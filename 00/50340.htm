<h2>            Com Port selection</h2>
                    every time something is plugged into a USB Port, the Leader laptop invents a new com-port number but I have a Data logging Multimeter that seems to be fixated on the number3 and will not work from any "other" port. when I try to change it's port designation,
 it says it is in use by another device? and refuses to work

            Thank you, I did contact Brymen, and they sent me a link to update my software, however, I still cannot link my meter to the Laptop, the meter is a Brymen TBM515 data-logging multimeter, and my Laptop is a Leader "Companion SC554" running "Windows 10"

    <title>Can&#39;t turn on location services - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> __maya__  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on location services</h2>
                    <p>I just recently upgraded to Windows 10, and had decided to use Cortana. While starting it up, it asked for my location, so I went settings, and under privacy &gt; location. Problem is, the option to turn on locations is greyed out, so I can't turn on location.
 CAn anyone help me fix this? Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Which region are you located?<br />
<br />
Please make sure your Country or Region, Language, and Speech Language settings are all aligned with one of Cortana’s supported locale configurations.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If these OS settings are not aligned, Cortana will not be available. For example, Cortana will not be available if your country is set to United States, but the Windows display language is set to English (United Kingdom).<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Why is Cortana not available for me on Windows 10?<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/why-is-cortana-not-available-for-me-on-windows-10/99a6fc79-1119-4ca3-bc19-71d12d264567"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/why-is-cortana-not-available-for-me-on-windows-10/99a6fc79-1119-4ca3-bc19-71d12d264567</span></a><br />

            <p>I don't believe that answered the question. The problem is with enabling location services, not Cortana. I upgraded a laptop and desktop from Win 7 in the same day and they act differently. While the location service is operational on the desktop, I've tried
 for hours to turn it on for the laptop to no avail. Because of this, I get no weather on the calendar on the laptop, but it works fine on the desktop although every setting I can find between the 2 PC's appear to be identical. Is there a FixIt available for
 this yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possibly related problem is that the desktop calendar notifications work fine, but will not function at all on the laptop although, again, every setting I can find between the two appear to be identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am signed into a local account on both PCs. Would signing into the Microsoft account on both sync up the settings?</p>

            I had to log into the admin account to turn on location services. Then other users are able to turn location services on and off.

            <p>The first answer is absolutely not helpful at all. This is a canned answer that was obviously cut and pasted from a script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also quite insulting because the answer is not addressing the question, undeniably demonstrating that the keyword the answer was generated with was Cortana and not location, which is the actual issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that location on/off switch is greyed out. The keyword used was for the answer given was Cortana. So I ask you this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this question scanned for keywords by an application which then returned an autoreply style canned answer, instead of being read and answered by an actual human being?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it certainly looks that way.</p>

            I'm sorry, Naomia. I was able to enable the service in SERVICES.MSC and that fixed my original problem. You might try a Windows 10 Reset to allow you to enable it. Okay, if you ask me how to do that, I'll have research it 'cause I've only done it once&nbsp;
 too many weeks ago. GOOD LUCK!<br />

            So it seems even though&nbsp;I&nbsp;get the message saying that the file cannot be found once I go back into settings I am able to change the location to on. I've had to do this twice now. Its not ideal but it works... I'm really beginning to regret buying a Surface.
 Its a fun idea that could potentially be really great as a work laptop/tablet. Everyday its something though and I end up spending half of the time I intended to spend working on a project digging through the forums trying to find solutions.

<p>Please excuse my lack of knowledge, but I don't know if I have a Microsoft account or a user account. I do not see a Start Menu. The only way I can get to the Start Menu is via the Microsoft key (next to Ctrl) on my keyboard. If I have a Microsoft account,
 can I switch to a user account?</p>

 the player back when the system updated a few weeks ago. It didn't happen. Going back to factory default-is that my only option? I'm not paying for something that I already possessed.

    <title>&#34;Reboot computer to repair volume problems such as bad sectors, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;Reboot computer to repair volume problems such as bad sectors, lost clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors.&#34; System Maintenance message that won&#39;t go away.</h2>
                    Everytime I boot up my computer, Action Center prompts me to perform System Maintenance. After doing so, the above message comes up. Restarting the computer does nothing [the message is still there]. I manually ran CHKDSK on C: [I thought Windows would
 run this automatically, and it did not], and it stated that the volume was clean.
<br />
<br />
The CHKDSK was set for "Automatically fix file system errors" and "Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors". It took just over two hours.
<br />
<br />
I just got my laptop back from the repair shop [it had a virus], so I'm a bit paranoid. Is this message anything serious or just an odd glitch?<br />
<br />
<p>I'm not PC Illiterate, more of a Beginner, really, but I don't always know how to find certain programs or information, so step-by-step instructions are very helpful.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone who replies to this.</p>

            <p><span>Hi BlackHolly,<br />
<br />
Did you see any sectors that got repaired?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to perform</span><span> chkdsk /r and provide us the event viewer logs.<br />
</span><span>a. Click Start, and then click Run.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In Open, type cmd, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<span>c. In the command prompt type chkdsk /r<br />
<br />
Note: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />

            I apologize for the delayed reply.<br />
<br />
I ran the System Maintenance again today, and this time it said there weren't any problems, so I guess the chkdsk worked, after all.
<br />
<br />
If you still want see the event viewer logs, I'm afraid you'll have to be more specific on where I can find them. I found the actual Event Viewer, but have no idea what log you want, nor where I can find it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help, in any case.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is windows update shield waiting to restart the computer to update critical system files. Once you have restarted the computer then the updates will be automatically installed on the computer before booting to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those updates are installed on the system then the Yellow exclamation mark will automatically disappear.</p>
<div>
<p>I would suggest you &nbsp;to restart the computer and check for updates again. Install all the available Windows Updates and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

 10 updates. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Howevever even changing settings for updates has made no difference. &nbsp;This is not related to any known updates not being installed. I have run defrag and disc clean up. I do not see this exclamation alert when I first boot my PC. It appears when the action

            <p>When u go to "windows update", I assume you have no updates pending. How about "hidden updates"?&nbsp; Anything lurking there?&nbsp; Probably not....</p>
<p>As far as my situation goes: I too am running Windows 7. &nbsp; I think the Shield first appeared around the time that I clicked on the Windows icon to "reserve" my copy of Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;I still did not have pending updates, yet the Shield remained. &nbsp;After a few
 days, I did download WIN10, but did not install it.&nbsp;I just left it in Windows Update "unchecked" so it would not install.&nbsp; Then I put the machine "to sleep" for the night and when I woke it up the next&nbsp;morning, the Shield (your friend) was gone.
</p>
<p>Then I decided I&nbsp; didn't want WIN10 cuz Dell said they could not guarantee compatibility.&nbsp; I moved the uninstalled WIN10 update to "hidden" status.&nbsp; Then did a system restore to just before I downloaded WIN10 which removed WIN10 from "hidden updates".&nbsp;&nbsp;
 And still no Shield.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Let me know if WIN10 enters into your scenario.&nbsp; curious. </p>

            I too did all of these things. I never wanted or reserved Windows 10 because of the same reasons u stated &nbsp;When they tried to install it anyway I uninstalled it and hid the update. &nbsp;However, the shield on the shut down did not appear until several weeks
 after this event. I have looked at all of the updates since to assure they were not sneaking in another Windows 10 event. I had several security updates in September but they were for Windows 7. I have left my computer in sleep mode for a day but I have had
 no luck in getting any change.&nbsp;

<p>Prior to our friend disappearing from my shutdown button, as a last resort, I was going to try a "clean boot".&nbsp; Thinking that maybe something was hung up and the clean boot might clear it?&nbsp;

            forgot to add: when u do the msconfig.exe and view the startup utility, under the "services" tab, there is a "windows update" entry.&nbsp; when one does the clean boot, that and other Microsoft services are temporarily disabled.&nbsp; Hence my thinking a clean boot
 may, MAY, solve the problem.&nbsp; or not....

<h2>            How to enable MACsec&#63;</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to enable MACSec on Windows Server 2012/2016 without a third party application? I know CISCO NAM can enable it. I'd like to avoid this as much as possible.

<p>You can see status of you contact if you open the contact they have</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not disturb</li><li>Active</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can set you status under profile images bell icon to the same status, and you can share files but only with in the skype own share system, becouse they dosent support OS own share menu also, and the color you can swap frome color to just run black and
 white inside of themes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
and no support for split screen, you you can be in video call / chat with some friends and at the same time visit webpages by split the apps in 2 parts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But is beta we can allways hopes they include some more functions in time.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That they dosent support split screen i dont like becouse am use split screen everyday in most of the apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Alexander for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed another issue with downloading files uploaded by the desktop version of Skype. The file are being downloaded to /sdcard/Download and can be opened from Skype, but somehow they do not appear in the Downloads built-in app. Again, this worked
 fine in previous versions.</p>

                    <p>My Mozilla Thunderbird Email program has stopped receiving emails (send OK), and to enable it to resume I need to find the Tools/Options button in Windows 8.1 so that I can delete the password for my account on Thunderbird. Need to open Tools/Options, click
 on Security page, click Passwords, click Saved Passwords, click Remove on that account, close that page then re-open Thunderbird and it will (??) prompt me to enter new password, which apparently needs to be the

    <title>Increase in TK&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> temhotabot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increase in TK&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Has anyone else noticed an increase in the team killing done in Hardcore?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I was in several matches where the enemy team had two guys, they were split screeners, who happened to have got host and were team killing their team mates through out the entire
 match. They proceeded to do this with every match after that until they apparently either got bored or had to go. I was partied up with friends so I didn't have to worry about getting them on my team but it wasn't fair to the other team because they spent
 most of their time dead, not from the opposing team but their own team mates. </span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Question is would you report people like that and how would you report them. I know MS doesn't have a stipulation for it in their Terms of Service or Code of Conduct but it does affect
 the outcome of a match. I might even be bold enough to say it would be considered cheating. I'd like to hear your opinions about it.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">This isn't about the team killers who kill three times and get kicked. This is about the team killer(s) who are the
<i>host</i> and continuously do it. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">On a seperate note, I was in a few matches the other day where we had a team killer on our team, I only had a party of five, who would kill us twice, then leave. We would keep playing
 and then get killed again by the same guy who apparently came back. He continued to do this for the next several matches. Always just killing twice then leaving then coming back, repeat and rinse. He didn't always get on our team and he even did it to the
 enemy team when he got in on their side. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I think the Game Developers need to put reflective damage on for Hardcore modes. If they can implement it in the first 30 seconds of every match they surely can implement it for the
 entire game mode. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">And for those of you who will surely say stop playing hardcore and play core. Why should I? I even did play Core mode for a few hours yesterday with some friends. We had too many
 in our party for TDM so we decided to play Ground War. There are just as many campers in Core as there is in Hardcore. And it is even worse in Core mode because we got stuck with one idiot on our team who liked to follow everyone around flash banging them
 and trapping them in corners. BOTH game modes have their share of idiots and problems, there is no doubt there.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I guess in the end, and sorry for the long rant, my main question is is this type of behavior reportable and if not should we tolerate it from our fellow players? I know everyone
 bought their own copy of the game and they can do whatever they want with it, but let's be honest here, it isn't much fun when you have a
<b>team mate</b> doing this stuff to his own team. And these actions most times <b>
do</b> affect the outcome of the match. Opinions?<br />

 be also due to the fact myself and friends mainly play HC Flags. We only play HC TDM when we don't have a full squad. IMO, I would report them under the Activision reporting function and then submit a player review for unsporting conduct(or something like
 that). </span><span>Hopefully, that will help you along with that issue.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The game has been out for a while now and surely some are getting bored with playing, but still cant shelf it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The best thing to do of course is to report them and move on to another lobby. Its also possible though that he was targetting somone in your party ....... so that wont always help. Switch game modes for a while if necessary &nbsp; ..... agreed ... you shouldnt
 have to .......... but shouldnt aint always gonna happen</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes it's more fun to think of your own ways to mess with them if you dont mind risking a report on you. Spectate the team memeber for a bit, maybe you can find just what his intent is, and use it against hin.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I was in a lobby with a girl on our team who kept throwing decoys at us. &nbsp;I hung around a couple matches just to see what was up. I finally realized the person had friends on the other team and apparently wasnt getting teamed with them. Once we both
 got on the same team, along with her friends, she started playing right, but I started following her around, blocking her in corners and such until she killed me enough times to get kicked. &nbsp;.......... Wasnt the right thing to do, and I dont even know if it
 mattered to her. But I got some satisfaction out of it. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>The bumper buttons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike jezz  say:</h3>
<h2>            The bumper buttons</h2>
                    
<p>I &nbsp;bought a Xbox One 15 days ago and I have enjoyed it alot, have played a **** of time on it, from Dead Rising 3 to Titanfall Garden Warfare and Forza.</p>

<p>And then it is strange I first notice this now. My left bumper doesnt say a loud click like my right. It feels like I have to push my left bumper more than my right.</p>
<p>I have a spare Xbox One controller, but it has the same problem - just with the right bumper.</p>

<p>Now, I have a hard time thinking both of these are defective, and I have also read about many others having this problem.</p>

<p>Does any of you have this issue?</p>

<p>Well, I don't know if I should return them to get new ones. I think it is kinda drastic to have two controllers with the same problem.</p>
<p>On the one I primarily plays with, I left bumper works fine. Has a high click sound, and is very sensitive. the other one, allmost doesnt say click, and I have to push it pretty hard or else it reacts like I just stops pushing the button.</p>
<p>But my second controller I bought seperately (from the same place) have the exact same problem just with the right bumper. The left bumper for that controller is perfectly fine.</p>
<p>The have the EXACT same problem, just with the different bumper.</p>

<p>I've had this dull left bumper issue before. I replaced the controller the first time it happened.</p>
<p>After that I had to replace my Xbox One and the Xbox One controller I got had this issue out of the box. So I took it back and asked for a replacement controller. The next controller, out of the box, had the same issue.</p>
<p>They eventually suggested to me to keep my old controller as they didn't want to open another new boxed controller.</p>
<p>They actually tried to tell me this is how the controllers are, that it was normal. Having a controller that did not have a dull left bumper I flat out refused to believe them and refused to leave the shop until they gave me a fully working controller.</p>
<p>Now my current controller has a dodgy left analogue stick. Taking into account I probably play a few hours a week these controllers are absolutely rubbish in regards to their quality and durability.</p>

<p>Thank you for your post Unreal Warfare.</p>
<p>That is also one of my fears - to get an even worse controller. </p>
<p>I am really amazed on how on earth MS can go from having the absolute best controller period (X360 controller) to make such a buggy product as the XO controller.</p>
<p>I actually quite like the XO controller. Its just that it sometimes "drop" my press on the RB on the one controller and the LB on the other.</p>

<p>The controller itself is great. I prefer it to the Xbox 360 controller after I had a bit of time to adjust to it. Just it's quality and durability isn't great.</p>

<p>I agree, the controller is great in my hands. Problem is I have to push the bumper pretty hard now before it reacts. Tbh it helps if you press in a certain way. But it should not be like that, my other says a loud click and it registers very sensitively.
 The other button that barely clicks has very low sensitive.</p>

<p>But I will probably keep both my controllers. This looks to be a common problem and not really rare. Hopefully they fix it in the next controller version.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Laserjet 4 Plus printing error</h2>
                    <p>I have a 64 bit laptop (Toshiba Satellite) and an old Laserjet 4 Plus printer with a cord that converts from an old printer connection to a usb connection at the computer end. &nbsp;This works fine on my Toshiba laptop with Windows 7 Pro/ 32 bit system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10/64 bit connection keeps giving me the "Printer in an error state". &nbsp;I unplug it from this system and connect it to the Windows 7/32 bit system and it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the cable recognized by the Windows 10 system and the driver software downloaded to my laptop, but I can't even get a test page to print during the setup process. &nbsp;The printer driver shows up in my devices as the default printer but nothing prints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Hi Ezra,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick response. I do not get any error messages when I try to download the ffxv comrades standalone. i just get a pay wall for this game. but in the description it says "if you already own the dlc of comrades the standalone version is for
 free" and in my case i have to pay again for it.</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to answer your question. It would seem quite a few players are experiencing an issue with downloading this DLC. After verifying on your account that you have the proper License to the content please try removing your profile
 from the Xbox One and redownloading it. Here is an excerpt from the final fantasy website "FINAL FANTASY XV MULTIPLAYER: COMRADES is available to players who purchased FINAL FANTASY XV and the FINAL FANTASY XV Season Pass, FINAL FANTASY XV MULTIPLAYER: COMRADES
 or the previously-released FINAL FANTASY XV MULTIPLAYER EXPANSION: COMRADES (DLC version) ". Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you've bought the royal edition, it didn't come with the season pass.&nbsp; It came with all the DLC.&nbsp; Slight distinction.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is an oversight, or intentional but people have been making MS and SQE aware.</p>

            Hi Bud.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to first try to troubleshoot it then for sleep issues first check the Display driver is latest on the PC's Support Downloads web page for your exact model, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag.
<br />
<br />Next go through this checklist for Sleep:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then I'd roll back, hide the Update and  report this to Microsoft using the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<h2>            How do I get my windows 10 out of undoing changes after soft reset</h2>
                    I reset my laptop because it was stuck at the start screen after failing/freezing during backing up and having to reboot several times. It failed and said it is undoing changes. The spinning circle has been going for about 15 hours. I hard booted it down
 again and it started all over. I want to somehow get to system restore. Any ideas?

<p>Wow just listen to the actual video guys, 20% gpu boost from dx12 efficiency over dx11 that is amazing and at least 50% cpu boost in real world code. That's like adding 3 extra CU which would overtake a 14/4 model.

<p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>For quite a while now I've heard various devs talk about DX12 etc, some said at the very least it will make things easier for them, freeing up development time in some areas allowing more time on other parts of development which can only lead to better things
 for us the gamers so again I'm happy with any kind of improvement however small!</p>

<p>20% boost was talking about the PC version of Fable Legends, not the Xbox One.
</p>
<p>"DirectX 12: DirectX 12 enables PC developers to have a new level of power and control and is a single API developers can access across Windows devices. As shown with Fable Legends running on Unreal Engine 4, there has been a 20% improvement in performance.
 And as announced today, Epic is creating Unreal Tournament using Unreal Engine 4 running on DirectX 12, which sets a new bar for visual fidelity in PC gaming. "</p>

            Hi,  The
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair 
<br />
<br />Safe Mode loads with a minimum set of drivers, software and service. Usually, when Windows doesn’t start normally, Safe Mode starts with no problem. It’s useful for you to troubleshoot the problem there. 
<br />
<br />This way works effectively when you can’t boot Windows 10 normally. 
<br />
<br />Ensure your PC is off. 
<br />
<br />Press the power button to turn on your PC, then hold the power button down until PC shuts down automatically (about 5 seconds) . Repeat this more than 2 times until you see the Preparing Automatic Repair (see below screenshot).
<br />
<br />Note: This step is aim to bring up Preparing Automatic Repair screen. When Windows doesn’t boot properly, this screen pops up and Windows attempts to fix the problem by itself. If you’ve seen this screen at the first time when you power up the computer, skip this step. 
<br />
<br />.- Then wait for Windows to diagnose your PC. 
<br />
<br />.- Click Advanced options, then the system will bring up the Windows RE (Recovery environment.) screen. 
<br />
<br />.- On the Windows RE (Recovery environment) screen, click Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />.- On the Troubleshoot screen, click Advanced options. 
<br />
<br />.- Click Startup Settings to continue. 
<br />
<br />.- Click Restart. The computer restarts and another screen opens showing a list of different startup options. 
<br />
<br />.- On your keyboard, press the 4 number key to enter Safe Mode without network. (If you need to do some online research after boot into the safe mode, press the 5 number key to enter Safe Mode with network access.) 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

<h2>            XBOX.com - Viewing Achievements on the website</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have been sent here by XBOX team support and an ambassador on the xbox forums with a problem that at present is not resolving itself and the people I have so far spoken to do not know how to rectify the problem.&nbsp; This apparently only seems to be occuring
 with my profile.&nbsp; Please see below for my original xbox forum post.&nbsp; The subject of this post is the same as the one on the xbox forum uk section.&nbsp; I hope this can be resolved swiftly.</p>


<p>I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing the same issue I am having with the xbox.com website, and if they have what they did to remedy it.&nbsp; (This has been going on for about 1yr now).</p>
<p>The issue I am having is when I sign into the xbox website then click on my gamertag in the top right corner, I am taken to my gamertag profile where I can click onto tabs across the top such as Home, Profile, Activity, Achievements, Friends, Messages.</p>
<p>When I click on the achievement tab the website says there is a glitch in the system and gives me an error code.&nbsp; Xbox support have no idea, why they have reviewed my error and witnessed it, but when they check on other gamertags, the glitch doesnt occur?!?&nbsp;
 It only occurs when they try it with my gamertag?&nbsp; Anyone else have this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I can view all achievements via smart glass, xbox 360 etc just not on the website.&nbsp; I have tried all internet web browsers whilst speaking with Xbox support and the issue seems to be with my profile somehow.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; It is really an annoyance than anything
 else.</p>
<p>On the profile tab I can see the last three achievements I unlocked however when I click on view all the same glitch occurs.&nbsp; It also happens when I click on compare achievements with anyother gamertag.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>GHENGlS</p>

<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>Any updates to report? </p>
<p>I have been sent an email requesting me to send feedback on the support forums. &nbsp;Whilst I have had a response on here and all people I have had responses from via chat, &nbsp;email and forum support, I have not had any response stating what may be the cause.
 &nbsp;Any ideas at all? </p>
<p>I assume that the feedback email is generic.</p>
<p>Any update response would be appreciated. </p>
<p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>GHENGLS. </p>

<p>Good morning. &nbsp;Please speak to a John Rey in customer support whom has experienced this issue that I am having. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet browser I am using has nothing to do with the problem I have. &nbsp;Please try and compare my achievements with your own on a desktop pc as I believe the issue is replicated.</p>
