<h2>            Programmatically distinguish between two embedded charts that have the same Chart Name in VBA</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm looking for a way to distinguish between two embedded charts on a work sheet that both have the same name.&nbsp; For example, if I plot a chart from Sheet1 so that it is embedded in Sheet1, the default Chart Name (via Chart Tools &gt; Layout tab &gt; Properties
 Group &gt; Chart Name:&nbsp; on the ribbon) defaults to Chart1.&nbsp; If I copy that chart, Excel names the new chart Chart2, all good so far.&nbsp; But a user can rename Chart2 to Chart1.&nbsp; Now I have two charts with the same name!</p>
<p>I've tried all sorts of code combinations with no luck.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p>Msgbox ActiveChart.CodeName&nbsp;&nbsp; 'FAILS!<br />
MsgBox ActiveChart.Index&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'FAILS!</p>
<p>What I want to do in VBA&nbsp;is store to a string variable the "id" of the active (currently selected) chart object.&nbsp; This needs to work whether the chart is in a worksheet or on a chart sheet.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

<p>If all you want to do is figure out if the activechart is the same one you got a reference to earlier:</p>
<p>If ActiveChart Is PrevActiveChart Then ...</p>
<p>where some time earlier you had</p>
<p>Set PrevActiveChart = ActiveChart</p>
<p>and PrevActiveChart is a global Chart-typed variable</p>
<p>Whether this would work of course depends on how long you need to keep that PrevActiveChart reference: it's not going to work between sessions for example.</p>

<h2>            Unable to select Microsoft office home and student 2016 product&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I installed&nbsp;Microsoft office home and student 2016, however when I've went to pull up Word I've been asked to choose my product. While I can select it, the option to continue is "greyed out" meaning I can't start using Microsoft office. This is
 despite not being installed on any other devices. I've posted a screenshot of what keeps happening below which will probably explain the situation better than I can in words. I feel like the solution to this is probably quite straight forward, but I can't
 imagine what I'm missing here. Appreciate any help in advance :) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I created some test documents with the office programs and it now appears to be working fine. The selection message I was getting with Microsoft Word is no longer appearing, and the test documents are saveable and appear retrievable. If this reoccurs I'll
 update this thread, but the problem seems resolved. Thank you for the help!&nbsp;

<h2>            E72 downgrade Firmware</h2>
                    
<p>I updated 3 weeks ago my E72's firmware, after i done this my phone became a "little" slow.</p>
<p>If I use my video camera the image gets to be stuck every 5 seconds, when I watch the video on my pc or even on the E72, the sound is good but the images are most of the time mixed up or stuck...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also: when i put up a connection like making a call or browsing on the internet, the time it takes to connect to the server is ALOT longer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the camera and the connection worked a bit better before the firmware update...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(BTW this is my first bad xp with Nokia, normally a business phone is close to bug free. This is close to no-wurth-selling...)</p>

<p>Someone else on this forum had a similar problem with the video. He said it was fine when recording to the phone memory but had the same problems you did when recording to the memory card. It was solved when he formatted the memory card. Remember to back
 up of course.</p>

            Friend , There is no option for downgrade officially so 1st check to format your memory card (not forget to make back up ) if problem still there then try to update with same firmware hope it works best regards

<p>I had the same problem on my E72, and I noticed that if I switched the destination memory to 'phone' it didn't stutter anymore. Then I tried another memory card, and the symptoms were gone too. The problem was visible only with the memory card that was shipped
 with the phone (4 GB SDHC). The other card I tried was (8 GB SDHC), so even SDHC is not to blame. Something was wrong with the bundled memory card, and I'm surprised to see others have had the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try video recording with some other memory card.</p>

<p>Finally solved this problem by using the hard reset code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*#7370#</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought this was the same as the factory reset.... but obviously not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to arise with my factory settings... as as soon as I restore my original settings the GPS stops working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia quoted $221 to fix this problem. I have no idea why. It was obviously a software issue so why were they quoting for a hardware repair?.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The girl at the Nokia counter was VERY vague. However in the end she did talk to the technician one more time (because I was very insistant) and then the technician reflashed the firmware. It started working after this but all the data was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought reflashing pretty much deletes and resets everything. .. but the GPS refused to work even after reflashing..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They probably did a hard reset at the same time... as that's eventually what worked... after I stuffed it up by restoring all the settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be possibel to restore contacts and SMS's without stuffing up the GPS. Restoring the settings stops it working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I worked all that out it was easy to fix.</p>

<p>Hello friend,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the E72 since last almost 3 years. I am also facing the same problem since I updated the firmware of my phone. This specific problem is with the firm ware version 81.003. The problem is with executable RAM. E72 claim to have 128 MB RAM but with
 the firmware update you can use only 20 to maximum 35 MB for your applications. All the remaining RAM is consumed by operating system itself. Recently what I did , I downloaded the NetQuin Mobile Guard &amp; try to find out the applications which were consuming
 the RAM. I found that almost 9 application were running in the system which were not &nbsp;reflecting in the open applications. I stop all of them (Not allow them to start with system&nbsp;boot) &amp; cleaned the RAM &amp; after that I found the system speed bit better. You
 can also do the same for you but please dont forget to delete the NetQuin from from your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this would help you.</p>

                    <p>Need help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my notes in Onenote this afternoon, this evening the Notebook is completely empty. I checked on the "OneDrive" recycle bin and also on the Documents and the Notebook is not deleted but is as well empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow all my sections and pages simply disappeared, I'm the only one with access to the account and I certainly did not deleted the sections nor the pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to recover the information?</p>

<p>Hi Rene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that <strong>OneNote</strong> may not be syncing correctly to its shared locations. We'd like to learn more about your concern so we can determine the best solution or direct you to the correct forum if needed. Can you provide the answer to
 the following questions?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you already tried manually syncing your files?</li><li>Have you already tried directly searching for your files using the OneNote's search box?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when opening your Notebooks?</li><li>How did you check your notebooks in OneDrive? Did you check it through the OneDrive desktop app or through OneDrive online?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you check the<strong> Service Health status</strong> of OneDrive
<strong><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> as this may be a server issue. It's possible that the servers may be undergoing maintenance. If that's the case, the issue is generally resolved automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to get back to us anytime and update us on how it goes.</p>

<p>Thank you for the response Amylove, please allow me to answer the questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you already tried manually syncing your files? --&gt; Yes.</li><li>Have you already tried directly searching for your files using the OneNote's search box? --&gt; Yeaph</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when opening your Notebooks? --&gt; No</li><li>How did you check your notebooks in OneDrive? --&gt; I only use the web version of onenote, I went into the notebooks, also check in in onedrive. Only one notebook is not sync'ing...</li><li>Did you check it through the OneDrive desktop app or through OneDrive online? -&gt; OneDrive online.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What is really weird is that I only lost the content of one Notebook, all others are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Service Health Status seems to be correct.</p>

<p>We appreciate your effort to provide us details about your issue, Rene. Since you mentioned that this is only happening on one notebook and no edit permission was shared to any users, we recommend you try checking this specific notebook using the
<strong>OneNote desktop app</strong>. This will help us further isolate the issue.</p>

<h2>            .OST</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 started an update.&nbsp; I had to leave town just as it started.&nbsp; We I came back the computer was shut down and would not boot, did all the command lines commands and Safe Boots I could find but nothing worked.&nbsp; Took to 2 different fix it shops and
 they both said the hard drive crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>I had to get new hard drive, load win10 &amp; office 2016.&nbsp; When I created a new outlook account it created a new .OST file but does not have all the data from my old one.&nbsp; I have a copy of my original .OST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I merge both .OST files so I can have all my folders and emails back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these are NOT .PST files, none of the 'copy .pst files' utilities will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<br />How can I merge both .OST files so I can have all my folders and emails back.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Unfortunately an ost file can only be opened by the original Outlook profile/email account used to create it. The only other option is getting a 3rd party OST2PST conversion program. Email folders for an Imap account get sync'd with the folder whenever the account is configured or when the .ost file is recreated whicch happens if Outlook can't find the file.
<br />
<br />For reason provided above, there's no point retaining a backup file of the ost file.  Also, contact/calendar folders would be marked as "This Computer Only" and info in these folders should be exported to a PST file to avoid risk of losing the data. The better option would be to maintain your contact/calendar data in a PST file set as the default data file for the profile. The default data file is where the default contact/calendar folders are located.

            Can I do third parties, or Microsoft? Anywhere near Worcester Area? I want to go to Natick Mall because Microsoft is more trustable.

            <p>So, i bought a lumia 640 yesterday and I had the same problem so i did some testing and i think i&nbsp;found the solution.</p>
<p>(sorry for my english) On my testing i found that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;if i disable the location services and the options that are found on the "manage" in the wi-fi setting
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- and when the phone is locked </p>
<p>
</p><p>- and if you moved (like from your kitchen to your garden) for some reason the phone restarts!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So i activated all this settings again and the problem is resolved....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Befor this i tried upgrading to Windows 10 on my phone and it did not solve the problem. So this seams to me to be the solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you check this settings on your phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: it is very strange that MS does not fix this thing! I did some search on the web and found that this is a recurrent problem on any Windows phone device! MS fix this please!!!!!</p>

    <title>CONSTRUCT TWO GRAPHS ON ONE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amirmunirxa  say:</h3>
<h2>            CONSTRUCT TWO GRAPHS ON ONE</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to plot three graphs one one but unable to draw two of them. One is easy and able to draw.
</p>
<p>First one is a straight line graph and</p>
<p>......... a vertical line starting at a fixed point (57.3 degrees) on x-axis(horizontal or base line) whereas as vertical axis "Y" is zero.</p>
<p>......... Second graph is also a straight line graph but some sort of diagonal line and variable. This graph starts from (0,0) and cuts the first graph, vertical line erected at 57.3 degrees. Also this graph follows the parabolic graph straight line pattern
 and cut the vertical line graph.</p>
<p>Kindly assist or guide me on this problem.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>First graph</p>
<p>X-axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 57.3degrees and Y-axis is 0,1,2,3,4,5</p>
<p>Second graph</p>
<p>X-axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0</p>
<p>Third graphs</p>
<p>X-axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90&nbsp; and Y-axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0, 0.03, 0.18, 0.52, 0.83, 1.30, 1.37, 0.73, -0.37, -1.50</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not very clear from your description exactly what you want, especially the second graph. Do I assume correctly that for the second you just want a horizontal line along the X axis at Y=0?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this graph look something like what you are trying to achieve?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c604d3f3-9a26-40b0-8978-1436bb55c03e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c604d3f3-9a26-40b0-8978-1436bb55c03e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If so arrange your data like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/138afd1d-9c32-4163-8bda-f38b871b95c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/138afd1d-9c32-4163-8bda-f38b871b95c1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then select A1:D17 and insert a Scatter chart with lines.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply and help. Very much indeed of pointing me on ambiguity. I am sending a link to show what I meant for the second graph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/w/s!ApB75VvFFQtogRd9VpG9c_b6GBFN</p>
<p>
</p><p>To elaborate further, the second graph actually goes along the third graph(parabolic) till the point where third graph starts climbing upward. One option available to us is use the values of zero and 5 degrees and draw second graph diagonally but what equation?
 and this is troublesome to me. Trust I am clear now. </p>
<p>Again thanks for the guidance and await reply.</p>

            <p>It looks from your diagram that the second graph is just a straight line, that would then have the equation</p>
<p>
</p><p>y=mx+b</p>
<p>
</p><p>where m is the gradient of the line and b is the y intercept where x=0 (which in this case looks to be 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At what value of y does it cross the line where x=57.3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gradient (m) can be derived from any two points on the line using (y-y1)/(x-x1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if for example it crossed at (x,y) of (57.3,1) then m=(1-0)/(57.3-0) = 0.01745</p>
<p>
</p><p>So y=0.01745x + 0 or just 0.01745x</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now its just a matter of putting the equation against X points in your data</p>

            <p>Dear Murray</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi. Thanks for the efforts. You are very much right and correct in saying that it is a straight diagonal line intersecting the vertical straight line erected at 57.3 degrees. To find out the intersection figure in digits is to plot on graph paper and then
 put this figure in the formulae to draw diagonal line. But I am looking to draw second graph without intersecting figure because it cross check the intersecting digit figure with graph figure. The only values I have or will have be these which I have mentioned
 in the mail message. Projection is the problem that what equation or factor I should take or use to draw this second graph which goes by touching the third graph values.
</p>
<p>Second graph actually goes with third graph till to the point from where third graph starts ascending and this can only be find out by drawing or over computer with some logic.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi again to all</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to Murray suggestion still no success on how to get the second graph. Infact We need to know the point where it cuts or intersect the first graph i.e., 57.3 line graph.

                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span>Starting with build 9860 the Technical Preview has a new option to choose how quickly future new builds reach you, it’s called the “Fast Ring”. By default everyone is in the “Slow Ring”.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>Recent changes to the later builds have also changed what steps you need to perform to change to the “Fast Ring”.</span></p>

<p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /></p><p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80853977-c74d-4fb0-9bdf-19b85e56cf1c" /></p>
<p>

</p><p><span>At the bottom of the ‘Advanced options’ window you will see the ‘Choose how preview builds are installed’ option, the default setting is ‘Slow’.
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bd90d38-0624-42b1-b482-dae8e84e3f81" /></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you click on the drop down arrow you’ll see two options: ‘Fast’ or ‘Slow’. By default, your PC will be in the ‘slow’ ring (as Microsoft names it).
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>If you want to install a new build as soon as it becomes available, you’ll want to be in the ‘Fast’ ring.</span></p>

<p><span>Click on the drop down arrow, move you cursor over ‘Fast’ and click to change the setting.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76dd7108-6103-4a3c-9bda-18217f7eb952" /></p>

<p>

</p><p><span>Click on the ‘Back Arrow’ in the upper left corner of the ‘Advanced options’ windows. Fast means that you’ll get it downloaded via Windows Update on the day it is released. Then click the ‘Check for

</p><p><span>If a new build is available, based on the type of build is that is being released, you will see an update named: fbl_awesome or fbl_impressive with the build number.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>When the Windows Update download completes you will be prompted to “Install” the new build. Click to start the install. This may take some time to install and complete and your PC will restart. So
 relax and keep yourself occupied until you are prompted near the end of the installation.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you see a “Failed to check for new preview build, please try again later. 0x8024402C error message, reboot your computer
 to clear the message.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Per Microsoft: “If you want to wait a bit and let others find any gotchas so that the community gets caught up with known issues and workarounds, then you’ll want to stay in the ‘slow’ ring.”</span></p>

<h2>            Office 365 ProPlus - Outlook 2013 not allowing access to Shared Mailbox Calendars</h2>
                    
<p>recently we migrated from a exchange 2010 to exchange online with a cutover migration. now we have 4 of 50 users that use office 2013 home &amp; business and office 365 proplus that can not create/edit/delete calendars events on other user calendars. we are
 sure that the user have the permissions to access the others mailbox calendars. if we access the shared calendars thru owa the user can edit/create/delete events.</p>
<p>we perform the following troubleshooting without success :</p>
<p>1. create other outlook profile</p>
<p>2. change outlook to online mode</p>
<p>3. remove the checkbox to download shared folders</p>
<p>4. create another windows 7 user profile&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. delete the entire office registry key folder from current user</p>
<p>6. run office 2013 repair</p>
<p>7. create a new mailbox account</p>
<p>but if i configure the mailbox on another computer (out of the domain) the shared calendars works as expected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>errors:</p>
<p>you don't have permission to create an entry in this folder.</p>
<p>cannot display the folder properties.</p>

<p>The software used are retail Home &amp; Business licenses. I get here because at the O365 forum said me that it was and Office 2013 issue and not O365. But I got a solution to the problem I am posting it because nobody at MSFT guide me to solve
 this issue.</p>
<p>Pre-requisites</p>
<ol>
<li>Office 2013 valid license key </li></ol>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the regedit and make a backup of the following keys HKLC\Software\Microsoft\Office and HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office. (This will be used if something gets wrong.)
</li><li>Go to "Add Remove Programs" and uninstall Office 2013. </li><li>Restart the computer. </li><li>Open the regedit and delete the following keys&nbsp;HKLC\Software\Microsoft\Office and HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office. (One of them will show an error after deleting the key. Just ignore it and press Ok.)
</li><li>Restart the computer. </li><li>Reinstall Office2013. (This will recreate the deleted registry keys)
</li><li>Configure the email Outlook. </li><li>Now the user can edit the shared calendars and contacts. </li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><span>According to your description, I did some search on Microsoft Enterprise Mobility+ Security, I find little information about if the EMS can be used for USB management, but I know the EMS can be used for tracking what happens after a file has been accessed
 and prevent coping , printing and other actions. For more details, you can refer to

    <title>Cannot access settings &#40;build 180706&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrgindi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access settings &#40;build 180706&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just installed the Insider Preview on my Education version of Windows 10. My OneDrive files didn't automatically populate my desktop like they used to before I installed the Preview. This was not an issue because I could just access setting and make the
 necessary changes, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "start" menu is not cooperating in any way. I've tried to open it using every shortcut imaginable and nothing works. Cortana also does nothing when clicked. The notification center/action menu reacts similarly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was forced to try to get to setting using alternative methods. As this is posted in the "Questions" portion of the forums, you can guess that my efforts were futile. I, again, tried every method imaginable to open up settings. Inevitably, when I tried
 to open settings through the command prompt, a warning message came up stating, "Windows cannot find 'ms-settings'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to reinstall Windows remotely, but I would like to exhaust all other efforts before I did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for all your help.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>NB&nbsp; On previous Windows 10 builds I have experienced an issue whereby the machine could not connect to a network, but restarting the device several times resolved it.&nbsp; This time it did not.&nbsp; (I did not have this issue with 8.1 - therefore do not believe
 it is the adapter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

    <title>Change the Default Settings of the Phonetic Guide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashmatash  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the Default Settings of the Phonetic Guide</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way to change the default settings for the Word Phonetic Guide?</p>
<p>The Phonetic Guide's settings require me to fiddle with them over and over each time I wish to add a phonetic key.</p>
<p>The default settings are horrible and difficult to read. I have to adjust character spacing, character font, offset and font size EVERY time I wish to add a phonetic key. Is there some way to fix this? I had the same issue back with Word 2003, but I just
 can't take it anymore.</p>
<p>There has to be a better way. Please help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wanted to first thank all of you for your feedback both here, and on our UserVoice site.&nbsp; We’ve heard you loud and clear, and as a result we are actively working on two changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>For people that want to use the pen as a precise pointer temporarily, we will introduce the ability to do that via a button on the Draw tab.&nbsp; This will keep the new default of having the pen ink on the document canvas, but give the ability to use the pen
 to do selection when needed.</li><li>For people that want or need to use the pen like a mouse by default, we will also add a new preference to the Options dialog that will allow you to restore the previous behavior.&nbsp; If you want to ink, that will be easier than before because you’ll be able
 to just tap a pen on the Draw tab and start inking, but you will be able to set your default behavior to be that the pen selects, just like it was before the update.</li></ol>
<p>We are actively working on making these changes so that we can get them out to you as soon as possible.&nbsp; Note that you may see #2 (the preference in the Options dialog) appear first, because we are prioritizing getting that change to you based on your feedback.</p>

            <p>Hi Redgy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. We are looking forward to improve it and provide the best possible customer experience in the latest coming builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to use the Windows Feedback app to send your thoughts directly to the team building Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805</span></a>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the
</p>
<p>preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can't port in a number into Skype. Hence, you ask is not possible.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            When you click Archive on the menu bar for the first time, Outlook.com will ask you to specify a folder name or to select the default folder name "Archive".&nbsp; From that point on, Outlook.com will move messages to that folder (either Archive or the one you
 created) each time you click the Archive button.&nbsp; In no way does that button perform a true archive.&nbsp; All it does is move messages from Inbox to some other folder.

<ul>
<li>However I don't want them to identify all projects as "important" (5) so I want to restrict their use of each level of importance to 6 uses per criteria.
</li><li>In the column for criteria 1 - only 6 projects can be identified as "most important" - i need for excel (2013) to restrict the use of the level "5" to 6 uses; same holds true for each subsequent level 4-1.</li><li>In the Column for criteria 2 - the same holds true;</li></ul>
