<h2>            Optimize drive schedule is set but never runs</h2>
                    I have optimization set for "weekly" for my SSD yet it never runs and even says under the current status: Needs optimization (31 days since last run). When I manually optimize it runs fine.

            <p>Thank you for the reply. However, after running chkdsk (there we're no errors) the optimization still does not run. I set it to daily to see if that would make a difference but it didn't:</p>

    <title>SMS with verification code does not arrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vkbm  say:</h3>
<h2>            SMS with verification code does not arrive</h2>
                    After I logged to surface rt using my email and password it asks to "verify" my account to "help protect it"<br />
I click "Verify" on Surface's computer "Your account" settings. <br />
I am presented with one choice of sending a text to my phone number ending in 80.<br />
It asks four last digits of my phone number, which I enter correctly<br />
Then I wait for SMS message to my phone that never arrives. I have no problem receiving SMS messages and had verified my account using that method in the past. It doesn't work for me anymore.<br />
There are no error messages, SMS just doesn't arrive and I'm left at "we'll send you a code" screen where I need to enter a code that doesn't arrive.<br />
I'm not presented with an option to send an email to alternate email address, I don't have one IIRC.<br />

<p>I tried to send the code like ten times, it didn't work.</p>
<p>I also tried making my user local admin, tried deleting other user I had on my surface, that didn't help too.</p>
<p>What fixed this is surface refresh. During first start I got same "verify" dialog, but that one was able to send an SMS now.</p>
<p>I fixed my problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>How to Submit a Book Manuscript to a Publisher.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Format Your Manuscript Properly:</span></b></p>
<p><span>1- Type your manuscript according to common manuscript-formatting guidelines. A final manuscript should be neatly typewritten
 in black ink on plain white paper, double spaced, paragraphs left justified, with a standard five-space indent at the beginning of each paragraph and printed in an easy-to-read font. Each page of the manuscript should be identified with a brief header--part
 of your book title, a slash mark and then your last name--and be numbered. Use 1-inch margins on all sides.</span></p>
<p><span>2- Include a title page with your manuscript. This should be a page all its own with the title of your manuscript typed
 and centered about one third of the way down on the page. Double space and type your name (as the author) or the pen name you wish to use, also centered. At the bottom right-hand corner of the title page, type your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail
 address and any other contact information--single spaced and right justified.</span></p>
<p><span>3- Include page breaks in your manuscript so that each chapter starts on a new page. Type the chapter title or chapter number
 about one third of the way down on the page, either left justified or centered. Then double space and begin typing the chapter text.</span></p>
<p><span>4- Proofread your manuscript thoroughly. Then consider having an impartial third party you trust proofread your manuscript
 for you. Make any corrections necessary. You want your manuscript to be the very best it can be before you send it to an editor for consideration.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Prepare Your Cover Letter</span></b></p>
<p><span>5- Find out the name of the current editor or editors at the publishing house to whom you want to submit your manuscript.
 Consult the current edition of the "Writer's Market" or other source book for this information, look online or call the publishing house. Verify the current address of the publishing house as well. Editors at publishing houses change frequently and you want
 to be sure you have the right information.</span></p>
<p><span>6- Type a professional cover letter to accompany your manuscript. Just like your manuscript, your cover letter should be
 neatly typewritten and contain your contact information. It should be addressed to the proper editor--and be sure you spell the name right--at the publisher's current address. The cover letter can be left justified, single spaced with double spaces between
 paragraphs and should usually be only one or two pages long.</span></p>
<p><span>7- Entice the editor to read your manuscript. In the first paragraph of your cover letter, use a hook or lead to capture
 the editor's interest and make him want to read your work. Use this paragraph as a sales pitch and focus it on the strengths of you as an author (perhaps you've already published several books or you are a well-known expert in this area), any endorsements
 you've already received (perhaps from someone famous) or the story itself--whichever will be the most compelling to an editor.</span></p>
<p><span>8- Include a one- or two-paragraph synopsis of your story. Hit on the highlights of the story, the protagonist and antagonist,
 the major conflicts and resolutions in the story and tell how it ends. Don't withhold anything from the editor, but don't go into too much detail here. Keep it short and sweet, but make the editor want to read the actual story.</span></p>
<p><span>9-Tell the editor why you are qualified to write the book. Sell yourself in this paragraph. If you don't have a lot of previous
 writing experience, briefly write about how much you love to read other books in this particular genre. Name a favorite author or two and reference something about one or two of their titles that may be similar to how your story is written, the setting for
 your story or any other factor that seems relevant and interesting. Keep it interesting, but brief.</span></p>
<p><span>10-Wrap up your letter with a few formal details. Tell the editor you are enclosing your manuscript, give a word count for
 the manuscript and ask the editor to kindly review and consider your manuscript and then respond to you via the self-addressed stamped envelope you are enclosing. Drop down a few lines and type your name. Then sign the letter in ink above your typewritten
 name.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Present a Professional Package</span></b></p>
<p><span>11- Keep your manuscript together. Put a rubber band around the pages of your manuscript or use a large clamp-type paper
 clip to keep the manuscript pages from scattering everywhere if it gets dropped. Do not bind your manuscript in any way. This is considered unprofessional.</span></p>
<p><span>12- Prepare your envelopes. Address a large envelope to the publisher. Be sure you have the correct address and the envelope
 is large enough to hold your manuscript without tearing. Get another standard business-size envelope, address it to yourself and put first class postage on the envelope so the editor can quickly and easily respond to you after reading your manuscript. This
 one will be your self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE).</span></p>
<p><span>13-Assemble your package. Place the SASE on top of the manuscript and place the signed cover letter on top of that. Slide
 the stack into the large envelope and seal it well. Take the package to the post office to have it weighed and affix the proper postage to the envelope. Then mail it out.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>See if this helps as an alternative.</p>
<p>Whatever Email Program&nbsp;you have&nbsp;&gt; Open it &gt; create new message &gt; once you have that you should see either a "paperclip" symbol or the word "attach" in the header &gt; click attachment &gt; go to where your Manuscript is saved &gt; click&nbsp;on it&nbsp;&gt; Attach or Ok &gt; it

<p>[/quote]The Play Store offers the official, full version of My Xbox Live for Android. It works very well on my Galaxy Nexus (4.04). It does seem as though it is not intended for Android tablets however. In my case I get the very same message post-install on my Motorola Xoom (4.04).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get the same problem and please note that this is an App designed and released specifically to the Android marketplace by Microsoft. I already have a windowsphone and use this a lot, just expect something designed by microsoft to work on everything its

                    <p><span>The situation we have is that our HP Windows CE 6 and HP Linux Thin Clients are unable to logon to our RDS Server when a user’s password has expired, they're provide with an error
 from the thin clients saying "Your password or username is incorrect". But if you connect from a XP, Win 7 or Server 2003/08/08R2 to the RDS Server, you are prompted to change your password. When we had a&nbsp;Terminal&nbsp;Server 2003 host setup, users were able to
 connect to the Terminal Server via any clients with expired passwords, upon doing so they would be prompted to change the password as it has expired.</span></p>
<p><span><u>Setup Background:</u></span></p>
<p><span>We use Server 2008 R2&nbsp;Remote&nbsp;Desktop Server with no Remote Desktop Gateway, we have have 3 Server 2008 R2 DC's in use, and 3&nbsp;different&nbsp;versions of HP thin clients on the local
 LAN: Windows 7 Embedded (Domain Joined), Windows CE 6 and a HP Linux&nbsp;Variation&nbsp;.</span></p>

            <p>
Found a fix:</p>
<div>
<p>
Basically I've set the the RDP's on the Thin Clients to auto-logon; but I've only filled in the domain name.</p>
<div>
<p>
This allows the users to access the Windows Server logon screen, which then allows the user to type the accounts in, so if the password is set to expire or change at first logon they can change it with no issues.</p>

<h2>            My Surface Pro 3 Won&#39;t Turn on - Microsoft Support is exactly no help</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a surface pro 3 for college about 2.5 years ago. Earlier this year (around march I believe) the computer stopped working, it wouldn't on. I used my warranty to receive a new laptop and about five days ago, it has stopped working, it won't turn
 on... again. It came on for about an hour three days ago, but now won't turn on at all. I attempted to go to the surface store, but they couldn't do anything. They attempted to do the hard reboot to no avail. They recommended calling Microsoft Support. I have
 now called twice, they ask me to preform the same hard reboot and then tell me there is nothing more that I can do unless I want to spend another $550 to get a new surface.&nbsp; I am a broke college student who can't afford this. My question is, what do I do?
 I have spent nearly $1500 on this laptop with all the accessories as well and now am on my second one of this machine, which didn't even last a year. Has this happened to anyone else? Is there anything else I can do?</p>

<p>Well if you do not have warranty on the device you would have to pay for a replacement of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried both holding the power/volume up button for 15-25 seconds?<br />
<br />
When you have it plugged in, is the LED on the charger on?</p>

    <title>Display and Icons going invisible on windows 10 after system startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Display and Icons going invisible on windows 10 after system startup</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Possible video card failure</p>
<p>Back when Windows 8.1&nbsp; upgrade was available I avoided it for awhile, then one morning I woke to find that my computer installed it for me. Ever since then I've had to restart my computer every 20 - 24 hours. Here's the issue, first the background will go
 black and the icons will be visible. Then after 30 minutes or so the icons will slowly disappear one by one with them blinking once in awhile. This takes about an hour. The shortcuts on the bottom of the screen will still be usable along with the icons until
 they disappear. Then the shortcuts begin to disappear one by one and the icons are gone. The start button is still working to click restart, but if not caught in time the file explorer window opens and underneath is a total black screen. Then I have to hard
 crash the computer and after it reboots it's fine for another round. Any ideas on what this could be? The computer is a Dell XPS 8500.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the issue might be with the incompatible drivers or some application causing this issue.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's perform a clean boot in Windows and&nbsp;check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the
 below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong><span>Windows Key ,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>
<span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click <strong>
<span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If a service is causing issue, I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time, reboot and then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one
 by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer the&nbsp;below article on&nbsp;"<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform Clean Boot</a>". As the&nbsp;article is designed for Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7. Unlike launching
 step for&nbsp;'System Configuration', options and steps to Clean Boot are same for Windows 10.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c). Right click on the Graphics card driver and select “<strong><span>Update Driver Software</span></strong>”. When it prompts to choose
 an option <strong><span>How do you want to search driver,
</span></strong>then go with <strong><span>Search automatically for updated driver software.
</span></strong>If you have a driver available on your PC, then select <strong><span>Browse my computer for driver software,
</span></strong>then select the appropriate location, where the driver located on your PC for updating it. (<strong><span>Ensure that PC is connected to Internet while performing this step</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d). Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed. If it doesn't fix the issue, then Right click on the same driver and select “<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>”
 then restart the system and let the system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue. (<strong><span>Recommended step</span></strong>)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you referring to the Microsoft Stylus?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15df8af7-8a4b-4b3c-9f35-eb408d6ccdaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15df8af7-8a4b-4b3c-9f35-eb408d6ccdaf" height="278" width="395" /></a></p>
<p>If yes, it depends on the thickness of the casing of the stylus. If it's thick enough, you can engrave them, if it's thin, you might have to get it Laser Etched instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly recommend that you also visit the nearest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> for best advice and for further checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Freezes after I leave It Idle for around 15 Minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 with Core i7, 16 GB of RAM, and 256GB of SSD. I usually use it on AC power. Yesterday, I used it on battery power, and it kept freezing whenever I left it idle or unattended for around 15 minutes or more. When it froze, I could only
 press the power and volume buttons to reboot it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the problem did not occur, when I was streaming a Youtube video, or on a Skype call (when machine was on battery power.) The problem did not occur too, when the machine was plug-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that this freezing problem is caused by Microsoft updates published in July, because I did not run into that problem last month, when I used the machine on battery power. (I have not installed any software over the past month; Microsoft updates
 are the only things installed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone run into this problem too? Could anyone help me to sort out this problem? I list my update history below. Hope that provides you some information for helping out. (I have installed all currently available updates.) Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c5009bf-3223-4be1-9b80-f5048b1995e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c5009bf-3223-4be1-9b80-f5048b1995e2" /></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(After I posted this question, my Surface Pro 4 froze again, when the screen automatically rotated... )<br />

<h2>            Screen Flicker, screen goes to black at start up or re boot</h2>
                    I have an issue with the screen flickering at start up. (Toshiba satellite laptop) I boot the computer and once windows begins to load I&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;encounter a flicker ( somewhat like a light bulb thats getting ready to go out) the screen flickers then
 goes to black..so I have to shut down and keep attempting to re-boot. After 25+ times it it finally loads properly. This can take 20-30 minutes each time it happens..which is usually every morning when I get up and turn the computer on! I have searched the
 web and see many other people encounter the same issue, but have yet to find a solution.
<div>There has only been one time this happened when I was not at start up..consistently, it has been at start up..once my log in screen comes up, i enter my password and the programs load-I have no flicker. Can someone please tell me what the problem is and
 how to fix it? I have limited computer know how.. so step by step instructions would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<p>hi ernest,</p>
<p>does “<em>i still did not see skype for business app in the app launcher?”</em> mean that you can’t see it when clicking the upper left corner of office 365 admin portal as below?<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44634495-e412-4876-b14d-24a581ab711c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44634495-e412-4876-b14d-24a581ab711c" /></a></p>
<p>if so, it’s an expected behavior that skype for business doesn’t show in office 365 portal app launcher. different from onedrive for business or sharepoint online, it’s a client software that members in an organization use to communicate via instant messaging
 (im), online meetings, audio and video calling at work or on the go. you can install it via the&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f50cbd-15b1-487a-97c0-e21b6980380f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f50cbd-15b1-487a-97c0-e21b6980380f" /></a>&nbsp;
 in portal&gt;<strong>office 365 settings</strong>&gt; <strong>software</strong>&gt;<strong> office</strong> and click install to<strong> install</strong> skype for business.
<strong>turning on skype for business only allows users to download and install it from portal, after which you can see skype for business on your computer. but that won’t make it appear in the app launcher.</strong></p>
<p>if not, to better understand your situation, please send us a screenshot of the page where you can’t find skype for business and we will provide further assistance.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>As I understand the issue, you are unable to install AuthenTec driver update for Touchchip Fingerprint co-processor and receive error code 80070102. Please let me know if this is not correct.<span>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>You've reached the right forum for your question. We are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
</p>
<div><b>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.<br />
</b>1. How are you installing the update? Is it through windows update?<br />
2. Do you face any issue with other windows update?<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to try installing the update through windows update and check if you face any issue.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may try to download latest <span>software</span>\ firmware for finger print from the manufacturer website and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Choose the appropriate model number of the laptop from the manufacturer website and continue.<br />

            Option 1: You can create a system image of the current drive and restore it to the new one. 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/how-to-backup-your-windows-8-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/h...</a>
<br />
<br />Then restore the image to the new drive - instructions reference Windows 10, but its the same for Windows 8.1:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-restore-a-windows-10-system-image-to-an/e20992ca-5641-4f7c-bb09-3895d0732162">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: You can download Windows 8.1 install media, create a bootable copy then perform a clean install:
<br />
<br />Download Windows 8.1 Disc Image (ISO File) - Microsoft
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />create bootable copy:

<br />
<br />You can then attach the other drive then format it through Disk Management.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Disk Management
<br />Right click the old drive
<br />
<br />Click Format.

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

<p>No games will work on my Xbox One. Was working fine until I updated it now nothing will work, not even YouTube! Chatted to Xbox but they couldn't solve the problem and advised me to ask a question on here. Already done a hard reset and that didn't fix it!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how can I set the &#34;Job Type&#34; to only &#34;Hold Print&#34; on a network printer for all users&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a user requesting that the network printer on his floor be set to only have "Hold Print" in the Job Type for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They then walk to the printer and use their ID to print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently this is just an option so all users aren't using the printer is this way.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The request is to make this mandatory. I have gone into the printer server and on the printer, gone into the Advanced tab, printing defaults and attempted to set this here, but it not sure if it will set this correctly for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>

<h2>            Youtube funkar inte</h2>
                    
<p>Youtube är lite oumbärlig nu när man är van vid den på xbox live, den har funkat felfritt, men senaste veckan har den av nån underlig anledning stängt av sig själv när man bläddrar mellan filmklipp,</p>
<p>och nu är Youtube ur funktion helt, &nbsp;applikationen startar upp som vanligt, men när dom olika valen av klipp kommer upp då kommer ett error medelande,</p>
<p>ERROR 4004.</p>
<p>The application encoutered an error and will now exit.</p>

<p>Är det nåt tillfälligt fel eller vad har hänt ?</p>
<p>Har rensat cache minnet, har deletat Youtube och laddat hem det igen, men det funkar inte ändå.</p>
<p>Får tilläga att alla andra appar funkar, Muzu, Facebook medmera.</p>

<p>MATS is still not available for Windows 10 so that cannot help. Which is frustrating for me since I have two Intel drivers which won't uninstall or upgrade. SFC and dism cleanup-image both report no errors, so previously the MATS would be the next step.
