<h2>            Windows Vista Active Sync Holding Com Port</h2>
                    Hi- I have Windows Vista service Pack 1 and I'm running Active Sync 6.1.6965 to sync my Cassiopedia E-125, which works fine using it's USB cable.&nbsp; It's usb cable makes a virtual com port of com 3.&nbsp; I have changed the settings of this device to only use
 com 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I plug in a port replicator that has a serial port (com 5)&nbsp;that I need to use for talking to another device via a terminal session, Active sync grabs com 5 and doesn't release it.&nbsp; How do I get activesync to skip looking at this com port
 when it's connected?&nbsp; Ther terminal program gives me an error of "This Port Is In Use By Another Program".&nbsp; Do I need to change a registry key or add a line to an ini file to get&nbsp;Activesync to ignore this port?&nbsp; I didn't see any settings in the Sync Center
 or Windows Mobile Device Center to limit what ports it watches...

            I don't know of a way to do that Elario.&nbsp; I was under the impression that it is all hard coded and cannot be changed. If you try and use any other port number you will just get an error.
<br />
<br />
The only experience I have had for changing the COM port is via bluetooth syncing.&nbsp; Although it is not what you are looking for, I thought I would reference it here for others that might need it.<br />
That process of seting up was like this:<br />
(<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.pocketpc.activesync/browse_frm/thread/4bb59756736e7ea5/1fe23d6624dfd920?lnk=gst&amp;q=bluetooth+outgoing+discover+&quot;paul+t.&quot;&amp;rnum=2&amp;hl=en#1fe23d6624dfd920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">via Juggs Ravalia</a> [MSFT])<br />
<br />
Step 1 Set up a Bluetooth COM port <br />
1. Open the Bluetooth Devices Control Panel. <br />
2. On the Options tab, select Turn discovery on and Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer.
<br />
3. On the COM Ports tab, click Add. <br />
4. Select Incoming (device initiates the connection) and click OK. <br />
5. Note the number of the COM port that was added. The COM port number must be no higher than 20.
<br />
6. Click OK to close the Bluetooth Devices Control Panel. <br />
<br />
Step 2 Set up ActiveSync to use the Bluetooth COM port <br />
1. In ActiveSync on the PC, on the File menu, click Connection Settings. <br />
2. Select Allow connections to one of the following. <br />
3. Choose the COM Port with the number you noted in Step 1 Set up a Bluetooth COM port.
<br />
4. Click OK. <br />
<br />
Step 3 Start Bluetooth sync from your device 1. In ActiveSync on the device, tap Menu, then tap Connect via Bluetooth.

<h2>            N73 and non-nokia memory cards</h2>
                    I've been on here lately reading about ppl having exactly the same prob as me with N73 rejecting a sandisk 2gb mini sd card...I emailed nokia in regards to the problem and the answer they gave me was to the effect that non-nokia genuine card may not be
 compatible with my phone...so why is it that the exact same card works perfectly in my wifes 6288? Anyway just wandering if anyone had found a way around this problem or perhaps a brand that is compatible? I have a mate using a 1gb transcend mini sd with no
 problems but I'd really rather have the 2. Anyway anyones help would be greatly appriciated.

            That's very strange...<br />
what is your firmware? by *#0000#<br />
hope that your firmware (old one) does not support 2GB capacity card...<br />
<br />
1) try to update the latest firmware<br />
2) use your phone to format the 2GB card<br />
<br />
Hope it help

            I'm running firmware 4.0726.2.0.1<br />
<br />
I have tried formatting the card on the phone doesn't help<br />
<br />
Looking at the sandisk card next to the 64mb nokia card and the terminals on the nokia card look slightly longer I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it.<br />
<br />
Any further assistance would be greatly appriciated.

            My firmware is 4.0735.3.0.2 and using 1GB Sandisk miniSD (non Nokia Genuine)<br />
<br />
- I think the phone can handle up 2GB, according many websites<br />
- I believe it can handle up to 4GB miniSD (but not SDHC)<br />
<br />
mistajay, how do you know that the phone reject the 2GB that you put in?

I'm running a non-branded 2gig SD card in mine, and for the most part it runs fine (apart from various kernel errors ...)<br />
<br />
4gig cards are not supported - the firmware only supports up to the FAT16 limit, ie. 2 gig.<br />
<br />
4gig SD cards are a little strange - for the most part the only ones that work are those designed for digital cameras, and the cameras obviously have some workaround for the formatting.

            i've had 2 different 2gb cards and they've worked fine in mine<br />
<br />
currently have a sandisk ultra II never had any problems,<br />
<br />
where did you buy the card from?<br />
if you have a card reader on your pc, can you transfer 2gb of data onto it, remove the card from the reader then place it back in and see if it's still holding 2gb of date.

            Sorry guys I shuould have given more info in my original post...I have tried 3 different sandisk 2gb mini sd cards all purchased from the retailer where I work all are genuine and all work fine in my wifes 6288 and in my pc card reader. The problem I have
 is when the phone actually recognises the card if I write a text or sometimes when the phone is not even being used I get the message; "Closing applications" then "Unsafe to remove memory card..." and then the phone doesn't recognise the card even though the
 card is in there...not to mention mostly when I put the card in the phone doesn't even register it. I have tried formatting the cards on the phone and on the pc, I have formatted the phone and updated firmware (although I believe there is a more recent firmware
 update which I will download and see if it makes any difference). The last option i guess is just to pay up for a genuine nokia card but if I can avoid that it's much better.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone for your suggestions so far any other ideas would be greatly appriciated.<br />

            Does anyone know anything about a wi-fi card that i've seen out there, it's a mini sd memory card with wi-fi built in, does anyone have one or know if it will work and give wi-fi capabilities to the N73??<br />
<br />
Just found similar topic so have posted on that, sorry guys for dual question.<br />

<p>mukhtiar, your problem looks like incorrect settings in the Data Cable section. Go to Menu -&gt; Tools -&gt; Data Cable.</p>
<p>Among the five options given, choose "Always ask on connection".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, connect the USB Data Cable to your phone</p>
<p>Then plug the other end to the PC</p>
<p>Your phone will provide options to choose from "PC Suite", "Mass storage", "Pict Bridge" and "Media player"</p>
<p>Choose PC Suite if your PC runs Windoze and you have Nokia PC Suite installed.</p>
<p>Choose Mass storage or Media Player or Pict Bridge if you don't have PC Suite installed and you run Windoze</p>
<p>Choose Mass storage or Pict Bridge if your're not running Windoze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mass storage mode is the best option if you're using PC Suite 6.x, and in non-Windoze PCs.</p>
<p>PC Suite mode is best suited for the latest PC Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you select Mass storage mode, your phone will go to Offline mode. You will not be able to use your phone as long as your phone is connected to the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In PC Suite mode, you can use your phone normally.</p>

<p>Installing the Windows 10 Technical Preview for Enterprise does not add Windows Identity Foundation. I have that installed and it is not available.</p>

            <p>Found a workaround in this post:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/error-when-installing-windows-identity-foundation/6e4c65a5-ea24-431c-b4f0-b8740e97cf46</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few assumptions: 1) that you can get the file out of the GAC on your local machine (map a network drive to \\&lt;your machine name&gt;\c$\windows\assembly). That will give you an explorer view with the actual files, and 2) that you know how to install
 a file to the GAC using gacutil (included with Visual Studio)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do it: copy a 3.5 version of Microsoft.IdentityModel.dll from a machine with it installed to your Windows 10 Tech Preview machine and use gacutil (if you have it installed, comes with Visual Studio) and run:</p>
<p>
</p><p>gacutil /i c:\&lt;path to Microsoft.IdentityModel.dll&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked for me and my connection to MS CRM. Didn't even need any other dependent DLLs. Definitely a workaround, but it got me past my issue.</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue, running AX 2012 R2 CU7 and cannot install the client because WIF is not available as an installable feature for Windows 10 ETP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fairness, there is no way you'd receive any support from Microsoft for running Dynamics on evaluation software!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I guess there must be some rationale behind the decision, or perhaps an architectural problem supporting WIF in the next generation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say we're just going to have to wait 12 months until the Dynamics AX product cycle upgrades and it moves off its current dependencies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until then, Windows 7/8/8.1 will have to remain the default OS for AX client users.</p>

            What 2 versions do you want to install at the same time.

Prior to 2016 you install oldest first.
After you have them both installed if you want the older one to be default, do an Office repair.
you have to do a registry hack to add the NoReReg key to all of the application entries for both versions.

https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Install-and-use-different-versions-of-Office-on-the-same-PC-6ebb44ce-18a3-43f9-a187-b78c513788bf# 

You can do the hack through the registry editor, or by using the following reg commands. 

NOREREG SCRIPT
Here are examples of the registry scripts that will insert the “NoReReg” key to the 2 sample applications. Select the script for the versions of Office you have. (add the other applicable office applications)

Office 2013
reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word\Options /v NoReReg /t REG_DWORD /d 1
reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Excel\Options /v NoReReg /t REG_DWORD /d 1
Office 2010
reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Op

<h2>            bullets disappearing and jumbled text, images, etc appearing when &#39;show paragraph - formatting&#39; selected.</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 365 Business (Word 2016) -</p>
<p>
</p><p>April / May 2018 - time frame ( and apparently after a recent automatic Windows 10 update - grrrr)</p>
<p>I began noticing that text was disappearing for bullets in documents that I would go into.&nbsp; &nbsp;I could select the area and a grey area would appear and seemingly the text was still there.&nbsp; If I clicked none the text would reappear but that was not a good solution
 as needed bullet list.&nbsp; I had 'show formatting on' and just by chance turned it off and noticed that bullet text reappeared.&nbsp; Clicked it again and text disappeared.. other text, lines, images, would appear in the area in a jumbled fashion.&nbsp; &nbsp;IT looked at the
 issue and experimented with chaning document font from Calibri to Times New Roman and that seemed to fix the disappearing bullet text - text was visible with 'show paragraph' on and off.&nbsp; This again was not a viable solution as numerous documents (100's are
 formatted with the Calibri font - much easier on the eyes when reading great amounts of text.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already ran Microsoft Office Updates and everything was up to date.&nbsp; I then found a forum post to go to Settings&gt; Programs&gt;&nbsp; select your program and then Change (my version is 'Modify' ) and select Repair.&nbsp; I used the Quick Repair and it ran for several
 minutes.&nbsp; I reopened&nbsp; the most recent word document where bullet issues were present and visible and tried the 'show paragraph' tool on and off and all is good again with the document!!!&nbsp; I hope that other older documents that I had opened will now appear
 correctly as bullets are used quite frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to put out there for others who might be experiencing a similar issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

            It would appear that the text has been formatted as Hidden, either with direct formatting or by an unintended style modification.

<p>@Suzanne, &nbsp; I did nothing other than run the "Repair' option and the document 'show paragraph' began working displaying bullet text correctly.&nbsp; Documents and bullet lists were not having this problem prior to the Windows 10 update. &nbsp; I opened up documents
 from 2017 and was having same issue.&nbsp; I have never used the 'hidden' option under font before and the text did not have that characteristic.&nbsp; I did forget to mention that I tried opening same document on 3 computers</p>
<p>Windows 7&nbsp; Word 2016 - document viewed correctly when 'show paragraph' was on and off</p>
<p>Windows 10 Word 2010 - document viewed correctly ' same as above'</p>
<p>Windows 10 Word 2016 - document viewed incorrectly - same issue that I had on my pc with the 'show paragraph' making bullet text disappear and strange text, images, etc showing up partially... I included print screen images of the incorrect and correct display.&nbsp;
 As you can see the bullet text is able to be highlighted by the grey area when it was operating incorrectly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is fixed at this point in time.. and the "Repair' is what worked.</p>

<h2>            Scatter chart in PowerPoint</h2>
                    I am trying to create a scatter chart to show values on an X-axis of "satisfaction" and a Y axis of "importance." I have a couple of struggles:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. I can get a label for the "satisfaction" axis to appear but not for the "importance" axis. How do I get both to show automatically, rather than simply inserting a text box for the missing axis label?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. How do I add descriptive labels to each data point? In what column or row in the data sheet does this information have to be placed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. How do I change the size of the data points? Changing numbers in the "Size" column of the data sheet doesn't do anything.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel cant detect the figure and currency symbol when data is cut and paste into excel.</h2>
                    When only happen when i cut and paste my bank statement from my bank website to excel. There is a long list of credit/debit figures and my currency sign is "RM" . My excel will show RM5000.00 instead of $5000.00, But my excel don't show up the sum on the
 lower right when i highlight 2 column or more. I think its because it detect as a word instead of amount. On some computer it will show up the sum and some computer it doesnt. I hae tried many computers and both 2007 and 2010 have this problem. On some computer
 when i paste the list of figures to excel it have a function to ask me to convert those data to numbers, but on my excel it doesnt ask me to convert to numbers. Anyone can help me with this?

Macros are very easy to install and use:</p>
<p>1. ALT-F11&nbsp; brings up the VBE window<br />
2. ALT-I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALT-M opens a fresh module<br />
3. paste the stuff in and close the VBE window</p>
<p>If you save the workbook, the macro will be saved with it.</p>
<p>To remove the macro:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bring up the VBE window as above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. clear the code out<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. close the VBE window</p>
<p>To use the macro from Excel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. ALT-F8<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Select the macro<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Touch RUN</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 memory</h2>
                    I'm just wondering, is there a way to save all of my data straight on my memory card instead of it being saved on my phone? And is there a way to save more than 20 sent text messages? ( it only saves 20 text messages in my sent inbox and i have no idea
 where then rest goes but in my inbox it self, it saves however many text messages received). Any suggestions?

<p>Hi Daniel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in a query. I would like to be able to view this query in the datasheet view with email hyperlinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also intend on making a Make Table Query based on this query with email hyperlinks in this field.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, Name is a reserved word in Access and shouldn't be used for object names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I wouldn't use a hyperlink nor a query. I would have a form bound to the query with a &nbsp;control bound to the e-mail field. In the double click even of that control I would use the SendObject method to open an e-mail form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, using a make table will create redundant data, so why bother?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, a tablename like Lumber Contacts, would suggest you have other tables for different kinds of contacts. And that wouldn't be good design. Instead you should have ONE contacts tale with a field to indicate the type of contact.</p>

<p>Okay thanks.&nbsp; Will change the field Name to&nbsp;another name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My final goal is a to have a table or query&nbsp;with the field Email as an email hyperlink.&nbsp; The reason is that&nbsp;I&nbsp;want look at my whole roster of contacts at once, and while looking at them, have the ability to click on a person's email address and have an email&nbsp;window
 open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also be routinely exporting this table/query to Excel, and I would like for the field to export to Excel also in the email hyperlink format.&nbsp; I believe that if I can get a table or query in Access with the email field in email hyperlink format, it
 will also export to Excel in that format.</p>

<p>Okay thanks.</p>
<p>I attempted to do the Send Object in the On Dbl Click event as you recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not find a "Send Object" in the Macros.&nbsp; In the went to the help menu to find the Send Object.&nbsp; The help menu says that Send Object was renamed EMailDatabaseObject in Access 2010 and later, and I have the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When tried the EMailDatabaseObject macro, all that it seemed to allow me to do was to email an object out of the database.&nbsp; It would not allow me to click on the email address and have that email address pop up in the To line of the email.</p>

<p>I specified the SendObject METHOD. Methods are part of the DoCmd VBA commands. Actions are in macros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes that is the equivalent for macros. There is a parameter for Edit Message. If you set that to Yes, it will open an the e-mail message for you to edit.</p>

<p>I see where I can also do a datasheet view on the form.&nbsp; I had been worrying that I would have to go through one record at a time if I did a form, but with datasheet view on form I think that I will come out with what I want.</p>

 site and it downloads and extracts almost to the very end before informing me that setup could not be installed since I had the Click to Run already downloaded. &nbsp;I have spent ALL night...6.5 hours going through every single file, folder, or document in search
 of the elusive program pieces that seem to haunt my hard drive just enough to keep the proper one from installing. &nbsp;I have finally gotten the two folders empty, and now can't delete the two folders!!!! &nbsp;So I have these two empty folders labeled with the string
 of numbers and letters recognized by the program I am desperately trying to install, and I can't even rename the files to trick the good program!!! &nbsp;I've tried 3 different Utilities developed to delete empty folders, broken registry entries, etc, but none
 have yet to be able to delete these two folders!!! &nbsp;I almost believe it to be a VIRUS!!! &nbsp; Microsoft needs to come up with a solution fast!!! These folders are stuck on my hard drive and no telling what damage they could end up doing,</p>

<p>Finally found my own solution reading through these Q &amp; A's! &nbsp;The sad part is that I went to the same site and downloaded this tool hours ago when it told me that it was not made for my OS or my software application. I just deleted it and continued in my

<p>Hello FernandoAlmeidaBR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reproduce your concern and I was able to add histogram parameters. It may seems that the issue is with the account. Since you're using an student or educational account and you stated that you can't install offline Office applications, it would
 be best that you contact the admin who provided the account. It may be caused by the account restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file you're trying to edit is shared to you, the one who created the file may have locked the charts and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.&nbsp;</p>

            If you haven't done it already, sync your phone to your windows live account, then your contacts will be on windows live where you can export the data to a csv file which can be imported into whatever application you plan to use in the future.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Hotmail/mobile?SignedIn=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Android and iPhones also sync to windows live </a>so once your contacts are in windows live you can just sync this data to one of these other phones without even bothering with exporting and importing.<br />
<br />
If you don't want the install the app that is referenced in the link I provided, you can set it up on most phones, using these settings:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Server / URL: m.hotmail.com</li><li>Username: Enter full email address, for example: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</li><li>Domain: Leave this blank</li><li>SSL: Enable this</li><li>Certificate: Accept the SSL certificate when prompted</li></ul>
<br />
Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and Tasks can be enabled <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you won't be able to copy your contacts to your SIM card.<br />

            Once your contacts are synced over to windows live, you can export them to a csv file which will be downloaded to your computer.&nbsp; Then you can import the csv file into any application or service (like google contacts) that is compatible with csv files.<br />
<br />
You can view your synced contacts on your windows live account by going to <br />
<br />
<a href="http://home.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.live.com/</a><br />
<br />
Sign in with the same windows live username and password that you use on the phone, then select Hotmail &gt; Contacts (this link is found in the lower left hand panel on the screen).<br />
<br />
When you connect your phone to your computer via USB cable and open up the Zune software, the pictures on your phone will be automatically synced to your computer.<br />
<br />
You can review <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/music/sync-files-with-my-phone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article, entitled "Sync Music, Videos and Podcasts"</a> to learn how to sync photos from your camera roll to your PC.<br />
<br />
Open up the Zune software, select Settings &gt; Software &gt; Collection &gt; look under the heading entitled "Zune folders &gt; Pictures" to find out the path and folder where your synced pictures are stored.

<h2>            How to Clear Music list left by Cortana Music Search</h2>
                    <p>When I tested new feature in Cortana Search-Music icon in top right hand corner, I got a list of songs that Cortana could hear through my laptop mic. When I tested this feature today in Starbuck's coffee shop it correctly identified song playing on store
 speaker but not song playing on laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was under impression that this new Cortana music feature could identify music played on my pc in build 14267 with apps like Groove Music, itunes or VLC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>Now I have a list of songs previously identified by Cortana that I cannot clear or remove. I have tried clear all Edge and Bing searches but this song list remains.</p>

 problem in windows feedback. I hope in next insider build that it gets erased. Thanks for your help.

            <p>Cortana is a web app updated independently of Windows, so waiting for new Windows builds to fix this will disappoint you. Also, 'Music' is curiously not classified as a type of interest, unlike News, Travel, Sports, etc. The Bing page where you decide "what
 Cortana knows about you" doesn't let you manage Music. The Microsoft support engineers should know this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana is indeed able to identify music played from your PC through apps and programs like VLC and podcast players. The sound drivers on Windows 10 however, can sometimes interfere with this, and you temporarily lose this functionality. The Skype desktop
 client is confirmed to mess with this, try removing that if you have it installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana Music recognition is somewhat better on Windows Phone and Windows 10 Mobile.</p>

<h2>            Outlook &#39;16 Keeps Prompting Me for Gmail IMAP password - HELP&#33;  &#40;Gmail says Outlook is a less secure app&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Gmail as my primary email address.&nbsp; Like many, I've got it coming through our home pc via Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Never had a problem until a week ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Situation:&nbsp; Outlook continually prompts me for my Gmail server user name and password.&nbsp; It never accepts the info I've double checked a zillion times to make sure is correct.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; Gmail did sent an email that said I had an unrecognized log in attempt
 with an app that was considered "less secure". </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done to try and fix: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Gone to numerous techy websites (this forum being one of them) to find possible solutions</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-&nbsp; Make sure Gmail password is correct</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-&nbsp; Go to Gmail settings and make sure the "IMAP" feature is turned on; and the POP3 feature is off</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-&nbsp; Go to Gmail settings and make sure IMAP settings are correct</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-&nbsp; Go to Gmail settings and TURNED ON the feature that allows connection to LESS SECURE apps (this still did not work)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-&nbsp; Tried deleting all my outlook cashed passwords.&nbsp; Created a new one for Gmail.&nbsp; Made sure Outlook had same one.&nbsp; Still did not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Beyond frustrated as this does not seem like a hard thing to fix.&nbsp; Somehow, Outlook and Gmail's servers are not communicating properly with each other.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>The App Password only applies when you have 2-Step Verification enabled; You no longer need to enable "less secure apps" then.</p>

</p><p>I know you've probably done this already, but have you already triple checked the port and SSL/TLS settings for the server configuration? Did you fill out your full email address as the username?</p>

</p><p>When you perform a test, do both send and receive fails or just one of them? Do you get an error as well or only a password prompt?</p>

                    <p>It seems that the developers of Skype have taken many steps backwards with the new Skype.</p>
<p>One issue in particular concerns the ability to listen to voice mails from within the app. This is no longer the case. Instead the program forces open a web browser, where you must sign-in before being allowed to listen to your message. If you have 5 or

<p>
</p><p>This is a huge flaw which should be addressed as voice mails are an integral part of the application.</p>

<h2>            N97 mini facebook status update problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for some days I've had issues with the facebook app on my N97 mini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can do everything with the app like uploading pics or commenting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when it comes to updating my status it just won't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I try to update my status it isn't shown on facebook. I can see the status I typed in for a few seconds on my profile. Then, I swith to the home screen and it's gone. Also, it is not displayed when I log in to facebook on my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My gf has had the same problems when updating her status via her Nokia C6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have re-installed the app, without any improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that a bug or am I doing something wrong? It has worked before!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jago</p>

    <title>N900 reboot problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herrfledermaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            N900 reboot problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought an N900 yesterday and during install, the thing went down although it was plugged in. I let it down and tried to load the battery all night long. This morning, I rebooted but it kept freezing on the 5 well known dots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched how to flash the N900 and succeeded in it. Problem is that, as soon as it's booted, it reboots right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can it be that the battery is dead? After loading a whole night long, the battery should be fully charged, no?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also: if the battery is broken, it doesn't give current through to the machine, is that possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remark: sometimes the device says "internal application error: camera application closed". But that only happens once in a while and I guess it is due to all the previous reboots it did...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone&nbsp; please advice?</p>

<p>remove any memory card and sim card.</p>
<p>check that the back cover is fitted correctly and that the camera shutter is closed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to boot with N900 not connected to charger and see how far it gets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it still&nbsp;fails then try reflashing again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>well I followed every single step and, got to R&amp;D-mode this is where it ends:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 8: ...<br />
"If the spanner logo is present and the device still does not boot, stop.. this process may not help you"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"internal application error: application camera closed" and the device reboots... This keeps on getting repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to flash it using the flasher and following image:</p>
<p>Maemo 5 <strong>Global</strong> release for Nokia N900</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But even after a successful flash of the device, the problem persists... :-(</p>

<p>Well, I tried all procedures to flash the thing, even with the global and UK image, but nothing seems to change...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It boots after the initial setup without a simcard or anything else, and when booted, it says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"internal application error: application camera closed". Sometimes "camera" is replaced by "contact", ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sick and tired of it, it's going back to the shop...</p>

            But that is not possible ! When the device is booted into maemo, it's on for 2 seconds and reboots again. So pc suite and nsu or not an option, unless NSU would be able to find the device when it's booted pressing the "u-key". But NSU isn't able to do
 that...

<p>rushing through posts here.. but..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the USB icon appears only momentarily, or not at all when pressing the u button, try removing the battery, replace battery, press and hold U and then try these two :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) plug into PC</p>
<p>or&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) press power button</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that still does not work.. the chances are the battery is too low.. Even if you think it is charged, it may not be charged enough..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you device is stuck at the 2 dots, you're boned!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It won't charge unless it boots.. The easiest (sometimes) answer is to swap batteries with someone with an N900, X6, 5800 or 5230&nbsp; handset since they all use the same battery..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it is charged, you should be able to encourage the device to boot again.. (or at least enter flashing mode)</p>

<p>1. the USB-connection is no problem. I can flash the device using a windows pc and the flasher utility (doesn't help, problem persists)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. charging the battery: I charged all night. I tried to charge it using another loader, I even already bought another battery which they tested in the shop. (doesn't help, problem persists)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. the device boots into maemo. I see the desktop. Then it says "internal application error: application camera closed" and it reboots right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can try, is to keep loading the newly tested battery until the light goes green. If that doesn't fix the problem, it's back to the shop.</p>

<p>For you it might be interesting, for me it's rather annoying because I can't play with my new toy and have to stick to the N95 :-(</p>
<p>No, I did not flash the eMMC image, I only flashed the OS twice. As soon as the battery lamp is green again, I will:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I bought the device in Belgium, so I guess it's this file for the OS: Maemo 5
<strong>Global</strong> release for Nokia N900)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. flash the EMMC</p>
<p>2. the OS (with the file named "Maemo 5 <strong>Global</strong> release for Nokia N90")</p>
<p>3. get back to you ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your effort and patience, I hope we get this thing working ;-)</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, no success: battery was green, did a flash of the eMMC and directly after that I did flash the OS: same problem persists... :-(<br />
And yes I followed every step one at the time: all seems to go well, both for eMMC and OS. But then it needs to boot Maemo and then it goes wrong...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once date, time, region and such are filled in, he starts building the desktop and then reboots over and over again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must be a faulty device I guess? I'll leave it plugged in for the rest of the night, and tomorrow I'm sure the battery is charged and I will try again...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the store that is I'm afraid. Why me !?

    <title>Create Rule with Exception to forward meeting responses to ONLY one of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rubiqa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create Rule with Exception to forward meeting responses to ONLY one of the participants</h2>
                    <p>I work on scheduling and I have to set up weekly appointment with different clients with our 4 therapist (we have one email set up for appointments). As an organizer I am the only person that gets the replies of the clients (accepting, declining etc.). I
 set up a rule to forward the responses by subject "Therapy Schedule" and I added an exception so that not all the therapists receive this forwarding response. But is not working. All four therapist receive all the replies.
</p>
<p>This is what I have tried:</p>
<p>I set up a rule for each therapist : Apply this rule after the message arrives with "Therapy Schedule" in the subject forward it to Jane Doe except if it is an automatic reply and except if the body contains specific words (here I enter the names of the
 other three therapists so any emails for the other therapist are not forward to Jane Doe as the body of the email contains the name of the therapist accordingly), but all four therapist received the forwarding email because of the rule, so the exception is
 not working. What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I need:</p>
<p>- Set up a rule by subject "Therapy Schedule" </p>
<p>- Create an exception so that only the particular Therapist in the original invite receives the forwarding response.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rubi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inbox rules automatically perform specific actions on email that arrives in your inbox. Can you confirm that image below is the same as where you create your Inbox rules?</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2fbd3136bf-aa49-4958-8b73-2f237f720e54.jpg" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the <strong>Stop processing more rules</strong> option is turned on. With this option on, when a message arrives in your inbox that meets the criteria for more than one rule, only the first rule will be applied. Without selecting this check box,
 all inbox rules that a message meets the criteria for are applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f5b469e7c-1e52-4dea-8a21-b3111ffe6264.jpg" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>With that, we strongly suggest unchecking the <strong>Stop processing more rules</strong> option to turn it off and try the rules that you have created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else. </p>
