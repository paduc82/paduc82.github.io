            <p>that is what i did....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the same as you..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to solve this kind of mess..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>first, you need to download from acer site the latest bios driver they have for your laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(use another laptop)</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>but you must install only one... but dont worry, it will prompt you if the file you are trying to install is not the one needed.. i used the 1.22 version... (it depends on the bios version, the starting number of the version must be the same., mine is from
 1.xxx to 1.22, i was prompted that installing the other one is not right, it said that it is incompatible)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then, after you downloaded it, extract it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>make sure you have the it on a flash drive (usb)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>second,&nbsp;since you have the disc... use it..&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/139810-sfc-scannow-run-command-prompt-boot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/139810-sfc-sc</a></p>
<p>this shows how to go to command prompt using disc repair (this may be win7 it is practically the same, only gui is different)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;go to repair your computer option where you will find many options..<br />
<br />
choose the option open a command prompt..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as your in the X: drive which is the container of the disc., go to the current folder of the file..<br />
<br />
X: &gt; F: (if F is the drive letter of the usb, then F, if not, then use the drive letter corresponding to the usb)<br />
go to... the bios folder<br />
F: &gt; cd BIOS_Acer_1.22_A_A/BIOS_Acer_1.22_Windows/Windows<br />
<br />
then run the Update.bat<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>(it requires that your battery must be greater than 30%..)<br />
<br />
if then, just execute the Update.bat<br />
<br />
F:/<span>BIOS_Acer_1.22_A_A/</span><span>BIOS_Acer_1.22_Windows/Windows &gt; Update.bat</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>just wait and voila... it is fixed&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>mine is aspire v5 471g</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>just tried the legacy boot.... and f2 was (as expected... doesnt work)<br />
<br />
i just did what i stated here and it was working again, bios was returned to default settings, and i just sit here having a smiling face...<br />
<br />
<br />
and also., a very big reminder...<br />
<br />
what ever happens, never turn off your computer while updating bios..just to be sure anything silly happens</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>if this doesnt work..&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;try again the 2.17 sir...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>unzip the exe there...<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>after that...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>locate the update.bat then run it...</p>
<p><span><br />

<h2>            Retrieving old records for legal purposes</h2>
                    <p>I urgently need to retrieve contact records from 2 years ago for migration purposes. I've searched for them by contact but it only saved recent records. The customer service options for Skype are terrible for sending me in circles so if someone can provide
 any answers or an emergency email or number I can contact it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest version of Skype as of this writing, and operating on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>
<span>The reason for this behavior is because of&nbsp;the current Windows Live Photo Gallery implementation (trade-off between accuracy and coverage - the internal recognition and grouping algorithms are designed
 to focus on accuracy as a first priority and coverage second). The implication of this design decision is that WLPG only predicts on a fraction of faces.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Early on in the tagging process, there are a large number of untagged photos that are easy to group together – these are the group that are presented early, and which users will quickly complete
 tagging. When the easy ones are done WLPG makes not only a lower rate of predictions, but this rate of predictions is on an even smaller number of untagged faces and with time the system stops finding more matches.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Reason:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Face recognition in its current version is designed to provide accurate people tagging suggestions to users.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Microsoft is working on improved recognition capabilities in the next version of Windows Live Photo Gallery.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Workaround:</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>
<span>Finish all suggestions until the batch people tagging dialog is empty</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span>Click on
<b>Tag them</b> or select the<b> All detected people</b> link in the People section in the ribbon</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span>Once that is completed the batch people tagging windows will show all detected faces from your pictures</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span>Select and mark faces that you want to tag</span></div>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Another method of increasing the number of recognized faces/people suggestions (by decreasing accuracy) is to modify a registry key
 as shown below: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>
<span>The value is under the key:
</span><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows Live\Photo Gallery\Library</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span>Add a DWORD value of name FaceRecognitionThreshold</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>
<span>There are 4 values that you can set this as: 0-3, with 1 being the default. 0 is more stringent, 2 is moderate, and 3 is loose.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>

            Hi Brent.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Brent, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p><a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/norton-public-betas-now-available-nasdaq-symc-1804448.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Symantec's press release</a> states that the Norton 360, Norton Internet Security and Norton AntiVirus software products have new free beta versions
 that can be downloaded <a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">from the Norton beta site</a>. People who download and use these beta versions are asked to give their feedback
<a href="http://community.norton.com/norton/?category.id=public_beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">on these products on company's message boards</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Symantec says that these new versions have a number of improvements compared to earlier Norton products, including "lower memory usage and improved file copy speeds" along with better antivirus protection engines and increased stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while these Norton betas releases have been made to be compatible with Windows 8.1, they are still considered to be pre-release products, much like the public preview of Windows 8.1 itself. As such, users who download these betas should
 expect bugs to pop up. The betas are also not officially supported by Symantec and are released "as is."</p>

            <div>so you are using an N only extender with an 802.11AC router. This certainly can</div>
<div>cause issues. That said, someone posted a similar issue a while back. I</div>
<div>understand that in theory, it should work, but we've seen issues with this kind</div>
<div>of setup and the Marvell wifi/drivers in the Surface tablets. We've seen issues</div>
<div>with older N dual band stand alone routers. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should test by unplugging the 2500 and then do some testing against the 6300</div>
<div>only from the same room (for comparison, as a test). Please report results.</div>

<p>There was a new version of firmware so update, but did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the SP4 to the local networking company and they logged it into their wireless and had the same problem of speed.&nbsp; Not sure I understand what they did, but basically they "flushed" all dns and reset all wireless connections. They were then able to
 get the speed of their wireless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brought SP4 home, same problem no speed. They had me reset the router, same problem.&nbsp; I am setting an appointment for them to come out to my house and look at my connections.</p>

<br />The app can be blocked in Windows Firewall
<br />&gt;Locate Control Panel in the Search bar
<br />&gt;View by large icons and tap on Windows Firewall
<br />&gt;Click on Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall
<br />&gt;Tap on Change settings
<br />&gt;Make sure that the boxes on the left of the app for Private and Public are checked. Check them please, if not.
<br />&gt;If you cannot locate the app in the list, press ‘Allow another app’.

<h3> rogueslider19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t shutdown and restart properly</h2>
                    Recently my laptop doesn't always shutdown properly.&nbsp; The screen will go black but the power light and wifi light will stay on, the fan still runs, for between 15-30 minutes before shutting down.&nbsp; I have to force shutdown sometimes to get it to turn off.&nbsp;
 Once I restart it everything is slow to start.&nbsp; Opening applications, folders, etc.&nbsp; take several minutes to open.&nbsp; Some applications, like my anti-virus application don't even auto start, I have to start it manually.&nbsp; When I hit shut down again and it turns
 off normally and restart everything works fine.&nbsp; Sometimes I am forced to force shutdown and restart multiple times before it starts up correctly.&nbsp; I have tried troubleshooting the power options and it has done nothing.&nbsp; I have done a full system restore and
 for a while everything worked fine but now it is doing it again.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; My laptop is an HP Pavilion g series.

<p>Hello linkmntn,</p>
<p>According to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center, HP SimpleSave is compatible with Windows 7 both 32-bit and64-bit.<br />
<br />
If you go into Device Manager, does the external hard drive show up? Do you have the most current drivers for the SimpleSave?<br />
Click <a href="http://www.techtalkz.com/windows-7/515982-how-use-device-manager-windows-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> for a good tutorial and screenshots for using Device manager. Do you have any yellow Bangs (!) next to your external hard drive?<br />
<br />
You should also check with HP.com for support since they support their own hardware.<br />
<br />
Please reply back with an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>There is a lot of information missing from your question such as Operating System and is the account missing or disabled or you don't know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easy answer is to create a new account and copy the data from the old profile to the new profile but don't copy over the appdata folder. If you don't see it then don't worry.</p>

<h2>            How do you make HP PSC 1210xi  Printer Scanner Copier run efficiently &#40;i.e. scan directly into .pdf files&#41; on Windows 7 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Currently the "In-Box Driver", generic Scan and&nbsp;Copier Program in Windows 7&nbsp; is not useful, slow and creates excessively large scan files&nbsp;in&nbsp; the formats available: jpeg, png and Tiff.&nbsp; The option to then need to run a conversion program to change the .jpg
 or other formats to a .pdf file format seems cumbersome, slow and avoids the option to make this a simple process.&nbsp; HP will probably NEVER create a useful official fix to create a Windows 7 compatible program for this printer, based on&nbsp; my&nbsp; previous calls
 to HP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HP PSC 1210xi&nbsp; Printer Scanner Copier&nbsp; previously was able to run HP Director and HP Photo &amp; Imaging to directly create smaller sized .pdf files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only work around that I was just told was to upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to "Windows Anytime Upgrade: Windows 7 Home Premium to Professional" for over $95 per Computer to get the capability to run in "Windows XP Mode" and then download the previous
 XP Compatible Programs from Hp.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There should be a more usful and less expensive process to get our dependable desktop prnter scanner Fax to work efficiently.&nbsp; Any Suggestions for a Non-Computer Nerd ?</p>

            <p>HP in common with <strong>all</strong> printer makers only provides software/drivers for a model for a finite period, that supports the version of win that was available when that printer was first released.</p>
<p>You can use one of the free pdf printers eg <a href="http://www.cutepdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.cutepdf.com/</a></p>
<p>Another option is <a href="http://www.hamrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hamrick.com/</a></p>
<p>And you will probably find it cheaper to obtain a win7 compatible device rather than use any of the workarounds</p>

            <p>You cannot "create" a disk you have to seek&nbsp;out, buy one and then install it to your PC. Make sure you buy the correct type and capacity. Make sure that your PC can accomodate it physically and technically. You might also need&nbsp;to buy a&nbsp;(compatible) data
 cable and power supply connector/converter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, if by "disk" you really mean partition, you must have unpartitioned space available on the current disk, in which case you can use disk manager. If there is no unpartitioned space (or too little to create a viable partition) then you must shrink and/or
 move&nbsp;partitions on your current disk using 3rd party partitioning software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start disk management...</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Click Run</li><li>Type diskmgmt.msc and hit Enter</li></ul>
<p>There are many partition manipulation packages available, some are free some are not. Google partition management software. Do research and choose carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning! Manipulating partitions without fully understanding the potential consequences can lead to an unbootable system and possibly an unrecoverable system too. Make sure you are fully backed up first and have the means to effect recovery from external
 media if necessary.</p>
