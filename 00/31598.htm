<h2>            Network drivers missing</h2>
                    <p>My son is at college and brought is new Dell Laptop home . There was no Network &nbsp;icon to connect to the internet. I ran troubleshooting &nbsp;and it there was an issue with the network adapter.</p>
<p>I tried to make a repair and the error came &nbsp;up saying &nbsp;the problem has not been fixed . So we did a system restore back to a Windows update installed on January 3 rd. . After the system restore the icon was back and we had network access. &nbsp;The same day
 he gets back to school turns the laptop on and the network icon is again gone . He tries to do the system restore twice and both times &nbsp;there is still no icon . Anyone else have this issue ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span><span>Hello Timothy,</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Appreciate the steps that you have taken so far to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be assured that we will do our best to help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to check if the Network option is turned on under settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Settings</strong><span> &gt; <strong>Systems</strong> &gt; <strong>
Notifications and actions</strong> &gt; <strong>Select which icon appear on the task bar</strong> &gt; toggle on
<strong>Network</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause&nbsp;this problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to update the </span><strong>Network adapters </strong>and check if it helps<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the list of results.</span></li><li><span>In Device Manager, select <strong>Network adapters </strong>&gt; the network adapter name.</span></li><li><span>Right-click (or press and hold) the network adapter, and then select <strong>
Update Driver Software</strong> &gt; <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. Follow the steps, then select
<strong>Close</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After installing the updated driver, select the Start </span><span>button &gt;
<strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong> if asked to restart, and see if that fixes the connection issue.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver on a
<strong>different PC</strong> and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</span></span></p>

            Hi Pajam.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />On the Sign in screen see if you can mouse or toggle to the Ease Of Access icon in bottom right corner, click on it or press Enter, click or arrow down to choose On Screen keyboard.  Does that work.
<br />
<br />If not here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start.  These steps will get your into Repair mode which uses different keyboard and mouse drivers so they usually will work:  
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />

            If the on-screen keyboard I suggested does not work then you need to roll back the update following the steps I gave.  
<br />
<br />Do you have a friend who is more tech savvy you can ask to help you?  If not you can take it to a shop but the minimum charge is around $150.
<br />
<br />If you need me to guide you then read the illustrated tutorials for each step and ask back if you have any questions.  You'll need to at least try.   I will not let you fail if you try.

<p>Inside the box where you try to type in your password does it say PIN in light grey letters? If this is the case click on sign-in options under the box. There will be two boxes that show up. One looks like a keypad and the other looks like... well I can't
 really describe it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the one that doesn't look like a keypad. Hopefully, it will say password in light grey in the box above. If it does you should now be able to type in your password.</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 download fails every time i try to download it &#40;off the microsoft store on windows 10 on PC&#41;</h2>
                    I have tried to download forza horizon 3 three times now and all have failed in completely different ways. I have tried many "solutions" and none have worked for me. The first time i tried to download it the game size didn come up (it didnt say xgb out
 of xgb) and it downloaded past the actual game size somehow even though nothing downloaded. the second time it got to 55.04 out of 55.05gb or something and then when it got to installing it wouldnt do anything and the progress bar didnt move for even after
 leaving it for hours. The third time I left it for a roughly&nbsp; 6 hours in the day with an internet connection and it only got to 10kb and then nothing from there. How do i fix this?

<h2>            HIGH disk usage Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    It's been about 4 days since I've had this issue. My computer was running really slow, so I checked the Task Manager and saw that a "System" process was running under the name "ntoskrnl.exe". I thought it was a virus or a rootkit. I ran Windows Defender
 and nothing was detected. I just did a clean install of my operating system last night, and I'm checking my processes and the same issue is persisting.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an HP Pavilion m7 1015-dx.<br />

</div>
<div>If the problem is persisting like I think it is, can this be a hardware issue?</div>

            <p>Are you getting a BSOD?&nbsp; It looks like you may have a memory problem.&nbsp; Suggest you test as follows and let me know the results:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>First, Invoke Run window or&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>&nbsp;Charm. And after that Select the Settings tab in case of Search Charm.</li><li>The next thing to do is Type in the command “<strong>MdSched</strong>”, and then press Enter.
<p>The window launched lists comes up with just two options –</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one being <strong>Run the tool</strong> right now. The system will reboot if you opt for this one. So in such case you must save all your work before you opt to go for it.</li><li>After that Run the tool at next system boot. This will automatically schedule the tool to run when you start your system the next time.</li></ul>

<p>This tool instantly works at system startup, and kind of works in an environment similar to that of DOS.</p>

<p>The tool will start the diagnosis instantly after reboot. Actually it runs a set to test on your

<p>If your RAM is unable to pass all the tests, then it means &nbsp;that you will be required to repair or replace it.</p>

my hard disk usage goes to 20 to 100% and the&nbsp;priority&nbsp;seems to be high as the system&nbsp;gets really slow.for example it takes 3 secs to open a local disk.<br />

            Its a 100% disk usage problem in all Windows 8 Versions. In task manager programs like services and system.exe consumes .5-1 MB/s and shows a disk usage of 100% and make other running programs unresponsive.
<br />
Its a major problem in windows 8 and still Microsoft is not doing anything regarding this!!<br />
Are we supposed to face this problem until the next release of Windows or is there any way to fix it permanently??

<p>I haven't bothered to count them but as you can see i have 20+ of these running.<br />
None of them are really using much cpu, but im just a bit concerned that there are so many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it normal and i should i just ignore them, or is this something i need to look into?</p>

            Hi Jaco,
<br />svchost is a program used to run Windows services compiled as DLL not EXE files.
<br />In previous Windows version one svchost was used to run up to 10-15 services. In Windows 10 most services runs separately, one per svchost instance. This increase number svchost processes but make process and service management  more easy and accurate.
<br />So that's normal, don't bother about this.

            Hello Jaco,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 V1703 or later, this is normal with SVChost or Service Host.
<br />
<br />With Windows 10 V1703, Microsoft restructured Service Host to host only one process rather than grouping of processes. So if your system RAM is more than 3.5 GB (3486 MB or more), Service Host will not group some of the services. On systems with RAM lesser than 3.5 GB, Service Host will continue grouping services.

<br />Hope this answers your query!

            Hi jaco9307 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is now fully multi-threaded, it is normal in Windows 10 to have 70+ versions of svchost running
<br />
<br />Those processes, while it seems a lot use very little system resources and will not slow your system down at all, each provides a Windows function and will only actually be used when required
<br />
<br />You have nothing to worry about this is absolutely normal in Windows 10 . ..

<p>This is probably a case of unassigned drive (USB drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right click on my Computer icon</p>
<p>2. click on Manage.</p>
<p>3. Go to "Disk management"/Removable devices &amp; assign a Drive letter to it manually.</p>
<p>4. Right click on the drive without a Letter &amp; click on "Change Drive Letter and Paths..."</p>
<p>5. Click on "Change".</p>
<p>6. Assign an alphabet.</p>
<p>7. Click on OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
There should be an unassigned drive exist in the disk management table.

            <p>The third-party flash card market is rife with fakes. There's really no way to know if that card will work, but I suspect it won't. From what I've read, the SDHC specs max out at 32GB of storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want something that works, stick with a 64GB MicroSDXC card from a reputable vendor, and let somebody else be the guinea pig.</p>

    <title>Online Status Unknown issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamthemessenger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online Status Unknown issue</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox One Day One Edition if that matters, but whenever I sign in no body can see that I am online. When I go to see if I am appearing offline it show "Online status unknown" and won't even let me go down to it to change the status. Then in the
 tabs at the home screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mixer says "Sorry, we can't show featured broadcasts right now."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Community says "There's nothing to show right now."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game Pass/Store both say "Sorry we can't show featured games and apps right now" or along those lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't install new games or even look at them. I can still send messages/party invites and play online, but my friends keep saying that I am appearing offline. It has been like this for almost a week now. I cannot look at people's profiles either. I've
 Googled it and only things I have seen to try is restarting router (tried it), trying WiFi (tried it), trying ethernet cable (tried it) and lastly to try a different wireless connection (tried that too) and nothing works. I don't understand why this is happening.
 Is my XBone going to crap or my profile? I've also tried deleteing my profile and relogging in and unplugging and plugging back in the Xbone and neither of those worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have any ideas or solutions please do let me know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Messenger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the issue with Unknown showing on your status. We would recommend doing a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft factory reset</a> this will fix anything corrupt with the OS. Two things to make sure you have before doing the reset:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>make sure have a stable network connection</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure know all log in information for all profiles on the console</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, let us know.</p>

D3DRM.DLL is Direct3D Retained Mode, an older graphics display technology from 1997 that was removed from Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Moreover, there is no information about the compatibility of the game “M</span><span><span>otocross Madness 2” with Windows Vista.<br />
To check the compatibility status of the game, click <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=motocross madness 2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</strong></span><br />

    <title>Xbox One Repair Wrong Tracking Number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imslayerii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Repair Wrong Tracking Number</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox now offers fake tracking number to shut you up...If you have Xbox that need repairs, they will force you to use advanced exchange or you will never be able to track it. First of all I paid for expedite shipping, FedEx delivered it in two days, Microsoft
 sent me an email four days later saying that's when it arrived. Now they said my Xbox has been sent and offered me a tracking number....FedEx.com doesn't recognize it, neither does the FedEx representatives...Called back again a lady had me on the phone for
 30min after telling me she is tranfering me and that never happened....if you want your Xbox repaired, you will end up paying for shipping and purposely getting by them..Microsoft Repair Service the worst thing Microsoft came up with....Try Sony</p>

<h2>            Where have all my contacts gone&#63; I am using latest version of Mac OS Sierra.</h2>
                    It appears that I am not the only one with missing contacts. The new layout is no where near as user friendly. There is no home page anymore and most of my contact are missing. This is extremely frustrating and I have read your instructions on how to add
 a contact and that doesn't work. I have signed out and signed back in a again twice, once with my Skype name and once with my e-mail address. I do not have the time to go through all my contact list to see which ones are there or not. Surely the whole idea
 of Skype is that it takes your contacts automatically from your contacts on your computer. Please can someone help me resolve this issue. Thank you

            Hello Susan. &nbsp;I have not signed in with a different account and I am using the same Skype name as I always do. I did not request that my Skype was upgraded, it did it without my permission and it also updated on my husbands iMac this morning with out his
 permission too and his contacts are all messed up with. It seems to be due to the fact that the latest version of Skype is not compatible with the latest version of the OS 10.12.6. I had to uninstall the updated Skype on my iMac and I reinstalled the previous
 version that I previously had and now all my contacts are there as they were before . If it worked on the previous version then it can't be to do with my Skype account or my OS, it has to be a problem with the newer version of Skype. It's a shame that they
 have messed about with Skype so much as I have been a big fan of Skype for many years, but this latest version is not very user friendly at all.&nbsp;

            I completely agree with Daisy. I am on a Macbook Pro with High Sierra OS10.13.1 installed and yesterday Skype upgraded to the latest version without asking me. There is no Contacts list available in the Skype toolbar! This is ridiculous. Also, I would
 like to add a new contact phone number to my contact list and I cannot edit anything to change the phone number to a name so I know what to look for next time I want to call it. I've never seen anything so unuser friendly in my life. Every time Skype upgrades,
 the service downgrades. I am really fed up with this. I can't show you a screenshot as it has my recent history on it, which shows numbers, names and profiles - but I can no longer find a list of my Skype contacts anywhere. How do I downgrade to a version
 that functions slightly better than this?

            There is no phone number for Skype customer support I tried all day yesterday to speak to someone and was given a false number to contact just so that they could get rid of me! It is really a very bad service, the only way is to go through this very painfully,
 slow and laborious Community blog thing. I haven't read one helpful reply from Skype regarding this issue, they seem to just give out the same replies. Is anyone at the Skype support actually reading these complaints and issues, and if so what are you doing
 to resolve them and why are you upgrading without our permission? Please give us a sensible solution.

<p>After some playing around, I found a link on one of the posts to a Microsoft page where you could check what accounts were listed with your email account, and that told me that there were two accounts for my email address. So the upgrade has, I think, created
 a new account. </p>
<p>When I clicked on the account with my Skype name, the old contacts came up. What also came up in the new format was a Bots section which included my most hated bot, BING. It's a little robot looking icon and there are heaps of bots in there and that's obviously
 why Microsoft has upgraded- you can block them all which took me a few minutes doing it manually- couldn't find the setting in privacy where I can block all of Microsoft affiliates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If my business associates didn't all use word etc, I would be ditching Microsoft and Skype quick smart as this is all too Big Brother for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I purchased a <span>digital </span>copy of
<span>Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag</span> yesterday for my<span> Xbox One.</span></p>
<span>Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag</span> yesterday for my<span> Xbox One.</span></p>
<p>It installs normal, and it was ready to play around 10 %.</p>
<p>When I played the game, there was&nbsp;loading screen and at the bottom right corner there was this:</p>
<p><span>"Install in progress, __ % completed."</span> Eventually the installation reached 100 % and I started the game and everything was good.</p>
<p>However, when I finished the mission where Eduard gets caught in the plantation by the Templars, a loading screen came up and yet there were the words again but this time it was stuck on 68 %</p>
<p>"Install in progress, 68 % completed." and it has not moved no matter what I do.</p>
<p>I have tried disconnecting xbox live, and I have also tried turning my console on and off.</p>

<p>Can someone help me?</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>If not, what I suggest you do is to uninstall and then re-install but let it fully install before running the game. I know it says
<em><strong>"Ready to Start"</strong></em> but it's always safer to let a game fully install to 100%, it seems cause less issues if you do this.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>As for the save, when you run the game after installation you should get the <em>
<strong>"Syncing Data"</strong></em> message and your save file should recovered.</p>

            Honestly, there must be more behind this error message. First, Steam is no "older program" that would need any compatibility fixes to work on Windows 10. Second, did you do what the message suggests? Did you check your network connection? Did you check
 whether Steam is online, disabled or blocked (by a firewall, f.i.)? If unsure, just reinstall Steam, and look if there's any difference.

<h2>            Windows 10 Cumulative update KB316908 for version 1511 December 2nd 2015</h2>
                    <p>Hi I hear that this update upgrades the version of windows 10 and also the revision of windows 10. Intern adding more improvements to the operating system once it's complete. I could not find it in my windows update and security when I clicked on check for
 updates the file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Cumulative update KB316908 for version 1511 December 2nd 2015. was not found. I was wondering if there is a way for me to manually download a stand alone version of this update. The version I have is 1511 and the build I have is 10586.63. &nbsp;when
 I click on choose how updates are delivered &nbsp;everything is grayed out. I have everything turned off. I don't know if that matters or not.. Do I have to leave the windows firewall turned on in order to receive the updates? I don't think I have to leave it on
 to receive them just to download and install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Typically Arcade games will work (not always, but mostly), but with Games on Demand you generally *need* to have your physical location and account region match up or it will start spitting out errors when downloading.</p>

<p>As I stated above, I am willing to go into my account and change my region for a period of three months in order to access the Japanese marketplace as I have out that this is possible. That would then allow me access to the game I want in the marketplace
 and I would then be able to purchase it. The question remains, would the game then run on a NA console, or I would I need to find a so-called Japanese console? The game would be a digital download and not have to be read by the DVD ROM at this point. Would
 this work? Hey, I am wanting to throw money at Microsoft here just to play a game.</p>

<p>As Maxen state, Games on Demand can be region locked. So even though your account would be set to Japan and you could see the games, you won't be able to download them because your physical location won't match.</p>
<p>It's also a violation of the terms of service to try to get content that you're not meant to.</p>

<p>I can't see there being a problem.&nbsp; I have both the old Xbox 360 and the new Slim 250GB machine. Both of which are updated to the latest dashboard, and both play compatible original Xbox games without issues.</p>

<p>As long as they are on the backwards compatible list then the games will run fine</p>
<p>Some people don't use an official Xbox hd or expect the 4gig one to be an hd</p>

<p>Mine work and I'm on the new dashboard. As long as they are on the compatible list and you have an official microsoft hard drive in the console, there should be no problems.</p>

            You can only have ONE antivirus, you must uninstall Avg or Mse, I would say AVG. the two conflicting are causing problems.
