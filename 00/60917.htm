Neither the Microsoft Office application suite, nor any of its <br />
individual component applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, <br />
Outlook, etc.), have _ever_ been "part" of *any* Windows operating <br />
system. They are, and always have been, separate applications, that <br />
must be purchased and installed separately.<br />
<br />
A full license for Microsoft Office comes pre-installed on new <br />
computers only when the computer manufacturer chooses to offer it, and <br />
the purchaser is willing to pay extra for it.<br />
<br />
Additionally, many OEMs offer the trial license for Microsoft <br />
Office, which you can use for a limited number (25, I believe) of times <br />
before you have to purchase it.<br />
<br />
As always, though, Windows 7 does include two rudimentary text editors: <br />
NotePad and WordPad.<br />

            Mine is a fairly new PC and should not have any power issues. Since updating to Windows 10 (from Windows 8.1 which came installed on the PC), my computer shuts down within 15 minutes of turning it on first time each day. After that, it runs fine (so far).
 What is causing the computer to shut down without any notice or warning? It does an automatic restart, but it's very annoying.<br />

            <p>I installed Win 10 on one of my laptops shortly after the OS was made available... wish to god I'd not done this.&nbsp; I'd not had on ounce of trouble out of this machine since purchasing it 18 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since downgrading to Win 10, the computer shuts down at least once&nbsp; every other day, sometimes multiple times a day.&nbsp; I own two other computers, each running Win 7, and will not switch these to Win 10.&nbsp; Videos run from youtube or any internet site freeze
 and/or lag.&nbsp; I first thought this might be an issue with Firefox, but it also happens with Chrome and IE (though not as often with IE).&nbsp; The new MS browser sucked so much I disabled it almost immediately.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a bunch of photo editing software; thankfully,&nbsp; these shutdowns have not cost a major loss of work.&nbsp; But, it may just be time for the switch to a Mac for a work platform.</p>

            <p>Hello Ingvar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to system files corruption. To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Automatic Windows 10 Updates so frustrating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> winwin_10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Windows 10 Updates so frustrating</h2>
                    <p>As an IT-professional I really would like to assure Automatic Windows Updates are particularly frustrating. They just appear at very bad moments. Scheduling (Configuring) is not working the way it must work. Automatic updates are disabled from within Group
 Policy, and the Update Service is stopped and set to manual, but it still comes back. Sometimes you just need to stop Background Intelligence Transfer Services, together with Windows Update Service, and even it is sometimes impossible and you just have to
 start Windows in Safe mode, DISABLE both Services, remove everything from Software Distribution &gt; Downloads, then return to Normal mode to be able to just work on your workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, please, fix this. Let us choose whether we want to run updates. An 8-core CPU PC with 8GB RAM is sometimes busy with something else, and when Updates just start on their own, the PC becomes like an Intel Pentium 1 PC with 128KB RAM. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Even now it comes back. It's like a virus. Really. A Microsoft-Official Virus.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Disabling touchpad will depend on the make and model of your Laptop. Some models would have its own button that would allow you to disable/enable the touchpad from the keyboard. Other models would also have settings from its own driver software that would
 allow you to toggle it on/off. Since you've mentioned that your laptop is Dell, may we know the specific model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, if you have other pointing device to connect on your laptop (like a mouse), you can disable the touchpad through Windows settings by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press <strong>Windows + I</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Touchpad</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Leave touchpad on when a mouse is connected</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the steps above, your touchpad will be disabled until you disconnect the other pointing device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

            I have been trying to solve this for so long and today right after I sent the questions wouldn't you just know I solved it myself. It was just a matter of right clicking on an empty space in the taskbar and&nbsp; unchecking the toolbar. Thank you so much but
 it is solved.&nbsp;

<h2>            windows 10 ruined my hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Last night I tried to download windows 10. I have a pre-installed version of windows 7. I was told that I could get a free upgrade to windows 10. I clicked to begin the download and went through the entire process right up until the very last section where
 it asks you for the product key number. i put the number in correctly but it says it is wrong, however, it said I could skip it so I clicked next and nothing happened at all. Now all I have is the blue screen with the product key box and next button and I
 can't even click anything to get rid of it. I have turned my pc off and on but I end up at the same page. Now I have lost all my documents, music, photos etc. I have put an old hard drive into my computer to use for the moment. HELP!!!</p>

            <p>Tell us the model /brand of your PC, and we can tell you how to trigger the Factory restore.&nbsp; Factory restore destroys all data on the drive.&nbsp; So
<strong>before </strong>you do the factory restore, find a friend who can temporarily install your old drive into an external USB connected hard drive housing.&nbsp; Then, with that drive attached to another PC, you can access and copy the data from it to where
 ever you choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tester for the Seagate drive is found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that drive is operational, it has the factory restore on it.&nbsp; If you do not have a valid product key, this is the way to go.&nbsp; Once you have the factory restore complete, you can then make a system image copy of the drive on an external drive or on a set
 of DVD +R's (not -Rs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can remove the original drive, install the new one.&nbsp; Then using a System Repair CD, you can use it to restore the image you made on the old drive to the new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more detailed instructions on any of this, just ask.</p>

<h2>            Best games for achievement hunting&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Because of the new rewards program, I want to get my Gamerscore to 25000 by my birthday, which is January 1st. What are the best games in everyone's opinion that are good for getting achievements fast, and are at least somewhat enjoyable? Since I have a
 GameFly subscription, just about any game is in reach for me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello ScottSanford1!</p>
<p>I know that dealing with this type of situation can be frustrating and we're here to help! I understand you're having issues with your internet speed not reaching the rate of the data plan you're paying for. Have you tried different Ethernet cables? I would
 recommend you first try safely powering down the PC/console as well as your router/modem. Once powered off go ahead and unplug them from the power source. Give it about 5 minutes to fully reset at which point you'd plug the router/modem back in first. Once
 the network equipment is back up and running plug in the Xbox One S and try running the test again.

<p>There are multiple things you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try to connect the ethernet port from the router to your Xbox directly. If the Xbox does not recognize that, try using your PC to check, if the Ethernet connection works</p>
<p>- When you connect via Wifi, you will lose speed, as there always is a loss of around 50-80%, depending on the distance and obstacles between the router and Xbox</p>
<p>- Try to use a powerline adapter, that can send the internet signal through your power lines with barely any loss.

<h2>            Network drive not showing up in &#34;windows explorer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help here. I'm not an IT profesionnal, but not a noob either. I usually figure out how to solve my windows issues but now it's been months since I've started working on this one (on and off) and cant find the solution. I do not see my network drive
 in my "Windows Explorer". I had no problem before my upgrade to windows 10, but not yet ready to blame Windows 10 as the common denominator of the issue, I just dont know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, here are the facts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Running latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>- Have a WD Passport Ultra, USBed into my home routeur, Sagemcom 5250</p>
<p>- All devices in the house can see the network drive except my Windows 10 laptop. Including my PS3.</p>
<p>- Laptop is a Lenovo Twist S230U</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is what I've done so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Just in case my upgrade was screwy, I did a clean install last week.</li><li>My private network is set to turn on network discovery and to sharing.</li><li>Some forum posts talk about needing a homegroup to see network drives, but am unable to do so. I get an error message "windows cant set up a homegroup in this computer". Dont know if that would solve my network drive issue anyways.</li></ol>
<p>Let the games begin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrea</p>

<span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do the other USB devices function fine without any issues on the desktop?
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow these methods:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</a> to run the automated troubleshooting services and see if that does the trick.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Verify if the USB drive gets recognized in
<b>Disk Management </b><span>and assign a drive letter to the same. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To open disk management,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Start, </b>type <b>diskmgmt.msc</b> in the Start search box and hit Enter.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the drive gets detected in disk management, Id suggest you to assign a drive letter and see if that does the trick.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Yes the other USB devices work.<br />
<br />
Method 1&nbsp; The troubleshooter wasn't able to detect any problems.<br />
<br />
Method 2&nbsp;&nbsp; No Iomega ext hd has been assigned a drive letter and "devices and printers" do not list the Iomega drive so I am unable to assign a drive letter<br />
<br />

It just seems as if the computer is ignoring the presence of the drive<br />

<p>Type Device Manager in Search and open it. When you insert your external hard drive does device manager&nbsp;automatically refresh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;And then say something like 'USB Mass Storage' device underneath 'Universal Serial Bus controllers'. If so, does it have an error symbol or not?</p>

            I can't see it refreshing. There are 2 USB mass storage devices listed under Universal Serial Bus Controllers, neither are in error, both "working properly". Both are using a driver \windows\system32\drivers\USBTOR.SYS<br />

One of them indicates D-link wireless which is how it gets access to the network,etc.<br />
the other has no other description.<br />

            It might be a compatibility error, your PVR may have made changes to your ext HD that makes it unusable on Windows. It's only a possibility though.

<h2>            How to Repair Corrupt System Files from a Installation Disc</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 8.1 x64, build 6.3.9600.16384,<br />
using the Command Prompt with administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>sfc /scannow<br />
</b><br />
returns:<br />
<br />
<b><i>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />

<br />
and<br />
<br />
<b>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</b><br />
<br />
returns:<br />
<br />
<div><b><i>Error: 0x800f0906</i></b></div>
<div><b><i>The source files could not be downloaded.</i></b></div>
<div><b><i><br />
</i></b></div>
<div>(and the Windows Update Service is not able to start because those files are missing.)<br />
<br />
<br />
also tried<br />
<br />
<div><b>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth /source:wim:F:\sources\install.wim:1 /limitaccess</b></div>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I see that you have tried many troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue. Let's try some more steps and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform Startup repair and check if it helps.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Startup Repair can fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system files.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this:</span></p>
<p>a. <span>Boot from the <strong>Windows 8 DVD</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option <strong>Install now</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. Click on </span><strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>d. On the next page click on<strong> Advanced Options</strong></span></p>
<p><span>e. Now click on<strong> Troubleshoot</strong></span></p>
<p><span>f. Lastly click on <strong>Startup repair </strong>and<strong> </strong>
follow the on screen instructions</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This may take 15 to 20 minutes to repair. Once completed try to login to your desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If automatic repair does not help, perform <strong>SFC SCAN</strong> and hard drive test.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Run </span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System File Checker tool using Windows 8 disk</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boot from the <strong>Windows 8 DVD. </strong><br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option <strong>Install now</strong><br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong><br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the next page click on <strong>Advanced Options</strong><br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong><br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Command prompt.<br />
g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the onscreen instructions, restart the computer and check if you can install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If the SFC Scan fails, please run <strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> command in the place of
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">sfc /scannow.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            <p>I've never been able to get DISM to work in any configuration.&nbsp;The documentation on the tool is very cryptic&nbsp;for people who do not&nbsp;work with this stuff everyday. WIM images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message&nbsp;in the instant case&nbsp;says that DISM is not support in the "online" mode in Windows&nbsp; PE.&nbsp; Error on SFC was that "system file protection stopped it from starting".&nbsp; I think that that best option for me is to re-image using an earlier image
 from backup that did not have this problem with windows update.</p>

            Use the "source" option to specify the location of the files that are required to<br />
&nbsp;restore the feature. For more information on specifying a source location, see<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077</a>. I have tried everything suggested net 3.5 is installed and enabled, I have set group policy to download from windows update and to use install.wim from
 source files and still get error 0x800f0906

            Once you can see the language and regional settings screen when booting from bootable installation media you are running Windows Predeplyment Environment&nbsp; (win PE) which uses Windows Recovery Environment (win RE) to run command prompt or all other available
 recovery options/tools once you click that "repair windows" button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The hidden recovery partition (&lt;=300MB and NTFS) if created and/or being used&nbsp;has its own winre.wim also.&nbsp;

<p>On a recent clean install of windows 10 i have what original post describes here.&nbsp; I tried a clean install after being unable to use dism to fix errors that sfc was detecting after the upgrade to windows 10 but still get same unfixable file corruption detected
 by sfc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the information in this post Saltgrass shared confirms my CBS.log is showing powershell as the trouble package but i can not get dism to see any usable sources in order to fix file corruption detected by sfc.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;several lines that contain "cannot
 repair member file" naming powershell and others saying there is some kind of ownership or privilege issue like&nbsp;&nbsp;"[DIRSD OWNER WARNING]Directory [ml:139{69},l:272{86}]"\??\C:\Windows\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\Microsoft.PowerShell.Management"
 is not owned but specifies SDDL in component Microsoft.Windows.PowerShell.V3.Common, pA Host= amd64 Guest= x86, nonSxS, PublicKeyToken = ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried .iso mounted in virtual drive, dvd media mounted in desktop and recovery options and dism always fails on /restorehealth&nbsp;with "The source files could not be found.&nbsp; Error: 0x800f081f"</p>

</p><blockquote>How do I repair the Corrupt System Files?<br />
Can I tell <em>DISM</em> to use the Windows installation disc as the source?<br />
</blockquote>
<p>The recommended advice is to run sfc and reboot before running sfc again for three attempts.&nbsp;If a fourth attempt is needed reboot and try running `Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup` before rebooting again and then running sfc /scannow
 before rebooting and then running dism with /restorehealth option and then if that is successful reboot run sfc once more to check it returns no errors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If DISM /restorehealth or /StartComponentCleanup options do not fix detected&nbsp;corruption in component store then you can only try refreshing windows and if that fails&nbsp;try resetting windows.&nbsp; If still unsuccessful then try&nbsp;wiping your drive to zeros and try
 from scratch (without keeping any settings or files).</p>
<p>I have tried several sources for dism to use but always get same result, "<strong><em>The source files could not be found.&nbsp; Error: 0x800f081f</em></strong>".<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A full in depth description on how to use dism options (i.e. use particular sources directory) with examples and good explanation is found at
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have upgraded, installed, reinstalled, refreshed, reset, sfc'ed, dism'ed and cursed way more than i would like this past few weeks as all i have proven is the downloaded files from windows updates and Media Creation Tool are corrupt and therefor any .iso
 created from those files are corrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quicker MS acknowledge this major issue the quicker a fix can be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now why would an engineer regurgitate what op describes,&nbsp; does not answer any of the questions op asks and then does not follow through on his promise of replying if a solution is not found be of any help to anyone?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution of not using windows 10 is getting nearer and nearer for me.&nbsp; Prevention is way better than cure.&nbsp;&nbsp; System File Checker is to check health of windows and it is telling me windows install is not healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Weird unwanted auto driver management
 and weird unpredicatable and unreproducable issues are i am sure all caused by these detected errors.&nbsp;Windows 8 was at least rock solid when it was released and cringe to think how much of a bad taste in many peoples mouths due to the bodged upgrade process
 for upgrading to windows 10 has left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely none of the shared solutions, suggestions, wikis and questions that folks have shared here or anywhere else online have helped fix detected file corruption in windows 10 for me.&nbsp; I know for certain my windows 8.1 install was healthy with no errors
 found&nbsp;by sfc before upgrading to windows 10.</p>

    <title>DVD RW&#47;CD RW will not read CD Roms or Audio CDs &#40;XP Pro&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DVD RW&#47;CD RW will not read CD Roms or Audio CDs &#40;XP Pro&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried the fix it option, have looked to see if it is enabled, etc. Still not reading.</p>
<p>Problem is the CD drive will only read DVD's (takes a&nbsp;minute to load) it won't read/write on CD's or open CD Roms. The CD's are not corrupted as I have used them many times before and others are blank. When I try burn something using Nero7 to Audio CD it
 just keeps telling me to insert&nbsp;a blank CD R/RW even when there is one in it. It makes a click noise every few seconds but never gets to reading the disc, or accepting it has a blank one in and letting me continue with burning the files to it.</p>
<p>When I tried a CD Rom it just stopped after trying for 30 seconds and didn't load.</p>
<p>When I tried a legitimate Audio CD (Bought) it did the same. Never loads the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try a DVD it works however it does take about 30 seconds to load it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            The drive is failing and the laser that handles CDs has completely died. Replace the drive. This is an easy and inexpensive hardware fix.

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to sign out of the guest account and login as Administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still signed in as Guest, you can check their existence &amp; status by entering the steps in the command prompt. To do that you need to do the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X on the keyboard.<br />
</li><li>Click on Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click Yes if it prompts for permission.<br />
</li><li>Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account:<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Win 10 WebDav credentials problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funkeisersoze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 WebDav credentials problem</h2>
                    <p>I have read a lot of posts related to network shares and credentials problem with Win10, but it seems none I can relate to, but all have similar problems.</p>
<p>I have created Http WebDav listener with Basic authentication app. Adding "network location" with address eg. https://localhost:11112/</p>
<p>with proper credentials(username/password) works fine, I can browse etc. </p>
<p>Then when I change credentials in my "db store", and try to navigate again I am getting windows login dialog because last credentials were changed, and this part seems to work fine.
</p>
<p>At this step I am entering new password (correct one) and in part where in my app I'm evaluating passed credentials I'm getting old credentials not the one I have entered?!??!? ( I have checked various combinations of username/password none seemed to be
 passed to authorization module)</p>
<p>Windows 10 is sending cached credentials that I have entered the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I have never checked "remember" checkbox in dialog, in windows credential manager there are no stored credentials for that given URL, I even have tried to add correct credentials to this cache, but it seems Win 10 is always sending credentials that
 were entered for the 1st time. After box reboot, I need to enter new username/password to browse and this time I can browse with correct credentials, changing password in app db, again here we go.. credentials being sent are the ones entered for the 1st time?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can tell me this is Windows 10 bug, or what can I do to avoid this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. using web browser and its security dialog works just fine, correct credentials are sent always as expected, so the code and security sequence being implemented must be correct.</p>

<p>So I was looking through the backwards compatibility listings for 360 games on the Xbox One and noticed the Rocksmith titles are not being considered for compatibility due to the required hardware. &nbsp;I assume they meant the USB cable required to connect a
 guitar to the console. &nbsp;If this is the case, the excuse of hardware compatibility makes no sense. &nbsp;The USB cable required for this game works on all standard USB ports, and the game is available on PC. &nbsp;For example, I have the game on XB360, PS3, and PC and
 I can use the one cable between all three platforms.</p>
<p>I would think the game could be easily made to work on the XB1 since it's available on PC and supposedly the XB1 architecture is based more towards PC versus XB360. &nbsp;Just curious if Microsoft is working on making any versus of these games available on the
 XBOX ONE??</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us disable <strong>Search online and include web results</strong> option in Cortana's Settings so that you can only search Windows and it will not provide web results upon searching. To disable it, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Cortana</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Disable <strong>Search online and include web results</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
