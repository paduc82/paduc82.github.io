<h2>            Xbox live account hacked and unable to recover</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend from HongKong's email had been hacked 2 weeks ago and that email address was used to login xboxlive, now he cant play all his digital games due to unable to login. We are 5 players team up for long term from Malaysia, Singapore and Hongkong to
 play Gow4 and Ghost recon wildland for cheevo, now we all stop play due to team member encounter issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As he mentioned he already contact Microsoft HongKong and proof he is the real person to own the xbox id, Microsoft support know about it but look like support was unable to solve the problem and it had passed 2 weeks already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is how Microsoft protect their xboxlive member in this case, in future you or me may face this problem too and we will loss every digital content we bought because Microsoft is ignore this kind of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any Microsoft support is here please help to solve this problem, you can contact him via
<strong>[Mod Removed- Personal Information] </strong>(xboxlive id: <strong>[Mod Removed- Personal Information]
</strong>) , we urge to finish our Ghost recon wildland for 1 more cheevo to 1000G....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.<br />

<p>Hey there Hoeaiki!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that your friend is stuck in this situation. Being that Microsoft is&nbsp;adamant about&nbsp;securing&nbsp;access to accounts, &nbsp;I would say that if you're unable to recover it, then they would have to start over with a new account and they&nbsp;would have to re-purchase
 his games and start his game progress from square one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to regain access to the gamer tag, you might want to set up <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/add-security-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
added security measures</a> to prevent any unauthorized access. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <title>Problems Deleting Fonts in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogueleader72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Deleting Fonts in Windows 8</h2>
                    I recently installed a whole slew of dingbat fonts for digital scrapbooking purposes. I went through some of them last night in PaintShop Pro to create brushes. I went into the Font folder to delete them afterward and I received the following message:&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Font cannot be deleted because it's in use."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem with that is, it was <b>not</b>&nbsp;in use; I had rebooted my computer and no programs were even open, not even my browser. The only thing open was the Font folder. I've only had Windows 8 for a few weeks, but I've never experienced this problem
 with any previous versions of Windows.</div>

            <p>Does it tell you what program has it in use?&nbsp; I would suspect it's probably Explorer using it, as it generates those preview icons in the font folder.&nbsp; Although it might also be a quick load app that loads fonts into memory in the background. I know some
 Adobe apps that do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is Explorer, you might try changing your icon view in the font folder to something that doesn't show previews (list format, for example).&nbsp; If it's another program, try closing that program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't tell what program has it open, the easiest step might be to reboot in a clean boot/Safe Mode&nbsp;to do it.&nbsp; Or if you do feel like poking around and finding the exact cause, there are some tools we can use to identify the specific thread that has
 locked the file in use.</p>

            No, it does not tell me which program is allegedly in use. All it says is what I mentioned in my first post: "Font cannot be deleted because it's in use." Also, I stated there were no programs open besides the Font folder itself. Both, switching icon view
 and booting up in Safe Mode did not work. However, I did find, though I've yet to try it, the following pain-in-the-neck method:
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.wincert.net/tips/microsoft-windows/windows-8/3647-cannot-delete-fonts-in-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wincert.net/tips/microsoft-windows/windows-8/3647-cannot-delete-fonts-in-windows-8</a><br />
<div><br />
<div>I'd much rather find an easier way. Seems more like a bug to me than the font actually being in use....</div>

            I agree. &nbsp;Especially if it can't be deleted in safe mode. &nbsp;I couldn't reproduce it myself, I opened my font folder and was able to delete some of my Adobe CS5 collection fonts without a problem. &nbsp;I'll report it.

    <title>Windows 10 Mouse&#47;Touchpad issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kodywallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mouse&#47;Touchpad issue</h2>
                    I own an HP Folio 9470m and I recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; This model has four mouse buttons, two above the trackpad and two below.&nbsp; The two below the trackpad work, but the left click above the trackpad clicks multiple times.&nbsp; For example, if I use
 the left click above the trackpad to open a new tab in my web browser it will open 8 new tabs.&nbsp; I have already used Device Manager to search for a more up to date driver, and none was found.&nbsp; Any help is appreciated!

            <p>I had the same issue so I uninstalled the Windows 10 driver and replaced it with the Windows 8.1 driver and that solved the issue. Unfortunately, Windows 10 keeps installing the Windows 10 driver automatically so I had to disabled the automatically updates
 also.</p>

            <p>Thank you Jonas,</p>
<p>it's working fine. I did exactly as you wrote. Uninstalled Synaptics driver relevant to Windows 10, reboot, and next installed Synaptics driver relevant to Windows 8.1, and reboot again. I also disabled auto-updates.</p>

            <p>What version of Windows are you using?</p>
<p>You need to use program which only capture and record Camera and won't broadcast , for example in Windows 10, Camera app would do this.</p>

            If you are using Windows 7, then either you need to download third-party software to do this or check your PC manufacturer's website or camera manufacturer's website and they might give you program to do this. Try open start and search for Camera or WebCam
 and see whether is there any application installed?

<p>What is causing these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched TechNet and the only article that I can find on this event is the following with refers to Windows Server 2008;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/cc734238(v=ws.10).aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article doesn't make any reference to Windows 10, so it's not applicable. &nbsp;However I did attempt the resolution within the document to see if it would help. &nbsp;It didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeatedly reported that I get the same warnings logged when am I installing CUs and I have run both the SFC and DSIM tools on the laptop, as per this thread;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/filtermanager-errors-during-installation-of/1b4e2850-f8f8-480f-b64a-7e67a51ce1cc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore the issue isn't with the Windows Update component or the Maintenance tool, the issue is with the 'FilterManager' component itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise on how I can resolve this? &nbsp;If you need to collect a series of logs from my install, please let me know where I can download such a tool and where I should send the collected logs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Acelyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming back on this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that last night, I ran the initial Maintenance routine manually on the laptop following the upgrade and monitored both the Application and System event logs. &nbsp;I can confirm that I no warnings were logged by the 'FilterManager'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">File System Filter 'wcifs' doesn't appear to be within this build of Windows 10?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade has reset everything back to the default/clean state. &nbsp;I will keep an eye on things and update this thread with what I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that there will be a few CUs and other updates for this build over the next couple of weeks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

 unless this gets fixed. Case in point Westjet app - you give a generic reply and don't do anything

<p>Hi nickbrewer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be some possible factors that's causing the misbehavior with your Surface. Let's drill down on what fix can we apply. In order for me to better understand what troubleshooting to apply, I would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What <strong>Surface Pro</strong> edition are you using?</li><li>Are you experiencing the issue on a different user profile?</li><li>Have you tried changing the <strong>Power Options</strong> on your <strong>Windows</strong>?</li><li>Are you having troubles with a certain app or is it with any app on your Windows?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can check these guides on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023450/surface-surface-battery-and-power#Video10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">optimizing your Surface battery life</a></strong>.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 problem with xbox one pad while pc gaming - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 problem with xbox one pad while pc gaming</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to post something i have found that is not working correctly and have managed to find a temporary solution for me but this needs to be fixed or looked at by Microsoft themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is whilst pc gaming using the official xbox one pad. I was experiencing input lag when playing various games on my pc using the xbox one pad connected via a usb cable. For example, playing assassins creed unity locked at 30fps using nvidias half
 refresh rate vsync (this plays a game at half the refresh rate of your monitor in my case 60hz, so game runs at a smooth 30fps) whilst looking around and controlling the character the input would start to drift from what was happening on screen, it happened
 when using the analog controls only. I tried using the mouse and keyboard and everything was running fine with no input lag, i then tried plugging my ps4 pad in and tested the game again, works fine, no input lag or drift. So i try again with the official
 xbox one pad and it starts to drift again, there is something wrong with the xbox pad drivers or direct input when gaming on windows 10, this did not happen on windows 8.1 or 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent 3 days solid on this trying a multitude of different things and the only fix is to use my ps4 pad or mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the official microsoft drivers from here ;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-xbox-one-controller-to-pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used the standard drivers that windows 10 installs too. Changed nvidias drivers and tried numerous versions, plugged pad into usb 3.0 ports and all the other usb 2.0 ports on my motherboard. Nothing fixes this input lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to point out i have tried the games at 60fps and don't get this lag at all, so this is only when the game is set to a locked 30fps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what microsoft has changed since windows 8.1 but whatever it is the official xbox pad doesn't work properly for windows pc gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the latest direct x web installers and vc redists available. my specs;</p>

I'm not sure about the TAB key specifically, but open Accessibility Options from Control Panel and see if any of the boxes are checked.&nbsp; If so, uncheck them and reboot.<br />

                    Computer is E- Machines W3609, running Windows 7 Home Premium,NOW ! I recently installed SEAGATE External Hard drive for continuous BACKUPS for my computer files ! My problem occurred around March 20 2013 , after I RENEWED&nbsp; - ParetologicReg Cure Pro !
 Reg Cure Pro ran on my computer fine for a long time , before this happened ! Everytime I cold RESTART my computer the Reg Cure Pro will not self update, because upon STARTUP, I keep getting a message that says:" Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library error
 ! This has been rather annoying, and I did call PARETOLOGIC and spoke to a support Tech ! He told me to un-install the program,,then go to the RUN box, and type in msconfig, type in%temp%, and then delete all the paretologic temp files! This DID not work!
 Then he told me to go to the Control Panel, click system and Security and allow the paretologic software through my FIREWALL ! Nothing was listed about the software or Paretologic! Everytime I re boot to this moment in time, 1:20 p.m. 04-07-2013, I do not
 get to restart without getting the runtime error message from the Visual C++ Runtime Library over and over this just keeps happening! What do I do now, is what I keep asking Microsoft, all forums, PARETOLOGIC- who does not supply re bootable disk for their
 products such as Reg Cure Pro! I really do not see a way out of this unless I completely remove a NEW renewal of that Reg Cure Pro and loose the money I have spent ,too?????????????&nbsp; Sincerely yours&nbsp;&nbsp; , *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />

</p><p>What do you see when you launch the game and go to your skins in game to select it?<br />
</p>
<p>I would close the game, and restart your PC. Re-launch the game and make sure you are logging into the game with the Microsoft account that made this purchase. If you still cannot see this skin after restarting your PC, then you will need to contact Xbox
 customer support so they can review your account with you.</p>

    <title>Xbox Elite Controller Grips Falling Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> square necron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller Grips Falling Off</h2>
                    <p>Yes I'm sure the warrenty is expired. But I bought insurance on it &nbsp;which apparently is useless. I called it in and was told it was just a cosmetic piece, therefore not covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Why was the grip advertised for functionality when i bought it then? They don't even mention the grips in the store anymore. Wonder why...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Since i have insurance and was told that the controller is still fine, doesn't that make microsoft responsible if i get injured on any sharp plastic that may be exposed? I mean by denying the fix on insurance you are saying its still functioning as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are other posts about this, but usually the people didn't get insurance and the warranty had expired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bizarre thing is other updates work fine. &nbsp;I think it is a problem with the particular update and not the computer itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the offline installer from the catalog that gets the same error. &nbsp;I was going to try installed in the individual components of the rollup, but that is not available.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That says all these are included in KB4012215. &nbsp;I tried uninstalling 2212 and installing 2215 but that failed. I'm going to install 2212 again, and just hid 2215. &nbsp;Reading what I've seen now that I have more information this appears to be a bigger issue
 with windows 7 and windows server 2008 r2.</p>

    <title>Connection to mapped network drive is lost if the computer is left - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salguod.net  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection to mapped network drive is lost if the computer is left idle.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;"The local device name is already in use"</div>
I have a home network of 3 PCs.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
One is a desktop running XP home and serves as a file server.&nbsp; It has a second hard drive (designated Z: locally) that is shared.&nbsp; It is plugged into our Dlink wireless G router.<br />
<br />
The other two are laptops, one Windows 7 Home Premium, the other Windows Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; Both use internal wireless cards to connect to the router. Both map the second hard drive as Z: as well.<br />
<br />
When logging into either laptop, the map to the Z: drive works as intended.&nbsp; However, if either is left idle for long, the connection is lost and any attempt to access the shared drive through my computer gets the error above.&nbsp; If I browse the network, the
 XP computer does not even show up.&nbsp; Restarting either laptop will re-establish the connection.&nbsp; Logging out and back in will not.<br />
<br />
What is the problem here and how do I fix it?&nbsp; All of our data is stored on that shared drive, having to restart to access it is frustrating.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Saluguod,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: update the wireless card drivers for the laptop computers and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: You can also try to update the 
firmware of the Dlink wireless router to the most recent version.</p>

            Router firmware is the latest.&nbsp; Windows update did find a wireless new driver for the Vista machine, but it did not help.<br />
<br />
I never loose access to the internet, only to the shared drive on the desktop PC.<br />
<br />
What else could be wrong here?<br />

<h2>            mixed mode assembly is built against version &#39;v1.1.4322&#39; of the runtime and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to play DC Universe Online on my computer with a game controller but everytime i go into settings to change the input to gamepad this error pops up and it says "Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. if you click continue, the application
 will ignore this error and attempt to continue. if you click Quit, the application will close immediately. Mixed mode assembly is built against version 'v1.1.4322' of the runtime and cannot be loaded in the 4.0 runtime without additional configuration information."</p>
<p>and if i click continue it brings me to a menu that freezes and if i click quit is says the program is not responding, i am in no way a coding genius and every answer ive found online for this question has had to do with coding so could someone explain how
 to fix this in laymens terms?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><em>"i am in no way a coding genius and every answer ive found online for this question has had to do with coding ."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Many PC games have inherent issues that require a fix, and tweaking files or doing other fixes is</p>
<p>part of PC gaming. </p>
<p>The best place to get fixes for inherent issues is often at a site specific to that game. With this game,
</p>
<p>from what I've read, the developers have apparently washed their hands of the controller issue, and</p>
<p>have not issued a patch to correct it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow the instructions given on those other sites you will find it's not really difficult. Don't let the fact</p>
<p>that you don't understand the commands get in your way. With PC games, you often have to doing this
</p>
<p>sort of thing (albeit not always as complicated). </p>
<p>The easy way is to copy/paste the commands shown as this prevents the chance of a typo</p>
<p>( the main problem with typing vs copy is commands are sensitive to leaving, or not having, a space between
</p>
<p>various parts of the command).</p>
<p>If you still find having to tweak files too taxing you may do better to use a console for gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have not listed what fixes you may have already tried, so I may be suggesting something you have
</p>
tried already, and the fixes you mention are probably the ones you need to use in any case, but...
<p>- By the look of it, this game uses a very early version of&nbsp; MS <em>.NET Framework</em> (v1.1.4322), which is somewhat
</p>
<p>peculiar as the game was released in 2011, so as a long shot...</p>
<br />
<p>Go to <em>Programs and Features</em> and click on <em>Turn Windows features on or off</em></p>
<p>Enable<em> .NET 3.5</em> <em>(includes .NET 2.0 &amp; 3.0)</em> .&nbsp; As you see, no mention of v1.1, but gamers should
</p>
<p>tick the main box next to .NET 3.5 anyway. </p>
<p>While you are there, scroll down to <em>Legacy Components</em> and tick that, and the
<em>Direct Play</em> boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have configured the games settings prior to trying to trying to use a controller, deleting the games
</p>
<p>configuration files may help. This would re-set the games settings and may help with the game recognising</p>
<p>your controller when you launch the game with the controller plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - What brand and model controller are you having the problem with ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to do an offline Windows 10 repair from an Insider - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clayton.curtis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to do an offline Windows 10 repair from an Insider build ISO &#40;DVD&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was running reasonably well on 1703 build 16251 until I borked something trying to fix errors (many of which were probably due to having done an in-place upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 long before becoming an "Insider").&nbsp; My system will now boot
 to the dreaded state of a black screen which produces an arrow cursor and small spinning blue circle when I move the mouse.&nbsp; I've managed to get into advanced startup options, and even booting into plain safe mode leaves me in the same situation.&nbsp; I've been
 able to get into command prompt mode (on the usual X: drive) and run both SFC (which says it found some things it couldn't fix -- per the log the hashes for MSDTC don't match) and offline DISM using my 16251 DVD as the source (which completed successfully
 with no other comments, but SFC still has the same issues).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Having been through all that, I'd like to do a "repair" installation, but I can't get into the normal Windows environment to start it.&nbsp; I tried running startup.exe on the DVD from the command line, but the only two options I got were "upgrade" and "clean
 install".&nbsp; I tried the former (and don't want to do the latter until I have more time available to reinstall all apps, etc.), but was told I couldn't do an "upgrade" from the DVD that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soooo.... I'm trying to determine whether it's possible to do an offline Windows 10 repair from an Insider build ISO (DVD), and if so, how.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, I could use pointers on how to resolve the "DISM worked, but SFC still has issues" situation.&nbsp; I've
 spent hours surfing the 'net and basically coming across the same stuff multiple times.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, when you're booting up the DVD, are you able to see the 'Repair this PC' option? Please advise.</p>

<p>Just to verify, when you're booting up the DVD, are you able to see the 'Repair this PC' option? Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your question there is no possible way to do an offline Windows 10 repair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Yes, I can see the "Repair this PC" option. When I click on it, I'm taken to the screen that includes "fix startup problems" and "troubleshooting".&nbsp; The "fix startup" produces an SRT log that says 0 root causes, and while the disk metadata check 'completes
 successfully', it has a code of 0x32.&nbsp; Going the troubleshooting route, the only option that I can use is command prompt, which is where I've been doing DISM and SFC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(b) I may have used the term "offline" incorrectly. I meant can I do a repair install of my C: drive having booted from the DVD generated from the downloaded ISO for 16251.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; I'm persisting with this because I learn things this way.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you can't boot to Windows then you will not be able to do a Repair Installation. So you would need to try a Clean Install. Of course the issue could be hardware.<br />
<br />
(Sorry for the delay however I was having major colon surgery and unable to help for a while.).<br />

            I'm having a similar issue with Window 10. When I open an image-rich site like Yahoo.com, the images don't display properly (just empty boxes). This happens on Chrome and Firefox as well, but when I open the same site using Edge, the images are displayed
 properly.

<h2>            Multiple Skype issues ...</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Im having the same issue .. my Android device (7.0) Skype version 8.10.0.4 was working fine till 2 days ago when it stopped sending anything in the middle of a text conversation ( I had sent at least 3 replies to a friend and then I got the dreaded squiggly
 line and nothing else). </p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting an age I descided to de-install and reinstall, the App, and now after asking for username and password it never connects. I have checked permissions etc and they are the same as before when it was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile the Login on my PC version ( obviously same details) works fine , HOWEVER there is another issue there as my Skype numbers ( I have 2 one in Ireland &amp; one in Germany) are not connecting to the desktop app anylonger ( since
 a couple of days) the numbers are reachable but the call never connects. This WAS still functioning on my Mobile UNTIL the above issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried contacting customer support, what a Joke how CAN you contact Tech support ( no email or contact phone number ). I finally contacted Microsoft directly and the people on the switchboard tried to put me through... fat lot of good that did me as I
 keep getting cut off when they are transfering me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I AM REALLY REALLY frustrated!!&nbsp; I use Skype exstensively for work and Im loosing business and i pay quite a lot of money each year for this ( now) terrible service!!!&nbsp; I am VERY annoyed! and quite honestly am going to look for an alternative unless someone
 does something FAST!!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Can somebody contact me ASAP ( you could try Skype but hey the chances of THAT working are v v Low) or at least check my account as this isnt the first time I´ve had this type of issues !!
</p>

            <p><strong>How will I know when Windows 10 is available?</strong><br />
Between now and launch, the following KB update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583</span></a>)&nbsp; should be installed on your Windows 7/8.1 computer.
 Volume License customers will not receive this update because of&nbsp;IT requirements in managed environments. If its not already installed, open Windows Update and check for Updates.</p>

<p><strong>To check if the updates already installed:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583</strong> update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is installed, you should see the following pop up in the Notification area of the Taskbar.

</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from an OEM base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry this type of licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
</span></span></span>
<p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>This will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous based qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The edition of Windows 10 installed will be based on the logical edition of Windows installed,
<em>ie. Windows 8 Core (Single Language) will be upgraded to Windows 10 Home, Windows 7 Professional will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.</em></p>
