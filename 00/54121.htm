    <title>Connecting to the Internet Causes BSOD&#47;CRASH - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dathighlander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to the Internet Causes BSOD&#47;CRASH</h2>
                    Okay i have had the BSOD 0x000000F4 so it was something to do with memory so i did all the hardware tests, checked my ram sticks, reseated them. it turns out they work, i removed my GPU to see if that was the problem it was no i switch it into different
 slots and it still works. Checked my SSD that works fine i use that exclusively for my OS and Drivers. Checked my mechanical drive, works. checked CPU works, and motherboard works and of course my computer turns on so it works. well i have network card adapter,
 it also works exactly as it should it connects me to the internet.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well since i established it was a software issue i tried updating the drivers, they were already updated. but the BSOD got so bad i couldn't get onto my computer so i formatted and reinstalled my Windows 7 home premium operating system. it installed okay
 i put in my PC build's CD drivers and installed all of them, i then went to connect to my internet and then it crashes/BSOD's.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now this happens even if i am idling doing nothing it wil take anytime from instantly connecting to crash/BSOD or several minutes. i have since used the laptop (what i am using to write this) to download the updates from the manufacturers sites and i updated
 the computers drivers and then it still happened. what else lets me know that it is software is that it is stable until i connect to the internet.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I took the PC into college last Thursday and connected it to the internet and it seemed to work. so i am kind of lost. how can't i connect to the internet and last thursday i connect onto the college network note i have multiple devices connected to the
 internet on a regular basis at my house so the problem would effect every device if it was the router.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note, downloading anything from the internet instantly causes the blue screen including Windows update.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This video i found on youtube shows what happens with my computer:&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/gGInG7XlyM8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtu.be/gGInG7XlyM8</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/gGInG7XlyM8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/gGInG7XlyM8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the&nbsp; <b>CRITICAL_OBJECT_TERMINATION (f4)</b> bug check.
<br />
<br />
This indicates that a process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpectedly exited or been terminated. So, just looking at that, we know that on your system, there is either a process or thread that is crucial to the functionality of your system that
 is unexpectedly ceasing to exist, therefore causing a system crash. Next question we of course have is, why?<br />
<br />
If we look further into the dump, we see EXCEPTION_CODE: (NTSTATUS) <i><b>0xc0000006
</b></i>- The instruction at 0x%p referenced memory at 0x%p. <i><b>The required data was not placed into memory because of an I/O error.<br />
<br />
</b></i>What's an I/O error you may ask? An I/O error is when any hardware device (hard disk, flash drive, etc) cannot perform its basic input/output actions such as reading or copying data. When this is the case with a hard disk itself, or any storage related
 media, it's due to the device PHYSICALLY failing. Do note that with hard disks, the connections can be faulty as well (i.e the SATA cables from the controller on the board to the hard disk itself).
<br />
<br />
Very rarely is this ever caused by software, and if it is, it's usually caused by things such as Intel Rapid Storage which I see you have installed. Do you have a RAID configuration set up? If not, it's useless software. However, IRST doesn't just 'uninstall',
 it's a bit complicated. See this - <a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/44074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<i><b>You noted you have an SSD, you need to be 100% sure the firmware is absolutely up to date.
</b></i><br />
<br />
If the SSD firmware is up to date via the manufacturers website:<br />
<br />
There are various ways to run Chkdsk~</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 1:</b></u><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 2:</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you'd like to get a log file that contains the chkdsk results, do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />
This will output a .txt file on your Desktop containing the results of the chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>If chkdsk turns out okay, run Seatools</b></u></span> -<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/</a><br />
<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<u><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></u><br />
<br />
If you'd like, we can also enable Driver Verifier to be sure we aren't dealing with a software issue. Given the *F4 bug check, I doubt this has anything to do with the internet whatsoever, you just may be receiving the crashes around the time of connecting
 to a network so it appears that may be the problem, but in reality it may not be related at all. We'll see soon enough!<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            i already did the firmware earlier today but i will re-do it to keep the troubleshooting clean and organised. also look at this screen shot i haven't got a clue what it means.&nbsp;<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=334CE6A169DD2E62!910&amp;authkey=!AIgCJVH4d9cyFQs&amp;v=3&amp;ithint=photo%2c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=334CE6A169DD2E62!910&amp;authkey=!AIgCJVH4d9cyFQs&amp;v=3&amp;ithint=photo%2c.jpg</a>&nbsp;also
 with regards to seatool i can't run it i installed the stand alone .NET v4 it suggested i downloaded it from the laptop and used a usb to get it onto the desktop and i installed and it still isn't running for some reason.
<div><br />
<div>also for the driver verifier should i attempt to recreated the crash/error/blue screen? also no real point backing it up i backed up my photos already and i have formated both the SSD and my mechanical (mech is storage, SSD is OS).</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way thank you for Helping me! just so you know i am very grateful! also if it turns out to be a hardware issue i have 3 years warranty on all my products i bought to build my PC is not life time warrenty for some.</div>
<div><br />
<div>i have the latest firmware update for the SSD. (samsung evo can't remember the numbers but i think 804 and its a 120GB).</div>

When does that error happen, are you trying to run a certain application?<br />

Enable verifier, yes. It will give us more info in regards to whether this is software or hardware.<br />

            All of the verifier enabled DMP's are detecting the driver GameKB.sys in violation. This is a driver in relation to SHARKOON Skiller -

<br />
Update this driver ASAP if available or uninstall these drivers and allow Windows after restarting to install the generic mouse drivers for your mouse.<br />

<p>CTRL + Shift + ESC to get to Task Manager..</p>
<p>Click on the Processes tab</p>
<p>Now Click on the CPU heading until the processes being most used are all grouped at the top</p>
<p>You should see 'System Idle Process' at the top and it should be in the 90's if not much else is happening on the computer. If it is switching with another process or another process is using more resource, make a note of what it is, and then check on the
 Internet for what the process does or is attached to..</p>
<p>If System Idle is at the top and is around 95%, you may have an issue with your hard drive.</p>
<p>How much free space is there on the drive? Ideally, you want 25% free space for your drive to operate well. If it is almost full, save files (pictures, music etc) to another media form at your earliest convenience, and external drive or burn to CD..</p>
<p>It is also possible that your hard drive is failing. Do programs take long to load? Is Windows slow starting up? Do you get errors popping up now and again, files not loading properly?</p>

<p>You wrote in your first post <em>click on icon, nothing happens;&nbsp;</em>now you say&nbsp;<em>it only opened a small square box ...&nbsp;This is exactly what I get when I try to activate Live Mail in the normal way.&nbsp;</em>So now we need to know which is accurate: a small
 box appears, or nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your small box sounds like a Windows window problem. It would be good to see a
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
screenshot</a>, because I can't actually visualize what you describe. Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conjure up the small box and click on it to ensure that it's the active window. Then execute these keystrokes carefully:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Alt-Spacebar, S, Right arrow ten times, Enter, Alt-Spacebar, S, Down arrow ten times, Enter.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any joy? If so, re-size the window to suit, then close down the program. Wait a few minutes and then launch it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, please explain what happens.</p>

            Hi Akhilesh, there really is not one way to do this . .. 
<br />
<br />Some apps and platforms, generate a thunbnail differently from others. Some use the 6th or 10th frame in the actual file as a thumbnail, some use the built in thumbnail, there is no consistency across the board with respect to this . . .

            Microsoft does not know the cause either. The best advice is to exchange. If you are in the US, go to a physical retail Microsoft Store and show they the issue and exchange there. If you are out of warranty there will be&nbsp;a charge. If outside the US, contact
 support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Don't assume your warranty has expired until you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello Soheila,<br />
<br />
<br />
To get the bottom of this issue, we would like to know more information about flickering/shaking screens you have encountered on your Surface Pro 4 by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Can you tell us if your device still on Windows 10 Anniversary Update (with update version 1607), or it's already in Windows 10 Creators Update (with update version 1703)?<br />
• When you turn on the Surface, did you notice if the Surface logo flickers/shakes as well? How about when you're on the UEFI settings?<br />
• Does it occurs immediately after you logged in to Windows, or when working on a certain task? If so, how long does flickering/shaking last?<br />
• Does your device connect to your external monitor/s via Surface docking station when this occurs?<br />
• Are you using a splitter/adapter to connect directly to an external monitor without the docking station?<br />
• Can you confirm if the device has the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-pro-4-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest firmware update</a> installed?<br />
• What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</p>
<p>• Also, can you provide a screenshot when you encountered the screen shaking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Spencer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen of your Surface Pro 4 could be shaking because of software or hardware issues. Your best option for this concern is to have someone from a physical Microsoft Store check the device. We also suggest checking your device's warranty so you can have
 it replaced if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some links that you may find useful:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not update from 1511 to 1809</h2>
                    I have tried various methods to update this laptop, but nothing works.&nbsp; Although it has always been switched on from new (Nov 2015) it has never updated the OS.&nbsp; Any ideas why, please, and why it will not update now?&nbsp; Is it time for a fresh install?

            Hi Roy, with these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Wonderful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not know that you could use the setup.exe from the ISO to start the update.&nbsp; In the past, whenever I have needed to update/re-install, I have always put the DVD or USB into the machine, then restarted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did not work this time, for what reason I do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your suggestion was spot on.&nbsp; I don't really know whether disconnecting the internet helped or not, but the update went really smooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a PC which was obviously years out of date with 1511 installed (the OS it had when I bought it!) and it seems to be running well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Strange Program Running in Windows 10</h2>
                    Ever since I started running Windows 10 I've had a strange program that seems to run in the back ground. It doesn't seem to cause any performance issues or really do anything at all. However, when I pull up the task list or show the tiles with the running
 programs it always seems to be there. Then I close it out and go about my day. It looks like a blank windows form with the title "DSD_84232." Has anyone else seen this?<br />

<h2>            MP question...</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing brotherhood online now since it came out and I still can't tell when another player has locked on to me in the Wanted game mode.</p>
<p>Anyone know how that works?</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems like a player I'm chasing/following with the lock-on system, knows that he's been locked onto and hides in a group of NPC's unitl the lock disappears. But, I just can't seem to figure out what it is that lets a player know he's been locked.

<p>Its&nbsp;the players&nbsp;behavour that gives them away, and it's logical that the player as locked on to them. So they blend to be sure of canceling the lock and then run away&nbsp;or using a skill.
<br />
<br />
Other players might however not know you are there and just blending to be more tactical or have more then one pursuer after them.
<br />
I think Wanted Mode requires 25% Skill, 25%&nbsp;Tactic's and 50% Luck.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>thanks for your reply Karthicka. I have visited the website you recommended for known issues, however the known issues are the issues that I'm having with trying to play older games and this KB3086255 update is not allowing these games to play, which is
 exactly what the article you suggested says, " that once this KB3086255 update is installed that some older programs and games may no longer run".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>also the commands that are recommended are confusing to me, it's my understanding that what I need to do is to start the service with one command when I want to run the older programs and then stop the service with another command when I'm done running the
 older programs, can you verify that this is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also there are five commands listed, is it true that I really only need the last two commands to start and stop the service ?</p>
<p>
To disable the driver's service, type the following command:
</p><pre>sc config secdrv start= disabled</pre>
<li>To set the driver's service to manual, type the following command:
<pre>sc config secdrv start= demand</pre>
</li><li>To enable the driver's service (and to set it to automatic), type the following command:
<pre>sc config secdrv start=auto</pre>
</li><li>To manually start the driver's service, type the following command:
<pre>sc start secdrv</pre>
</li><li>To manually stop the driver's service, type the following command:
<pre>sc stop secdrv</pre>
</li><li>
</li><li>
<pre>also I'm not sure where to enter these commands, do I just open command prompt and enter them there ?</pre>

            <p>MrPearson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if you can uninstall KB3086255 from windows 10, however when I upgraded to windows 10 I had the exact same issues with trying to play older games that I am having on windows 8.1 after the KB3086255 update was installed. After upgrading to windows
 10 and having those issues with my games I converted back to windows 8.1 and my games ran fine just like they always have up until the KB3086255 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would like to uninstall the KB3086255 update from my windows 8.1 computer because I have way to much time and money upwards of $1,000 in hardware to play games and I don't want some ridiculous update to prevent me from playing them. However I wonder
 if there are any risks or other future issues that may come from uninstalling this KB3086255 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to put a fix on this asap. Microsoft bragged about how windows 10 was going to be a gamers operating system yet so far more gamers have had issues trying to play there games and most have converted back to windows 8.1 or 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and thanks for your feedback, greatly appreciated</p>

<h2>            Vista Small Business-64 Bit, when Re-started, shows BSOD, takes 30 minutes for log in to show.</h2>
                    
<p>I wonder if I can get some direction on this. This is a recent occurance, roughly the last several months.</p>
<p>I typically re-boot my pc once per week. When I do so, it hangs and displays "Shutting Down", and sits for about 30 minutes.&nbsp; Then the Blue Screen of Death is displayed for a short period of time and the system then re-boots and shows the log in screen.</p>
<p>I have the following software installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norton 2010 Anti-Virus </li><li>SQL Server 2008 Developer Edition-Full installation </li><li>F5 Client Software(for work) </li><li>Citrix Client Software(for work) </li><li>FireFox </li><li>Bundled software such as MicroSoft Works </li></ul>
<p>Here is a cut/paste of the message that comes up once the re-boot is successful and displays a message indicated that Windows has recovered from an unexpected error:</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.<br />
<br />
9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see
<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable
<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC
<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.
<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See next message for my
<br />
generic driver update methods.</strong></p>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen
<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other
<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however
<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Taking it one step at a time makes it easier.<br />
<br />
Try this shortened form.</p>
<p>1. Do the check using MSCONFIG as above to see what happens and report back. (Remember to<br />
change the setting in msconfig back.)</p>
<p>2. Run SFC and CheckDisk as above to clear corruption.</p>
<p>3. Update your major drivers.<br />
<br />
Those alone might clear up the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an office in the US.</p>
<p>If we purchase a Skype number for that office in Austin from Viet Nam, is there any problems?</p>
<p>Is that ok to receive and make calls by that local number from Viet Nam or South Korea (our HQ is in South Korea)?</p>
<p>How much for the annual cost for that local number and will it be changed in the future? (I have checked the current subscription is $52.26 for 12 months, tax inclusive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<h2>            black screen after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>Original Title - </span>Alan Moore</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have just upgraded from W8.1 to W10 on a Lenovo notepad.&nbsp; All went well until the last stage of finalisation.&nbsp; My desktop screen tries to open but stalls and goes into a loop and the notepad can't open up.&nbsp; The task bar starts to appear, but no apps
 appear on it.&nbsp; My non-taskbar app shortcuts also sometimes try to appear on the desktop but then disappear.&nbsp; Whichever way things go, the desktop closes to a black screen and tries to open again - sometimes it immediately closes again, sometimes it tries for
 a few seconds before going into the loop again.&nbsp; I have managed to hit ctrl/alt/delete to get to details of disk usage etc, but can’t see any clues as to the problem (and I don’t have the skill anyway).<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, I have a defunct notepad and don’t know how to get it fixed.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Can anyone in Microsoft fix this online for me?<span>&nbsp; </span>Or should I take my notepad to the suppliers to see if they can fix it?<span>&nbsp;
</span>The notepad is only about a year old.<span>&nbsp; </span>It isn’t a brilliantly fast/powerful one, just a cheap extra machine I needed, but it’s too young to be ditched!
</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, I’m in UK and am posting this question from a Samsung PC for which I have already upgraded to W10, and that went well – though it took 3 hours – and W10 has, so far, seemed to be a great improvement over W8.1.
</span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!</span></p>
<p><span>Alan</span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Alan, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Unplug all external devices and restart the computer to check if you are able to get to the desktop screen.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The black screen issue could be related to display drivers and might get resolved by updating the display drivers. Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the mouse cursor works fine then press Ctrl + Alt + Del to bring up the Task Manager. You can also use Ctrl + Shift + Esc key to bring up the Task Manager. Once this window is open, click File and select “run new task”.
 Type “explorer.exe” and hit ok. This should bring up the Desktop screen with the taskbar.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Press “Windows key + X” and select “Device Manager”.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>From here you may update the display driver and restart the computer to check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>

<h2>            player feedback tampering</h2>
                    
<p>To whom it may concern.</p>
<p>I was given this link by xbox live chat support.</p>
<p>I recently started playing virus mode in Forza 5 and believe my reputation has been affected by one or two persons unhappy with the fact I would not let&nbsp;them take advantage of the glitch in the virus mode that allows certain cars to exit the playing arena
 so they can not be infected allowing them to win the game.&nbsp;I have become quite good at stopping these people. My reputation has always been that of good until just recently I received a message from xbox live stating that my reputation has dropped. I checked
 it and it&nbsp;had dropped from good to needs work and not the higher needs work level but the lower one of the two in&nbsp;the space of an hour or two. Im sure&nbsp;either gamer tag (<strong>[Mod removed]</strong>) or (<strong>[Mod removed]</strong>) have filed complaints
 against me in retaliation for me not letting them cheat and take advantage of the ability of some cars to escape the playing area of the map. But not only have they filed complaints against me but have asked their friends to do the same which would be easy
 do to my ranking on some circuit leaderboards resulting in my reputation being greatly affected and dropping two levels in the space of an hour or two. I do not believe this to be coincidence. Somewhere in the code of conduct section I read that the new system
 would not allow this manipulation of ones reputation to happen but yet exactly the opposite has occurred. I would like this manipulation of my reputation to be corrected and the real offenders to be dealt with accordingly.&nbsp;My gamer tag is XPR CRIMINEL and
 my email is <strong>[Mod removed]</strong>. I would also appreciate any information on the investigation and any action taken but&nbsp;most of importantly I would like my reputation to be corrected for my own pride and image and less likely to be matched with these
 monkeys in the future. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>

<p>I personally think the rep system on the One is just as much of a joke as the 360 system and pay very little attention to it. I get numerous threats of reports from people daily on this and just laugh in their faces.</p>

<p>A few years back microsoft banned a special needs kid and loads of others around the world for something they never done, microsoft would not admit their mistake until the kids parents managed to get the story on national tv news in the UK, after that m$
 did a 180 and unbanned everyone who they banned unfairly.</p>

<p>Something similar happened to me I came back from vacation and my rep was down to needs work after six months of no problems. What there doing is they come into a lobby and wreck and ram everybody until racing is impossible then as soon as you get frustrated
 and try to drive around or through them they say Xbox record that then they report you and make it look like your the aggressor. And I try to go to a new lobby but they always show up in a race or two and start with the making fun of my southern accent and
 cussing like salors. If somebody would just play a hour or two a week from Microsoft they could see and hear who the bad guys are. I'm a very fair player if bumped I don't freak out, and if I accidently bump someone I apologize and explain it was an accident
 and usually pull over and let them have there spot back so I don't know how to be any nicer. I'm skydiver959 and I too was a victim of these trolls. I will admit that 90% of the time I hold my tongue and don't retaliate but before I left for vacation I got
 bad news and did retaliate but I'm only human and like any good red blooded American when push to far into a corner I will fight back and that was a rare occurrence for me I usually get along great with 99% of Xbox live players.
