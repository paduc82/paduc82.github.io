<h2>            &#36;5 Gift Card redeemed and didn&#39;t receive money</h2>
                    <p>On November 6th I received a code on xbox from Xbox and I redeemed it on November 8th. I just had a chat with support to figure it out and I was told to make a post here. I never got the $5 and when support told me to look at my purchase history. It said the card was refunded and so I didn't get the money. The person in the chat said that they saw it on my account that I redeemed it. Is there any way I can get the $5 since I didn't spend it and it's not in my balance either.</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1ilMY.img" /></figure><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1ibnS.img" /></figure>

            <p>Unfortunately after the promotional credit was redeemed on your account, the only team that will be able to further assist with billing would be our chat support team. If there were issues redeeming the code, that would be an area we can help out in, however if the credit was already applied to your account and had been removed, our chat team would be the best route to take as that would fall into a billing issue. Our chat team would&nbsp;look into your account&nbsp;to figure out if that credit was spent or expired.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please keep us posted after reaching out to our chat team once again so we can make sure this is sorted properly. </p>

<h2>            80090304 error Unable to Download 360 Profile</h2>
                    <p>It's really weird. When I load up a BC game, it says Signed in as Citizen Four. Then when I try to play it tells me to sign in. When I go to sign in, it says I have 0 profiles installed. I then try to download my profile and it gets to the part where it says getting game data and freezes with the error message "Sorry, Xbox Live profiles can't be downloaded right now. Try again later. I tried&nbsp;to delete the profile as it may be corrupted. When I do that on either console One or 360, there are no profiles to delete. I tried clearing the cache multiple times on the 360 itself. Then tried again to download the profile. Still Nothing.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that someone had given their console DMZ Host and it had fixed the issue, however mine was already given DMZ host. I tried disabling it/re-enabling it, resetting the modem/router. Powering off the console, unplugging it, every time while re-trying to download my profile with the same issue. Nothing has worked. There are a few people on reddit having the same issue as well with no solution. One of the guys over there said he had been on the phone with MS support. They claim it is a newly appearing issue and are looking into it...&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue on MS end. And it sounds like it could take a while to sort out..&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have also tried changing my password, removing credit card info and re-adding it. etc... Nothing has worked.</p>

<h2>            Desktop and Taskbar not working properly</h2>
                    I was working on my laptop last night, and when I finished, I closed it and let it sleep overnight, as I knew I would be resuming what I was doing first thing in the morning. When I opened it this morning, I signed in as normal, and instead of opening
 to the desktop as it normally does, it has opened on the start menu and the start menu won't close to show the desktop. I have restarted it and it has had no effect. Programs open fine, but do not show up on the taskbar, and the previously pinned apps aren't
 showing up on the taskbar either. I would really appreciate if anyone knew how to fix this.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Ashtyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your laptop is in tablet mode. For us to verify this, let's look into the settings and switch to desktop mode. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> and click <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Tablet mode</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Tablet mode</em>, set the <strong>When I sign in</strong> option to
<strong>Use desktop mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, check if the start menu is closed and if the programs you have opened appear in the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes so we can further assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Yes I tried but it seems that alternate configuration tab ip address can only be used at the time of non availability of DHCP address. But I need a DHCP address and a static address to be configured at the same time. But&nbsp;this option is available in xp.
 Can you please suggest me with a solution for this.

            It is quite wrong that a network interface can not use multiple IP addresses when DHCP is enabled, but this limitation still available in Windows 7.

<p>I'm having pretty much the same problem. As far as I can tell this is a Windows<em>limitation</em> and not an error or anything anybody can fix easily. I think it's ridiculous that Windows can't manage profiles for different WiFi access points, each with
 their own DHCP or Static IP settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your problem this is a solution I just found on another windows 7 forum, I'm not sure how well it works, so apologies in advance if this turns out to be a dud, but here's how it goes;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>Enter the <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong></p>
<p>Click on <strong>Change adapter settings</strong> on the left-hand side</p>
<p>Right click and select <strong>Properties</strong> on the network adapter in question</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong> and then on <strong>
Properties</strong></p>
<p>You'll see two tabs <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Alternate Configuration</strong></p>
<p>Leave the <strong>General </strong>tab settings on the default auto for the DHCP login</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Alternate</strong> <strong>Configuration </strong>tab to set up your Static IP settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I read, this will get your system to attempt login via the DHCP server initially, when this fails, it'll revert to the Alternate Configuration settings which has the Static IP settings. So this will supposedly be a little slower to connect to the
 Static IP'd connection, but should work. Good Luck.</p>

<p>That works with Windows 7. &nbsp;I too am curious, as I have a few computers in my environment that would benefit from this. &nbsp;Works a charm in XP, but if you follow these steps in 7 it doesn't work.</p>

<p>Kzin you're on the right track.&nbsp; I luv that petri article, it has helped me many times before this for my XP machines.&nbsp; Like everyone here I've been searching for a solution to this issue.</p>
<p>For windows 7 I have been able to set multiple static IP addresses for one NIC, not DHCP and Static IPs simultaneously:<br />
<br />
1. Right click Network and click Open Network and Sharing Center<br />
2. Click Change adapter settings in the left column<br />
3. Right click on the adapter you want to configure and click Properties.<br />
4. Select Internet Protocol Version 4(TCP/IPv4)<br />
5. Click on Properties.<br />
6. Set static IP and DNS<br />
7. Click Advanced<br />
8. Add the additional IP addresses.<br />
9. Close all open Properties with OK and IPs are active<br />
<br />
Enjoy</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to do this with DHCP and Static IPs let us know!</p>

<p>Wow, and it gets worse. This was possible in XP but not in Windows 7? I guess one of the reasons this still isn't getting an official fix from MS is probably because not that many people need to do this (?) But it's shocking that I've tried this with a couple
 of iOS devices, and a Blackberry so far, and they handle this stuff fine. <em>Mobile</em> devices!</p>
<p>Windows needs something similar to what iOS does for this kind of thing, save a separate profile for each wireless network that has been accessed. If nothing is edited, the profile would simply store the password, and let the DHCP server assign a dynamic
 IP address. If a static IP, DNS etc. has been specified store that under that access point's profile. I'm no network specialist, but this sounds like something that would work.</p>

            <p>This means you need to install the original version of Windows that came with your computer if you can't afford Windows 7. Otherwise, you will have to save up or ask a family friend or family member to gift you license.</p>
<p>If you know a college student, you could ask them to purchase a discounted license for you.</p>

<p>In Device Manager, remove all references to this port (delete the entries) so it's as if the port didn't even exist.</p>
<p>Then go to Start / Control Panel / Add Hardware and have it search for new hardware devices.&nbsp; Hopefully it will pick up the Port and ask for drivers.&nbsp; If it doesn't, select the option to find the device yourself and select USB Serial Port (or whatever option
 it provides that comes the closest).&nbsp; Follow the procedures.&nbsp; Try installing the drivers&nbsp;now that Device Manager is clean and hopefully they will now install and you'll be good to go.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>We would like to verify if the files were originally .WMV format or have you done a conversion method and changed the files format into .WMV. In addition, please provide us your Movie Maker version. To view the version, open your Movie Maker, click
<strong>Alt+F </strong>then <strong>U </strong>on your keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the files were in .WMV format as its original format, please specify the origin of the file. It is also possible that the file has a DRM (Digital Rights Manager). You can check the link below for more information about DRM:</p>

            <p>I helped an user about 2-3 weeks ago with the same issue; it was their video drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a suggestion, if not already, you should visit WINDOWS UPDATE and see if there are any updates to your video card. Video driver updates for the Windows operating system could be listed as 'optional' updates, you may have to select them manually to update.
 This option might help you. It's not an absolute, but based on other experiences and responses from this forum, it has helped others resolve their issues. Here are some common video card providers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>additionally, you may want to get all your system updates and check your DirectX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Movie Maker uses several components; one of which is DirectX. You need to make sure that you're using the latest version of DirectX when working with Windows Live Movie Maker. You can also use this link to install/reinstall DirectX if you're
 having issues.</p>

    <title>xbox live purchase and content usage limited issue happening multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shandrilshessai  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox live purchase and content usage limited issue happening multiple times every day</h2>
                    Attempting to play Sword Art Online fatal bullet, I have purchased the 3 DLC's. When XBOX live has issues the game cant be played because the DLC's need Xbox live to allow me to play them. The issues are happening at least once every day (often around
 6am AEDST for the first one). The issues are all on the Xbox live end, my connection is fine. Is there any way to play the DLC without Xbox live?

            I know of the active service alert, it seems to happen rather often, my question is if there is some way SAO Fatal bullet DLC can be played when xbox live has its issues since the content usage restriction means I cant play the game at all due to buying
 the 3 DLC's.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Pattiicakes,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
As per the description it looks like you are facing an issue while installing Windows
<span>Kernel-Mode Driver Framework update.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can reply to these questions in order to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you facing any issue while login to the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to install other Windows Update?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter:
<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:
<br />
<br />
Check the Windows Update service status.<br />
<br />
a. Click Start, in the start search box, type Services and press Enter.<br />
b. Scroll down and find the Windows Installer.&nbsp; Double-click “Windows Update” in the Services list.<br />
c. On the General tab, make sure the service is started under “Service status”.<br />
d. If the service is not running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2: <br />
<br />
Unregister and re-register the Windows Update <br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Unregister:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, right-click
<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Run&nbsp;as administrator</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Allow</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<span>&nbsp;
</span>wuauserv /UNREGISTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Re-register:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong>, right-click
<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Run&nbsp;as administrator</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Allow</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<span>&nbsp;
</span>wuauserv /REGSERVER </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, try your installation again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run System File Checker toll (SFC) scan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows 7:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable the security software and perform a clean boot and then try to install the windows update manually
 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 1:<br />
<br />
Disable security software: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note: If you have to temporarily disable security software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot</span><span> will check if any third party application
 is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows 7: </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps from Step 3: to reset computer as usual.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 3:<br />
<br />
Download and install the update manually and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Image files are hidden even when the &#34;hidden&#34; attribute is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sugarbearblue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Image files are hidden even when the &#34;hidden&#34; attribute is not checked.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After editing and saving image files (using two different editing programs),&nbsp;my .jpg files do not show up in my Pictures folder.&nbsp; I can find the files in Search and see that the attribute "hidden" is NOT checked.&nbsp; Windows is fully updated.&nbsp; This is my 2nd
 laptop with Windows 7, 64-bit OS.&nbsp; The first one hid my Lotus files.&nbsp; Now my new one hides my image files.&nbsp; I've seen this problem in several forums but most have the problem that windows is automatically changing the Hidden attribute.&nbsp; My problem is that
 they are hidden WITHOUT the Hidden attribute being checked.&nbsp; This is a huge problem for someone who works with a high volume of images but I can't seem to find an answer.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen this problem and found the fix?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"Although you usually can't see a hidden file, it's an ordinary file in all other respects. You can choose whether a file is
 hidden or visible by changing its properties. Here's how to do this: </span><span><br />
<span>1. Right-click a file <b>icon</b> and then click <b>Properties</b>.</span><br />
<span>2. Next to <b>Attributes</b>, select the <b>Hidden check box</b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 1: Display Hidden Files and Folders</b></span><span><br />
<b>Step 1:</b><span> <b>Here's how to display hidden files and folders.</b></span></span><span><br />
<span>1. Open <b>Folder Options</b> by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>Appearance and Personalization</b>, and then clicking
<b>Folder Options.</b> </span><br />
<span>2. Click the <b>View</b> tab.</span><br />
<span>3. Under <b>Advanced settings</b>, click <b>Show hidden files</b>,
<b>folders, and drives,</b> and then click <b>OK</b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b>Step 2:</b><span>
<b>To show or hide the file names for pictures and videos</b></span><br />
<span>1. Open a <b>folder or library</b> containing <b>pictures or video files</b>.</span><br />
<span>2. Right-click an empty space, point to <b>View</b>, and click <b>
Hide file names</b>. (If this option has a check box next to it, the file names are already hidden from view.)"</span></span></p>

You still need 64-bit Consumer Windows in order to support more than 4GB of memory.<br />

                    <p>I get this error when try to sign in to Visual Studio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not that big of a deal since my product key has already been applied since it was a &nbsp;MSDN subscription download. However, when I try to sign in to Azure, there is NO cursor on the username box. I tried to paste the username, that pasted the text
 but clicking the button just throws an error, although it is the valid email. I've a feeling both these issues are related and hence posting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I'm using VS 2013 Update 5 (a brand new install, I also repaired it so hopefully nothing related to installation is causing this.)</p>

<p>2. During video playback though it seems to happen more when I'm fiddling with Geforce Experience which makes me think it's related to the Nvidia drivers. I seemed to last two weeks from the start of April without one and it's started happening again now.</p>
<p>3. no</p>
<p>4. 142760 is what it says in BlueScreenView in the "Caused by Address" column.</p>
<p>5. Yes, it's up to date. Build 1511. (OS Build 10586.218)</p>

    <title>Can pin new apps to Win 10 Taskbar, but not to Start Menu or All - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seldomseen1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can pin new apps to Win 10 Taskbar, but not to Start Menu or All Programs</h2>
                    <p>I use freeware (Registax6 &amp; AutoStakkert) and paid apps (PixInsight) for my astronomy imaging.&nbsp; Windows 10 shows me an option to pin these to my start menu, but when I accept that option, the Start Menu doesn't change.&nbsp; I just installed a new upgrade to
 PixInsight today but it doesn't show up on the Start Menu or in All Programs.&nbsp; But the old version of PixInsight was working in Win10 until I had to uninstall it.&nbsp; If I go to the Programs folder, I'm able to pin Pixinsight to the task bar also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an online conversation with a Microsoft Tech yesterday.&nbsp; He said my installation was corrupt, and I should Reset the machine.&nbsp; He said that a Reset would not erase my apps, but when I open the Reset Dialog it give me only the option to erase my apps
 or erase my apps and files.&nbsp; I'd rather go back to Win7 than do that.&nbsp; Is Reset safe for apps?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>I understand your concern and I'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset will delete your apps. It is unsafe for apps unless you want to reinstall it again.&nbsp; I recommend you not to reset. You will lose your apps. In both the option on the reset dialog box, apps and settings will be removed. &nbsp;You can either keep your personal
 files or remove them</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask few questions about this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2) Is this the only app that is not showing up on the start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also pin any other apps to the start menu and check if you are able to see it in the start menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pin the&nbsp;apps&nbsp;to start menu, restart the computer and check if it helps . If you have a lot of apps in the start menu, scroll down and try finding it . Check if this might help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this post helps. Do get back to us with for further queries and we'll be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, Joythar K, and thanks for the warning about Reset.&nbsp; I won't use it.&nbsp; I haven't made any changes to Windows 10 since the install which I did on July 31.&nbsp; I haven't been able to pin shortcuts to the Start menu since that time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I did notice one strange thing.&nbsp; PixInsight was in All Apps when I updated to Windows 10, but I had to uninstall it in order to install a new version.&nbsp; I&nbsp; installed a new PixInsight, it worked when I made a shortcut from the Programs folder but
 it didn't show up on All Apps.&nbsp; I uninstalled the new version and reinstalled the earlier version it also ran from a shortcut I had to create, but didn't show up in all apps.&nbsp; I re-installed the new PixInsight and it still doesn't show up in All Apps,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But around that time AutoStakkert showed up in my Most Used menu, after which I was able to pin it to Start.
</p>
<p>Does Windows 10 have an upper limit to the number of Apps allowed in the All Apps list?</p>
<p>
I've tried running the following in Powershell as Administrator, and neither of them report errors:
</p><p>SFC/ scannow</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">After running these two I still can't pin to the Start Menu</span></p>
<p>Also, my first installation of Windows 10 froze with a cyan window screen that showed a single dot below it instead of swirling dots.&nbsp; I rebooted with a Windows 7 system repair disk, and the Windows 10 installer reverted to Windows 7.&nbsp; My second installation
 of Windows 10 appeared to go correctly, although I did get several messages stating "This is taking longer than expected."</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you tested the issue on a different PC? Please test the issue on a different issue and check the issue.</p>
<p>2. Do you face the same issue when you re-pair the headset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not appears to be a audio device issue but&nbsp;the Bluetooth&nbsp;connection issue. Windows is reconnecting the headset in low quality audio mode (profile).
</p>
<p>If possible you may also try connecting another Blueooth headset to this PC and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may try these steps to set "Bluetooth audio render" and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key +X </strong>key together&nbsp;and choose <strong>Control Panel.</strong></p>
<p>b. Click on <strong>Sound </strong>icon.</p>
<p>c. Under <strong>Playback </strong>tab, set "Bluetooth audio renderer" as the default playback device.</p>
<p>Sometimes low quality seems to occur when the headphones use the "bluetooth hands-free audio" device.</p>
<p>You can right click and "test" the device, if you hear the test noise that is the device your headphones are set to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I wouldn't risk it, there are air vents on top of the S model console, blocking those could cause heating issues with your console and even the heat blowing out of the console could damage your monitor. Older consoles if I'm not mistaken do not have air
 vents on the top but I still wouldn't risk it. It probably would hold the weight though in answer to your question.</p>

<p>Hey Lekgolo137,</p>
<p>As everyone here says not a good idea to use your 360 as a tv stand. As second option you may want to consider the PGE (personal gaming environment) from Gaems.</p>

    <title>Glitch in Halo 4 Mission 6 Reclaimer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mad cowboy va  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glitch in Halo 4 Mission 6 Reclaimer</h2>
                    
<p>So I'm playing through TMMC currently on Halo 4.&nbsp; In mission 6 Reclaimer after taking out the two big guns in the sky I get back onboard the Big 4 Wheeler with the Big Cannon. As we go merrily along I notice the Big 4 Wheeler is floating in sky. No ground
 below. I can see land, But not under me or the Big 4 Wheeler. After listening to cortana's pity speech a voice say's the Big 4 Wheeler can go no farther and I'm on my own. At that point the Big 4 Wheeler Vanishes. All I can see is the electricity surrounding
 the Big Cannon. I try to walk, but cant get far. I see 2 Ammo dumps notices but don't see them. &nbsp;I don't fall, I'm just stuck floating in air a long way from land. &nbsp;I have reloaded the save point to no avail. Still the same. I have shut down the XBOX One and
 restarted. Restarted Master Chief in Halo 4 and still had the problem. Anyone else had this problem? Anyone have any Ideas? I really want to finish Halo 4 so I can move onto Reach and Guardians which I have installed and ready to play. I'm &nbsp;playing in order
 so I don't miss anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks All.&nbsp; Cowboynva.</p>

            You can't make an Outlook backup with Outlook open.&nbsp; Close Outlook, make a copy of your existing .PST file and copy it to your external hard drive.&nbsp; This backs up EVERYTHING, Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, email, etc.&nbsp; You should NEVER use the .PST inport/export
 functions from within Outlook, they are broken and have been for a long time, they LOSE data, and they very often corrupt the Outlook profile in use.&nbsp; If you ever have a problem, simply reconnect the copy:<br />

            <blockquote>This problem is caused by an MS Outlook Add In which prevents Outlook from closing down. The add in that is usually responsible for cauysing this problem is the one that search/indexing tool. The cure is very simple:
<div><br />
<div>(i) With Outlook open go to Tools Menu</div>
<div>(ii)&nbsp;<span> </span>Click on 'Trust Centre'</div>
<div>(iii)<span> </span>On the left hand pane, choose Add-Inns and then near the bottom of the window you'll see a button that will let you manage your COM Add-Ins.</div>
<div>(iv)<span> </span>Ensure the drop down box is set to 'COM Add-Ins' and then click GO</div>
<div>(v)<span> </span>Highlight Windows 'Search Email Indexer' and then click 'Remove'.</div>
<div>(vi)<span> </span>Click OK and then close Outlook.</div>
<div>(vii)<span> </span>Re-open Outlook and run the backup. (The program will tell you that Outlook needs to close first before backing up). All should then be OK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If any problem contact me at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</div>

number (v)<span> </span>Highlight Windows 'Search Email Indexer' and then click 'Remove'.&nbsp; is not on the list.<br />
