<h2>            Bugcheck 0x00000109</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I just recently encountered a BSOD, which I have rarely ever encountered on this 2+ year-old machine.&nbsp; I ran a Memtest86+ on it not too long ago without any errors in the current module, so I am fairly certain it is not a RAM issue.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

    <title>Can I transfer an Xbox account &#40;connected to a Gmail alias&#41; to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the cig inside  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I transfer an Xbox account &#40;connected to a Gmail alias&#41; to an existing Hotmail account &#40;that is linked to a different Xbox account&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I understand this is an extremely vague description but here is the story/issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have had an Xbox account for about a decade now, and it was created with a Gmail&nbsp;account when I was a kid. I still have access&nbsp;to the email and the Xbox&nbsp;account so there is no issue there. A few years later I created my first Hotmail account, and in
 that apparently an account for every other Microsoft product in existence. This included a new Xbox account that was linked to that email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I came to own more Mircosoft products, whenever&nbsp;I signed in with my current Hotmail/Microsoft email, it would link the Xbox&nbsp;account it created to my devices as well. Which was cool, but&nbsp;it wasn't the account I originally&nbsp;made or still use, so I would
 have to add my Gmail&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;account after each time it signed me out. In short, I want to know a few things:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I delete/unregister the Xbox account with a Hotmail&nbsp;address without losing my&nbsp;inbox or other accounts/products now associated with that email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I tried to add a new alias for the Hotmail Xbox account, which I assumed would break its ties with the email address. Then (after removing the account from primary&nbsp;status) tried to add my Hotmail address as an alias&nbsp;for the current Xbox account&nbsp;I use,
 which was met with the&nbsp;error "Part of reserved domain". Is this because it was still technically registered with the&nbsp;old account (as removing it completely&nbsp;told me it would delete my inbox)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If I cut my losses and made an entirely new Microsoft&nbsp;email address, can I effortlessly transfer the Xbox&nbsp;account to that or will it give me another domain issue?</p>
<p />

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these issues with the accounts. I just want to clarify a few things, Were you still going to be using the account with the Gmail address, Or are you now strictly using the Hotmail account in which you purchased all your
 content through? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You would not be able to merge the two accounts but you are always able to update the Alias on the accounts. You can always follow the steps on the following support article for
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12407/microsoft-account-how-to-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Managing aliases for your Microsoft account</a>. If you follow the article it should answer all your questions regarding the account aliases.

    <title>Teredo Tunneling Pseudo Interface error reoccurs after registry fix - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digiti124  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo Tunneling Pseudo Interface error reoccurs after registry fix Win 7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>My fix for Windows 7 32 bit works:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>"I enabled all three drivers in Device Manager,then opened regedit found HKEY_LOCAL-MACHINE\SYSTEM\CURRENTCONTROLSET\SERVICES\TCPIP6\PARAMETERS ...in the right pane right click Disabled Components select modify or edit. Toggle radio button from hex to decimal
 change DWORD value to 0.. Reboot. The problem is now fixed with no more explanation points and those drivers are now hidden as they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone else."</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However on my newer Windows 7 64bit computer this fix only holds for one reboot then reverts to code 10 error and exclamation point in Device Manager for the Teredo Tunneling Pseudo Interface only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always thought a fix in the registry was permanent. Please advise Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry for the inconvenience that caused to you.</p>
<p>The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by the Device Drivers is not recognized by Device Manager. In our case, the Device Driver for the Teredo Tunneling Pseudo Interface may be
 corrupted.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the registry editing is not resolving the issue. Then you can the below methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the major cause for this is that network adapter is not currently supporting this feature. You may download the latest driver / update the driver for your network adapter or chipset, and then try to uninstall and reinstall this component.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to below link for the common resolution for the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/943104?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/943104?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make sure that you download the correct and the most up-to-date version of the driver, visit the Motherboard manufacturer’s website wherein all the drivers will be listed. Select the appropriate driver for the device that is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may uninstall the existing driver from device manager before installing the new one.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Step1</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Device Manager </strong>by clicking the<strong> Start button.</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Control Panel </strong>and then click on <strong>System and Maintenance.</strong></p>
<p>3. Then click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>. </p>
<p>4. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>5. Locate <strong>Teredo Tunneling Pseudo Interface </strong>and right click on it and select
<strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<p>6. Go to <strong>Driver tab </strong>and click on <strong>Uninstall</strong> button to uninstall the driver associated with the device.</p>
<p>Once the Uninstall completes, restart your computer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Device Manager </strong>and right click on the <strong>Computer name
</strong>in the device manager window.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Scan for hardware changes </strong>and check if the issue got resolved.</p>

<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/EasyBCD.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>. Install it. Click Add new entry in the left pane. Choose the type from the drop down menu (Windows Xp). Type the name of the entry (Windows XP Home or Pro whichever you have). Make sure there is a check mark in the box to auto detect correct drive.
 Click Add Entry. That's it. It should now be fixed.<br />

<br />I would suggest you reset windows 10, choosing the delete files option, this will remove any junk left by the previous owner.
<br />
<br />settings -&gt; update &amp; security -&gt; recovery 
<br />under Reset this pc
<br />choose the 'remove everything' option
<br />
<br />when finished, set it up with your own account.

            Hi P
<br />
<br />The best option when you get a used PC is to reset Windows 10, but since you do not want to loose the Applications and data, that is not an option . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Family and other People 
<br />
<br />Click 'Add someone else to this PC' 
<br />
<br />Follow the prompts to create a new account 
<br />
<br />Close the settings app 
<br />
<br />Log out of that user account 
<br />
<br />Log into your new account 
<br />
<br />Click the Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />In the resulting dialog, select the old account(s) and click 'Remove' 
<br />
<br />That's It, your new Admin Account will replace the old account(s)

    <title>Having issues with the touchpad on my acer 5532 series laptop auto - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hugos63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having issues with the touchpad on my acer 5532 series laptop auto clicking.</h2>
                    The issue I am having is that whenever I use the touchpad and move the cursor over ba button, window, tab, etc. it automatically selects/presses the button, window, etc. I have touchpad tapping disabled. I have run all windows updates and install the the
 lastest touchpad drivers from synaptics. I have checked through every windows setting I could locate and every thing seems ok. It just seems as though the touchpad is constantly left clicking on everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mouse info is...<br />
Synaptics TouchPad V7.0 on PS/2 Port<br />
Driver Version 14.0.3.0<br />
Driver date 8/27/2009<br />
<br />
Computer info is...<br />
Acer Aspire 5532<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
64-bit OS<br />
AMD Athlon TF-20 1.6Ghz<br />
3 Gig RAM<br />
<br />
Hopefully this is a software bug that can be fixed and not a hardware issue. Using a regular mouse is hassle.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
Hugh

<p><span>Hi Hugos63,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to fix your issue, please provide additional information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Was there any recent changes/updates/drivers installed on your computer?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Do you receive any error message?</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, I would suggest you
</span><span>disable the touchpad to verify if it’s creating a conflict with the mouse or if the sensitivity of the touch pad is high.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to temporarily disable the touchpad from Device manager and verify if the mouse works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to access device manager and disable touch pad.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click on Start.</span>
</li><li>
<span>In the Start Search Box type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Expand Mice and pointing device.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Right click on Touch pad and Disable it.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Restart the computer and verify if it works fine.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Incase if you find the mouse is working fine, you need to contact computer manufacturer on this issue to verify
 if it’s the sensitivity or the drivers causing the issue and get their assistance to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior can also happen if the computer is infected with Virus.&nbsp; I would recommend you to run an online
 virus scan. </span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and verify if your computer is infected with virus and remove the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://safety.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://safety.live.com</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Hope this helps resolve your issue!</span></p>

<p>In spite of all the problems that W7 users had with that printer it seems that Epson is claiming that it is compatible with W8.1</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>so ask them for help.&nbsp; One possibility is that Microsoft aren't aware of these new (<span>12/12/12) drivers.&nbsp; Then your attempt to use them might be replaced by whatever it thinks is approved before you could actually test them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Whenever you change to a new version of Windows, you need to install drivers
</span><span>(software that provides the interface between the hardware and Windows)
</span><span style="font-style: italic">for printers, scanners, video cards, etc., that have been written for that new version of Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And also note that you need different drivers for a 32-bit version of Windows and a 64-bit version.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">It's up to the manufacturer of the hardware to write and make available for download those drivers. Especially if your hardware is older, it may<span>&nbsp;
</span>well be that the manufacturer has decided that it's not worth his time and effort to develop drivers for hardware that he is no longer selling.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Check with the manufacturer or on their web site to see if a driver exists. If it doesn't (and it probably doesn't, for such an old prointer), you're out of luck. Also
 check their web sites in other countries, if there are any; sometimes you can find the driver you need that way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">So in the future, before you do such an upgrade, be sure that you've done the appropriate research to find out what drivers don't exist, and therefore what hardware you
 will have to replace if you upgrade.</span></p>

    <title>Windows media player auto rewinding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockywkord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows media player auto rewinding</h2>
                    <p>So after moving to windows 10 I have watched numerous movies through the windows player but about halfway through them (sometimes more sometimes less) it rewinds back to the beginning and starts the movie all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how smart the media player is but it seems to happen recently just as it gets to an action packed part or a critical point in the story line. Don't know if anyone else has this problem and did have a look through the threads I could find to
 see if there was anyone else with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Paid movie rental not showing as paid&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently paid for two movie rentals on Xbox 360, they were both showing in my active download, afterwards they both were showing in My movies, but were both asking me to rent again as if I had already watched them, but still showing that I had 14 days to watch till they expired. I have both the 360 and Xbox 1, they are both showing the same thing under the Movie &amp; TV app?</p>

            Hi Ralph
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Usually this is a broken Store app tile and you normally have to clear the Start Menu tile cache to fix it. 
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />2. Copy the following text into Notepad:
<br />
<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im shellexperiencehost.exe
<br />
<br />timeout /t 3 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />del %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\* /q
<br />
<br />timeout /t 2 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />start explorer
<br />
<br />@echo on
<br />
<br />3. Click File and Save.
<br />
<br />4. Choose a location to save the file.  Enter a File name of ClearTileCache.bat and select Save as type of All files (*.*).  Click Save.
<br />
<br />5. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location that you chose to save the file to.  Double-click ClearTileCache.bat to run the file.

    <title>Critical Process Died &#40;possible solution&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc felix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical Process Died &#40;possible solution&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This might be a solution for some people. I bought my ASUS laptop from Microsoft. After contacting them about the critical process died error message about 4 times and doing all the told me, I would still have this problem. &nbsp;I am currently a college student
 and already have files from class saved on this computer including my papers. I was afraid one day it would crash and I would have the greatest headache in history. &nbsp;The last time I contacted them about the issue one of them recommend I re-install windows
 10, after so many failed attempts to fix it. I put that Idea on hold for a week and one day I found out that my computer was upgraded to windows 10 it didn't come with it out the box even though my laptop is new. Soooo.... I came to the conclusion that maybe
 that is what is causing the issues because I still have the old system files on the laptop from what I saw. Perhaps the files from the old system was interfering with the windows 10 that was installed on my laptop. so this is what I did. *this also worked
 for my problem with updating the computer. stupid thing thinks battery saver was on when it's not. Just make sure to update everything before you decide to put battery saver on as a precaution*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible Solution: your going to have to reset your computer (Recommend keeping your files) oh and make sure you laptop is fully charged. Any programs you had will be deleted, but your files/documents will be kept.</p>
<p>1.Go to your settings option. (hit message icon on lower right of the screen)</p>
<p>2.Go to update security</p>
<p>3.Go to recover (backup your stuff if you need to. I didn't have a usb, but my files weren't deleted.)</p>
<p>4.Hit the option that says "get started" under reset my PC</p>
<p>5.Choose to keep your personal files and following the prompts to restart it. make your you keep windows 10 and don't hit the downgrade prompt which well take you back to your previous windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should fix the issue, its been two and I haven't received any critical process died error. usually it happened 1 or every 2 days I used my laptop. I also updated my computer with everything. today is the first day I activated battery saver. hopefully
 it keeps updating when I turn it off.</p>

            Hi Carly,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            I did a hard shut down but when i turned it back on to do another it said preparing automatic repair. So it didn't let me do another. I let the automatic repair do its thing but it just turned grey. What do I do now? Is this laptop gone for good?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let me congratulate you on getting a new laptop!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If what I have understood is right, you are having two email addresses and would like to view both the emails without having to logout and log-in to the second account each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using the mail app to view the emails, then you can follow the steps below to add a second email account to the mail app. Once you have added your second email account, you can view the emails for both accounts without having to logout each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Login to the mail app with the first email account</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows Key + C and click on settings</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Now, select accounts and click on “Add an account” and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 not recognized.&nbsp; Then Unknown device not working properly.&nbsp; then another message saying windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (code 43)</p>

<p>The keyboard and mouse is a Logitech wireless that came with our zt computer and is 2 yrs and 1 month old, and the warranty has expired just last month.&nbsp;

            Hello  and thank you for contacting us. My name is Angelo and I am a Independent Adviser on here.
<br />
<br />If you don't have the access key that was created when you locked your drive then I'm sorry but you no longer can retrieve that data from the SSD.
<br />
<br />Bitlocker is made to protect the files in case someone would steal your computer so it is very highly secure.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
<br />Angelo

<br />If Bitlocker was activated by you or someone else and you don't have the recovery key then I'm sorry but the files are lost.
<br />
<br />If you didn't activate Bitlocker why do you think the SSD is locked by it?
<br />
<br />Awaiting your reply

            Hello ن٢يف 
<br />
<br />Thank you for replying.
<br />
<br />Right, lets try something, I assume you tried connecting the drive to another computer and you had no access to it.
<br />
<br />Try Linux Mint <a href="http://mirrors.evowise.com/linuxmint/stable/19.1/linuxmint-19.1-cinnamon-64bit.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mirrors.evowise.com/linuxmint/stable/19....</a>
<br />
<br />Burn it to a USB drive or a DVD and boot from it with the SSD connected to the computer, when Linux Mint asks to start Live or to install select Live.
<br />
<br />Try accessing your SSD from Linux Mint.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />

<br />
<br />Try it, Linux is very good at reading drives that have problems but if your drive really is encrypted then it will not help. Try it anyway if you have a spare USB stick or DVD it's not going to cost you anything except some of your time and you will gain some more knowledge by doing so.

<br />Like I said, if it is encrypted it will not but like you said you never activated Bitlocker so there could be a different problem with your SSD where Linux could help.

<p>So my power supply Red dotted today after making a really funky noise which sounded like a fan grinding against a wall. i've tried everything turning it off unplugging all the seperate cords and plugging them back in, but it just
 goes back to red dot after about 5-10 minutes of being on. am i gonna have to get a new&nbsp;power supply? (for the slim's btw i have the halo reach model.) i've already checked all over for one, gamestop (they only sell old model supply's) microsoft AND here...
 any suggestions?!</p>

Bitlocker is an volume encryption program. So basically you will have to format the drive. I do not have original software to encrypt individual files and folders.

</p><p>Of course there are options, but you will need to use a 3rd party application like IObit Protected Folder. You can read more about this application

 I would recommend.</p>
