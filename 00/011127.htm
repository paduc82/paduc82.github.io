<h2>            Hello - I would like to know how to cascade documents, or introduce tabs as on an internet browser.</h2>
                    Old answers say I should right-click on an empty part of the task bar, or click on arrange all, but that doesn't work. I just want to see the documents (or the tops of them) all at once, so some sort of tab function, as on a browser, would be the best
 of all. As it is, I am frantically searching between four documents all the time. I feel I am missing something obvious, as other people must need this on a daily basis.&nbsp;

            Your question is quite confusing as you have posted in outlook category. So are you trying to create tabs for outlook or files?

            <p>Sorry - I just wanted to post about microsoft word but couldn't see the option. I want to be able to see my documents (word documents) on the screen of my mac. Currently the way I find them is by going to "open recent" in word, but that doesn't work if I've
 made a new document. Then I just can't find it without hunting about on my desktop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd like the files to cascade so I can see their titles, or have tabs, as on a browser. I don't mean the kind of tabs that are indentations - I mean the protuberances on the tops of pages or documents that allow you to see what they are.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 does not print some embedded objects</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have a recurring problem trying to print embedded graphs for my dissertation in Word 2013. They are created in GraphPad prism and are embedded. They are clearly visible on the screen, and when printed to Xerox printer or to Office XPS printer, they disappear
 - there is just an empty space. Images (photographs) remain present. A similar problem occurs when I am trying to print images that were saved as EMF by another program and embedded into Word by me as drag and drop. They instead come out completely black but
 are clearly visible on the screen.</p>
<p>If I save the document as PDF within Word, then they are present, but the fonts within the graphs are changed from Arial to a smaller sans serif font. Also, the images are dramatically reduced in resolution and quality.</p>
<p>I won't be able to actually print my dissertation with this issue. I would gratefully appreciate any help with this problem. Even being able to print/save to PDF in high quality would be an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>Igor</p>

            <p>Hi Igor,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are dragging the image from another application to Word, the resolution of the image will not be supported. Office application supports a resolution of 600dpi.</p>
<p>You may copy that image from the required program to MS Paint, and use the save as option to save the image in Jpg format. Now embed the image into Word document and check if the print appears fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Abid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upon reviewing your case, we can see here that you are using an add-in for Outlook. Since you are using an add-in that is manufactured by Veritas, we suggest that you get in touch with them for further assistance regarding this matter. Since you installed
 the update for Outlook, we also suggest that you check if there's any available update for the add-ins. This might be the reason why the vault is not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to message us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

I've seen this, just can't recall how it's done. I've got a number of PPTXs open and I can only see one at a time, I want to be able to quickly switch to one and then back to another. In Windows I could Command+TAB, but in MAC it shows me app, not pitches.
 There is something like the expose (?) view (I'm new to MAC) for PPT pitches you have open or do I always have to double tap on the P icon in the launchpad? Thanks!

<h2>            Heading creation Word 2010 not appearing in navigation pane&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Office 2010&nbsp; windows seven</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently installed office 2010. I am working on a thesis which follows the MLA format. This means that the document contains no heading and simple paragraph breaks. It was previously in 2007 word format.</p>
<p>As I wish to make use of the navigation feature which would help greatly with the 100 or so pages I have, I have attempted to apply heading styles to the documents in key areas of my thesis. The first problem is that when I apply a heading style it does
 not appear in the navigation panel. In other words it does not seem to "take." The text will change according to the heading style but it does not appear in the navigation panel.</p>
<p>The second part relates to the fact that for the sake of the MLA standard, at least in my university, there should be no change to style. In other words, I want these headings purely to make my navigation through the document easier. This makes the entire
 editing process simpler. I understand that I can modify the style of the "fake heading" I am creating, but even when the formatting takes it tends to create a paragraph break automatically which I don't want.</p>
<p>Any ideas on why the apply headings are not appearing in the navigation panel?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;p.s. on further experimentation I have discovered that if I create line breaks between a sentence, and the rest of the body of the paragraph... I can apply a heading style,<strong>but</strong> this is not what I want. It would be impractical to break up
 every paragraph in this manner&nbsp;to achieve navigation only to have to go and delete them all at the end. Surely word can deal with the creation of a "pseudo-heading" which does not have paragraph breaks between it and the rest of the document?</p>

<p>There is no way to get the navigation pane to do what you're asking under your constraints. It simply doesn't have the ability to differentiate parts of a single paragraph that way.</p>
<p>What you can do is to insert complete paragraphs, formatted with one of the built-in heading styles, to act as temporary tags while you're writing the thesis. When you're doing the final editing before submitting the thesis, make another copy of the document
 file. In that copy, open the Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+S), click the down arrow of the style used for the tags, click the Select All x Instances item on the menu, and then press the Delete key. That will remove all the tags.</p>

            The 6300 is an S40 phone so only a Nokia Care Point will be able to reset it.<br />
<br />
In order to remove the branding, the phone has to be SIM-unlocked and the network operator has to give you writen authorization.

<br />
Yeah. Reinstalling thru the Nokia Software Updater would also be an option if you're just planning to cleanup the phone. But this cannot be used to repair a corrupted firmware.<br />

<h2>            OneDrive Sync issues in WIndows 10</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: OneDrive Problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive has yet to work on my Surface 3 Pro with Windows 10 Preview. OneDrive in the file system is not synced with my OneDrive on my other Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 systems and doesn't show any of the files.&nbsp; I&nbsp;tried to uninstall it in order to re-install
 it but apparently you can't do that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the OneDrive App fails to install (error code &nbsp;80240024).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been hoping that this is a system problem that would be fixed in subsequent releases.&nbsp; But now as we approach RTM I'm getting worried.&nbsp; I see many problems entered about OneDrive but none quite like this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we have a system-wide problem with OneDrive as we go into RTM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Charlie</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't see a Settings in a start menu. So I assume by going to Settings, you meant through the Charms pull-out. I went there and on to Accounts but could not find a Verify option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other Settings?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for the delayed response. I suggest you to check if the following steps helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Fully close OneDrive. If it's in the system tray, right click on it and then press exit.</span></li><li><span>Go into your user folder and delete the empty OneDrive folder. </span></li><li><span>Go to C:\Users\"Your User Name"\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneDrive (AppData is a hidden folder. Make sure the option to view hidden folders is turned on.)</span></li><li><span>Click on OneDrive.exe. It will tell you that it cannot find OneDrive folder on your PC and that it needs to reconfigure OneDrive.</span></li><li><span>You will then be asked to create a new OneDrive folder and you will then get the option to sync the files that are located on the OneDrive server.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the results so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>I have to wonder if we're working with the same system. As my heading says, I'm talking about Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8/10 we have the "Taskbar" not the system tray as you say. When you right click on OneDrive in the Taskbar,&nbsp;rhe only selection &nbsp;you get is "OneDrive" and "Unpin this program from the taskbar",</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first response also didn't seem to fit this system.</p>

            If you can start it, type *#7370# on the standby screen.<br />
<br />
No other way, except having a Nokia service/repair center install (flash) the latest phone software (firmware).<br />

<h2>            audio settings grayed out ppt 2010 vista home</h2>
                    wanted to hide audio icon from slide. sound downloaded from ppt clip art (audio) came with ppt. Effects option is ok but the audio settings there is grayed out. Need it to hide the icon. I have read extensively online about this problem. Didn't find any
 answers.

            If you set your sound to play automatically, you can just drag the sound icon off the slide and the sound (audio) will still play.

Nope. Nothing I do works. Automatic didn't work either. I tried dragging off the slide, no luck. I tried saving the work at different extensions. Nothing.<br />

            You should be able to access "hide during show" from the ribbon. (the grey icon in animations is a bug I think)<br />

            The 'audio settings' is now available. The hide in the ribbon was always available, it just didn't work. I guess it was the 'play automatic' that did the trick. Great.<br />

            That option must be grayed out unless you choose the Automatically event -- no sense in hiding something that has to be clicked to played. If it is hidden, you cannot click it.

Yes I understand that but for me it is greyed in audio settings in the animation pane even if the trigger is a

            hi, John,<br />
that was happening to me too. I just do 'as told' (lol) and hope for the fix. I have given up on understanding 'why'&nbsp; things happen at ms. I can described the step Geetash made me take:<br />
Go to the ribbon, on start click 'automatic'. I dragged the icon ON TOP of the sound belt out of the slide. It did work. I may be out of my mind but it did. The grey disappeared from the 'audio settings'. I noticed I have to do this with other clips too.<br />
<br />
Sorry if you knew this. Just sharing.<br />

            <p>According to one thread in&nbsp;Apple's discussion forums, the correct settings are:</p>
<p>p01-imap.mail.me.com&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; incoming<br />
p01-smtp.mail.me.com&nbsp; &gt; outgoing<br />
check "Remember password" and "SPA"<br />
On the Advanced tab, select SSL for the incoming server, which should make the port 993.&nbsp; For the outgoing server, use port 587 and&nbsp;choose "Auto" for the encryption.&nbsp; On the Outgoing Server tab, check the box for logging into the incomng server first.</p>
<p>In another thread, the settings given are:</p>
<p>incoming server:imap.mail.me.com&nbsp; incoming server:993 &amp; SSL<br />
outgoing server smtp:p99-smtp.mail.me.com outgoing server:587 &amp; TLS</p>
<p>Alternatively, just download iCloud for Windows and allow it to configure Outlook automatically.&nbsp;

<h2>            Sharepoint Online Check in Multiple Documents</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have uploaded about 17000 files to SharePoint online via a mapped drive into document libraries, each with many folders.</p>
<p>It appears that the files are checked out, How do I check in all Files at once in all the folders without going through each individual folder?</p>
<p>I have turned off checkin/checkout in the document library but still my colleagues cannot see the files unless i check them in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jamie</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jamie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my search, I didn’t find some articles about using PowerShell or script to multiple checking in all the files. You can try using SharePoint designer for multiple
 checking in:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Install SharePoint Designer 2013.</span></li><li><span>File&gt;Sites&gt;Open Site. You can also navigate to the library, click Return to classic SharePoint&gt;setting gear&gt;Ribbon:On&gt;LIBRARY tab&gt;Edit Library.</span></li><li><span>In SharePoint Designer 2013, click All files in the left panel&gt;choose the library (choose it, don’t access it)&gt;click Check In&gt;OK.</span></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7dd45a50-083c-4c7f-9e90-e589f5fb5ae8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7dd45a50-083c-4c7f-9e90-e589f5fb5ae8" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned above, you may exceed the list view threshold limit. You can
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-large-lists-and-libraries-in-Office-365-B4038448-EC0E-49B7-B853-679D3D8FB784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mange the library to avoid exceeding this limit</a>. Otherwise, it may cause some unexpected issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, as you mentioned the page refreshes in Content and Structure page, you may change to another browser to check the outcome. It may be caused by there are too many
 checked out files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Tim</span></p>

    <title>Incorrect caption numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottmckeel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect caption numbering</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Word 2007 and having a problem with caption numbering&nbsp;that I have seen other&nbsp;people in other boards have, but I have not seen a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My caption (figures) are based on heading 2. So I am getting this problem: </p>
<p>(I'm skipping ahead a couple chapters because that is where my problem is)</p>
<p>3&nbsp;HEADING 1<br />
3.1 HEADING 2<br />
Figure 3.1-1 - This is OK<br />
3.2 HEADING 2<br />
Figure 3.2-1 - This is OK<br />
Figure 3.2-2 - This is OK<br />
4&nbsp;HEADING 1<br />
Figure 3.2-1 - I want this to be 4.0-1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand since my captions are based on heading 2, that I am having a problem when I just have heading 1, but I cannot find/think of a good solution. I have seen people say to create a new custom caption (like FigureX and then later remove the X), but
 I'm worried it won't then show up in my list of figures. Any ideas?</p>

<p>4.1 HEADING 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and format it as hidden so that it does not appear.&nbsp; The only problem is that if you do have a second level heading under the Heading 1 after the caption, that heading will be numbered 4.2.&nbsp; Then if you change the numbering value so that heading becomes
 4.1, then the prior caption will revert to Figure 3.2-1</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, I have a section 4.1 under where this figure is. Like you said, it would look funny having the first section under Chapter 4 being 4.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way I can tell word to make this one caption 4-1 (base it on heading 1) and keep all the rest based on heading 2?</p>

            Not by using the Caption facility.&nbsp; You could however construct "Captions" by using cross-references.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Windows 10 technical Preview. I understand your concern and will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the status if Windows is activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + W</strong>.&nbsp; </li><li>Type <strong>Activation</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If Windows is not activated, then<strong> </strong>I would suggest you to follow the steps to Activate Windows and check the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start the Product Activation Wizard, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>At the Start screen, swipe in from the right side, or hover your mouse in the upper-right corner of the screen to display the charms menu.</li><li>Tap or click the Settings charm.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>Change PC Settings</strong>.</li><li>If your PC is not activated, PC Settings will provide instructions that are customized to your activation error. If telephone support can provide help for your error, tap or click the appropriate link, which may resemble one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Activate.</li><li>Activate by phone.</li><li>Contact customer support for help.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>If the Windows is activated, then the possible cause could be corruptions in Lock Screen directories under
<strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData</strong> are corrupt in some fashion. Deleting the
<strong>SystemData</strong> folder might fix the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Do get back to us if the issue persists or if you have more queries regarding Windows.
</p>
        </p>

            Make sure you didn't go into registry to alter your login screen to circle pic by changing value to 1. If you did, reset it back to 0 for default square pic at login to change your picture. If you want to go back in to tweak registry again it will save
 your new pic.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to clarify few things before we proceed with the troubleshooting:</p>
<p>How are you trying to repair Office 2013 from Control Panel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to repair, you need to select the installed Office suite, click change and then choose the option for repair.</p>
<p>You may refer to the screenshots and steps in the following article which talks about the error and check if it helps:</p>

<h2>            0RANGE N95 CUSTOMERS - FIRMWARE UPDATE - CALL ORANGE NOW</h2>
                    Dear all.<br />
<br />
As we all know the Orange N95 is crippled with faults -<br />
<br />
Mine has the "phone restarts in a call and when you call back the mic dosent work" issue...<br />
<br />
Phone orange today and their diagnostics now recognise there is a fault with the firmware<br />
<br />
They guy i spoke to said that Nokia have asked orange to take some details from customers regarding their faults with the phone...<br />
<br />
they basicly ask a few bits about the memory and firmware and your problems ...<br />
<br />
they are doing this so they can create a profile for a better firmware !<br />
<br />
so i would STRONGLY recomoned that everyone call's orange and reports their faults ... you wont get your handset changed but you will speed up the firmware update by giving nokia the details they need quicker !<br />
<br />
please post your customer experiences on here ....<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />

            I have a nokia N95 contracted with orange network, my firmware vesion is 11.0.026 i am having the following problems with my phone<br />
1) Switches off randomly and tries to restart but freazes so i have to take the battery out to restart myself.<br />
2) A black screen appears when i slide the phone to go to the media section.<br />
3) Camera takes a long time to load up and when taking a picture it doesnt save as it has frozen.<br />
4) When adding a recipent to send a text message it quits off the text and i have to start all over again<br />
5)The battery life is very poor even when applications havn't been running<br />
The supervisor at Orange called Tracey (61035) has informed me that all your nokia N95 have this known software problem, therefore she is refusing to replace my N95 with a new one without the software issue. Her advise for me was to purchase a cheep £15 pay
 as you go phone and use my contracted sim card in that phone.<br />
Can you verify that if i was to get a new n95 replacement it would suffur the same software issues, i find this very hard to believe that Orange is selling the n95 still for £89.00 with them knowing there is an issue. I also payed £89.00 in september 2007.<br />
I do belive that the Nokia N95 is a excellent phone which satisfys all my needs but these issues Nokia a bad reputation this phone I have is not fit for purpose at this present state but i am locked into an 18 months contract with orange till march 09.

            If you have hundreds of messages and there's a few you still wish to keep then use the Messages app in PC Suite.

    <title>Cannot save the Word files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erdildeniz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot save the Word files</h2>
                    <p>I use Office 2007 and Windows 8.1 operating system.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, i used my USB Flash driver in school's PC and back in home i inserted it to my PC to. I don't know but maybe my computer gained a virus from the school but not for sure.</p>
<p>When i make a word document, in the beginning (in the first 10-15 minutes) i can save it without a problem. But after that, when i try to save it to the location, it cannot save and the saving window opens again,again. But it cannot save the file. But there
 is the file that i saved in the first minutes. I try to change the document name but still it cannot save and give an error as "Document error occured". When i try to save it with "save as" it saves it to the other location with 0 kb and there's nothing in
 the document. In the folders (that i try to save) there is a different kind of file with TMP folder. And the files are looking alike a system file. Please, help me. I believe it is a virus but how can i clear it or is this really a virus? &nbsp;</p>

            In your original post, you wrote, "When i make a word document, in the beginning (in the first 10-15 minutes) i can save it without a problem. But after that, when i try to save it to the location, it cannot save and the saving window opens again,again."
 Does that mean you are resaving the document to a new location? Which folder are you using? The Documents folder on your machine? Something else?

            <p>I use documents, desktop, a new folder that i created, but none of them works. In the first minutes i can save it to anywhere i want but after that it cannot save. The saving window opens and opens again everytime i click to save button. But it does not
 save. In the folder, there IS the file that i saved in the first minutes (for ex. 2029 kb file) but when i try to save it, the word sees the first file but cannot save it onto that one. I try to use the same and different names with the first file but nothing
 helps. And when i try to save the file to a different location than the first file, it saves it with 0 kb and the file is empty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use pictures and photos in my word file, so the file size is bigger than usual. Like the example i gave, 2029 kb is the middleway of my work. In the end, it should be like 5000 kb but it won't save it. The file is there but it cannot see, despite i can
 see the first file in the saving window. Gosh, really i can't find a solution.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are you sure that the problem is only with Word files? In that case, see what happens if you temporarily run Word in Safe mode. Create a document and see if&nbsp;you are able to save normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to start Word in Safe mode: Exit the program if it is currently running. Hold the Ctrl key and restart Word; when asked about Safe mode, click yes.</p>
