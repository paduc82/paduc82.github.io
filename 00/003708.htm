<h2>            WM6 w&#47; ActiveSync 4.5 not Syncing Outlook Ditribution Lists</h2>
                    I have the PPC 6800 with WM^ and ActiveSync 4.5. I have created several distribution lists in outlook contacts for mass mailings and those distro's are not Syncing to my device. I did not have this problem with WM5. Any guidance would be most appreciated.

<p>You are correct Linley.&nbsp; It is a feature that a lot of folks would like to have ... we can only hope that it might appear in the next iteration of WM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd party apps are the only choice now ... and could be expensive depending on your needs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Microsoft Exchange Hosting featuring Outlook is a consideration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Part of what it provides is Outlook Web Access which provides access to e-mail, contacts, appointments, and tasks from any PC. You'll have access to spell check, personalized signatures, task lists, reminders, e-mail filtering, personal addresses and
<strong>distribution lists</strong>, letting you work efficiently anywhere you have an Internet connection.</p>

<h2>            Excel for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have some problems with Excel software and also with all Microsoft programs package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mainly, I have problems with Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I have problems with Solver. When I turn on Solver there turns on new sheet with conditionals for solver (?), and I have know idea how to fix that. It's very annoying because when you work with a few sheets you have to miss that, and overall I don't
 like it. Another problem with Solver is that when I turn on Solver in full screen, then I turn off solver and full screen turn on solver again, turn off and turn on Solver in full screen mode then, solver appears in on desktop or in other sheet which is others
 than that sheet in which I wanted too turn on Solver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I have problems with using pulling formulas through vectors. I mean when I want to pull down the formula through excel, indicator doesn't stop when depending cells stops but indicator goes further and formula counts anything. Other problem with
 that is then I want to pull over the formula, I can't because indicator doesn't want to go further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, There is problem with counting formulas, because from time to time inspire of seeing formula in upper strip, in cell is anything and &nbsp;I have to click enter a few times to make excel to count that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, when I use big sheets charts are still reloading when I change a position and I come back to that chart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finnally, excel and other softwares works slowly. For instance, in word tabs load very slowly. Apart from that, initial loading excel or word is very slow (opening process).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used potential solvings such as: turn on classic mode, reload Office on computer and if we talk about things connected with charts I was changing that options in settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for all answers and new potential solvings of that problems ! :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Radoslaw_S,<br />
<br />
We'll report the issue to the related team. Summarizing the symptom here:<br />
<br />
<br />
In Excel for Mac 2016, the first time you launch Solver add-in, it will launch a new worksheet with conditionals.<br />
If you open Excel in full screen mode and turn on Solver, the worksheet window will be minimized, instead, the solver pane appears on the desktop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mac OS, Excel 2016 for Mac<br />
<br />
<br />
We have the reproduce steps and will send to the related team for investigation. We will post updates here once we receive more information. You can subscribe to this thread to receive the latest updates.
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Jim

<p>Have you tried sending any emails from other email accounts? If you have tried to do that and no emails are delivered, you may have to check each subfolder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I made my own mistake--not an issue in Outlook. My account has several aliases and each alias has its own folder (not the same inbox). The alias (say, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) that I have the issue with (not really an issue) is not the primary alias. Emails
 sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** arrive in its own folder named ABC@live, and I placed this folder ABC@live in another folder, say, OnlineShop (ABC@live is a subfolder). New emails sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** are delivered in the subfolder ABC@live under the folder OnlineShop
 and do not embolden the folder OnlineShop, so I wrongly assumed my account cannot receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I forward emails to this account to another account. The rules for the forwarding account probably does not work in the account that emails are forwarded to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<h3> ron1321  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB2744842 Setup encountered an error&#58;  The  update.ver file is not correct</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original title: KB2744842</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed KB2744842, the critical update for IE8 (Win XP-SP3). The log file created on my hard drive for the installation has
<strong><span>20</span></strong> lines in a row near the top all saying the same thing (emphasis added):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>KB2744842 Setup encountered an error:&nbsp; <span>The&nbsp; update.ver file is not correct</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are immediately followed by:</p>
<p><strong>AnalyzeForBranching: Getting file version for file c:\windows\$hf_mig$\kb2744842-ie8\sp3qfe\ieuinit.inf
<span>failed with error 0x00000002</span></strong></p>
<span>failed with error 0x00000002</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And down&nbsp;near the bottom of the log there are 2 lines in a row saying:</p>
<p><strong>In Function SetVolatileFlag, line 11741, RegOpenKeyEx<span> failed with error 0x2</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But after I installed the update, the Microsoft site showed this update as being successfully installed, and Belarc Advisor lists it as installed and locked.</p>
<p>Anybody got any ideas what these errors mean and how to tell if the update is actually installed correctly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>I don't think that applies. I have <strong>not</strong> been offered this update a second time.
</p>
<p>It was offered only once. I installed it and then saw all the error messages in the log file that was created during the installation.
</p>
<p>Just don't know if it installed correctly with all those errors, even though the Microsoft update site marked it "successful".</p>

<h2>            Old profile picture attached to sent emails</h2>
                    Like many other people in this community in the past, I've spent a significant amount of time trying to figure out why my Microsoft Outlook desktop application is attaching a very old image of me to outgoing communications. Unfortunately, I'm nowhere near
 discovering the answer. I have updated my profile pic in the obvious My Account &gt; Edit Profile area, but that hasn't solved the problem. I have no idea
<em>where</em> Outlook is pulling this image from ‚Äì and I can't even find it anywhere in my account settings (across various services, including Skype) to attempt to replace or remove it. Please help.

<p>Dear LordAlukard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the swift reply! In following your suggestions, I believe I stumbled on the problem quite by chance. While looking for my account information through Office Outlook, I clicked on the 'People' tab at the bottom left of the window. Four separate
 contacts appeared, one of which included the outdated picture and information relating to a previous job/employer. I deleted this and two of the remaining three contacts ‚Äì leaving just one, which identifies as my active email address / account (and couldn't
 be deleted). Having done this, I immediately noticed that the suspect image had vanished, and been replaced by a generic 'initials' graphic. Remaining in the People section, I double-clicked on this graphic and it gave me the option to add from file and resize
 a profile picture. I've done so, and now all outgoing mail is updated and working as it should! Thanks again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

                    <p>I have some concerns using 10162 incase anyone has experience the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>Odd behaviour by explorer observed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Close down IE11 as normal and after a few minutes it reopened again on its own accord, like it never closed down properly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had previously set IE11 as default browser.&nbsp; Maybe that had some effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had also experienced some fluttering of&nbsp;url to 'blank page' and back again in IE11 in 10162 when using HP site&nbsp;to reply to a community post.</p>
<p>

<p>HKLM Software Microsoft Windows NT Current version image file execution options and similarly in HKLM Software&nbsp; WOW6432 node Microsoft Windows NT Current version image file execution options

<p>
</p><p>I thought this was down to the build being a test build, hence not a genuine release but is this normal</p>

    <title>Is the forced upgrade version of Skype any better for the feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;grt1&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the forced upgrade version of Skype any better for the feedback Microsoft has received for the last year or more&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It remains totally unclear whether Microsoft has made any effort to address the many deficiencies users found in Skype for Windows 10. For well over a year, users have raised alarms over a variety of problems that drove many to switch back to the "classic"
 version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We now are faced with the impending shutdown of all Classic Skype installations, forcing users to upgrade to the version that had so many complaints. If the Skype upgrade was now to a version taking into account the feedback users have given over the past
 year ‚Äî Microsoft has made no apparent attempt to make that known. It seems that, while they provided a board on which users could list their problems and complaints, they either didn't bother reading it, or didn't think it worth improving the product to address
 the issues that drove so many of us back to the classic version of Skype.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I, like others, are now looking about for alternatives given that MS seems not to respect the efforts of its once-loyal customers to identify the issues found in Skype for Windows 10.</p>

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>Thanks for your reply, Andre. I'm nearly tempted to be encouraged, but your message seems to contradict the fact that those of us currently using the classic version are regularly seeing warnings that our dependable versions will no longer work come next
 month. That leaves us with the expectation that we will have no option but to upgrade to a version that ‚Äî if no better than when we originally tried it before returning to Skype classic ‚Äî will once again fall short of our expectations and needs. If the Skype
 development team has been incorporating changes to address user's issues, this is something they do not seem to be making clear enough.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that Microsoft has now re-considered their plan to disable Skype classic for all remaining users in September 2018? The top of this very page still has a link to a screen advising, "<em>As part of our plans to modernise
</em>(sic) <em>Skype, we will be discontinuing Skype 7 (Skype classic) in the near future</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I follow more links taking me to the Skype Blog, as of right now it clearly states, "<em>We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018.</em>" (<a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can appreciate the challenge to maintain versions for different platforms. But that should make it all the more imperative that the newer product successfully maintains all the strengths of the earlier version before building newer features upon it. If
 the "newer" version fails to meet that initial expectation, it's not yet ready to stand alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears you're providing us with a link to download Skype classic even though it will, assuming the Skype Blog is correct, only work for another 15 days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Despite your advice to the contrary, here we are on August 29 and the official Skype blog continues to say clearly that classic Skype will no longer function as of September 1st.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When starting classic Skype the prompt to update to Skype 8 has now started appearing with an insistent red notice (replacing the earlier Skype-blue prompt.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain why they believe "the deadline was pushed back past September 1st to an undetermined date of "soon"" when every indication is that you are mistaken?</p>

<p>Some Skype Classic users were so upset about the impending shutdown, they even started<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/microsoft-microsoft-keep-the-desktop-version-of-skype-alive-for-professional-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a

<p>Julie, Thank you (in advance) for the link to the Skype executable files for Skype 7 (aka Skype Classic).</p>
<p><span>When starting classic Skype the prompt to update to Skype 8 has now started appearing with an insistent red notice (replacing the earlier Skype-blue prompt.) Therefore on today Friday, 30 August, because
 of the red notice prompt from Skype</span><span>&nbsp;admin&nbsp;</span><span>to update to Skype 8 version, I have upgraded from Skype 7 (aka Skype Classic) to Skype 8.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; Skype 8 lacks several
 of the facilities offered by Skype 7.</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to hearing from you.</span></p>

<p>As of today, this is no longer an option and classic Skype users are being forced to upgrade to Skype 8. Declining the upgrade exits out of the app and you are not allowed to connect until you perform the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I'll be upgrading for the purpose of notifying my contacts that I'll be moving to another platform. Skype 8 is terrible. I feel like Microsoft didn't want to support it so they're just going to trash it until people stop using it and they don't
 have to.&nbsp; I completely feel they are killing the product on purpose so they can discontinue it slowly as opposed to just killing it quickly while millions are still using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, mission accomplished, Microsoft.&nbsp; I will no longer be using your terrible, terrible product.

<p>Skype 8 is a terrible product indeed, and now Skype 7 is forced to shutdown if we do not agree to upgrade, I'm using Skype for years and most of my business contacts are using it as well....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel this is unacceptable to force users to upgrade to a product that is still missing a lot of previous features and that is way slower than the previous version (try searching in history...), but I do not see any viable alternative to communicate with
 existing contacts, very frustrating.</p>
<p>

<p>MS has simply decided to ignore the many, many complaints about the removal of Classic Skype and has now removed the option to postpone the 'upgrade' - what a misnomer that is - making change to 8 unavoidable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame MS shame - your customer service and unwillingness to respond to users' comments is deplorable.</p>

    <title>Snap is inefficient in Tablet Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianl1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap is inefficient in Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>I sent up a report in feedback regarding this, could I get someone to expound upon how we are to effectively use Snap by touch screen in Windows 10? From what I've been able to discover this far, this is a grand step back from the quick snap and swap features
 we were provided with on Windows 8! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the Surface Pro 2, primarily in Tablet Mode, and as mentioned, find it much more difficult to use Snap functionality than what I've been able to with Windows 8.</p>

    <title>Displaying non-printing characters results in garbage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bj&#246;rnisebaert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Displaying non-printing characters results in garbage</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the last update I installed (I'm now on version 1710, build 8625.2127) I get garbage in some documents whenever I show the non-printing characters:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e41327a-5da8-4277-b13b-97600f71cf1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e41327a-5da8-4277-b13b-97600f71cf1a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough:</p>
<p>- this doesn't happen with all documents, but I really cannot figure out what causes this to happen</p>
<p>- whenever I hide the non-printing characters and then show them again, I get garbage again, but it looks different each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea about the cause. All I know is that it happens since the last update. I have the problem both on my desktop and laptop (both on Windows 10, Fall Creators Update installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated - thanks!</p>

<p>@Kristine:</p>
<p>- It also happens in safe mode.</p>
<p>- As far as I can see, the problem isn't related to specific fonts.</p>
<p>- It only seems to happen in documents with the heading as on the screenshot. (I didn't make the heading, the school wants us to use it, so I have no choice there.)</p>
<p>- I don't get any error messages.</p>
<p>- I didn't change anyting else on my computer apart from installing the Office update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Doug: I'll send you a copy in a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough, it doesn't always happen:</p>

I changed it above for you.&nbsp; Also you can do that by the way, just edit your message and you can change the category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, to use multi-valued fields you have to have the field's data type set to such as it will not work with other datatypes.&nbsp;

            Nope, can't be anything but a Multi-Valued field datatype.&nbsp; Otherwise, just build it the old fashioned way using an extra table and a subform.

            not sure of best way to do this anyway
<div><br />
<div>Have it set up so far that after the Item<br />
<div><br />
<div>When the user selects and Item # on the form- given components-from the combo box(based off a query - with criteria in the item field based on what is selected on the form)are available to be selected based on the item selected and they can-or should be
 able to select Many of the items - also would like to calculate a total price of the many components that they select.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When use the Mulit-valued field - can you explain how I can get the Price of the components they select?? and get the total</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or thinking a little more - does it make sense to use a subfrom where the available components based on the item selected - show up and add a field for the subform that is a yes/no field for Select This Item-</div>
<div>and then total only the selected items</div>
<div>Seems like a pretty typical situation - many components that make up an item-(selecting some of the items)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure of best way to do this???</div>
<div>thanks&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I did goof up a little.&nbsp; There is no Multi-value field datatype (somehow I had that in my head wrong as I don't use them currently but have messed around with them a bit).&nbsp; It can be any field type that allows you to set a lookup.&nbsp; You then select the ALLOW
 MULTIPLE VALUES to YES.&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; But Calculated field datdatypes, OLE datatypes, attachment types, and hyperlink types can't be used as multi-select as defined like this.&nbsp; That doesn't mean you can't add more than one attachment to an attachment
 field, because you can but it isn't a select.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for getting a total of the components, I do think another table and subform would be better for you.&nbsp; I'll have to get back to you later as I need to get to bed.</p>

<h2>            Help with HTC Titan X310e</h2>
                    <p>Just got my HTC Titan last week when my nephew decided to ditch his phone for a WP 8 phone. I just completed factory resetting the phone and just put in a new SIM card. Here are what I have noticed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am having problems signing up in the email+accounts option when I try to input my google account to sinc my contacts.</p>
<p>2. I cannot seem to get my PC to recognize the phone when physically connected via USB cable. Already downloaded the Zune program which is supposed to work with the WP 7.5 Mango OS. I would really like to transfer files and pics to and from my PC.</p>
<p>3. After downloading FaceBook, I can't seem to get it work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All the downloading is being done via Wi-Fi running 3Mbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

    <title>How to get a sum of duration after filtered&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> essmithsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get a sum of duration after filtered&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Project Pro 2013:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I have a filter setup to show me all Overdue tasks. &nbsp;From here, I'd like to know two things:</p>
<p>1. How many (quantity) overdue tasks do I have?</p>
<p>2. How much work (as in, duration in days) do I have that is overdue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to avoid having a custom column in the Project, instead, I want to display the two pieces of information in a Custom Report. I can't figure it out.</p>

            <p>You haven't said how you define "Overdue" or how you are determining whether a task is "Overdue" or not.</p>
<p>However, assuming that it is based on a built in field or a custom field, you may have a field which has the value of either "Overdue" or "Not Overdue", in which case you are better off grouping rather than filtering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a count of the items in a group, use a spare number field, Number1, put in "1" as the formula and then check roll up to the sum for summaries and group headings, and you will get the count when you apply the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a count of duration days of overdue tasks, then you could use a custom duration field Duration1 with a formula = Duration and roll up the sum, and you will get the count when you apply the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to make a custom report, you will need a custom table, custom filter and custom group to go with it, and some use of custom fields will be necessary as well.</p>

            <p>I'm afraid a filter will not get you what you need.&nbsp; Filters don't summarize values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get what you need in a custom report by creating a task table.&nbsp; I'd show all subtasks.&nbsp; Add the Name, Duration, Start, Finish, and Work fields to the table. Apply a group by Status.&nbsp; You'll see the Group summary lines summary the duration and work.&nbsp;
 Then apply the Late Tasks filter to show just those tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this gets you close to what you need.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A quick question before we proceed.</p>
<p>Do you get any specific error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to add-ins enabled in Publisher which is causing this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer to the following article provided by Microsoft, ‚Äú<strong><span>Why do I get a "stopped working"

            <p>I have the exact same problem. Windows 10 here. I have no add-ins installed, every update has been applied, and I am current on everything. I can work in Publisher for a minute or two before it suddenly crashes. Nothing seems to trigger when it happens.
 I can even open it and go do something else, and it will still crash. I can open it in safe mode and it will behave the same way. All my other Office programs seem to work fine. Very frustrating because I have a project I'm trying to work on and haven't been

<p>Same problem with Office 2016, Win10, but resolved!&nbsp; I installed OffCAT (search Microsoft pages for OffCAT - Office Configuration Analyser Tool) and open Publisher.&nbsp; Before it crashes, run the OffCat utility which shows as a Menu Item above the Ribbon.&nbsp;
 Read the OffCAT report - Configuration Details - Application Event Logs.</p>
<p>These crash logs should list the offending program/application.&nbsp; In my case it was Nahimic which is an audio utility preloaded with my MSI laptop.&nbsp; MSI advised me to uninstall Nahimic as it was known to cause problems, which I did.&nbsp; But I could have tried
 un-clicking the "load-on-startup" box.&nbsp; Why an audio utility should interfere with a graphics application such as Publisher is just another mystery in this irrational world.</p>

            I didn't replace Nahimic.&nbsp; The Realtek sound system is perfectly adequate for my needs (being a part deaf grumpy old man!)&nbsp; Let me know if just stopping it from loading at start-up works or not - if it does I might consider re-installing Nahimic in case

    <title>Excel Date Formatting Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Date Formatting Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey MS Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run into an issue with date formatting. I have exported information from an internet source to a ".csv" file and then executed "Save As" to a ".xlsx" file. The data which was exported from the internet source appears like shown below, in Column "B".</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EXAMPLE DATA</span></p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td><span><strong>B</strong></span></td>
<td style="text-align: center"><span><strong>C</strong> (formula in column "D")</span></td>
<td><span><strong>D </strong>(result)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><strong>2</strong></span></td>
<td><span>11-08-15</span></td>
<td><span>=B2</span></td>
<td><span>11-Aug-2015</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><strong>3</strong></span></td>
<td><span>11/26/2015</span></td>
<td><span>=B3</span></td>
<td><span>11/26/2015 </span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span><strong>4</strong></span></td>
<td><span>11/18/2015</span></td>
<td><span>=TEXT(LEFT(B4,2) &amp; "-" &amp; MID(B4,4,2) &amp; "-" &amp; MID(B4,9,2),"00-000-00")
</span></td>
<td><span>11-18-15</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>the above table shows some attempts, but are not in reference to the following attempts. The following are separate attempts to format the cells in the manner of "dd-mmm-yyyy"</li><li>Column C is formatted as TEXT</li><li>Column B is Formatted as GENERAL</li><li>Column D if Formatted as DATE as "dd-mmm-yyyy"</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SOME OTHER ATTEMPTS MADE</span></p>
<p>First I&nbsp;tried formatting all the cells in column B to the date format "dd-mmm-yyyy" using Format Cells &gt; Date &gt; "dd-mmm-yyy", but when I do this, the dates with hyphens (like in&nbsp;cell B2)&nbsp;will format correctly and the dates with slashes (like in cell B3)
 will remain the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I used the ISTEXT formula and found that the cells with slashes (like cell B3) are in fact text, so I tried to substitute the "/" for the "-" and format it like cell B2. This was successful (cell D4)&nbsp;but when I tried to format it using the "Format
 Cells" command the cell remained the same.&nbsp;I thought&nbsp;this was because the value was now stored as a text so&nbsp;I tried to use the formula "DATEVALUE(D4)"&nbsp; which is supposed to take a date in TEXT and convert it to the MS date and time number - there was an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am completely stumped. Any suggestions as to how I can get my dates to all format in the "dd-mmm-yyyy" format?</p>

<h2>            Word 2007 Only Prints First Two Pages of an 11 Page Document</h2>
                    I have problems printing an 11 page document. I cannot get more than the first two pages to print. I have tried Print Preview, and only the first two pages appear. It would appear to me that something is telling Word that the end of document is 2. This
 problem is only happening with one document. Other documents of more than two pages print as they should. Any and all assistance would be appreciated.

            How much free space do you have on your C drive? I know on my Surface the file is deleted after the upgrade. I always save it to a different drive before I do the required reboot.

            Could Microsoft have pulled it to speed up downloads? I cannot find it in Windows 10 Pro build 14965 either. Also maybe too many copies being installed without users being in the Windows Insiders Program. Maybe Microsoft is trying to clean up the insider
 program so only users that have officially signed up will get the official downloads.

<h2>            Is there a way to disable &#34;Message from webpage &#91;object Error&#93;&#34; popup box&#63; IE7-9</h2>
                    Tested under IE7-9 so far with the same results.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time a javascript action tries to execute on certain PeopleSoft web pages at my company, IE initiates a "Message from webpage [object Error]" popup window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is being generated by some compatibility issues with their out of the box javascript attempting to resize div width/height upon a dropdown onChange event.</div>
<div>Rewriting the code is really not an option without knowing what other parts of PeopleSoft rely on this function(s).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you dismiss the message box by hitting "ok" the web pages work fine, but each and every javascript action on the page will generate the same message popup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to simply disable this popup box in IE?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried disabling "Display a notification about every script error" as well as enable "Disable script debugging" - none of which change the outcome in the least bit.</div>

<p>I am using GraphPad Prism 7 and just recently updated my Microsoft PowerPoint to Version 15.26. Since I upgraded powerpoint, when I use the send to powerpoint function in Prism my graph will transfer over to powerpoint. But if I save and reopen the image
 it gives me the error "the image part with relationship ID rId2 was not found in the file." Now sometimes it will work hap hazardously. But I have not updated my IOS system or my prism, only Microsoft and then the issue arose. So something in the update is
 causing and issue when sending from Prism. Unfortunately I have an educational Office 365 license so Microsoft refuses to give me any technical support (they suggested instead of using my University's free service I should purchase my own so that they can
 provide support - because that makes complete sense). Any who, it looks like whatever has happened in the 2016 update has all of a sudden made images from Prism unrecognizable.&nbsp;</p>
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After "send to PowerPoint" button and looking at Console, there's plenty of these two types of errors (hundreds, pages), which seems to imply that it's copying much more than just the image.&nbsp; The old version of Office may of been
 able to handle this, but it seems the new version is complaining that the extra data doesn't meet it's needs.&nbsp; The sending to PowerPoint needs to be adjusted so that it sends what PowerPoint 2016 for Macintosh needs.</span>

<p>
</p><p>Prism technical support cannot reproduce the problem but they only have 2013 MacBooks and say its an issue on Microsofts end but I can't get any help on their end. I used a newly reimaged 2016 Mac and the same error occurred so it seems to be an issue unique
 to newer Mac's using Powerpoint 2016. I have been able to remedy the problem by first using Powerpoint 2011 then transferring to Powerpoint 2016, but this is a time waster. Not sure what happened with this latest update, but I cannot do my job without this
 working so I'm at a stand still! If anyone has any suggestions please let me know!<br />

            Sorry, but GraphPad will have to install Office 2016 on a new Mac to fix this. I guarantee Microsoft is not going to alter their software because an add-in company doesn't have the resources to test their product adequately.

<h2>            Error when opening Outlook - Something went wrong. We couldn&#39;t start your program. Please try starting it again.</h2>
                    My Outlook would not open after some recent windows updates. I uninstalled the updates and Outlook opened ok. The next day when I tried to open Outlook, it comes up with the above message. I also cannot open my iTunes at all. I have no idea what to do
 to fix this as I am not computer savvy :(. (I am using Windows 8)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks</div>

<h2>            contacts&#43;message backup</h2>
                    The app stopped working on my Windows 10 mobile last week. When I click on it under "settings", it appeared to open and then closed again ; I have windows mobile version 10.0.14393.2551 ; the Outlook Calendar and the Outlook Mail also behaves the same
 way last week, it opened and then closed again ; I deleted one of my Microsoft account last week, most of my contacts disappeared ; I re-create another Microsoft account with the same email address and a day later, the contacts re-appeared ; but the above
 mentioned three apps do not work since then. Is there anything I can do to make them work again ? Thanks. (I scanned the web for an answer already but nothing seems to work ...)
