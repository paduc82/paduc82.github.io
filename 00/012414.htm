    <title>Can I create a folder hierarchy of notebooks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I create a folder hierarchy of notebooks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a small business, but I have dozens of clients and many clients have multiple projects (or in some cases, dozens of projects). I am hoping&nbsp;to use a OneNote notebook for each new project. Each new project will open and&nbsp;at some point be closed (finished).
 Will all these notebooks have to be in the same OneNote directory? If not, how to you set up a folder hierarchy? Also, I&nbsp;plan to&nbsp;be using OneDrive.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Mohan</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;assist small businesses and individuals in designing and developing new products.&nbsp; I do not use Microsoft Project (as of now).</p>
<p>My concern is&nbsp;with OneNote project notebooks and their organization and&nbsp;management.
</p>
<p>Another person has responded&nbsp;with recommendations on how I can create a hierarchy of notebooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>

            <p>Hello Bernd</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the past I&nbsp;have experimented with changing the path. However, when I open OneNote, typically I only wanted to see those Notebooks in the active folder (C:\Users\Kris\Documents\OneNote Notebooks)&nbsp;. However, as I recall,&nbsp;I'd see a long list of notebooks
 including those not in that folder. </p>
<p>I do plan to use OneDrive for Business. Most of my new work&nbsp;will be&nbsp;done in my home office on&nbsp;a Windows 10 laptop. In that environment I&nbsp;will structure my notebook organization as you suggested in your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, I was wondering is there a MS tech bulletin (or other) that deals specifically with OneNote Notebook Organization (not necessarily sections or pages)? As I set up my new notebooks I am just trying to ensure that I know what I am getting into.
</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>When you start Onenote you see all <strong>open</strong> notebooks, independent of any storage location. There is no need for closing notebooks you're still using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid any valuable documentation about Onenote is outdated, well hidden or not existing.</p>

<p>I have closed my notebooks that are no longer active, and&nbsp;I will be moving them to their client folders.</p>
<p>The closed notebooks no longer show up in the left sidebar when I open OneNote; I now see only my&nbsp;current open&nbsp;notebooks and that's the way I wanted it</p>

    <title>Another Excel color formatting question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gene9328  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another Excel color formatting question</h2>
                    <p>Need some Excel help from the experts.....although I have seen similar questions on the board, I haven't seen any that&nbsp;seem to answer my particular question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to format the color of one cell based on the color of another..........however, I want the 2nd cell to retain the first cells color no matter what value is placed in the 2nd cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will use cells A1 and A2 for my example.&nbsp; Cell A1 is defaulted to be shaded red......however, I have a created a formula that will shade&nbsp;cell A1&nbsp;green if&nbsp;the current date or the word&nbsp;"TODAY" is entered into the cell.&nbsp; I also have specific formulas that
 shade cell A1 gray if the values are things like "X", "NONE", or a null entry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want is for the&nbsp;color of A2 to match the color of A1 no matter what value is placed in A2.&nbsp; So......if the response causes the A1 cell to be shaded green, I want A2 to be shaded&nbsp;green whether I put "Tuesday", "1500", "X", "$100.00", or no entry at
 all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that possible ??</p>

            <p>I am assuming that you are using Conditional Formatting. Is this correct? If so, then you should be able to include A2 in the "Refers to" range in the same condition that you apply to cell A1 but in the formula used in the condition you will need to use
 absolute referencing (with the $ signs) so the formula always refers to cell A1. Just exactly what absolute referencing is used is impossible to say without an example of what you are trying to do. ie. both column and row might be absolute or maybe just the
 column or just the row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide a better explanation of exactly what you are attempting to do, search for an application on your computer called "Snipping Tool". Click the round colored Start button bottom left of win 7 screen and type Snipping Tool into the Search field and
 right click the program and Pin the application to the taskbar and then you can open that application and follow the prompts to create a picture of part of your screen and then on this forum use the "Insert Image" icon to upload the picture.</p>

            <p>OssieMac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Conditional Formatting but I'm still learning so I don't claim to be an expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell....I'm trying to compile&nbsp;a spreadsheet that tracks reports and information&nbsp;from various organizations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each column is a separate organization.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Row&nbsp;1 is the DATE the report was filed.</p>
<p>Row&nbsp;2 is the TIME it was filed.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are multiple other Rows that capture information that is contained in the reporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to get a visual representation of when a report is overdue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Row&nbsp;1 has a default color shading of red (indicating a report is past due).&nbsp; I have it set up to&nbsp;change to green if the&nbsp;word "TODAY" or the current date is&nbsp;entered in the cell.&nbsp; I also have Row&nbsp;1 set up to change to grey if specified text is entered denoting
 no report was received ("NONE", "NA", "N/A", "X", etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Row&nbsp;2 is the TIME the report was received.&nbsp; I want to see if it is possible to get the color&nbsp;shade of the cell in Row&nbsp;2 to match the shading of the cell in Row 1.....no matter what time or other information is placed in the cell in Row 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to format Row 1 and Row 2 separately for each column since each column&nbsp;represents a different organization.&nbsp; The information entered in Column A, Row 1, and Row 2 may be completely different that what is entered in Column B, Row 1, and Row 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p />

            <p>I really need to see a copy of the workbook both to understand and experiment with to see if I can provide a solution. Can you upload a copy to OneDrive. If it contains sensitive data then make a copy of the workbook and replace any sensitive data with dummy
<p>
</p><p>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then&nbsp;you can probably start at step 8 to get the link.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.)
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Do NOT fill in the form; Select "Get a Link" on the left side.</li><li>Click the button "Create a Link"</li><li>Click in the box where the link is created and it will highlight.</li><li>Copy the link and paste into your reply on this forum.</li></ol>

<h2>            Outlook contacts not syncing fully to Windows Phone 10 950XL</h2>
                    <p>I have contacts from</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people</p>
<p>
</p><p>That are not syncing fully with my 950 XL Microsoft Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone is using the same email &amp; password as my outlook account as it's primary account.&nbsp; The contacts do come through but only with a single phone number.&nbsp; The additional details (address, etc) that are clearly shown online at outlook.live.com are not
 showing on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only guess is that it is due to a google account linking to the outlook account (I can not edit the address for example on the outlook website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway to push these addresses to my phone?&nbsp; Seems silly that Microsoft doesn't talk to Microsoft.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to batch convert .ppt files to .pdf. I have adobe X pro but it throws errors when I try and do it. I want to be able to click on a folder and have it convert all the subfolders while maintaining the folder structure on output.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that google drive can do this but I've had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi thanks for your reply. I'm using Adobe Acrobat X Pro. Microsoft office 2010 64 bit. I open acrobat and choose file --&gt; batch create multiple files. I select add files --&gt; add folders I select the Folder that contains my files. I click ok. I change the
 destination to a folder on my computer and choose the overwrite option as well as keep original file names. I press ok and immediately I get "missing pdf maker files. Do you want to run the installer in repair mode?" If I click yes it will just keep cycling
 for all 300 ppt files. So I have to force close. I know there is a known issue with 64 bit MS office so i fired up a computer with 32bit office and it still doesn't work.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have recently updated twice lately and last update is: Insider Build 14271.rs1_release.160218-2310.</p>
<p>And every since I did that, taskbar sometimes freezes, or internet explorer not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or my computer cuts out and it gives me a sad face with blue screen.</p>
<p>I also when trying to play a game lots of .dll files are missing.</p>
<p>It was working perfect before hand.</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me?</p>

<p>omg I have this issue sometimes with the new app systems and it drives me a bit nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things you can try: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Check your downloads folder to see if the folder actually downloaded.</p>
<p>2) Check your PROGRAM FILES folder - if it is installed, it will show up in there.&nbsp; But watch the name you are looking for - the apps are sometimes listed by their name, but the FOLDER the app is in is usually under the manufacturer or software provider
 name.&nbsp; Good to know, so you don't end up trying to install the app more than once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user friendly way to check your Program Files, click on your DOCUMENTS FOLDER - on the left side of the window that opens, you will see a list of all of the places on your computer - click THIS PC if you are using Windows 10 - and the top half will show
 you your folders, the bottom half will show you your devices and drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Drive C - the area where all of your apps and program folders are will open up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONLY LOOK TO SEE IF THE APP IS THERE - DO NOT MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY TO THESE FOLDERS OR THEIR CONTENTS UNLESS YOU ARE AN ADVANCED USER!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps you.&nbsp; This format also works for Windows XP, which I also love.&nbsp; Have a Great Day :)</p>

<p>Oh yeah... and check your start menu list, lol.&nbsp; If you are using Windows 10, it's a big list, but at least it is alphabetized.</p>

<p>Just search for them.&nbsp; They don't go directly to your Start Screen but do get added to your All apps view.&nbsp; To see that from the Start Screen just press Ctrl-Tab (or swipe whatever direction up or down it is that achieves the same result).&nbsp; Alternatively
 since they always seem to get added at the bottom of that list, we can apparently start typing (to&nbsp;get keyboard focus in the Search bar),&nbsp;press Esc, Tab and End to get there and see if there are any which are tagged *New*.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another alternative is changing
 the view to By date installed and then since the order seems to be reverse chronological you should see *New* apps at the top.&nbsp; Etc.&nbsp; W8:&nbsp; It's an

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you download the games from the Windows Store (the tile on your Start screen) or from an internet website using a web browser such as Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you downloaded the games from the Windows Store they should be installed and available if you search for them. Go to your Start screen (press the key with a Windows icon on it on the bottom row of your keyboard). Now start typing the name of the game
 and you should star seeing things appear in a column on the right of the screen. Eventually one of them should be your game. Select it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you download it from an internet website it may not have been installed, just downloaded. You will need to find the installer file and double left-click on it to install it. To see your recent downloads using Internet Explorer, first open Internet Explorer
 then press the keys <strong>Ctrl </strong>+<strong> j </strong>on you keyboard (at the same time). Follow the prompts to install the game then find it using the same method as described for finding Windows Store apps described above.</p>

<p>You’ll probably recognize most of the account activities listed on your <strong>
Recent activity</strong> page.</p>
<p>Even if an activity sounds suspicious at first, you can expand it to see more details and decide whether you remember it.</p>
<p>For example, if you accidentally made a typo in your password, you’ll see <strong>
Incorrect password entered</strong> in the list.</p>
<p>Or, if you signed in to your account from a mobile phone, you might find that your service provider routed the signal through a cell tower in another city.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But if an activity looks unfamiliar, or if you see an unusual pattern (like multiple sign-in attempts or changes that you’re sure you didn’t make), let us know. We’ll help you make your account more secure to minimize any threats.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>If you click “This was me”: </strong>
<p>When you tell us you were responsible for an activity, we’ll keep track of that info going forward. For example, if you sign in from a new location that happens to be the hotel you’re staying at on a business trip, we’ll add that location to the list of
 places we expect you might sign in from in the future. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>If you click “This wasn’t me”: </strong></p>
<p><strong>When you tell us that you don’t recognize an activity, it’s possible that a hacker or a malicious user has gotten access to your account.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>To help protect your account, we’ll walk you through several steps, including changing your password and reviewing and updating your security info.

<p>
</p><p>What's interesting about this one is that the indicator on the lower left side says that there's 13 reminders, but the reminder window doesn't show anything.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Daniel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some steps you can try:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Navigate to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Reminders &gt; Select “Show reminders” button.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Exit Outlook, click Start, point to Run, type “outlook /cleanreminders”, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Exit Outlook, click Start, point to Run, type “outlook /resetfolders”, and click Ok. Use this method if the /cleanreminders switch doesn’t resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Back up your folder settings if “outlook /resetfolders” needs to be run.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Sign in to the web application of your account and check whether you can view the reminders.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is still there, please provide us with the following information:</span></p>
<p><span>1. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The detailed version of your Outlook client. Navigate to File &gt; Office Account &gt; Office Updates. It looks like 16.0.6965.2117.</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What type of email account do you use, an Office 365 account, a Gmail account, a Hotmail.com account or any other account?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Where are these reminders in? Are they in your primary folder (the folder where you receive messages)?</span></p>
<p><span>4. If you create a new test meeting, will you see this meeting’s reminder in the reminder window?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Looking forward to your update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>it wasn't very helpful. my office outlook and outlook.com are already synchronized well.</p>

<p>my problem is on the phone calendar only&nbsp;- which get the data from 2 weeks only&nbsp;before the day the calendar setup.</p>
<p>it don't get the data before that day. </p>

<p>Thank you for your clarification. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that what you're experiencing with the Outlook.com app Calendar is by design. Two weeks is as far as what the app can sync back with the calendar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Should you have other queries, I highly encourage you to post them here.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am project manager, all my agenda is in big Outlook 2010. I have many secondary calendars with projects, people works, etc etc.. Those calendars are for example 2 or more years back..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Android phone. Other people in my office have WP phones or another phones (doesnot matter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that native exchange client in Android phone knows sync all events. But it doesnot know sync secondary calendars.</p>
<p>I found that Outlook.com (app for Android) knows to sync secondary calendars, but only two or three weeks back.</p>
<p>I found that WP phones knows natively all calendars, but doesnot know to sync more than 2 weeks back.</p>
<p>I heard that some "search button" for searching events on web has been disabled from Windows Phone calendar so my collegues are not able to find what was happened half year or more back..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really think that project manager can be satisfied with such machines and solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply</p>

</p><p>At the beginning we will divide this problem for two threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First will be about syncing calendars between Microsoft account and Android devices.</p>
<p>Later we will speak about syncing calendars between Microsoft account and Windows Phone devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now to Android devices..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At first some dictionary of used terms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Native exchange = means preinstaled exchange app (or client) by manufacturer, or natively build-in any Android OS by Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com = means application developed by Microsoft+SEVEN. It is Email application which knows besides of standard emails also to sync contacts and calendars. This application you can download for free from Google Play Store to many Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primary calendar = It is main primary calendar in Microsoft WindowsLive web or in Microsoft Office Outlook 2010/13 application on PC/Notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondary calendars = are additional calendars which you can add into Microsoft WindowsLive web, or in Micorosft Office Outlook 2010/13 application on PC/Notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shared calendars = are Microsoft WindowsLive calendars owned by your friends and shared to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem with syncing past events which I am describing is going throught all Android devices I already had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xperia Ray (with GingerBread, then later with ICS)</p>
<p>Xperia M (with JellyBean 4.1, now 4.3)</p>
<p>Huawei Ascend G630 (Latest fwm to July 2014, dont know now which version of fmw)</p>
<p>Collegues had some HTC and Samsung (cant recall which models and which fmw version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are experiencing problem -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Native build-in exchange client (in Xperia M (fmw Jellybean 4.3) knows to sync all past events. 6 months back, 8 months back, year or maybe everything (not tested completely but I saw events in December 2013 so this should be working)</p>
<p>But, this native build-in exchange client doesnot "see" all other calendars (secondary calendars and also it doesnot see shared calendars).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com application for Android knows to sync all secondary calendars which you have under your Microsoft WindowsLive account. Also this application knows to sync all shared calendars from your friends/collegues.</p>
<p>But, Outlook.com application for Android DOESNOT KNOW to sync events more than two weeks back to the past. And this is that problem!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot sync primary calendar year or more back by using native exchange client, and all other calendars (secondary and shared) using by Outlook.com application. This is confusing solution and doesnot solving syncing year back project calendars, clients
 calendars, customer which are in fact secondary or shared calendars..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible solution is: Update Outlook.com application for Android devices let it knows to sync more than two weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I explained well my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jaxon</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. Anyway - I dont see any problem to update Outlook.com application for Android (or update whatever what is doing this limitation to two weeks), because calendars events are not including huge data in the context of syncing with smartphone devices (files,
 pictures, videos etc). We have megabytes of bandwidths on Wifi/3G/LTE, smartphones has gigabytes of external data storages, Micorosft has exabytes of cloudstorages worldwide on the web, in this year 2014 we have floating distrubutable performance of servers,
 so I dont see any technical reason why to sync only two weeks back. Btw - my outlook calendar exported to PST file has no more than 13Mbytes (and there is 4 years &nbsp;of events)</p>
<p>p.s.2. Project manager has to know what/when/why happened. Project manager (or people in management generaly) has to be ready immediately and not open big Outlook 2010/13 or in worst case search for Wifi to connect to internet and search long minutes when
 they have in hands device which can do it by one or two clicks..</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your attention</p>

<p>
</p><p>For now, we suggest to sign in using a different account credential or use Skype for Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned that you're trying to restore the 8.12 version, we really cannot guarantee that you will be able to do that and if&nbsp; it will work properly. We recommend to use the latest version instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot launch the latest version, try uninstalling Skype then restart your computer, after then reinstall Skype.</p>

<div>The controls are all set to be locked from editing and locked in content. Then at some point in the workflow, I set the contents of the controls to be unlocked. Naturally, I am able to edit the fields by just selecting them with the mouse. Afterwards,
 I lock the controls' content again and the form is saved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I reopen the form and unlock the contents of the controls, I am not able to edit the text in the control by selecting it with the mouse. The only way I can edit is by using the arrows on the keyboard to navigate up/down and then reselect the control
 to edit it. It seems like some sort of focus issue. After I use keyboard navigation the first time, I can then select using the mouse normally.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By the way, all the locking/unlocking operations are being performed in the VBA code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a solution to this?</div>

            I suggest, then, that you look more closely at the possibilities offered by the editing restrictions, which even allow you to nominate which users can/cannot edit specified areas. With editing restrictions, you can also lock/unlock content controls within
 an otherwise editable range.

<h2>            Windows 10 Preview 10041 won&#39;t finish install</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to do a clean install of build 10041.&nbsp; Everything works great until I get to the screen asking me to setup a user name, password, and password hint.&nbsp; At that point, I get an error that "something didn't work right" no matter what I enter for
 each of the prompts.&nbsp; This screen comes after the screen where I sign into my Microsoft account.&nbsp; That seems to work without a problem.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the replies thus far.&nbsp; To Lawrence, I am attempting a clean install with a fresh partition and hard drive.&nbsp; There are no other programs on the computer at the moment, so running antivirus is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the links to the custom build routine.&nbsp; I have done just that.&nbsp; My problem comes during the installation process when I've selected the custom option and set a new partition.&nbsp; Halfway through, I get stuck on the password page.&nbsp; Any other suggestions
 would be very helpful.&nbsp; Thanks, all.</p>

            <p>I just had this trying a clean install (deleted partitions). Connects to WiFi fine, gets through the Microsoft account login in and authentication, then after a minute you get the local account create users screen.</p>
<p>Like the initial post, put anything you like, it fails back to this screen, puts a red box around the hint with error "something didn't work right".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried again &nbsp;(from scratch) with Lan cable, and I got through first time (without the local account screen appearing). So this appears to be a internet connection issue, and fails in two places:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: after connecting to WiFi, confirm connection</p>
<p>2: useful error message please</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just to add a small user experience improvement, on the two factor authentication screen, the focus should default to the code input box.</p>
