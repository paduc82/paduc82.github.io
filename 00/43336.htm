<h2>            Vista Stop error 0xc000021a</h2>
                    <p>Suddenly my Vista Desktop stopped booting with Stop error 0xc000021a </p>
<p>0x00000000 (0xc0000001 0x00010730)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No new Software installed within the last week</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startup-repair failed. </p>
<p>Going back to restore point worked a few times but only for the very&nbsp;next boot.</p>
<p>Choosing last good Configuration did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can enter Windows in safe mode.</p>
<p>Checked Harddisk with checkdisk, took Hours to go but next time on normal boot Stop error again.</p>
<p>sfc /scannow found no issues </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked for Malware with MBAM, only some PUP (potential unwanted Program)&nbsp;found.</p>
<p>MRT Quick scan ist negative too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tryed to perform a clean Boot by disabling all non Microsoft Software in msconfig, but no luck again a stop error (couldnt remember which one)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could be an defektive driver file but how can i figure out&nbsp;which one to have a look for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hello zigzag3143<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for answering late, nut working in safe mode is in friendly words suboptimal and I missed the email about your reply.<br />
<br />
I ve good and bad news.<br />
First the bad ones: while trying to disable some autostart-entrys last evening I encountered the next bluscreen on next boot. Shame on me, but I have no a pen at hand to write down the numbers.<br />
<br />
Startup-repair took long including a Disk check and a system restore.<br />
The really bad news: This kills all recently collected minidump-files. only one left. I uploaded it here:<br />
http://rapidshare.com/share/27E313920851DE72FB1DE072A7C64F1E<br />
<br />
The good news: <br />
Suddenly during one of the next Boot attempts it booted right to the login screen. This is when i got the mail about your reply.<br />
I took the chance to do a little cleanup by uninstalling long time unused software of which I found some entrys in autostart.<br />
<br />
To continue working down your post the msinfo32 file is here:<br />
txt version http://rapidshare.com/share/CE0FB50EC706CFC4FF19782CB27CA63A<br />
nfo version http://rapidshare.com/share/565CB9DF506921AFC358000C4E8C7DDE<br />
<br />
Didnt run memtest but the memtest function of the Windowes repair system. No errors found with that tool.<br />
<br />
Question to help me learn a bit: If <b><font color="#FF0000">Blue Screen View &amp; Who Crashed are often wrong</font></b> wich tool should be used to analyze the dump-File and where to get information about dump files.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

<strong>'Stopping'</strong>, it has been like this for the last hour how do I regain my sound and audio?</p>

</p><p>even if I get it running again I'm&nbsp;worried that my audio will still not work and my troubleshooter just keeps telling me that "one or more audio services isn't&nbsp;running"</p>

            Hi, &nbsp;sashahowgate
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you!!
<br />How you doing today?
<br />
<br />
<br />Try this&nbsp;
<br />The problem that you indicate, can be generated for different reasons, some of them:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Failures in the system controllers.&nbsp;
<br />Errors in physical sectors.&nbsp;
<br />Windows services disabled.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To try to solve the problem, do the following:&nbsp;
<br />Verify the Windows service&nbsp;
<br />Use Windows Key + R.&nbsp;
<br />When you open the window you type:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Services.msc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />When you open the list of services, look for "Windows Audio".&nbsp;
<br />Double click on the start button and verify that the start type is in (automatic).&nbsp;
<br />Driver update:&nbsp;
<br />You had already done it, as you mentioned before. However, it is important that you update the drivers related to BIOS and chipset. You can do this from the technical support page of your computer manufacturer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

<p>- I had already gone through those steps*, but I've actually kind of sorted the issue now- the status is no longer on 'stopping' i killed that through some help online, however, I still don't have sound I've sent a troubleshooter through but I think it'll
 still come up with the same issue that one of my audio services isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*how do I get to the technical support page of my manufacturer, if you are saying this is a hardware&nbsp;issue I'm not sure I can sort that right now as I'm currently on holiday.</p>

<p>Asus - and I don't know how to work out model, I know that sounds dumb&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know my manufacturer&nbsp;is Asustek computer inc - so would I have to contact them online?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue has resolved, the only issue is that I loose sound every couple of days and it takes many hours for it to get working again. Of course, this is something I can live with, but id rather I could find a way to fix it rather than just living with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm&nbsp;now wondering if there is something affecting my computer to do this or something I'm doing on the computer to cause this, and therefore&nbsp;something I could do to prevent it? - this problem has only started since I've&nbsp;been visiting Croatia, however, I
 don't see how that could cause the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to make it clear my 'window audio' status is now 'running' but just end up losing sound, every couple of days.</p>

<h2>            Skype on HoloLens</h2>
                    <p>hello all!</p>
<p>I have a question regarding connecting to Skype with my hololens... currently my hololens is not able to call or receive calls! I know that it is connected to my skype account because when i enter a new contact on my computer it does show up on the hololens.
 However if someone skype me only my computer will ring. Nothing from my hololens? And outgoing calls from my hololens just ring and ring.</p>
<p>Any suggestions about how to fix this?</p>
<p>thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One and PC to LG OLED TV issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello?. My name is Rodrigo. And currently I am having 2 Small but real annoying issues with my LG OLED 4K &amp; HDR&nbsp;TV..</p><p><br /></p><p>To explain as best I can...</p><p><br /></p><p>The 1st problem is that: When I just leave it there on.. The screen easily and quickly auto becomes fade into Dark.. Like if Screensaver was on.. However I had that Setting to off.. And yet it still does it.. This happens on my Xbox One X and PC..</p><p><br /></p><p>The 2nd problem is that: When playing certain video games on Xbox One X that activates HDR.. The screen becomes Darker than Normal... And the only way to bright it back up to normal is by switching from Game Mode to Standard Mode in the settings... However, Since it doesn't have Game Mode.. It feels of the look on the screen rather clunky.. Like weird.. But&nbsp;Game Mode is a Must when playing Video Games on TVs these days..</p><p><br /></p><p>Now to ask everyone who probably owns a Vizio M Series or P Series 4K &amp; HDR&nbsp;TV.. Do

            <p>Hi</p><p><br /></p><p>Both issues 1 and 2 are the television causing this to occur and not the console.</p><p><br /></p><p>With issue 1 what is happening is that the television is detecting that it has been displaying a static image for a prolonged period of time and to try to prevent/reduce the chance of screen damage occurring from displaying a static image it will dim the display. My LG OLED does the same and I'm note sure if this can be disabled in the television menus.</p><p>With issue 2 and the HDR being darker in game mode than others if you carry out an internet search you will see it is common for this to happen on LG televisions when in HDR mode.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Thank you for replying.. Yeah I am rather aware that it's not the console fault.. I been trying to message a couple of people here and there.. And so far they haven't reply.. So I was like, Why not and ask in my favorite system website?..</p><p><br /></p><p>About Issue 1.. Umm.. This I do not know for sure.. Because my original TV which was a Vizio&nbsp;1080p Full HD&nbsp;TV.. It did not cause this problem.. To be honest Lol.. That is why I asked everyone who has Vizio M Series or P Series TV if they got the similar&nbsp;issue like this TV..</p><p><br /></p><p>About Issue 2.. I been trying to search up online.. Especially about the HDR problem.. So far myself on my end with Bing Internet Search.. I had not been able to see one... But thank you for confirming to me that there is common issue with the HDR&nbsp;Problem..</p><p><br /></p><p>I got a question to you about Issue 1 and 2..&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Since this LG&nbsp;OLED&nbsp;TV has these two issues..

I probably would still get the same issue with Number 1 due to some screen protection.</p><p><br /></p><p>And as for Number 2.. I just double checked and see if it work perfectly.. Umm.. It did bright up a bit but the standard mode still beats The Game Mode unfortunately..</p><p><br /></p><p>I got a different question of some sort..</p><p><br /></p><p>Is The Vizio M Series or P Series TV exact same or similar like the LG OLED&nbsp;TV?.. Like.... Umm.. Let's say This LG OLED&nbsp;TV&nbsp;Sharpness can have a Max of 50% Sharpness.. Does Vizio M Series or P Series TV have higher Number of Percent?..</p><p><br /></p><p>Lastly.. Do you personally recommend Vizio M Series or P Series TV?.. Because at the moment.. I am currently rather un-happy with this LG OLED&nbsp;TV.. Like my brother told me..

            <p>Hey gds1972?.. Umm... I forgot one more issue.. Another annoying as well.. Sometimes my Screen loses signal of my Xbox One X and unfortunate I have to disconnect &amp; Reconnect the cable every time it does that or Full Restart the&nbsp;Xbox One X which again.. It's not the System fault but it's one of the ways for the signal to recognize it again..</p>

But I guess without Research and study about certain TVs.. It is how it is I suppose... I am not interested in Sony TV unfortunately, and&nbsp;Samsung TV is expensive to be honest lol....</p><p><br /></p><p>Right now I am attempting and putting a lot of time and focus into the study and research of this:&nbsp;VIZIO - 55" Class (54.6" Diag.) - LED - 2160p - Smart - 4K UHD Home Theater Display with High Dynamic Range TV.. It's a M Series style and according to the information.. It's a XLED&nbsp;Plus.. Similar like LG OLED&nbsp;TV.. However Vizio hasn't failed me yet.. But I can't take the risk any longer.. Which is why&nbsp;I am going to study and carefully research this TV and go back to Vizio like it was meant to be lol..</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 bluescreen at startup &#40;dpc watchdog violation&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 bluescreen at startup &#40;dpc watchdog violation&#41;</h2>
                    Hello there,<br />
<br />
about 2 hours ago my windows 8.1 updated (49 updates) and told me to reboot.&nbsp; When loading windows again I felt the computer slow and the ventilator started up straight away at full force.&nbsp; After logging in everything started freezing and a dreaded blue screen
 came up with the error message "DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION" came up and told me that my computer would restart after recollecting information but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
I have tried switching on a few times now, tried to repair with my windows CD, even trying to run different types of checks with command prompt and restoring the system but nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
Now doing some research on the internet two topics come up as possible reasons for this issue, driver update and viruses.<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss as to what to do apart from reinstalling my windows (something I would preferable not do) and thus am here to ask the experts for possible options/solutions to my dilemma.<br />
<br />
I am really hoping that some good soul could help me out with this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any helpful comments.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work on this forum!!!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

<br />
Thank you very much for your answer, <br />
<br />
Aftewriting this I just decided to reinstall windows as it had been a fresh install as I was unable to do what you wrote in normal mode and I could figure out how to get into safe mode. Now that I have learned how to get into safe mode on my computer I will
 be able to apply your steps if it occurs again.<br />
<br />
The program that was causing the issue was Comodo firewall which seems to create this problem on windows 8.1.&nbsp; I would be interested in knowing what can be done to fix this issue as I do find that Comodo a good firewall.<br />

            Good to hear.<br />
<br />
COMODO is causing this as it's causing conflicts with the NETBIOS ports, therefore causing crashes. A lot of antiviruses and firewalls are doing this as they are not yet compatible with 8.1 and/or they are just buggy. This can also happen if you have COMODO
 installed + an antivirus as well. Did you?<br />
<br />

            Well yes I do have ANTIVIR installed.&nbsp; I have the habit to install both ANTIVIR free and COMODO on my previous systems.&nbsp; Is there any way to get two free programs to work well together on Windows 8.1?&nbsp; I also understand that ANTIVIR is a good antivirus
 that is not too heavy on the system, is that true?<br />

            You cannot use an antivirus suite and COMODO at the same time, there will be conflicts. Use one or the other. I would stay away from that antivirus regardless, as well as Norton and McAfee.<br />

            Despite what most think, Windows Defender + Windows Firewall + a secondary SCANNER (not antivirus) such as Malwarebytes (what I recommend) is more than enough and does the job very well. I would also recommend this for now to truly see if COMODO causing
 conflicts was the issue.<br />

<p>
</p><p>This is getting frustrating, really FRUSTRATING! For months I received in all of my computers (a Sony VAIO laptop with original Windows 8.1, an ASUS desktop with original Windows 8.1 and a desktop with Windows 7 Professional) the same blocking message Code
 8020013 not allowing me to download the Windows 10. &nbsp;The, "out of the blue", without any explanation, one day, first, the laptop downloaded and installed the Windows 10 without a glitch. Two days late, the same happened with the ASUS, again without a glitch.
 But with the Windows 7 Pro desktop I am having no luck at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Today I tried with the Media Creation Tool and also was unsuccessful, receiving the same Code 8020013 plus another extra code 0X-90017.Then I tried to use the same Media Creation Tool using the ASUS which has the Windows 10 installed
 and also got the same two Codes, not allowing me to download anything related to Windows 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Is it worth all this ?</p>

            To be specific, I'm talking about GTA V. I am running it at the lowest settings and yet there is significant stuttering and tearing between frames. I searched the net for a fix and almost all sources mentioned unparking the CPU cores to get better fps.
 However, I also read that unparking may result in overheating of the cores and ultimately may cause damage. Which is why I'm asking if it is safe to do so. Also, since you asked, there are no problems in&nbsp;using the computer normally.

<h2>            Windows 10 Lowering Volume &#40;When i launch games&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So it seems my volume keeps automatically lowering when launching games/in game, including the games volume and music etc etc. Changing the Communication part in the Sound tab to "do nothing" literally changes nothing and this keeps occurring, it's been

            Hi Martin.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            ntdll.dll. error causes explorer to crash</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got strange problem with my computer for a few days. I'm using WIN 10 PRO. Process explorer.exe crashes and restarts every time I click on the "file explorer" shortcut on the windows bar on the bottom of screen - when I click start button and then "file
 explorer" it works. Furthermore, it also crashes when I click on any file/folder with right mouse button - blue circle appears, all the folders/files freeze, screen blinks and that's it, explorer just crashed and restarted. 2 days ago I found here, on this,
 forum to check the file integrity with command "<strong>sfc /scannow"</strong>. It took some time to finish and I got info, that system repaired some integrity tissues. After that the problem with "explorer.exe" was gone. In the meantime I ran antyvir - nothing
 found. Yesterday, the problem got back. I don't know what causes it and how to solve it. I checked the system's event log and there are many error records. Almost all of them are about "explorer.exe" and they say that problem is caused by
<strong>ntdll.dll</strong>. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, I understand your concern and we will try to assist you in the best way we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The causes of ntdll.dll error messages can vary greatly. However, most ntdll.dll errors result from a corrupt or damaged version of the ntdll.dll file itself, corrupt hardware drivers, or issues between Windows and other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you perform the methods mentioned below and check if the issue persist:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong><span>DISM may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click on the link provided below to know how to run DISM.</span></p>

            <p>This problem has been plagging Win 7-8-10 users for way too long and it's time that Microsoft aknowledges there is a problem... I scanned the internet in all directions and found reports about crashing Windows explorer way back to 2011 or earlier.. though
 maybe not that much often. </p>
<p>I had a perfectly working Win7&nbsp;SP1&nbsp;Enterprise&nbsp;on a corporate domain for the past 5 years, until&nbsp;I got a new laptop (upgraded from HP 8540w to 8560w).... soon after I started to work on the newly&nbsp;imaged laptop, I got&nbsp;plenty of system updates pushed to my
 computer and one day all of&nbsp;a sudden my Windows explorer started crashing for no apparent reason every time I was trying to lookup the properties of .EXE files... even a desktop shortcut that points to an EXE makes the explorer.exe process crash... the event
 log contains more or less always the same message :</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: Explorer.EXE, version: 6.1.7601.19135, time stamp: 0x56a1bbe2</p>
<p>Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.1.7601.19160, time stamp: 0x56bcd74c</p>
<p>Exception code: 0xc0000374</p>
<p>Fault offset: 0x00000000000c0aa2</p>
<p>Faulting process id: 0x1890</p>
<p>Faulting application start time: 0x01d189239c5893f3</p>
<p>Faulting application path: C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE</p>
<p>Faulting module path: C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll</p>
<p>Report Id: e9223ba9-f5a3-11e5-9bef-402cf414e963</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;Apparently it looks like that ntdll.dll seems to have been corrupted by one of the many updates I received. At some point I tried everything that was suggested on the various forums (restore points, safe mode, sfc /scannow, etc...) and somehow
 got it working again.. not long after the problem came back. Recently I've had 3 .NET 4.5 updates on my system.. is it the culprit ? don't know, I've to un-install them first, but suspect that even that won't help and will be forced to re-image my laptop from
 scratch. Once the file is corrupted, there seems to be no way to fix it.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It has become such a PITA, that daily working is almost impossible without having the system crashing once or&nbsp;twice a day and tear down&nbsp;everything that was open (and related to Windows explorer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, fix that damn ntdll.dll issue once for all. &nbsp;</p>

            In my experience I would&nbsp;have stayed with 8.1. Immediately after I uploaded 10 I lost all audio, finger pass, all my desktop icons (which I have no option to recreate). It' seems to have a different look and feel almost every time I turn it&nbsp;on. Called
 customer tech support and spoke to a service tech (who had what seemed to be an Indian dialect, very hard to understand). After almost 2 hours of being logged onto my laptop&nbsp;she turned me over to the floor manager (or supervisor). He too had a dialect that
 was hard to understand. What became very frustrating and dismaying was that after about 5 minutes of his accessing my laptop he quickly went into "sales man" talk and eventually told me they could fix the problem for almost $400.00 for a year. I adamantly
 disagreed with that approach stating that Microscope offered the product then they should fix this at no cost to the customer. He then proceeded to say I made mistakes in the upload and I should've contacted tech support first...

                    I have a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 and automatic updates set on.&nbsp; This morning, my wireless mouse (Logitech M510) no longer functioned.&nbsp; I tried other mice, changed batteries, etc and none work.&nbsp; I googled the issue, and it seems that the latest
 Windows 10 update caused the problem. Please fix this as soon as possible - it is very hard to work without a mouse!

<h2>            Multi lifecam Studio camera issues</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 of these running on a single PC.&nbsp; They all function, but I have a few issues.</p>
<p>1) They are all named the same when I use the LifeCam Studio application (and in Device manager)</p>
<p>2) If I change settings (Autofocus, white balance) the settings are not saved after you close the studio application.</p>
<p>3) Some of the settings (Truecolor, brightness) will affect all of the cameras.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to seperate these cameras so settings can be made individually?</p>

<h2>            Hard Drive failure and getting Live Mail transfered properly</h2>
                    <p>I may be asking an old question but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a recent hard drive failure. I was able to get the folder structure for my email but not do a proper export. When I import the folder structure over, it puts everything in Stored Folders and all old mail is marked as "read". In the old Outlook Express
 days, this wasn't the case. As long as you had the proper file, it maintained the folder structure and read/unread flags. Am I doing something wrong? This seems to have gotten worse. I have over 6,000 stored email messages relative to my field of work and
 I use the read/unread flag with intent. I would really like my email to go back to the proper folder and with the proper flag set. Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. If&nbsp;I understand&nbsp;you correctly, you wanted to have the same folder structure as with Outlook Express when importing emails to Windows Live Mail, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you further with this issue, can you confirm if you have followed the steps regarding importing and exporting emails enumerated in this
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>? Also, can you provide more details on this, "<em>I was able to get the folder structure for my email but not do a proper export</em>"? Did you
 encounter any issues when you exported your emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>The message metadata you're looking for - flagged, watched, read/unread, replied to, forwarded etc. -&nbsp;are not stored in the message file itself but in the database index file. If you import messages, none of these metadata will be included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a major problem for you, you'd be better off if you could recover the entire store folder from the old hard disk. If you can, then put it in the default location on the new C: drive, then install Windows Essentials. The installer will find the
 store folder and take it into use. Because of the new hardware, saved passwords will have to be re-entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a possibility?</p>

            Not exactly. I had live mail, had a hard drive crash, and re-installed on a new hard drive, then moved my live mail back into live mail using import. I had no ability to do an export first so everything was pulled in as "READ" AND put into stored folders.
 I just want it all back in the proper folders with the proper flags set.

<p>
</p><p>I was able to get the metadata in place but not in the exact way you suggested. I tried moving the entire Live Mail folder in place and then installing Windows Essentials. When I did that, Mail wouldn't launch. I ended up in uninstalling everything, removing
 all data, then reinstalling Live Mail again. Once that was there, I copied all of the mail folders structure in place and then launched Live Mail. That worked. It preserved the read/unread flags.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip. It set me on the right path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure wish Microsoft would provide a better way to recover from this type of failure. Unless you can perform an Export, which is great unless you have a catastrophe, getting your mail imported the proper way shouldn't be that difficult.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks again...Tom</p>

<p>
</p><p>What happened when you tried to launch it? Was there an error message?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Well, it's always been the user's responsibility to back up important data in case of catastrophe. Is your documents folder backed up somewhere, like on OneDrive? Your pictures? Why not your email as well, then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you're back in business, but I'd like to know why you couldn't launch Windows Live Mail after installing Windows Essentials with the store folder in place. There might have been a problem with ownership of some of the files, but I would have expected
 that to throw an error with an identifiable error message.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. I didn't take down the error. Everything was a new install. New hard drive, new OS, moved folders in place, new install of essentials Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the topic of recovery. You are correct. We are all responsible for our own backups. If only users had a crystal ball and could predict catastrophes, that would save the world so much pain. What I am talking about &nbsp;though has nothing to do with having
 a backup or not. It has to do with Microsoft being able to import mail from its own product into its own product. If a "store" file exists where the metadata is stored, why would Microsoft ignore that file and behave as it does? If Microsoft handled this well,
 why would so many 3rd party products exist for purchase that do exactly this, preserve the metadata? I fully understand the need for backup. Why wouldn't Microsoft offer an import process that sees the folder structure, looks for its own fingerprints, and
 then act accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am glad I was able to recover.</p>

    <title>BSOD while gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dannybleinis  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD while gaming</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been having this issue for quite some time now. About a year ago, I used to occasionally get BSOD while playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The problem went away on its own. Then, few months down the line, I started crashing randomly while
 playing certain games. I crashed playing Grand Theft Auto V, frequently crashed playing The Witcher III, and I think even got a BSOD or two from the latter. The only games I had been playing consistently without any crashes or blue screens were Grand Theft
 Auto: San Andreas, and for a long period of time CS:GO. Due to a lack of free time I put gaming on hold for awhile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast-forward to about two months ago, I bought and downloaded PLAYERUNKNOWN Battlegrounds. I had been playing CS:GO and San Andreas still without any issues. The game ran fine for the first day or two, and then it began crashing more and more frequently
 until it was almost entirely unplayable, producing blue screens every 5-10 minutes, or a simple crash at best. The problem then transversed over to CS:GO, where the crashes were much less frequent, but still occurred every 2-3 rounds (around 45 mins/round).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first. the blue screen errors were my NVIDIA drivers. I did a full clean install of the drivers, and hadn't received an NVIDIA driver-related blue screen ever since. However, the blue screens I began receiving afterwards were driver irql_less_or_not_equal,
 and some other driver/memory/page file size-related ones (cannot remember the exact codes off the top of my head, but there have been a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:<br />
SFC scannow (no errors)</p>
<p>Clean install of NVIDIA Graphics Card drivers</p>
<p>Increasing/altering page file size (temporarily fixed the problem for about 4 rounds of PUBG before BSODs returned)</p>
<p>Stress test on CPU/GPU with Furmark and another program I cannot remember (no issues)</p>
<p>Memtest86 (no errors after running overnight)</p>
<p>A fresh, clean Windows install with a brand new activation key and everything (done this yesterday)</p>
<p>Driver Verifier (ended in a blue screen loop. When I tried to boot in safe mode, it only gave me the option to system restore for some reason, which restored a bit further back than my most recent restore point :( )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since the fresh Windows install, I managed to play a game of PUBG with no issues today. I got through around 20 minutes of gameplay in CS:GO before the game began crashing every 2-5 minutes, which subsequently ended in a blue screen at the end of the
 game (driver irql less or not equal). I am unsure on what to do now, but I do figure I need to single out which piece of hardware is the culprit. I am decent with computers but not an expert so I definitely need some help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my minidump, as well as some of the crash dump files from my most recent CSGO crashes:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/f/s!AjapUuVxDd14jkYC3vTlaEdy9K1X</p>

<p>I have 1709. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that after all of the diagnostics, I either have faulty hardware (RAM, CPU, GPU, PSU?), or incorrectly installed drivers (maybe less likely considering I'm having these issues on a fresh OS). I'm just not sure what else I can do to troubleshoot because
 Prime95, Memtest, and Furmark all gave no stability issues or errors.</p>

    <title>Sound on Surface 3 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geodav52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound on Surface 3 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface 3 Pro on a&nbsp;docking station with which I have been using Windows 10 for at least two + years without a problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; I recently went to use Skype (<em>which I had not used since late last year when it worked fine</em>) and found that my microphone&nbsp;was
 not working.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adopting the first principles approach and keeping things simple I first disconnected the Docking Station and reset the microphone to use Realtek High Definition Audio and the microphone worked but the speakers did not, except for harmonic feedback from
 the microphone.&nbsp; On plugging in the headphones, which activated the headphone driver, the result was the same except I could now hear everything&nbsp;that the microphone was picking up including&nbsp;my typing and even my breathing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;subsequently reconnected the docking station whereupon the docking station driver appeared on the display&nbsp;but with a notation that the docking station audio was disconnected even though the device status advised that it was working properly thus I was
 unable to use the docking station audio driver.&nbsp; &nbsp;As before, the speakers only produced the feedback sound yet when I inserted the headphones into the docking station the feedback reduced to more of a hissing sound but still played back everything the microphone
 picked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled all associated drivers even though they reported as being the most current in the first place and this does not make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to go through the process of resetting the system and then re-loading and configuring all of the software so I am hoping that someone may be able to shed some light on this matter.&nbsp; &nbsp; All other aspects of the Pro 3 work absolutely fine
 and when I disable the microphone driver both the speakers and headphones work perfectly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help this will really be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Random disconnections from internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alvon de priest  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random disconnections from internet</h2>
                    My internet connection just gets cut off by itself everynow and then and when I click the Diagnose button, it says that no problems were found. The only way I could find that could help this was to re-connect. My internet connection is a dialup broadband
 so whenever I turn on my pc, I have to open the Connect to a network shortcut and connect to the internet. Sometimes, it gets disconnected so bad that I have to restart my computer to get it to re-connect. I've tried using batch files to help me reconnected
 if my internet is out but it doesnt work most of the time even if I reconnected by myself.
<br />
<br />
Im using windows Vista and my internet is pretty fast.<br />

            Hi Alvon de Priest,<br />
<br />
You will have to contact your ISP on this matter since your connection is straight from the wall mean it is connected centralize somewhere.&nbsp; If you have your own modem/router, you can try to reset it.&nbsp; In this case, you'll have to contact the ISP and have them
 reset it for you since you do not have access to it physically.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps,
