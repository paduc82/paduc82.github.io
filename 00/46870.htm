<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps as below and check if the issue gets fixed,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note :</span>

<p><strong><span>As a work around you need to install the software in Vista compatibility mode to do that you need to follow the steps provided below.</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>Locate the installer.exe file in your file system and right-click on the file. From the contextual menu, choose
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Compatibility</strong> . Choose the version of Windows you want to emulate and select the ‚ÄúRun this program in compatibility mode‚Äù checkbox. Run the installer</span></p>

            Thank you for your prompt answer. The driver which appears to be missing is the
<br />
"Intel(R) Network connections intel version 16,3.0.0. However this is at the beginning of the Windows 8 upgrade report, but near the end of the report it gives as compatible "Intel(R) 82566DC-2 Gigabit Network connection. So there is some confusion, I shall
 go ahead and install windows 8 and hope this ethhernet connection functions as it my connection to my router. Orange sagem Livebox"<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

            The problem appeared to have solved itself when&nbsp; installed Windows 8. The first attempt did not work it got stuck on the WiFi network, so the next time I skipped this and Wiwows loaded and ran with the network up and running from the 82566DC-2 Intel network
 card.<br />
The driver version is:-9.13.41.1<br />
&nbsp;So if any else has this problem go ahead and install and forget the contradiction in the upgrade Assistant Report<br />

</p><p>I tried a variation of the suggested solution of creating a new local account, converting the Microsoft Account connected account to a local account, converting the new account to a Microsoft Account, and moving content. (see

<p>
</p><p>I created a new local account (tip:&nbsp;make it an admin account), copied files over from the original account, deleted/removed the original account, converted the new account to login with my Microsoft Account, and everything works now. The weird thing is the
 other devices I had also started to sync even though I didn't do this on them. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update - Windows Touch Screen</h2>
                    <p>Went through another forced Win10 update. This time M/S thought it would be fun to turn back on the touch screen. Is there a way to permanently disable the touch screen so an update won't turn on the touch screen again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this important? We'll my glass screen has a break which means if the "touch screen" is turned on the mouse just keeps bouncing around, it's like the screen is being touched 1,000 times a second. No way to log in... no way to get to the device manager,
 no way to get to the Human Interface Devices, &amp; no way to "re"-disable the HID-Compliant touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be great - thx</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to emulate a bigger display size in a smaller size monitor</h2>

</p><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story kept to myself, but I have to work with a software that demands 1980x1180 display size, and I don't have a monitor that allows for that size.&nbsp; The application comes up, but the buttons, are outside the monitor's view range (1480x1080) and I need
 to capture screens from that application.&nbsp; Is there a way to emulate seeing that size of screen (1980x1180), using some type of software, or Windows settings?&nbsp; I don't think so, but who knows what types of hacks have been done&nbsp; before.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Apart from investing in a larger monitor, no, you can use the scale and layout controls to make some modifications to how applications appear on screen.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />	Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.

            Hi  jicabrera, can you plug your device into your TV, your TV will have at least that resolution
<br />
<br />Plug into your TV with a HDMI cable or DSUB
<br />
<br />Then in Windows press Windows Key + P to open the projection panel and choose Duplicate, then on your TV, you should be able to see the whole screen . . .

<h2>            Drive missing from Indexing Options Modify window</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to add a 3rd internal hard drive to the list of indexed locations for Windows Search, but it isn't listed with the other drives.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The drive is a 640GB Western Digital WD6400AAKS with a single NTFS partition, as a basic volume, marked as Active, and it shows as Healthy in Disk Management. I can access all the data on the drive from every other program, except for Indexing Options. I
 have tried changing the drive letter, clicking "Show all Locations" in Indexing options, restarting the indexing service, and of course rebooting. I'd love to get this working!<br />

<h2>            Location shown in Cortana and Maps may not be accurate</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">First of all, thank you for all of the feedback and bringing all of the location accuracy issues to our attention. &nbsp;Even though&nbsp;we‚Äôre not able to reply individually to all of the cases, we‚Äôre listening and you are helping make
 Windows better for everyone. Based on your feedback, we‚Äôve investigated and identified some issues we‚Äôre working on improving in&nbsp;future builds. We know how frustrating it is when your location is wrong so here‚Äôs some more details if you‚Äôre interested.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">Most apps rely on the location platform in Windows to provide the location information. Depending on the hardware available on each device, the availability of the location information and its accuracy will vary. For instance,
 a device with GPS will provide better accuracy than a device without it and in general Wi-Fi based information is more accurate than the one based on reverse IP.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">What this means is that for most desktop users (where GPS presence is very rare) if the computer doesn‚Äôt have a Wi-Fi adapter, the location results will be obtained using the IP address. Using this technique, the results can vary
 widely in accuracy and can sometimes be incorrect. This has always been the case and we do not expect users to see a major difference here between Windows 10 and previous versions of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">For laptop/tablet users, Wi-Fi based positioning is usually very good, typically in the range of 50m-150m of accuracy. We have uncovered some issues with certain Wi-Fi hardware in Windows 10 that results in a failure getting the
 positioning from Wi-Fi and thus falling back to the much less accurate IP based positioning. This causes the location shown to users to be incorrect or highly inaccurate even when the device is connected to Wi-Fi and will impact some users after upgrading
 from a previous version of Windows to Windows 10. We‚Äôre actively working on this problem and hope to have it fixed in future builds.
</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">*Update* The fix for this issue&nbsp;was released through Windows update at the end of September, users being impacted by it should be getting more accurate locations once they have installed the latest updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">*Update* The latest version of the Maps app lets you enter the address where you keep your PC and we'll use it as your location when we don't have a precise reading on where you are.

            Right after I upgraded to Windows 10 and loaded the Maps app for the first time, it showed my location to be "8652 NW 120th St, Potwin, Kansas 67123"&nbsp; When I searched the internet concerning that address, I found out that it is a notorious "fake address"
 used by hackers.&nbsp; The Maps app persistently shows that address for my location, then eventually corrects itself to my true location in Denver, CO.&nbsp; I notified the Microsoft help desk, and they said they would "note it" and that my security is an important
 priority for them.&nbsp; That was nice, but I am still concerned.

            <p>Whereas GPS might be rarely present on desktop systems, I have a USB GPS attached to mine, which Windows totally ignores. I can find nothing in settings to allow this GPS unit to provide location information for Windows, so it uses my internet IP address,
 whose geo-location information is that of my service provider's headquarters, some 1000 km from where my PC is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply not good enough, Microsoft. NMEA data containing my exact location is constantly available, yet Windows cannot see it. I have sent Windows 10 feedback. This really needs to be addressed to give any kind of credibility to Windows in 2015.</p>

            <p>OK, I have not set my address in Cortana specifically but:-</p>
<p>If I&nbsp;say to&nbsp;Cortana "Where am I right now?" It tells me my town, street, post (zip) code and puts a dot on Bing maps within a few feet of my house. It says "accurate to within 75 yards," but it is only about 75 feet away.</p>
<p>Myself and most others I assumed, had, in the past, given our addresses buying Windows or setting up Windows Live, Outlook, Skype or one of a hundred other programs etc and I assumed Cortana uses that rather than IP addresses because my tower pc does not
 have GPS.</p>
<p>I am aware that if I look up a location via an IP address, it can be wildly inaccurate&nbsp;or just plain inaccurate.</p>
<p>I find it strange that Cortana does not show everybody's locations similarly?</p>

            try this:
<br />1- A very simple solution would be to check the Recycle Bin. If you're lucky, the Word document will still be there, safe and sound.
<br />Nothing yet?
<br />
<br />2-The next thing to do is find the backup file of the Word document (.wbk). For this to work, it is necessary to have backups enabled in Word, and you need to know where the document was saved.
<br />
<br />* Open Microsoft Word and choose the File tab in the upper left corner
<br />* Click on the File tab and select Open.
<br />* Choose the folder in which the document was last saved. Select the backup file and click Open.
<br />* If you can not remember the location of the document, be sure to search the entire computer for Word backup files. You can do it by entering * .wbk in the Windows search.
<br />
<br />Nothing yet?
<br />
<br />3-The next thing would be to try the Word Auto Recovery tool. If, for example, your computer was locked and you have not saved the file, when you open Word next time, the file should appear in the left part of the window.
<br />
<br />If this does not happen, you can search the AutoRecover files manually. Open Microsoft Word (2010), click on the File tab and select Recent. At the bottom of the menu, select to retrieve unsaved documents. You can search your file there.
<br />
<br />If you do not have this option in your version of Word, you only have to search the * .asd files on your computer using Windows search, as explained at the beginning.

            Hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try resetting the game to see if it will accept the Update, at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; House of Fun Slots &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling the game in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, then restart PC, go back to Microsoft Store app Settings to reinstall the app from Library.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Windows 10 is new most of the drivers may not be available which are compatible with Windows 10. However, you can run the previous version of drivers in compatibility mode and check. You may refer to the steps from the article below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a></strong> (information holds good for Windows 10 as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Problem Wifi Works but Not Direct with Ethernet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tenncros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Problem Wifi Works but Not Direct with Ethernet</h2>
                    <p>I am currently on my 5th router and modem recommended by my ISP. &nbsp;Last night they said the problem is Windows 10 and not an ISP problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: &nbsp;Wifi works fine but when we connect anything to the router via ethernet it picks up the signal for a couple of seconds and drops. &nbsp;It displays "invalid ip address" or "unknown network". &nbsp;When diagnostics is completed it says "invalid ip address"
 or "invalid default gateway". &nbsp;Gateway is always empty. &nbsp;If we connect directly into our old modem the desktop has a signal. &nbsp;I have tried hard connecting with 3 different laptops and get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ipconfig/release and renew, deleted network drivers, run software updates, turned off windows defender, turned off firewalls and tried new ethernet cords. &nbsp;I am at a loss and have wasted way too many hours trying to figure this out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally went and got a wireless adapter for the desktop to be able to use it while we try to get a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciate.</p>

    <title>Halo 2 PC Keyboard Configuration Broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nelno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo 2 PC Keyboard Configuration Broken</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased Halo 2 for the PC and the game refuses to allow me to re-assign my keys.&nbsp; For example, if I try to re-assign Forward to E, the game tells me: "That key has already been assigned to another action.&nbsp; Please clear that action and try again."&nbsp;
 However, I cannot clear the action.&nbsp; The only actions I can clear are the secondary actions in the right-most column (by pressing delete when the action is selected, or X on my controller).</p>
<p>Also, entering the product key that came with my Halo 2 PC in the MS support site doesn't work -- it only tells me that there is a problem with the key, which I have confirmed and had another set of eyes confirm, is the correct key.&nbsp; The key worked when
 I installed and activated Halo 2 PC, it just doesn't work at the support site I reached via the links in the Halo 2 readme file.</p>
<p>If there's no fix for the keyboard configuration, I want a refund.&nbsp; Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I've tried everything I can think of to clear the default keys without success and via google I've found others reporting the same problem.&nbsp; There's
 simply no excuse to release a PC FPS with a broken keyboard configuration.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I managed to re-assign almost all of the keys by simply re-assigning them to other keys first instead of trying to delete them first.&nbsp; However, I cannot re-assign forward to E.&nbsp; Attempting to assign any key to E always results in the same message
 about it already being assigned, even though E shows up nowhere in the list of key assignments.&nbsp; Kinda makes the whole thing pointless.</p>

<p>If there is any OS releted problem then this tool will fix it. But if problem still exist then test your printer with some other PC.</p>
<p>Is the same thing happens there? Then your printer might be faulty.</p>

                    <p>Whenever I try to log into the old skype, I always get my password removed. For example every time I enter my password in with my email, the skype tab turns white and then it removes the password and not let me log in. This problem has lasted for like a
 month now and I want to be able to log into old skype because I don't enjoy the windows 10 skype as much as the old one.</p>

<h2>            Apache&#58; air &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">After playing too much LA Noire I wanted something new, a game that I normally don‚Äôt play and I chose Apache: Air ****. I am still up in the air about
 most of this game it seems to be a mild OK for me but it does have its moments that drive me wild with frustration.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">It seems you can‚Äôt get enough altitude to hover over your targets although I am still playing in training mode while I get use to flying these choppers
 then I will switch over to Realistic mode where I am sure my altitude issue will not be there.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">Graphics I really have no rebuttal because I don‚Äôt have an HD TV therefore, I have little to comment on graphics.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">The game play well I believe this games choppers could use a bit more stability mode when flying those birds. They do seem to be a bit hairy to handle they
 may have better handling mode if I used a flight joy stick but right now controller is my weapon.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">I do like the weapon modes ever since I experienced the C-130 in COD it felt cool to waste those white dots on the ground as it does in this game of Apache.
 It seems when using the hover mode your bird seems to handle like a brick and you‚Äôre a bit out of enemy view until you get out of hover mode. Then, you choice your cockpit mode and before you now it you‚Äôre heading into the ground. Flying these choppers in
 the game takes allot of time getting use to I guess the best method is keep flying to get better. Then you have radio communications totally out of flight sink meaning while the radio chatters comes over your flight movements are totally out of sink before
 you are told to fire on your targets you already been under fire and have unloaded all your heat seeking missiles, what gives; I haven‚Äôt a clue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">Achievements are easy to collect and there are some you will have difficulty on even if they were handed out by girl Scotts. Some Achievements popped open
 while I was flaming into the ground see what I mean. Anyway, I don‚Äôt think this game is worth $40.00 bucks you might want to rent the game just for the achievements otherwise, the game could be made much better.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Well some of your points I agree with, it does take some practice getting the hang of this thing with a controller as far as flying it, I was considering a flight stick, still on the fence about buying that. &nbsp;I do make sure I have enough altitude before
 I hit autohover and get into FLIR mode, which also I think is great and I also first liked it same place (game) as you did.</p>
<p>On other places on the internet it is touted as one of the more realistic flight sims available for 360 and I agree with it, if it wasnt it would not be taking us both time to get a better handle on it....but to me that is a good thing, If someone wants
 to just hop in a jet lock on targets and shoot and thats all to it then great for them but I want it to be tough to fly, I thought Falcon 4 SP2 where it took 5-10 minutes sitting on the ramp just to start your engine was great though to give you an idea of
 how I like the difficulty. &nbsp;I am still in training mode myself, was going to wait for harder levels for the stick, and I am playing on a 55" 1080p hdtv so I can say that to me anyway the graphics while not stellar are not bad either, especially when you go
 into the radar modes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that I can pass on that I have just figured out is that not only is the left trigger that you zoom with range sensitive according to how far you pull the trigger in but also the FLIGHT left and right thumbsticks are this way as well...in other
 words on these thumbsticks instead of moving either one of them to the all the way up or down position they are also sensitive to how far you are pushing them....once I figured that out it helped quite a bit, hope all that made sense. BTW if you ever need
 a coop partner feel free to give a shout. &nbsp;Peace.</p>

<p>Get off of Training Mode, it ruins what helicopter experience there is.</p>
<p>Fly on Realistic, and many of your flying problems will be solved.</p>
<p>And I feel sorry for you that you've bought it for $40 USD.</p>
<p>The computer version is less expensive, and gets support.</p>
<p>Also on the PC version there is versus mode and a mission editor.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I was really upset before because I bought for $50 for the Xbox&nbsp; when it came out and then Activision blocked Gaijin from updating it.</p>
<p>So I bought the PC version when they had a sale for it.</p>
<p>Gaijin will be working with Konami for their next game, so hopefully Konami will be a better publisher.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ADDED:</p>
<p>The graphics are not so great on the Xbox, it definitely looks better on the PC.</p>
<p>I have a MadCatz Xbox 360 controller that I can hook up to my computer so my gaming experience is the same.</p>

<p>Also I've seen that Rage Quit video before as well.</p>
<p>Why does everybody complain about the controls?</p>
<p>They're not difficult.</p>
<p>Like most games, the whole controller is in use.</p>
<p>But here's the funny part, Apache Air Assault does not require you to press buttons as much as Call of Duty does.</p>
<p>In fact, you don't even need to press the Y, X, Left Trigger, and Left bumper buttons to play the game and beat it on Veteran.</p>
<p>The right stick button isn't even in use either.</p>
<p>Yet everybody doesn't seem to get it.</p>

<p>I just reread my post and I've made a horrible impression.</p>
<p>It's just that this game got hammered for its "difficult" controls.</p>
<p>Sure not everybody gets it the first time but the critics are hard core gamers whose lives are dependent on playing games for a portion of their living and yet they can't seem to get the controls right.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope that you have fun with that game.</p>
<p>But please do try Realistic/Veteran mode, it's what makes flying fun.</p>

<p>No offense but if I wanted to fly on the PC it would be flight sim X with my Saitek X52, our discussion was about this game on this platform. &nbsp;This game started out at the same price it is today....it has not went down a dime, cant say that about alot of
 top xbox games. My point is for us that want a decent 360 challenge of a sim we got two choices "Over-G" or Apache....I like the challenge and I can honestly say I have spent 60 bucks on so many games that turned out to be garbage that it's nice to find a
 decent title for a good price, different strokes for different folks, I would not have been upset even if I had spent 60 on this, but then again Aviation has been most of my life. &nbsp;Oh, and killer video Riven ha, Peace.</p>

<p>i also do get a message and it says oops skype has detected a problem please restart skype.</p>
<p>also sometimes the audio sounds robotic sorry i don't know any other way to describe it but the only way to get it fixed is to restart my laptop.</p>

<div>Can you advise how you were able to force the install? &nbsp;I have tried everything I can think of and my Win7 x64 machine will not install the drivers from the link provided. &nbsp;I downloaded both the driver package and the driver setup program and have tried
 both with the same result - failure!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any direction you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</div>

            Hi, my USB1000 device was stuck under Other Devices in my W8.1, and no driver seemed to fit this&nbsp;hw.&nbsp;My solution became to rename the drivers filename and use the "have disk" feature.
