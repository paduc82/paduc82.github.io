<p>Since you aren't the original poster (who never came back after his initial post in April), if you have a similar problem then the answer is similar: reinstall your drivers.</p>

<h2>            Storytime&#58; The Surface Support</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Back in October 2018, my Surface Book 2 had a problem with the detachment mechanism (precisely the connection between Base and Clipboard). I went on their website, everything looked alright and I got the exchange device within a week.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
I unpacked the device and got a first hint of what to expect from now on. The device I got was scratched all over its bottom. the display looked terrible due to dozens of micro scratches and dirt. Not enough, the hinge seemed to be badly adjusted, the lid didn't
 close properly.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
So, I tried to reach out by phone to the local, german customer support multiple times. No one answered as they claimed due to a technical issue. I also waited about an hour in line with one person before me at the support chat. Must've been a very persistent
 person.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Later that day, I contacted the US service. Fortunately for me, their devices worked. After explaining to the (very nice and serviceable) agent why I was absolutely disappointed, he decided to send me a new one. The device I received in October was in an almost
 new condition (<span>only</span>&nbsp;some
 liquid marks at the bottom and a few very small scratches) and I needed it for study so I decided to keep it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Not even two months later, at the ninth of January 2019, it started again. I tried to detach the clipboard, the very function I bought the device for - and heard a very unpleasant crack followed by a permanent rattle whenever I moved the device. The muscle
 wire lock on the right side broke and was now freely moving inside my Surface.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
So, again, I turned to the US-service, telling them that I was fed up with the Surface Book. The agent told me that he was very sorry, that I was a good person with a lot of good things to happen in my life (yes, really), that he knew how important it was to
 have a flawless surface to work with. He ultimately decided to escalate the case, thus pushing it to the next level of service so that we could decide whether I'd receive a Surface Pro 6 (technically a downgrade but I am fine with that) instead of another
 Surface Book 2. But, he told me, this was a matter to discuss with the Sales Team so I'd have to call them. I decided to try it with the German service once again and their team answered the call and was able to redirect me. Unfortunately, those guys decided
 not to answer the call, the connection broke after 40 minutes of patiently waiting for an answer. I recalled the previous number and this time they told me not to be able to help me. Unfortunately, the agent was unable to give me any contact info but instead,
 he tried to navigate me through the absolutely terrible support website in search for the number I tried to call previously. He didn't succeed so he tried to reconnect me and after 20 minutes of hanging in the line again I just hang up.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
The next day, I called the surface support directly (whatever that level that was) (figured out the number with help by @MicrosoftHelps earlier). Finally, I got someone with a deeper knowledge I thought. He told me that he could redirect my case to the higher
 level so that I'd exchange my Book for a Surface Pro 6 but he lowered the expectations. In Germany, the manufacturer appears to be required by law to offer cashback or a completely new device after three failed repair attempts and he clearly told me that my
 prospects to get an SP 6 after&nbsp;<span>only</span>&nbsp;two
 exchanges were low. So, he frustratedly recommended me to send in the device for repair once again. I tried just minutes after the call, unfortunately, the portal didn't work due to software issues as the German support told me at this point when I called
 them to ask. Later that day, I contacted the US-Support to manually get a label. They told me that something was a little out of the ordinary - whatever that means - and that my case needed to be escalated once again so that they could analyze whether everything
 was fine. The agent didn't explain what it was and how it could be solved but she called me without asking before and told me a lot - unfortunately nothing relevant, just some more support phrases, everything is being taken care of, she's very happy to take
 my case, Microsofts thanks for my loyalty and that I'd receive further information in up to 72 hours. Later that day I received an email that contained all those useless phrases again but, unfortunately, not a single concrete information. After 72 hours, nothing
 happened, no email, no call, not the slightest bit of information. I tried to print out my package label once again on my own, it worked out this time, leaving no information as to why it didn't the first time. In the night I received an email from the Microsoft
 support. It was the exact same I mentioned before though, this time, the agent replaced one line saying that she'd 'personally update on the status of the replacement'. Whatever that means in this context.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
I sent in the device for replacement and received the replacement within convenient 5 days. The new device had black, extremely persistent marks on its keyboard and several scratches on its bottom. So, I called the German support once more.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
The agent told me that an exchange of the device with a Surface Pro 6&nbsp;<em>was
 not possible due to me not contacting the phone support each but using the web portal for the exchange two times</em>. She claimed that I had to call the support each time if I intended to exchange the device and after three times, there might be the possibility
 of exchanging it with a pro 6. When I asked her where to find that in the terms and conditions (which I read), she asked me to wait and told me a few moments later that she'd escalate the case. Half an hour after our conversation she emailed me and told me
 that exchanging with a surface book 2 was the only possible solution.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
So I turned to @MicrosoftHilft to ask them for help and to probably get in touch with someone from Microsoft to share my complaints. After I explained my whole story starting 4 months ago, they wrote me that they'd escalate my case and that I'd be contacted
 by someone Monday this week so that we could discuss exchanging with an SP 6. This Tuesday, I received an email, identical to the one above - but with the request to decide, otherwise, my case would be closed - but no call. I wrote the Twitter team that I'd
 continue to wait for a phone call and answered the email, asking them not to close the case as I still was in contact.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
As of today, I did not receive a phone call, so I called the support again. After 10 minutes of conversation (it brought nothing new), the connection broke.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
I don't know what to do.</p>

    <title>How to stop indexing media files in Windows Media Center Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j m bunch  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop indexing media files in Windows Media Center Xbox 360 extender&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've successfully set up the Xbox 360 Windows Media Center and attached it to&nbsp;a Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit machine on the same LAN segment.&nbsp; It works fine, except that it rebuilds its file index seemingly from scratch every time it is launched on the Xbox.&nbsp;
 Specifically, if the Xbox is turned off then turned back on, and WMC on it is launched, the files in the Windows 7 machine's media library folder are indexed again).&nbsp; This makes&nbsp;WMC on the Xbox&nbsp;nearly unusable, as it requires you to wait for quite a long time&nbsp;for
 user interface to become responsive every time it is launched after turning on the Xbox.<br />
<br />
This does not appear to be a network issue, as I've reconfigured it every which way (both wired and wireless),&nbsp;the Network Tuning tool always reports excellent results, and once the file index is rebuilt the media files play just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried reducing the number of folders within the media "library" folders on the Windows 7 machine, and have reduced it to a single folder within which the files do not change (meaning files are not added, removed, or modified between Xbox WMC launches).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this behavior by design?&nbsp; Is there any way to change it?&nbsp; I can't find any settings on the Xbox that control this.</p>
<p>The LAN segment is on the Internet, and the Windows 7 machine has had all updates applied as of the time of this post.&nbsp; The Xbox is the new Xbox 360 4 gig, with over 2 GB of free space on the internal memory and another 8 GB of free space on MU's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Skype Messaging Unavailable for some contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Messaging Unavailable for some contacts</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Skype for a while and this is the first time it is stating that the messaging is unavailable for only 1 of my contacts.&nbsp; The strange thing is that it allows the person to call me and message me, but I cannot reply back unless the window
 on the side pops up on my desktop.&nbsp; Also I have no issues messaging the same contact on my Skype app on my phone, the messaging unavailable is only on the desktop.&nbsp; Not sure where the disconnect is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further investigate, what is your device's operating system? What is the version of Skype you are running? Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post.

Thank you!<br />

    <title>Compatibility with Microsoft and other games. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boeingseven-for-seven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatibility with Microsoft and other games.</h2>
                    <p>I have a lot of older games and software that I have used over the years from the Windows 98 days.&nbsp; To name some,
</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Sim-X Acceleration</p>
<p>Microsoft Combat Flight Sim 3</p>
<p>Microprose Falcon 4.0</p>
<p>UBSoft Lock On Modern Air Combat</p>
<p>
</p><p>These above games work fine on my present Windows 7 Pro 64 bit system so does my trusted Microsoft Sidewinder FFB joystick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, if I upgrade to Windows 10, will these still work? Or are they now obsolete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: When I went from Windows XP PRO to Windows 7 PRO the following software below ceased to work.</p>
<p>Microsoft Combat Flight Sim-1</p>
<p>Janes Combat Sims USAF</p>
<p>IL2 Sturmovik</p>
<p>Microsoft Combat Flight Sim 2</p>
<p>Crimson Skies</p>
<p>and Adobe Photoshop 5.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question to y'all is, should I choose to upgrade to Windows 10 will my softwares still work? (Since I am running Windows 7 PRO 64 bit edition, I assume, I will be upgrading to Windows 10 PRO 64bit edition as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eagerly await your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the app is downloaded and installed from Steam platform, name is "Playerunknown's Battlegrounds", when the game was installed and first started, it pop up a window asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device", (I usually click "NO"
 unless I trust or know the details for such request, but it's my friend who just click "YES" on everything before I know what the app asked for, which i think is a very bad habit, lol) Anyway thus I don't know which program I've allowed the app to access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ryley101,<br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)Are you getting any error message while opening any programs like Itunes?<br />
b) Are you facing similar issue with any other program installed in your computer?<br />
c) Did you make any recent changes to your computer?<br />
<br />
I suggest that you start the computer in "<strong>safe mode with networking</strong>" and check if the problem persists.<br />
To do this,<br />
1. Restart the computer.<br />
2. As your computer restarts but before Windows launches, press F8.&nbsp; <br />
3. Press F8, when the boot menu appears select "safe mode with networking" option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue does not persist in safe mode with networking, then try performing clean boot on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Clean Boot Troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party program is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Internet Explorer issues try the methods given below.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to access the site with no add-ons.<br />
1) Click Start,<br />
2) Select All programs,<br />
3) Select Accessories,<br />
4) Select System tools,<br />
5) Select Internet explorer with no add-ons.<br />
If IE does not freeze, then disable add-ons one at a time until you find the add-on causing the problem. You can refer the following link for more information on Managing add-ons:

<span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Internet-Explorer-add-ons-frequently-asked-questions</span></a>&nbsp;
<br />

<strong>Method 2:</strong> You may reset IE settings to default on your computer and check for the issue.<br />
1. Click Start, type ‚Äúinetcpl.cpl‚Äù (without quotation marks) in the Start Search bar and press Enter to open the Internet options window.<br />
2. Switch to the Advanced tab.<br />
3. Click the "Reset Internet Explorer Settings" button.<br />
4. Click Reset to confirm the operation.<br />
5. Click Close when the resetting process has finished.<br />
6. Uncheck the "Enable third-party browser extensions" option in the Settings box.<br />
7. Click Apply, click OK. <br />

    <title>Touchscreen WORKS in Chrome but not in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touchscreen WORKS in Chrome but not in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After allowing my computer (against my will) to update Windows 10 my touch screen doesn't work properly.&nbsp; I have "disabled and renabled" from the Device Manager's Human Interface devices.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did not help.&nbsp; I have scanned for updated drivers and they are all
 "the best for your system" currently in use.&nbsp; I have uninstalled them and then reinstalled them even if they were "the best" available according to the Device Manager.&nbsp; I have viewed the "hidden" drivers and disabled the unused ones.&nbsp; I have taken each driver
 and individually disabled (then tested) then re-enabled, and I know which ones I need and which ones are "in the way"..... Still the same problem....and
<strong>HERE IS THE DIFFERENT PART.....please read carefully.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My system's touch screen <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">WORKS WITH A CHROME BROWSER</span> but
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not </span>for anything in Windows.&nbsp; On my Windows 10 desktop I can touch, drag and move icons, but can not tap or choose them.&nbsp; So the touch screen is being SEEN in windows, just not acted on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type into a search "my touchscreen works with Chrome but not Windows" I see nothing but the opposite problem.&nbsp; People with systems that don't work with Chrome after a Win10 update...but mine is opposite.&nbsp;<strong> It Works with Chrome.&nbsp; NOT Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a better driver for an "HDI Compliant Touch Screen"?</p>
<p>

<p><strong>Version 1703&nbsp; (OS Build 1563.726)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried the calibration but when I touched the crosshair the screen responds with a dark circle around the crosshair, but it doesn't register a tap, single or double, long or short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, IN Chrome, the touch screen works perfectly!&nbsp; &nbsp;I am just running a touch screen photo booth program, and it worked until the recent upgrades (that I couldn't roll back)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just hoping for a better driver that both Windows 10 and Chrome respond to.</p>

<h2>            contains a virus and was deleted</h2>
                    I recently picked up&nbsp;a nasty&nbsp;virus through issues with my flash player, it caused my computer to lock up and give me a blue crash dump screen when signing in at startup. Im running Windows 7, IE9 and Eset Smart Security all up to date. First i attempted
 to restore to a previous point but the virus destroyed my restore points (which i frequently update). Next i booted in safe with networking and attempted to run a scan with eset which was unsuccessful due to eset being comprimised. I looked around and found
 that windows defender, windows firewall and &nbsp;Base filter engine service have all been deleted. I then moved to try and restore eset but i found that i cannot download anything offline without it saying "said named file" contains a virus and was deleted. I
 know these files are clean and i tried to turn off all addons and turn off SmartScreen filter on IE but it continues to block every download. Any Suggestions on finding the root problem or virus in order to fix this?

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please explain HOW A MICROWAVE OVEN actually INTERFERES with a laptop's &nbsp;WIFI signal.... &nbsp;How close must the microwave be to the PC's adapter, for example? &nbsp;When the microwave is turned off and not in use, should it also be unplugged? In coffee shops with
 WIFI facilities, are the microwave ovens degrading the signal quality? &nbsp;

            this is caused by the fact that both a microwave oven and most wifi routers operate at a frequency of 2.4Ghz there is a setting on some wifi routers that allow you to operate at 5Ghz, but this frequency does not travel through walls well, as far as them
 interfering, the microwave should not&nbsp;broadcast its frequency outside of the microwave, and most wifi routers broadcast in every direction, the radio waves then bounce off of the walls and envelope the room and other areas as well, it is not a line of site
 signal, so&nbsp;unless&nbsp;you have your computer very close to the microwave you should not get any interference at all.&nbsp;or of course if you stick the wifi router inside the microwave.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps,</div>

    <title>Unable to watch Shared Recorded TV shows in Media Center under Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to watch Shared Recorded TV shows in Media Center under Windows 7.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have two computers running Windows 7.&nbsp; One, which I'll call Tower, is running Ultimate and has a dual-tuner installed.&nbsp; The second, which I'll call Netbook, is running Home Premium.</p>
<p>When I record a show on Tower, it shows under Tower's Media Center in Recorded TV.&nbsp; If I use Netbook and try Media Center, there are no shows listed, just the message: "Windows Media Center could not find any shared libraries on your network or there is
 no content in those libraries.&nbsp; For information about using shared libraries, see Windows Help."</p>
<p>I have verified that my Homegroup is running correctly, and everything else works fine.&nbsp; Also, on Netbook I can watch the shows on Tower by using Media Player to access the shared library Recorded TV.</p>
<p>If I copy a show from Tower to Netbook, it shows in Tower's Media Center as a Shared Recorded TV show on Netbook.</p>
<p>I have removed and reinstalled Media Center on both PCs without any change.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on what I should try next?</p>
<p>Don</p>

Hello.</p>
<p>I've done that and it works.&nbsp; That's how I've been watching the shows, but I would like to get the shared shows working correctly, because doing it this way, it doesn't always show the metadata about the shows, such as the synopsis.</p>

            <p>I did a clean install of&nbsp;Windows 7 64-bit Home when I bought a SSD for my OS drive. That resolved my issues. Probably not what you wanted to read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I highly recommend a SSD for the&nbsp;OS&nbsp;in conjunction with a traditional hard drive to store your recorded TV shows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate the cause of this issue, we need to ask you the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Following the update that you have done to your computer, have you installed any other applications, software, or program in your computer?</li><li>To the fact that it is also possible that after the update, compatibility issues may arise, we want to ask you if you have also updated your devices and drivers?</li><li>Have you encountered any issues while you where doing the update?</li><li>Have you tried to boot in Safe Mode and check the CPU usage?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

            I contacted Microsoft Support.&nbsp; They help me identify that a cloud based backup service (idrive) was creating the problem. Windows Defender was monitoring it and processing it causing the disk usage.&nbsp; When I end the task (idrive service) it goes back to
 normal.&nbsp;

<h2>            Message&#58;  Your copy of Windows 7 might be counterfeit. Unauthorized copy of Windows 7&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Help, I opened my laptop and got this message: Your copy of Windows 7 might be counterfeit. And it gave me 2 options: 1) enter another key and 2) activate/reactivate my copy(if I'm not mistaken). But, instead I chose "cancel" at the bottom right-hand corner
 of the message box.</p>
<p>The message keeps popping up though. What now?</p>

<p>
<span>UPDATE:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Search index getting corrupted on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>On my workstation with Windows 10 RTM, searching programs from the start menu usually does not work. Or it works for a while, after which the search crashes again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In event log there multiple errors like this when searching:</p>
<p>ESENT 174: svchost (2112) TILEREPOSITORYS-1-5-21-1950917831-2560309238-1928759327-1001: The database page read from the file "C:\Users\arttu\AppData\Local\TileDataLayer\Database\vedatamodel.edb" at offset 282624 (0x0000000000045000) (database page 68 (0x44))
 for 4096 (0x00001000) bytes failed verification due to a page checksum mismatch. &nbsp;The stored checksum was [58702470ccae9049] and the computed checksum was [593b26c4ccbe9049]. &nbsp;The read operation will fail with error -1018 (0xfffffc06). &nbsp;If this condition persists
 then please restore the database from a previous backup. &nbsp;This problem is likely due to faulty hardware. Please contact your hardware vendor for further assistance diagnosing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also errors about corrupt content index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebuilding search index or moving it to another drive does not help. Tried also the search troubleshooter. Finally did a reinstall from scratch but no help.</p>

            Have tried those steps myself, not a permanent fix - works for a while and then gets corrupted again. A colleague has a exact same issue on his workstation.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I needed to reinstall Win 10... &nbsp;I chose "don't keep any files", so the installer deleted the programs, and deleted the files from the C: drive. (Actually I reinstalled Win 10 ~3 times. Win 7's stability was much better!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, the only thing you can do is fully reinstall Windows 10. My Search Indexer works perfectly.</p>
<p>(Working in File Explorer, "Search" (next to start menu's icon), etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good ol' System reinstall, that can solve every problem...</p>
