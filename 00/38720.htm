<h2>            Google Chrome- throttled connection</h2>
                    <p>I have recently reinstalled Windows 10 home edition and have since reinstallation have had a problem with chrome reach the speeds its supposed I had before reinstallation. The internet connection is a fiber-optic network, and browsers such as Edge and IE
 have no problems getting the best speeds. However when I launch Chrome the connection is seemingly throttled down to mere Kbps, I have done everything I know how to do short of just trashing the pc. Is there compatibility issue with Chrome in an update or
 a way to boost the speeds back up to previous standards?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is the issue persisting in incognito mode?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes made or was there any update installed on the browser?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As there is no issue with the other browsers, I'd suggest you to contact Google Chrome Support, who can assist you better on this.</p>
<p>

                    When I save a snip in SAVE AS it is routed to My Pictures but it doesn't appear in My Pictures. If I search for the saved snip using the name that I gave it I click on the search answer and it appears in Windows Photo Viewer after about 15 seconds. When
 clicking on Properties it shows that it in My Pictures but it again does not show it's face!

<h2>            Family Safety - cannot convert to child account</h2>
                    I have an administrator account and each of my two kids have laptops with a separate standard user account. On one of the kids PC's, I&nbsp;cannot change their account from standard to child in order to use family safety.&nbsp; When I go to manage their user account
 and change the account type, then click on child account in the drop down it says "we can't reach the family safety website to set up this child account".&nbsp;

<p>If you burn the ISO to a DVD it's exactly the same as the DVD you bought, you can use either one. A clean install is very easy, and faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom Clean Install Steps </strong><br />
<br />
Times to use: <br />
Moving from XP to Windows 7, or other unsupported in place upgrade paths (ex: Vista Home to 7 Pro)
<br />
Moving from a 32 bit Windows system to a 64 bit system, or changing languages <br />
Don't want to do an in place upgrade, <strong>or you want a fresh/clean install </strong>
<br />
<br />
You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an external storage before doing so. You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows
 7. Here are the steps: <br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external storage device. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool you can use to copy your files (but
 not programs) from your PC, and then transfer them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy the files you want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. Depending on what you have installed you might
 be able to download some programs from the Internet. <br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)." Note: 32 to 64 bit requires you to restart and boot from the DVD.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then you're done - enjoy Windows 7.

<p>Batteries have a specific charge cycles and when they are finished, the battery doesn't charge. Generally batteries wear out after an year or so. Contact the manufacturer for a battery checking utility.</p>

<p>-The console does not detect the hard drive</p>
<p>If your Xbox 360 console does not detect an attached hard drive, try the following:</p>
<p>Turn your console off and then on again.</p>
<p>Make sure your hard drive is installed correctly by removing and adding your hard drive back again.</p>
<p>If you have another hard drive, try it with your console.</p>
<p>Replace your hard drive. You can order a replacement Xbox 360 Hard Drive from the Xbox Online Service Center. Console registration is required to replace a hard drive under warranty (the hard drive warranty is the same as your console warranty).</p>
<p>If the above steps don’t resolve the problem, repair your console (sign in with your Windows Live ID, if prompted).</p>
<p>But in the steps where it asks to send to microsoft... if its a new hard drive just bring it back to the store and swap it out for new one if you have not stored anything onto it.</p>

<p>Is it a new style hard drive or a hard drive for the original xbox? Did you buy it new or used? I ask because I bought a used 60 GB hard drive for my slim,and the first one didn't work.I had to exchange it at my retailer for one that did work. That could
 be your isuue (as madman suggested).</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. It was showing before, but now just disappeared. &nbsp;I tried removing and adding multiple times. I cannot format it because it does not show up. I cannot say for sure when it disappeared. &nbsp;However I just went to play a game and
 it asked to update. &nbsp;I even tried removing all the past updates. Still no luck. I just bought both the Xbox 360 and hard drive within the last month or so.

                    <p>I get off work only to find out I am banned.....i mean it' one day and all but the fact of the matter is I was not home at all. I barey play with people and their explaniation was vague and just said I was cheating. How was I cheating when I was not home. The only thing I did was play warframe, and linked my Fortnite account to my Nintendo switch account. Out of the 9 years I've been on here never once have I cheated. If I can get a better explanation as to why I was banned then I'd be ok. Because if this happens again and this time it' permanent then what' the point.&nbsp;</p>

            If you only got one product key, then you can only activate 1 license regardless you were given both 32 and 64 bit disk. If you need to activate it on another computer, you need to acquire another license.

            Hello Pasta24,<br />
<br />
<br />
Backing up your information and wiping yor disk clean is an option to go.&nbsp; I do believe that may be the easiest route to go.&nbsp; Do you have a Vista DVD?&nbsp; However, you can verify if the additional installation of Vista is installed on its own partition.&nbsp; Simply
 right click on Computer and go to "Manage".<br />
<br />
There should an option called "Disk Management".&nbsp; Normally if Vista was preinstalled on your computer, it should occupy drive letter (C:).&nbsp; (D:) is normally for CD/DVD or Recovery Partition if available.&nbsp; I would recommend backing up your information externally
 prior to proceeding.&nbsp; Simply verify the information in here.&nbsp; ***Do not delete anything yet.***<br />
<br />
Also click the Start Orb and type "msconfig"<br />
<br />
System Configuration should open.&nbsp; Click the "Boot" Tab<br />
<br />
How many OS options do you have listed.&nbsp; Normally, you should have one.&nbsp; The one that sy Windows Vista (C:\Windows) should be the Current/Default OS.&nbsp; If you would please let me know what you see.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
***I would not like to delete anything until we first verify what you have***<br />
<br />
Once all of the information has been verified.&nbsp; What we will do is Delete the partition that is obsolete.&nbsp; Perhaps extend your C: Volume with the remaining free space.&nbsp; Then delete the Boot Record in the System Configuration "Boot Tab".&nbsp; Attempt to boot your
 computer.&nbsp; If it boots successfully, great. If not, its possible the MBR could need to be repaired.&nbsp; Thats where we would boot to your Vista Disk and attempt to "Repair Your Computer" and enter into the Command Prompt and type "bootrec /fixmbr" or b"ootrec
 /fixboot".<br />
<br />
Either one of these options would take care of your issue.&nbsp; If would please follow up with me at your earliest convenience, I would great appreciate it.&nbsp; Please do not perform any of these task unless you are familar with doing this.&nbsp; I will walk you through
 the process.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            Hi  yatharth_23
<br />
<br />This may be an issue caused by a video card device driver update that came down with the Windows Update, please try this
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running       
        </p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run video play troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Video playback &gt; Click and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />2. If you are using Films &amp; TV App
<br />
<br />A. Reset Films &amp; TV App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Films &amp; TV by Scrolling Down &gt; Click Advanced Options &gt; Click Reset
<br />
<br />B. If Reset doesn't work, then you should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Films &amp; TV App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste it
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage Microsoft.ZuneVideo | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.ZuneVideo | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />C. Review below help

<br />
<br />3. Use VLC Media Player as an alternative
<br />It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.
<br />
<br />To download VLC - <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>

<h2>            Does &#34;Windows Hello&#34; not show up for you&#63;, does your perfectly good fingerprint scaner randomly not work after going to Win10 when it worked perfect before&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Well me to.&nbsp; Being in the insiders program, when Windows 10 was first released, this was a big peeve of mine, and I eventually got it working.&nbsp; Then the 10547 update came out, and it broke the XBOX ONE app, my main app.&nbsp; So I reset back to normal windows
 10...AND LOST WINDOWS HELLO...and the use of my fingerprint scanner...AGAIN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BUT I FINALLY HAVE A REAL FIX, NOT MICROSOFTS BASIC ANSWERS AND REQUEST FOR YOU TO BUY A DEPTH CAMERA...ITS A SIMPLE DRIVER ERROR!!!.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer sager, and egisteces603 integrated.&nbsp; I had this idea because my other laptop, a Lenovo x240, works flawlessly with it. I knew it wasn't the camera as it worked before.&nbsp; ALL YOU NEED TO D, is follow this link and download this driver, I
 don't know what it does to the framework that makes the fingerprint reader work again, and windows hello enable, but it does, its from Lenovo, and worked perfect on my Sager P170SM-A.&nbsp; It even says on Lenovo's website its a "general driver" so I'm sure it
 will work on most machines.&nbsp; NOW I WANT CREDIT FOR THIS MICROSOFT, I'm a long time paying xbox and windows customer, and your fixes were WEAK to say the least.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>heres the fix boys - http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds103635</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shout out to Lenovo for being prepared for an awesome new OS, with poor support....</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
please run the Windows Explorer and go to the folder "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\" and copy the file "CBS.log" to your document folder (otherwise you can't open it) and open it with notepad. Now search for broken files. If you only find a few damaged file, replace
 them from the DVD:</p>
<p>http://blog.nirsoft.net/2009/09/17/how-to-extract-missing-system-files-from-the-dvd-of-windows-7vista/</p>
<p>otherwise, make an InPlace upgrade to repair the Windows.<br />

<h2>            There was a problem resetting your PC - new Windows 8 laptop problem</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just bought a brand new Windows 8 laptop but it was the demo model so I want to reset it to factory settings before using it, but I keep getting the message "There was a problem resetting your PC". The refresh option works fine, it's just resetting that
 I'm having issues with.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>I was having the exact same problem resetting my new HP Envy dv6 series laptop, and nothing seemed to work.... I uninstalled and reinstalled updates and drivers, tried fixing the registry, and just about gave up when I stumbled across something that finally
 worked. &nbsp;Your mileage may vary, as this seems to use an HP-based tool, but other laptops probably have some similar software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;First, go to the Windows 8 settings menu from the charms bar</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;Then select the "General" option on the left, and select "Advanced Startup" at the bottom to restart</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. &nbsp;Now, after the laptop boots up to the blue options screen, select "Troubleshoot", and then select "Advanced Options", and then "UEFI Firmware Settings". &nbsp;Selecting reset or refresh from the options screen always gave me the error message and it was
 back to square one.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. &nbsp;Now, I get an ASCII Startup Menu with several function-key choices including "System Recovery", which is what I chose. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. &nbsp;Now, I am then prompted for my keyboard layout, and then I get another blue "Choose an option" screen a little different than the one in step 3, and select "Troubleshoot", but then "Recovery Manager", and "Windows 8".</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. &nbsp;I get HPs Recovery manager menu, where one of the options is "Minimized Image Recovery" which restores the OS to a minimal factory state. &nbsp;Select that one, and wait about 45 minutes while the HP Software installation tool does its thing. &nbsp;It seems
 to take a bit longer to reset the system this way than it does the usual way for some reason, but you don't get near the amount of bloatware.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't entirely understand why this works, and the usual way of resetting the OS doesn't, but I'm guessing that something gets messed up in the registry or some config file, preventing Windows 8 from using some of the system tools. &nbsp;Selecting the UEFI
 Firmware Settings, however, gives us a way to launch system tools from the recovery partition. &nbsp;I'd be curious if anyone else gets this to work, and/or has some insight why it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In any case, I think this is major design flaw: the capability to reset/restore the OS should not be heavily dependent on the installed OS, since people usually want to do this only after the OS itself is messed up. &nbsp;Also, the fact that you have to plow
 through so many menus to find the right solution is also an indicator of poor design (this critique applies to much of Windows 8).</div>

                    I want to adjust the scroll speed in Microsoft Edge so that it scrolls faster/is more responsive. How can I do this? I am using my Microsoft Surface Laptop's built-in track pad to scroll.

<p>Hello Andre, I appreciate your swift reply. I don't think that there is anything wrong with the scroll speed in Edge that needs to be repaired, I believe it is working as it is intended. However, the problem is that for me, the default speed seems slow.
 Specifically, I feel as if I need to scroll more than I would like in order to advance down the page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new laptop, out of the box with only default apps installed. I followed your instructions anyway and nothing has changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to manipulate the default scroll speed?</p>

            Hi Andrii
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to this folder: c:\Windows\System32 
<br />
<br />Make sure that there is a copy of MSVCR71.DLL in that folder
<br />
<br />If that file exists, we need to re-register it:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button and type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose  Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />regsvr32 msvcr71.dll
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if the issue is resolved
<br />
<br />If not, open Command Prompt again and run this command:
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />Wait for that command to complete and restart your PC       
        </p>

    <title>How to delete graphics card driver update through cmd&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to delete graphics card driver update through cmd&#63;</h2>
                    I recently updated my graphics card driver for my nvidia graphics card and after restarting my computer, I got stuck on an automatic repair loop. Im pretty sure that updating it caused this to happen so I want to know if there is any way to delete or uninstall
 the update through cmd or if there is any other solution for this.<br />
<br />
I viewed a system boot log diagnosis through the cmd command: ( c\windows\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt )&nbsp; and found this in the notepad text<br />

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing details about your concern. <span>Since you mentioned that the issue started after installing an update,<span> t</span></span><span><span><span><span>he<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Windows Recovery Environment</span><span>&nbsp;</span>(WinRE)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>can
 be used</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to access<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>the System Restore option that may resolve</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>this issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just to verify, do you see the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Advanced options</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>button on the Startup Repair screen? If yes, just click that button and you should see this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c113075d-cb56-483c-afcf-e2c17fdf62de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c113075d-cb56-483c-afcf-e2c17fdf62de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From this screen, follow this path:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; System Restore.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>This option reverts your PC to an earlier point, called a system restore point. Restore points are created when you install
 a new app, driver, update, or when you create a system restore point manually.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Choose a restore point created before the issue occurred. Restoring your PC to an earlier point will remove updates and drivers installed after the restore point was made. It won't affect your personal files.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Let us know if the
 issue persists after performing System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to your response.</span></p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>it may be best to check out the GTA5 Rockstar forums for that issue, for example you could try the steps in this thread: <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/communities/public/questions/201001118-GTA-Online-Mechanic-won-t-deliver-my-car" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.rockstargames.com/.../201001118-GTA-Online-Mechanic-won-t-deliver-my-car</a></p>
