<h3> monique d&#39;amour  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not detecting TV after windows update to Fall Creator Edition</h2>
                    <p>Windows recently updated my operating system to the Fall Creator's edition. I had previously been using my TV as a second monitor via HDMI to view movies. After the Fall Creator's update was completed windows no longer detects my tv. I have already done
 the following things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the HDMI Cable on another computer - It works</p>
<p>Checked for updated monitor drivers - I have the current driver</p>
<p>Checked for updated graphics drivers - I have the current driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion computer that's 1 month old. display was working just fine prior to this update. I cannot get the windows 10 to detect the tv. I tried to add the tv manually there is no place to do this on the display screen. I've searched all over
 the web, there are countless problems with some suggestions but nothing has worked to correct my situation. I don't know what else to do. At this point this situation is BEYOND ridiculous. Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hello Mandeep,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The entry in the task manager, ‚Äúprogram‚Äù might be a third party application on startup. You may try the following methods, to make sure your computer is protected.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong>
</span><strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‚Äò<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>‚Äô.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Run a Virus Scan</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would recommend you to run a complete virus scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner. It will scan the computer for viruses and malicious programs. To download it and know more about it, click on the link below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Disclaimer: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to that, I would suggest you to uninstall the applications that you do not use, to do so refer to method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Uninstall, change or repair a program</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may uninstall the application that are not in use. It will also improve the performance of your computer. To do so, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/uninstall-change-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/uninstall-change-program</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists,
</span><span>I would recommend you to include a screenshot of the issue to help us understand the root cause of the problem and provide appropriate solution steps<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>BSOD Video TDR Failure &#40;HP Probook 4540s&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v&#237;t‰õzslavboch  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Video TDR Failure &#40;HP Probook 4540s&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Since probably november I¬¥ve been having issues with videocard in my notebook (HP ProBook 4540s with AMD Radeon). I¬¥ve had multiple BSOD, mostly Video TDR Failure but some others so on December 15th I performed factory reset (usually after BSOD I had
 to run system restore which took over 3 hours!).</p>
<p>It was perfect, everything worked well, but last days suddenly my screen went black again and computer rebooted. Yesterday after it went black (and I wasn¬¥t doing anything graphically demanding, just browsing web), then I got BSOD with Video TDR Failure
 - atikmdag.sys, and I couldn¬¥t boot it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System repair didn¬¥t work, I tried to restore it back to factory setting, that didn¬¥t work either, rightaway I got the message that system can¬¥t be restored to factory settings, what I was able to do was the system restore, so I went back to Dec 15th, right
 after I restored my computer previously (btw. since than only software I installed were MS Office, one old game and WinRAR) - It took almost FIVE hours to restore the system!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned off swichable graphics in BIOS (which I had previously when I restored system back to factory settings), AMD is not visible, nor is the Catalyst Convertor installed). It must be without latest Win10 update since It has old Windows Store Icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it¬¥s some kind of software issue rather then hardware since It worked well for couple of days after the factory reset.
<strong>But I need to know, what shall I do now? </strong>I will finish my work, I wasn¬¥t able to do yesterday evening since it crashed, will download Windows 10 iso from Microsoft and create Windows 10 USB boot drive so I can do factory reset should I need
 to. But what shall I do then? Should I turn graphic on and reinstall AMD drivers (I had the latest AMD and Intel from HP page for my laptop&nbsp;eventhough&nbsp;that one of them was older then I had before, those on HP web are from 5th August 2015)? Won¬¥t I have same
 issues? The AMD Card is the reason I chose this model so using it without videocard makes no sense.

            From Microsoft:
<br />
<br />We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters. The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for all versions of Windows 10 to delete the 22.19.128.0 driver from the system and recover the recommended driver version (8.970.100.9001):
<br />Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon, and then select Device Manager.
<br />Expand Display adapters, right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab and verify driver version is 22.19.128.0.
<br />Select Uninstall Device.
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.
<br />The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen Device Manager.
<br />Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />Recheck the driver version.  If it still reports 22.19.128.0, repeat steps 4 to 7 until the recommended driver (8.970.100.9001) is re-installed.  If this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here.  If a different driver version is installed, follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.  
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />1. If you have an AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters read this. If not skip down to 2.

<br />2. More troubleshooting for all regardless of your adapter make or model:
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver - OK.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />3. If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller

            Hi Lee,<br />
<br />
You still have an option to reset the password if your friend has forgotten the password to the tablet. If he's using his Microsoft account, then here's
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/2b74d21c-ce0d-4a81-ad67-7cc5103a5f83/how-to-reset-your-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reset the Microsoft account password</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
Once the password has been reset, just restart the tablet and log in as normal.<br />

    <title>XBox Live Reputation System Blatantly Fraudulent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loftiertuba590  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Live Reputation System Blatantly Fraudulent</h2>
                    
<p><span>Everyone knows the player reputation system is flawed because it invites childish people with a grudge to abuse it and skew the reputation of innocent players. However, it seems
 to me that the bigger issue is the fact that the system is outright fraudulent, as it does not work the way Microsoft claims. The proof is visible on the account of anyone who actively plays online with random strangers and has been avoided by even one other
 player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you look at your rep, the first statement you'll see at the top left under Summary is, "Of the people you have played: __% preferred you or did not submit a review about you."
 The last 1/2 of this statement is a blatant lie. If the first percentage actually included folks who "...did not submit a review about you." the percentages would be in a constant state of flux for folks who actively play the online games with random strangers.
 Every single player you meet for the first time would have either a positive or negative impact on your rep, but that is not what's occurring.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I play Happy Wars online several times a week with 4-30 random strangers in each round. Since there are currently 17,028 other players in my league, most of the people I meet
 on the battle field are folks I'm playing with for the very first time. If Microsoft's statement were true my percentages would change at the end of every match, yet they nearly always stay static. The only time they change is that very rare occasion when
 someone takes the time to submit a review, and that one review causes a significant change in the percentages.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The way the system currently operates a single person opting to "Avoid" you can do significant damage to your rep, even when you play with hundreds of people a week who don't
 leave a review. Then there's no way to repair the damage that's been done, because most people aren't going to "Prefer" a stranger. If things worked properly, a little damage to a good player's rep would be quickly negated by all the folks who didn't leave
 a review. I‚Äôve left feedback for Microsoft asking them to repair the code so that the system operates in accordance with their own statement, i.e. include the players who did not submit a review.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I honestly believe most of the griping about the reputation system would dissipate if they would simply repair the code and make it work as they obviously intended. A good player's
 rep would be restored with continued online interactions with new folks, and a bad player's bad rep would actually be indicative of their bad behavior. Until they fix this the XBox reputations are literally meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to see this repaired please add your voice to the Feedback Forum. It‚Äôs easy to ignore a single voice, but an army of voices can bring about
 change.</span></p>

<p>Hi there THEOWENKILLER. &nbsp;I honestly thought the reputation was linked to the XBox Live account rather than the type of console you use. &nbsp;If the rep is in fact handled differently for each system then I can only speak for the 360.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft is in affect committing fraud and we live in a sue-happy world, their attorney's will most likely advise them to correct the situation. &nbsp;Of course they could take the lazy way out and just amend their verbiage on the reputation screen rather
 than debugging, but that's where many voices coming together in a mature, respectful and intelligent manner could make a difference.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope to see the reputation system working properly rather than scrapped. &nbsp;There are those few rotten apples that spoil the fun for everyone and need to be weeded out. &nbsp;If the system worked as Microsoft claims, then a few inappropriate hits to
 one's rep would quickly be trumped by all the people you encounter who aren't avoiding you.</p>
<p>I would love to hear some brain storming on how to discourage people from leaving inappropriate reviews out of spite. &nbsp;Perhaps when someone leaves a bad review it should come at a slight cost to their own rep. &nbsp;Not enough to discourage leaving the occasional
 negative review where it's deserved, but enough that it will get costly for those who make a habit of leaving a bad review every time they lose a game, have a friend request declined, don't like a forum post, etc. &nbsp;Any thoughts?</p>

<p>What have you got to complain about with A: a free account and B: no gamerscore?
</p>
<p>Happy Wars requires you to have a Gold account to play online. Your rep goes down if you have been playing without consideration of how online gaming works.</p>

<p>I've had two profiles including this one over the years. Never had the rep change from 100% ~ 0% Obviously haven't received enough positive reviews on this one (had it nine months or something) to get it to 5 stars. And AFAIA it only takes about 5 reviews.
 I could just ask the friends on my friends list to review me if I cared enough. lol</p>
<p>But anyway, 100% ~ 0%. That's with hundreds of Mortal Kombat fights (and having pictures of guys snarling into their Kinects sent to me after they've lost) tons of hours of ME3, Space Marine, Max Payne 3, RDR multiplayer etc.</p>
<p>I'd be interested to know what about your rep is being impacted. the specific sub-categories. It's only really good as an indicator in what you need to improve about yourself. (Exceptions being sore losers leaving negative reviews. Who are, incidentally,
 few and far between.)</p>
<p>My little foster brother is 12 and played a lot of Happy Wars. His rep percentages are awful and I can understand why. He nevers shuts up on the mic, when he has nothing to say he does his own sound effects, when he party's up he tells other people what
 to do. When they don't do it he stops playing properly.</p>
<p>I'm almost certain there'll have been complaints filed in the past and enforcement is pending. lol But I'm his Parent Account now. He's banned from Happy Wars (he spent ¬£96) over a couple of months, on Happy Tickets, under my parents' nose. I reduced his
 friends from 99 to 10, 1 person abroad and 9 kids from his school. The Family Timer is set to 3 hours a day. He needs my password to download anything, accept friend requests etc. He can only talk to, and message friends.</p>
<p>Bleh. Point is... his Rep. The Rep I'd never seen move on my accounts... was a decent guage for the way he behaved. If you stand out in communications in a negative way, stand idle or mess about in team-based objective multiplayer, or, maybe just suck enough
 to annoy somebody. That somebody will let their annoyance carry them all the way to your profile to "Avoid This Player".</p>
<p>Positive reviews are rarer, because people are expected to play a certain way... the majority do play that way... and it's so normal it doesn't motivate people to review them positively. lol So their rep remains either 100% - 0% ... or generally heavily
 weighted toward the positive in any case.</p>
<p>Maybe all the fault for your negative reputation doesn't lay entirely on a dodgy rep system. Is uh... what I'm saying. {XD</p>

<p>That's what you get when asking for intelligent input on XBox Forums? &nbsp;Why the assumptions? &nbsp;I have way too much time and money invested into Happy Wars to leave my rep vulnerable to folks who prefer scratching and biting on the forums over useful interactions.</p>
<p>If anyone has anything productive to say I'm all ears. &nbsp;To those who just wish to lash out, all I can say is that your demonstrating to the world where your strengths are, and it's nothing to be proud of.</p>

<p>If you compare my rep at the beginning of this thread to what is was by my next post just 4.5 hours later, you'll see exactly what my problem is with the current system. &nbsp;My only online activity on this account has been on this subject, and folks decimated
 my rep in under 4.5 hours because they didn't agree with me. &nbsp;For those responsible I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for so elloquently demonstrating my point.</p>

    <title>update Window 7 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arielehuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            update Window 7 Professional</h2>
                    <p>Only updates that include the 64 info in the title of the update are being allowed to successfully update. The code was 6BB, then changed to a #d one, but I didn't get that written down. I've tried the download of the Repair.bat as administrator and that
 didn't work. I've run </p>
<p>Troubleshooters that have come up and they think they've fixed everything, but still only a few updates can download. This has been true since February. I thought they were downloading as I've re-tried updating previously and eventually the update window
 will say "no new important updates"--but those still had failed...updater just seems to have given up on them.</p>
<p>Help! I bought this hard drive for $800 last year to replace the one with Vista that was always difficult. That plus the tech's hours make this an expensive mistake. Does anyone know how to fix this without reloading Win 7?</p>

<p>You replaced the HDD last year, is that correct?</p>

            <p>I replaced the hard drive with Windows 7 Pro already installed last year...all the programs from my old HD put on for me.&nbsp; Updating worked until this February.
</p>
<p>Seems to be on the 64 bit as those are the only updates that install. All updates download but most don't install.</p>
<p>I don't use Internet Explorer but Mozilla Firefox 47.0 (x86 en-US).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code I'm getting is 80246007. </p>

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3020369,</a></p>
<p>as just recommended by another person on MS community, the only change was that update said Never for the "most recent updates."
</p>
<p>The update program DOES check for updates and download them, but only installs ones that say 64 on them, though it did just allow one from Dell without that # in the title of the update.
</p>
<p>Thank you for helping,</p>
<p>Ariele</p>

</p><p>1. How did you install Windows 7 on the new HDD &amp; what installation media did you use to install it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9, IE10 or IE 11 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Yes, I know you don't use Internet Explorer - but it's part &amp; parcel of your Operating System. If IE's not working properly and/or not fully-patched, Windows isn't either. Note: Support for IE10 &amp; earlier ended on 12 January 2016.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is it a Dell computer that came with Vista preinstalled or did you use a Dell (OEM) disk to install Win7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Can you successfully upgrade to Firefox version 47.0.1 (or higher)? </p>

<p>PA Bear:</p>
<p>Trying to do this right and finding it so confusing. Sorry about all the stuff I'm doing wrong. I really am attempting to follow rules and provide answers, etc.</p>
<p>1) Forget about the Vista--it's on the old computer but is why I went to a computer with Windows 7</p>
<p>2) KB3170455, KB3168965, KB3163245 all installed on 7/14/16.</p>
<p>3) KB3170106 also installed on 7/14/16.</p>
<p>4) Explorer 11 says June 10, 2016 (that's for the most recent 11 update, I believe...except that I got the one today that bumped it up to the next level).</p>
<p>5) It says: You have version 22,0,0,209 installed (Adobe Flash Player).</p>
<p>6) Since Feb 12, 2016 most updates have failed--HOWEVER, some have succeeded--those with "x64-based systems" in their names and one other: Dell Inc. - Display - Dell SE198WFP(Analog).<br />
7) I do not believe I've run either of those removal tools. <br />
Please tell me if I should change my update setting back to allowing updates.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and help,</p>

            <p>We'll still&nbsp;need to "dig a little deeper" here. Please answer <em>each of the following
</em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Dell&nbsp;computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Have&nbsp;you ever done a Repair Install and/or a clean install of Windows 7 since you bought the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you replaced the hard-drive&nbsp;since you bought&nbsp;the brand-new Dell computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Chances are (99.99%) the Dell computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your #1 troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Your list of <strong>Installed Updates</strong> says that <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> [sic] was installed on 10 June 2016, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Were you running Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9 or IE10 before you installed IE11?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. When (exact date, preferably) did you disable Windows Update (automatic updating)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. What are the KB numbers of the last four (4) failed updates according to your
<em><strong>Update History</strong></em> (this time) and what error number(s) is associated with each failed update? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt;&nbsp;</em>Is <strong>Java Version 8 Update&nbsp;101</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt;

<p>We'll still&nbsp;need to "dig a little deeper" here. Please answer <em>each of the following
</em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Dell&nbsp;computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Has Windows 10 ever been installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Have&nbsp;you ever done a Repair Install and/or a clean install of Windows 7 since you bought the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you replaced the hard-drive&nbsp;since you bought&nbsp;the brand-new Dell computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Chances are (99.99%) the Dell computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your #1 troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>4a. Your list of <strong>Installed Updates</strong> says that <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> [sic] was installed on 10 June 2016, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4b. Were you running Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9 or IE10 before you installed IE11?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. When (exact date, preferably) did you disable Windows Update (automatic updating)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. What are the KB numbers of the last four (4) failed updates according to your
<em><strong>Update History</strong></em> (this time) and what error number(s) is associated with each failed update? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>1a) 11/03/15</p>
<p>1b) no Windows 10</p>
<p>1c) Nope</p>
<p>1d) The Dell computer I have is refurbished...I don't have any other hard drive (except for the old Dell)</p>
<p>2) "C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 16.0.1\avpui.exe" 589 days left on subscription</p>
<p>3) No Norton of McAfee which I HATE as I previously had exactly that problem...on another computer. There's NONE on this one that I find in program check.</p>
<p>4a) I'm assuming that was the updated version. I had Explorer on this computer when I bought it 11/03/15. I used it until a boss insisted upon having Firefox.</p>
<p>4b) So I think the answer to that would have to be yes, given the answer to 4a.</p>
<p>5a) Yesterday as "Elder" on MS community said to do that and then Thrashdrive repeated that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; FYI--code 6BB at one point switched to code 80246007 maybe on a different update fail.</p>
<p>6) in order to do this in Explorer, I have to leave this page, so I will continue answering after I try the things you're asking for that require a new window in Explorer.</p>

<p>The error code indicates that the Microsoft Account you're signed in with (or at least the OneDrive bit of it) has been migrated to the new platform, which means that the photo email feature you've been using no longer works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll either have to send the pictures as attachments in the traditional way, in which case they will be at full size, or embed them in the message body where you can resize them and apply other&nbsp;effects. You'll find instructions - and a solution for cases

<h2>            Cannot delete user account</h2>
                    I was having a problem with the permissions on the computer.. which seems to a rather popular problem here.&nbsp; But moving on, I fixed that with the registry hack program but during my adventures to fix the problem I made a test account to see if it was just
 mine.&nbsp; Turns out the answer was no, but since then, I have not been able to delete that user account.&nbsp; There is no delete button in control panel and it is
<em>this account only</em> .&nbsp; All others have the option.<br />
<br />
Is there a command for cmd that I can use or something so I can get rid of this account??<br />

Weird. I dont know what it means but either way thanks for your help.&nbsp; I'm going to reinstall windows 7 because I've been having so many problems.&nbsp; I chose to upgrade from vista instead of a full wipe so I'm hoping it will eliminate the numerous problems I've

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 910 earphone jack not working</h2>
                    Hi, I recently purchased the Lenovo Yoga 910 laptop from the microsoft store, but there seems to be a problem with the laptop. Every time I put in my headphones into the laptop, volume only comes out of one side. I have to twist and turn the headphone
 plug into the jack for quite some time for both to work. I have tried multiple pairs of headphones and all those headphones work perfectly fine on other devices. Is there an issue with the laptop? Can I fix this myself, or would I have to get the laptop exchanged?&nbsp;

<p>I have only come across one gold ingot, and one ebony one. I have also found these mine vanes but I failed to carry a pick ax with me. If you are just roaming around the land head toward any mountain areas here you fine those mine vanes. I am sure you will
 fine what your looking for there but I will check the wikia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ebony Ore locations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blackreach, There are some deposits near the rivers when traveling west from the waterfalls to the south.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gloombound Mine, due south-east(roughly 4 o'clock) of Windhelm inside the orc stronghold of Narzulbur. - 1 in a bucket next to the smelter, 1 in a cart next to the bridge (stealing), 3 in a cart next to the entrance to the mine (stealing), 17 ebony, and
 5 iron veins inside the mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mzulft, southeast of Windhelm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redbelly Mine, north of Riften, in the town of Shor's Stone - 3 Veins, 3 ebony ore next to smelter in shor's stone (sitting on crate), 1 ore inside the bucket on the carriage next to the smelter (at the end of the bridge - careful, don't push it off the
 cliff).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throat of the World, very top of the mountain. - 2 veins</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Fails Every Time</h2>
                    <p>For 2 months now, every day my laptop downloads a Windows 10 update, restarts to an error message (Error Code 80004001).&nbsp; I've tried restarting with no peripheral devices plugged in.&nbsp; I've tried running the update trouble shooter, but it's not available
 to me for some reason, even though I'm the administrator.&nbsp; I've googled the error code and the issue repeatedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is encrypted with VeraCrypt, could that have something to do with the failed updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who has any ideas, if I can't figure this out soon I'm just buying a new computer.</p>

            Hi Tony..   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you-<br /><br />Doing a clean install will likely be better than any new computer you can buy since they all come with bloatware  that causes these issues.<br /><br /> if these are regular Windows updates You can run the Windows Update Troubleshooter:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantansw...</a><br /><br />If that doesn't help then you can reset Windows Updater:  <a href="http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-update-problems-using-automatic-reset-script/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-update-problem...</a><br /><br />But what I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.

            An encrypted drive, especially with a third party utility such as veracrypt and Windows 10's servicing model could be a factor. Could you suspend veracrypt indefinitely, then try again to see what happens?
<br />
<br />If not, then you probably should perform a new installation see how it behaves.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Please repeat the error code, put spaces between the numbers (the system here is "protecting" you by hiding your "phone number". Yes that is stupid, but the people running this site are too lazy to fix the problem that has been around for several months.)
<br />
<br />Doing a clean install of windows will probably work (for a while) but it is a brute  force approach that will cost you time. Hopefully we can help you fix the problem that is causing the error code.
<br />
<br />
<br />Buying a new computer is another brute force solution. This time it will cost you a lot of money.  And it will only be a temporary solution. It is very possible that eventually you will have the same problem on the new computer.  It is a software problem.

            Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<p>Same problem and then some. This is the <strong>LAST TIME I EVER</strong> update windows. I'll take my chances with all of these security flaws. I had to multiple 'reformats' and do THREE fresh installs of the OS as&nbsp; EVERY LAST ATTEMPT (<strong>save one
 because I didnt let the update through</strong>) at updating to MS's latest security patch garbage resulted in
<strong>dead screen</strong> and or <strong>corrupted scrambled video</strong>, also given my
<strong>limited/near zero access</strong> I was unable to access barely anything even after attempting what seemed like every available operation/fix. Its wonderful how 99% of fixes require desktop access, and when this useless OS wipes that out? Best of luck
 to you, cross your fingers. <br />
</p>
<p>In summation, thanks so very much for wasting so many hours of my VERY PRECIOUS and VERY LIMITED time MS.&nbsp; Next Win10 meltdown Im going to Frisbee the crappy Win10 disk off my patio and go with Linux, Im tired of being
<strong>forced</strong> to fight this trash.&nbsp; I have relic printers with better software than Win 10.&nbsp; How long you guys been doing this? Absolutely Brutal. Thanks for the headache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Completely PO'd</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the OP, either dont update windows 10 or switch to another OS. </p>

Same error code and fails again&nbsp;during verification. Seems we can't use it now until we can fix the issue.</p><p><br /></p><p>The console is about 7 months old.</p><p><br /></p><p>It looks like many others have the same issue, is there any known fix for this yet?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

                    Hallo, bisher war der Betrieb eines Sitecom LN-306 Printserver problemlos. Unter XP-Pro, W7 Home, auch unterW8-home aber nach Upgrade von XP-pro auf Win8-pro wird bei der Installation der Print-Server-Software NETBios als nicht installiert angezeigt, sodass
 keinerlei Zugriff auf den am Printserver angeschlossenen Drucker m√∂glich sind. Alle Rechner im Netzwerk incl. LN-306 sind statisch adressiert, haben Internetzugriff und k√∂nnen drucken, √ºber Router mit angeschlossenen Printserver. Alle verf√ºgbaren SW-Versionen

            MS decided (they "have statistics") that prove that the "Ribbon" (the design you are complaining about) is more 'user friendly' than the "Menu".  They introduced it in Office 2007 and like a virus it has been busy infecting other programs since then.
<br />
<br />Sorry, MS "knows best" and they do not give us the option of selecting which works better for us personally, the Menu or Ribbon interface (even though it would be trivial to introduce).

            Oh, they don't show them, they just talk about them. It was NEVER about a user choice. It was MS Marketing telling the Office developers there were not enough new features to sell Office 2007, so come up with something more that is "new" ... &lt;says the cynic&gt;

            Hi,  GilbertSam
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend you check the RAM
<br />
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue. </blockquote>

<p>Hello Maritza thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran the memory diagnostics and nothing came back.&nbsp; As soon as it hit the second test at 99% and all the while reporting no errors found it booted the computer and did not display any other messages for me to see.&nbsp; Went straight to the desktop as it is supossed
 to do and started a couple of programs in the shell.startup folder as it is supposed to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your response as a result of reviewing the MINIDUMP file?&nbsp;&nbsp; Please advise. </p>

<h2>            Photo transfer from Android to Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I plug my phone into my PC to transfer photos to Windows 10 Photo App and continue to get the message "We couldn't find anything to import. Make sure the device is unlocked and try again." My PC detects my device, it shows up on MY PC,&nbsp;but when I click on
 it it tells me the file is empty. It used to be so easy to plug my phone in and import pictures.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a lot of factors that might cause this issue. To provide you the appropriate resolution, we would like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any software/hardware changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Is the issue the same when you try to connect other devices on your computer?</li><li>Does your computer recognize the Android device as a media device or storage device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            No, I have not made any changes to software/hardware. When I connect other devices, ie. my camera, everything functions properly. It is being recognized as a multimedia device.
