<h2>            My Powerpoint presentation is corrupt in Powerpoint 2013, help please&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>I've been chatting with Microsofts Helpdesk and they adviced me to put my problem in this forum because there are specialists here :-)</p>
<p>So here we go:</p>
<p>I bought a new laptop, on my old laptop I had Office 2013 (professional, 32-bit) installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my new latop I had Office 2016 to try for a month. Tinkered around with it, updated my presentation many times. Decided to delete Office 2016 because it doesn't add much to my Office 2013.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Office 2013 on my new latop after deleting Office 2016, but now my presentation will open in Office 2013, but when I change someting I can't save the file. The error I get is that the file is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I tried so far:</p>
<p>Deleted Office 2013 with a tool the helpdesk recommended (ran the tool twice).</p>
<p>Made a new account on my laptop with admin rights, still no luck with the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran:</p>
Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
Version: 10.0.16299.15<br />
Image Version: 10.0.16299.334<br />
[==========================100.0%==========================] The restore operation completed successfully.<br />
The operation completed successfully.<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that the file can be opened and changed using Office 2016 which my wife has on her laptop.</p>
<p>So I really think that the file is not corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I tried to open the file in repair mode, still no luck.</p>
<p>I can open and repair the file in Powerpoint 2016 (without any message), then reload it in Office 2013, then it still says it's corrupted when I want to save it. And opening the in Powerpoint 2016 repaired file still is corrupt accoding to Powerpoint 2013
 when I want to save or repair it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file itself is quit large (475 Mb) and it contains 1114 sheets (my work of the last four years).</p>
<p>By the way the switch back to Word 2013 went well, I can open and change files in Word without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I really would appriciate someone who can help me, because I am stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Tom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update1: I've installed a language pack (Dutch, my native language), same result...</p>
<p>Update2: I've found the malicious slide, it's number 333 (no that's not a joke). Removing the slide does not help. I found out by copying slide by slide to a new file, until I hit #333. But by copying all slides (besides 333) to a new file, I loose all my
 50 or so custom slide shows. So I'll keep on searching till I find a satisfying answer and keep you posted.</p>
<p>Update3: YAY, I've solved the problem. Opened the file in Office 2016, deleted malicious slide 333, saved it. Copied it to my new laptop en opened it in Office 2013, and I could save it again. It's a bit trial and error but it works :-)</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Then, go to Format -&gt; Slide Design, choose to show all documents, and choose the corrupt PowerPoint file. Now, go to Insert -&gt; Slides from File, and select the corrupt PowerPoint file. Make sure you are set to insert all slides, and then import. If that works, great! I suspect, however, that you might crash at that point. If so, try repeating the process, inserting specific slides one by one until you find the problem one. After that, save the file, making sure that Fast Saves are off (in Preferences / Save).
<br />
<br />If you are unable to open your PowerPoint files then try PPTX Repair Kit recovery tool. This utility recovers your corrupt and damaged PowerPoint presentations (.ppt, .pot, .pps, pptx and ppsx formats) from MS PowerPoint files.
<br />
<br />Visit:- <a href="http://www.pptx.repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptx.repair/</a> to know more about the tool and download free trial version.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

<p>Hi Jamshed Muhammad,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response! Is there some part missing because your post starts with then. I opened the file, but then I can't find Format -&gt; Slide design....</p>
<p>I tried inserting slides from the corrupted file, but as you suspected, it crashes. To insert specific slide after slide is a very tedious task because there are more then 1100 in there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option that I can think of is buying Office 2016 which seems to work, but I throw away money because my Office 2013 is worthless then. And I am afraid that this problem reoccurs in Office 2016 after a while. The PPTX repair kit recovered three slides
 in the demo version, but they don't look like the original, so that won't do for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h3> joretha  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change from Excel 32-bit to Excel 64-bit</h2>
                    I have upgraded to Windows 10 after I have purchased my new laptop last year. At the same time, I have purchased the 2016 Office online, as it was not available in the shops yet. Now, having problems with big Excel files and Excel telling me to upgrade
 to a 64-bit version, I discovered that, while my computer &amp; Windows are the 64-bit version, my Excel is the 32-bit version. Do I have to purchase a new Office or can I upgrade for free to a 64-bit version - and how?

<p>
</p><p>No need to buy a new license.&nbsp; All office licenses give you the right to run 32 or 64 bit Office as required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to uninstall your current 32 bit Office, then go into the MyAccount site and dig down to find the 64 bit installer.&nbsp; It is on the same page as the Offline and 2013 installer download options.</p>

<p><span>If you need to install Office 2016 without an active Internet connection, or if you're having problems with slow speed or tenuous connections, you can download the offline installer file and then install Office 2016 at your convenience.
 Go to the Wiki link above for instructions with pictures</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note </span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you already have another drive labeled D, Office will create a virtual drive with the next available letter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose <strong>Save</strong>, you can specify where you'd like the image (.IMG) file to be saved. For example, you can save it to your desktop or to a USB drive. On Windows 10 and Windows 8 machines, you can open the file

<h2>            how to increase space between page number and text&#63;</h2>
                    <p>in Word for Mac 2011, I would like to increase the space between text and page numbers (center, bottom of each page except first) WITHOUT changing the bottom margin. &nbsp;Bottom margin should be one inch. &nbsp;page number should be half an inch from the bottom margin,
 which is one and a half inches from the page edge. &nbsp;Format =&gt; Document =&gt; margins =&gt; from edge =&gt; bottom does not address this.</p>

            <p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your description is confusing... at least to me. :-) So let's go back to the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reference point for these setting (margin &amp; edge) is the edge of the paper. Thus a bottom margin set at 1 inch mean that it is set 1-inch up from the bottom edge of the paper. The edge settings control where the last paragraph of the header or footer
 begins in relation to the edge (top or bottom) of the paper. So if you have a 1-inch bottom margin and an edge setting of 0.5 inches, the page number should be appearing 0.5 inches above the bottom edge of the paper and approximately 0.5 inches (you must adjust
 for the point size of the text) below the page margin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the above example if you make the "edge" setting 1-inch, the page number will be appearing very close to your last line of text in the body of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am confused about is your saying the "bottom margin should be one inch... page number should be half and inch from the bottom margin..." but then you go on to say "which is one and a half inches from the page edge." If the page number is to appear
 1.5 inches above the page edge and 0.5 inches below the bottom margin then your bottom margin needs to be set at 2-inches and the bottom "edge" set to 1.5 inches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - Gutter has nothing to do with this. It is a setting that is used along with "mirrored margins" for adding a little extra room that allows for binding the document via spiral binding, ring binding, jiffy binding, etc. For example, to allow for binding
 a document that is going to be printed 2-sided (front and back) and your left and right margins are set to the narrowest (0.5 inches) you would check the "mirrored margin" option and add a "gutter" of 0.3 inches to the outside edge (left). This provides the
 minimum amount of space required so that the binding does not destroy any text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Excel 2016 - Can&#39;t change&#47;edit marker option for data plot</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to edit one data series in a plot with many data series.&nbsp; I want to plot the one data series as a line (with no markers) so it stands out from the other data series.&nbsp; I use to be able to edit the&nbsp;data series in earlier versions of Excel by going&nbsp;to
 marker&nbsp;options &nbsp;and selecting "none" and it goes away.&nbsp; With Excel 2016, when I select "none" under the marker options nothing happens.&nbsp; The data series still has the marker.&nbsp; What am I missing here?&nbsp; I can change the size of the marker, but I can't make it
 go away by checking none. </p>

<h2>            help - Word 2010 image resolutions</h2>
                    Hi all<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get Word 2010 to output my high resolution images at their original resolutions. I have an image that is 400dpi - I insert it into Word (not copy &amp; paste) at 100% and select the
<b>Compress Pictures</b> button (<b>Picture Tools &gt; Format &gt; Adjust</b>) and untick "Automatically perform basic compression on save". Target output is set to 220dpi (the highest available). Also, in
<b>Word Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Image Size and Quality</b> I have ticked the "Do not compress images in file" box. In the PDF the image is 220dpi. No matter what settings I choose I can never get the image to output at 400dpi. If I drop the image into Word XP
 and output the PDF using the same settings I get a 400dpi image.<br />
<br />
I have seen lots of discussion about this online and I've tried everything I've found but without success. In the Advanced options I have also tried changing the default target output to "Document resolution" but that has not help. It must be possible surely?!<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />
PS To make the PDF I am using CutePDF Writer which doesn't lower the resolution of the images (there are no such options - it just prints a PDF of your document 'as is'). I've been using it successfully for years.

So the only options are to let Word decide the best ppi or manually set the ppi with 220 ppi as max.</p>

            You can't do it.<br />
<br />
MS has decided that to "save space" the max image resolution will be 220dpi.&nbsp; You will have to use a different application to get higher resolution.<br />

                    <p>Hello, I have an Office 365 account and can't log into One Drive! I tried the registry fix, that doesn't work either. I have a student account. I can log in just fine to my OneDrive on my (separate) Microsoft account, but I have no subscription on that.
 Please help!!</p>

            Hello Brianna,
<br />
<br />Can you be more specific or share your screen with the error?
<br />
<br />The basic steps to solve issue similar like your are:
<br />1-
<br />Uninstall the onedrive app from the control panel.
<br />and 
<br />Uninstall the onedrive from windows: Go to the start menu &gt; write CMD and open as administrator (Rightclick)
<br />And execute the next Command:
<br />For windows 10 32 Bits:
<br />%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall 
<br />For windows 10 64 Bits:
<br />%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />
<br />2- restart the computer 
<br />
<br />3- install the last version from <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/new-onedrive-sync-client-release-notes-845dcf18-f921-435e-bf28-4e24b95e5fc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/new-on...</a>
<br />
<br />Try to login since the Sync bottom from the onedrive online.
<br />
<br />I hope this help.
<br />Regards.

<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Apologies if this is the wrong forum section, I'm more than happy to repost this to the correct one. I've run into a odd problem with Outlook's Android app and am looking for a bit of guidance.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">In the mobile app, under Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync Contacts, there is a switch to enable this to sync to Android's contacts. The problem that I have run into is that this switch, when toggled on, toggles itself
 off on it's own. Currently, this happens pretty immediately, however when the app was first installed, it would start importing contacts and then turn it off. We are able to successfully import contacts in by adding an Exchange account but we would prefer
 if this instead handled through the app.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">This happens to more than one user using different versions of Android on different phones. On the phone that I'm currently posting for, we've done the following:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Initial install was completed on a fresh version of Android 8.0, phone model Google Pixel XL 2</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Uninstalled and reinstalled app from the Play Store</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Force stopped and cleared the cache from Settings &gt; App &gt; Outlook &gt; Storage</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">The Outlook app is on the most current version; 2.2.131. Is this feature not currently enabled for the Outlook app? Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my testing, it won't switch to off automatically if I toggle on it. So, actually the issue should be related to your clients or accounts. Since the issue happens to different versions of Outlook clients on different phones, to determine if it's
 a client issue or account issue, please try to sign in the test account (I have sent you in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>) in your Outlook client and check the outcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still happens when you sign in the test account, the issue should be related to Outlook client, regarding this, we have dedicated support channel for Outlook for Android. (Go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Help &amp; Feedback</strong> &gt; <strong>Contact Support</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-in-app-help-for-Outlook-for-iOS-and-Android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243#ID0EAABAAA=Contact_Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get in-app help for Outlook for iOS and
 Android</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't happens to the test account, the issue should be related to your accounts. I need to confirm if you are using Office 365 for Business account. If not, you should contact related mail service support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Iry</p>

<p>Hi Iry,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for responding so quickly! I apologize for the delay, the phone is currently with a user that we're supporting, awaiting confirmation that they can add this account now. Once they add that account, should they just try syncing contacts
 as they normally would? Or is there any other configuration that would need to happen?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Did anybody know how to add horizontal bracket using built-in equation tools in word 2013?</p>
<p>The bracket and&nbsp;the annotation is shown as the above pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, so far the built-in equation tool actually does not have this capability?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3> samjolman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Activesync Samsung Blackjack</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Samsung Blackjack that won't sync to a Dell PC with Windows XP.&nbsp; I also have Trend Micro PC-Cillin 12 on my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect my phone to my computer with its USB cable.&nbsp; This initiates Activesync, which starts its green arrows a-spinnin!&nbsp; So at least in knows a device is present.&nbsp; But after a while it simply comes back saying it cannot connect with the windows
 mobile device.&nbsp; I already made exceptions in my PC-Cillin following the Microsoft troubleshooting help on that.&nbsp; I upgraded to Activesync 4.5.&nbsp; And I made sure both phone and computer are USB enabled in Activesync.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm fresh out of ideas.&nbsp; Any thoughts??</p>

            <p>Hi Satya11,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strictly speaking, it’s not feasible to set OOF (Out of Office) for all users in Exchange admin Center. It’s suggested end users set automatic replies by themselves. But, as an Office 365 admin, you may use PowerShell command to set the OOF for each user
 one by one. <span>&nbsp;</span>For more information, please refer to this article: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd638217(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to set the <strong>OOF for multiple users at once</strong>, you need to use a
<strong>PowerShell script</strong> and please go to <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this forum</a> for further assistance.</p>
<p>And if you have any question on this “Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration” powershell command, just feel free to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick </p>

                    Is it possible to use a 4gb card in the E65? There seem to be quite a few available now at reasonable prices.

            To be brutally honest I'm not quite sure why I'm answering your question because I can't help you at all as I don't have a E65 !<br />
<br />
I've looked at the tech spec for the E65 here :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4344228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4344228</a><br />
<br />
and it doesn't specify the maximum size of microSD card it can use !<br />
<br />
I've also looked at the manual here (page 20) here :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_E65-1_UG_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/guides/Nokia_E65-1_UG_en.pdf</a><br />
<br />
and it doesn't say either !<br />
<br />
So unless another user has actually tried one which works and can tell you, I'd say your best bet would be to go into a computer shop that sells 4Gb microSD cards and ask if you can test it for use in your E65 - trouble is most places are online nowadays !<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - at least partly - I did try !

            Thanks Edward,<br />
<br />
I appreciate your honesty and help.<br />
<br />
I guess its just a case of either spending £10-12 on a 2gb that'll work or spending £30-50 for the extra capacity.<br />
<br />
I suspect that unless I get a definitive answer that its compatible I'll buy 2-3 2gb cards and a little case.

            Hi<br />
<br />
The difference in SD memory between 2GB and below to 2GB and above is the file system that was changed from fat 16 to fat 32.<br />
<br />
in short SD cards 2GB and above uses fat32 and you can find the statment that Nokia E65 supports both fat16 and fat32 in the user manual (also available as a download on nokia's site somewhere)<br />
<br />
hope it helps to you and other people

This is a good point - although I can't confirm whether this extends to phones, but if it IS true then the E65 supports cards larger than 2Gb as page 20 states it supports FAT16 and FAT32 file systems.<br />
<br />
If you have any other devices that use a SD/MMC card, you could always buy a 4Gb and if it didn't work you could then use it in your other device that takes a SD/MMC via the use of an adapter.

            Currently the E65 can not make use of a 4GB or above memory card, so the maximum is presently 2GB. This may<br />
(but don't hold your breath) change with a new firmware release.<br />
<br />
This has little if anything to do with FAT 16 or FAT 32, but more to do with it's present inability to read or write to SD-HC memory cards.

            The only Difference between SD and SD-HC is the disk format they use. Fat16 can only address less than 2 gig hence needing Fat32 to address it correctly.<br />
<br />
The SD-HC is only marketing to make it easier for consumers. Depending on the devices (like a lot of cameras) SD-HC cards will still work once formatted in the device but you will only see 2Gig of capacity not the full 4 Gig or more.<br />

            If the phone has S60v3 feature pack 1, then it will support the SDHC cards.

When I used excel office in past, I could produce what we call a "climate graph" <br />
that is a column graph (for rainfall data) AND a line graph (for temperature data) in one, using two "y" axes<br />
Now I am using Mac office I can not seem to do the same thing... any advice?<br />

<div>Insert a column chart with both series (rainfall and temperature).</div>

<h3> robertolsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 printer error</h2>
                    Running Office 2010, Windows 7 home premium, and an HP Laserjet 2035n connected as a network printer. All apps print fine except Outlook. When printing an email, the 2035 shows a cartridge error which I clear by pressing the ok button on the printer. Then
 the 1st page prints ant the printer shows a paper jam. I clear by pressing ok, the next page prints, and another paper jam error and so on. There is no actual paper jam or catridge problem, just the error light on the printer. Word, Excel, Acrobat all print
 fine, only Outlook causes errors. Suggestions?

            From memory the E90 is mini USB not pop port so it will not be comatible with the pop port connector on the CK-7W.<br />
<br />
You will have to try bluetooth.

<h2>            Images in email messages are replaced by a red &#34;X&#34; in Outlook 2010  Email on Windows 10 Pro 64</h2>
                    <p>This has just started in the last few days and all Windows 10 updates have been applied. Messages that use images for links are replaced with a red X and&nbsp;a message that the "Linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed,
 or deleted. Verify that the link points to the correct file and location."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is Windows 10 Pro 64 bit and I have a Office 365 Home subscription. The Outlook 2016 is updated, which may have caused this problem in the first place.&nbsp;This includes the UPS My Choice e-mail notification e-mail, one from National Geographic,
 and The Upworthyiest daily e-mail. Others appear to be fine. I checked my security settings regarding downloading images under File|Outlook Options|Trust Center|Automatic Downloads and the option "Don't download pictures automatically in HTML email messages
 or RSS items" is unchecked. Not sure what other settings might affect this but again, it's only on some select e-mails that had been fine just a few days ago. I do know that there were new Windows updates that included Office 365 but can't say that's the issue.
 It isn't a big deal but it is a bit annoying so anyone have some suggestions on troubleshooting I'd welcome the feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

            <p>I have tried the steps outlined in the above link but Mail does not appear in the list of Options in the Outlook section of the registry. There are only the following: Calendar, Flagging, General, MSHTML, Reminders, ToDoBar.</p>
<p>This problem with a lack of graphics in emails began only recently. I am running Windows 10 and Outlook 2010 and bother are fully updated.</p>

            <p>Registry edited and no change. An answer would be helpful. Below is a copy of that key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e4df5b2-a83c-4d16-bf74-2c7753dc6fe5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e4df5b2-a83c-4d16-bf74-2c7753dc6fe5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I also question the terminology where 32 bit is a DWORD and 64 bit is a QWORD. This is on a Windows 10 64 bit system. I have no idea what version my subscription is or if there is a 64 bit version of Outlook. This is a bit confusing.</p>
