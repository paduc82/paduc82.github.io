                    My son's computer, which has Windows 10 and that he logs into with his Microsoft account linked to our family account, has suddenly stopped reporting activity and is not limited by the limits I set. &nbsp;Previously it was working fine. It still shows up in
 my family account as his computer but does not report activity. &nbsp;I tried removing and re-adding him the the family account and it has not helped. &nbsp;

            I have this exact same problem that started recently - within last 10 days. &nbsp;I set up two children under the family account. &nbsp;Both children have Microsoft Accounts and log into the Windows 10 computer that they use with their Microsoft Account Logins.
 &nbsp;It appears that the recording of activity is simply not working. &nbsp;I have tested this by logging into their accounts and opening and using apps/games/browsers. &nbsp;Even when using MS Edge
<em>nothing </em>is showing in their accounts under activity. &nbsp;It was previously working but then just stopped. &nbsp;I am running Win 10 on both my computer and the one they use. &nbsp;Activity Reporting is turned on and the "Email weekly reports to me" is checked.
 &nbsp;The weekly reports are still being generated and emailed. &nbsp;There is just nothing in them. &nbsp;I also tried deleting and re-adding their accounts to the Family Account. &nbsp;This did not work for me either. &nbsp;A little frustrating given that I thought this would be
 a good feature for parents. &nbsp;

            Sounds very familiar. &nbsp;Have tried many of the same steps. &nbsp;One other thing I have noticed is that my son's desktop is no longer showing up under devices both on my family screen and on his own account screen. &nbsp;I assume this is connected. &nbsp;

            I have done everything and all is set up correctly. &nbsp;I have restarted the computer. &nbsp;But I have also noticed that the computer no longer shows up under 'my devices' on his account screen (even though he is currently logged into it) and on my family page
 under his account.

    <title>Missing User Account After Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silent54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing User Account After Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 using the free upgrade. Initially during the upgrade and configuration, I was using my account or profile. However, didn't see my wife's account at login. After install and setup was complete, I was updating
 a few programs out of date due to the upgrade, restarted, and at login only my wife's account was present. No option for me to login. I looked in the Settings/Accounts/Family &amp; Other users and there isn't anyone else listed except her. I still have a file
 under users on the C drive but not sure how to fix this without having to create a new account. There is also a profile for my account under System Properties/ User Profiles. During initial setup when I was logged in, my desktop setting were exactly how they
 were with Win 7. So, no clue as to why my login profile is no longer available for login or user switching. Thanks

</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your issue, however&nbsp;you&nbsp;can follow the steps below in order to bring the missing user account in a group.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open administrative Command Prompt.</span></li><li><span>Paste following command and press Enter:</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net localgroup ‚ÄúAdministrators‚Äù [Computer Name]\[Missing User] /add</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Basically, it seems that it wasn't visible because the missing user didn't belong to any group. &nbsp;Add them to a group and it all comes back. You can see all the profiles at "<strong>View Advanced System Settings</strong>" under the "<strong>Advanced</strong>"
 Tab, clicking Settings under User Profiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

            <p>We&nbsp;have a similar problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our Windows 7 machine had two local&nbsp;accounts; one was an administrator user, the other was a non-administrator user.&nbsp;
<strong>Note&nbsp;that neither of these&nbsp;accounts required a password.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade was performed by the administrator account.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the upgrade, <strong>
the administrator account was missing</strong>.&nbsp; Only the general account was accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The remedy above does not work in our case because we are not being allowed to perform administrator operations.&nbsp; The security dialog pops up but will not authenticate because it

            A remedy that was suggested between here and another Win 10 forum site, did nothing for me. I did solve my problem but not sure if it will work for you without an admin account. Since my profile folder was still accessable on the C drive under users. I
 copied that to another drive. I had to create a brand new account and one at a time folder by folder copied and pasted almost everything from my profile folder to the new account. The only areas I didn't paste over were anything related to Windows. This first
 time I tried this, I pasted everything and I lost access to specific things related to Win 10 because I probably pasted Windows data only related to Win 7. So my second attempted worked without any hitch. ONly thing lost was my old username.

            <p>This is not helpful. That command doesn't work. When I was on the phone with Microsoft support they tried something similar and it wouldn't work because the random account that was magically created is now the admoinistrator and I wantr my old administrator
 account back.</p>

            This problem first showed up in August of 2015. &nbsp;Here it is 10 months later and Microsoft has not changed or fixed the problem. &nbsp;We had 6 user account on our church computer. &nbsp;The update to windows 10 failed to properly convert 3 of the accounts, especially
 the administrator accounts. &nbsp;All attempts has asked for the password for the one administrator that does know their password. &nbsp;Microsoft should be sued for allowing this problem to continue to plague customers for this long. &nbsp;No telling how many wasted man
 hours this problem has caused and will continue to cause.

            <p><span>I think that this instruction would have been more helpful to the typical non-techincal user by instructing the user to first go to the Control Panel (by right mouse clicking Start) and
 clicking on System, then in the left column, clicking <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>, (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span>
<strong>View Advanced System Settings</strong>) etc., to determine their computer name and the name that is missing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then you can suggest that one copies the command to Word or an available editor and replace [Computer Name] and [Missing User] with the appropriate information before opening the Command
 Prompt.<span>&nbsp; </span>The user can then copy and paste the command having now used the syntax of the command correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I think that Microsoft can do much better than that when helping a non-technical person, don't you think?</span></p>

                    I am getting a generic error (corrupt or missing files) when installing windows 8 pro 64 bit OEM. The computer was just built and has no OS. I have tried installing using several different optical dives, USB, SATA and the install errors at 6% every time.
 I tried making an ISO of the DVD but i could not copy the install.wim, in addition nero could not either. I have tried on several computers to no avail. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

                    <p>I see people having problems with the store not working in the beta version of Windows 10. I upgraded free to Windows 10 today and now my store doesn't work. Just shows it loading and nothing happens. What do I do?</p>
<p>

            <p>Maybe you check your system files by using the System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>I discovered, that I also could not access internet via Edge and figured, that this based on the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start elevated Command Prompt (Win+X -&gt; Command Prompt (Administrator))</p>
<p>2. Run sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with the scan still running, I could access web within Edge and use the Store again soon after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I solved it, or found a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to disable two-step authentication in my MS Account Security settings. As soon as I disabled that, the store opened without a problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 encountering Driver Power State Failure.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Need help with my new Toshiba high end laptop(Windows 10 Driver Power State Failure)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got my new Windows 10 Laptop from Toshiba. It is 15 inches, has an i76700HQ processor, 4k, 16 GB Ram, 512 GB SSD and a 4GB NVidia 950 GTX Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting today, every 30 minutes or so no matter what I am doing the Blue Screen of Death appears and restarts the computer using the "Driver Power State Failure" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a lot of research on how to try to fix this- I updated all my drivers using DriverEasy. Before that I went into Safe Mode and entered devmgmt.msc in the run dialog box and got a list of all the drivers. 2 of them had a yellow exclamation point under
 them- firmware and general pnp monitor. I uninstalled them and then got the up to date drivers. Anyways, I went back and checked and they still are yellow in safe mode. I tried again to get the newest drivers but it says it is up to date!!! This is so frustrating!!!
 There are yellow exclamations by them in safe mode indicating the drivers need updated but when I try to update them they say they are up to date lol. What a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, the Driver power State Failure error still comes like clockwork and I have to restart my whole computer. The safe mode driver thing didn't help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted McAfee and added Avast. Then I thought maybe Avast was doing it so I uninstalled it and use Windows 10 defender. Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone walk me step by step how to see what the problem is and how to fix it please????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going crazy here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 on screen keyboard disappears after typing first letter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericshockley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 on screen keyboard disappears after typing first letter</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I'm looking for information/help on an issue with my tablet (Surface Pro 3) that I purchased a few weeks ago. &nbsp;Whenever I type using the on screen keyboard, the keyboard disappears after typing the first letter (it does this when the keyboard
 is attached and not attached). &nbsp;Is this a setting that I need to adjust or is it something to get fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

            As an update, this only happens with Chrome. &nbsp;When I use IE the keyboard does not automatically appear and I have to click the keyboard icon on the lower right part of screen (but the keyboard does not disappear when I begin typing). &nbsp;I tried selecting
 the keyboard in Chrome BEFORE I started typing but it still disappears. &nbsp;After I bring it&nbsp;up again it does not disappear.

            <p>I also have experienced this annoying problem while using Chrome. At this point, the only solution I have found is to type a search directly into the address bar at the top of the home page instead of into the Chrome search box in the middle of the home
 screen.</p>
<p>It may not be an ideal solution for some, but it works. The on screen keyboard does not go away after the first letter is entered.</p>

<h2>            Adding Screensavers</h2>
                    
<p>I'm very computer savvy but I cannot figure out how to add a downloaded screensaver to the screensaver list so that it stays there!&nbsp; I followed the directions from the provider, in this case, Disney, and it shows it on the list right after the download.&nbsp;
 I clicked apply and save but then when I open the screensaver settings, it is not there!<br />
Ugh, so frustrating.<br />
Can someone help me?<br />

            Hi pash189,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I suggest turning off your anti-virus temporarily while you reset the screen saver to the Disney themed screen saver.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't resolve the issue, you can perform a clean boot to see if a startup program is conflicting with the screen saver:<br />

<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to
 reset the computer so that it starts as usual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend
 that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.

<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.

</strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <strong><span>Service</span> </strong>
list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong><span>Service</span> </strong>
list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the <strong><span>Service</span>
</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong><span>Startup</span> </strong>
tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span> </strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Restart</span> </strong>
.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong><span>Startup Item</span> </strong>
list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <strong><span>Startup Item</span>
</strong>list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span>
</strong>check box in either step. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether
 the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span> </strong><span>Collapse this image</span>

<p><span><span>Hi grammy5,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>We would like to know does this happen with one file type or shortcut of particular application or is it with all desktop shortcuts?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Was it working fine before? Do you remember any recent software or hardware changes made on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the below methods and let us know if that helped</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>You can perform system restore. Restore the system to the date it was working fine. Below link will
 help you perform System restore: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</a>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Re-build icon cache</span></strong><span>. Steps to follow:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open
<strong>Windows explore</strong>r, Click organize and select ‚ÄòFolder and search option‚Äô</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><span><span>Select View tab,
<strong>select</strong> the option <strong>‚ÄòShow hidden files and folder and drives‚Äô</strong> and
<strong>uncheck</strong> the options <strong>‚ÄòHide extension for known file types‚Äô</strong> and
<strong>‚ÄòHide protected operating system files‚Äô</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Navigate to C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right click on IconCache.db and click on Delete.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Yes to confirm the deletion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>NOTE: This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Close the windows explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Empty the Recycle Bin.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>viii.</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span>Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ix.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you go back, you will notice the Size of the IconCache.db file is smaller, and the Date Modified is now the current date.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>NOTE: If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much, then just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>x.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The icon cache has been rebuilt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Method 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You may even check the file association </span><span>type of files is set appropriate. Steps to follow:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on start, in search box type in Default Program</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Associate a File type or a protocol with a program</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Locate for different file type, check Current default</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If it‚Äôs different then select Change program tab
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select the application</span></span></p>

    <title>Disabling the User Login for windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling the User Login for windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Back when I was using Windows 7, my laptop would open directly to my desktop when started.&nbsp; I prefer this, because my roommates use my laptop for general use.&nbsp; If I want to use email/Skype/whatever, I go to the website's login page and login as normal.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After downloading Windows 8, and now with 8.1, I instead have to login when the laptop starts up, which then means anyone who uses the laptop has access to my email, also I get automatically logged into Skype, so I get calls from people when I do not want
 to take calls, etc etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone please tell me how to adjust the settings so that the laptop doesn't force a "user" to sign in at startup, but rather just boots straight to desktop?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thank you</p>

            <p>Hello Anil,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've checked these threads and tried using a local account.&nbsp; The problem is then this local account does not have access to my files (music, videos, documents, etc.) that were previously just stored on my hard drive/desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to allow the laptop to boot up without signing into a Microsoft Account?</p>

            I think you misunderstood.

            <p>Yes, but I don't want to have to login to the Microsoft account either, and/or I want my roommate/whoever to be able to watch saved movies or access files, but I don't want them to be able to access my email.&nbsp; Even being automatically logged into my main
 email account is frustrating because I must log out of it first in order to log into another email account..&nbsp; Is there anyway to have the laptop function without an associated user account like it did&nbsp;with&nbsp;Windows 7?</p>
<p><br />

<p>thank you,</p>

            Then your only option other that to create a new local account for your room mate is to use web mail.
<div>I think you are trying very hard not to use the functions the OS gives you.</div>
<div>You can SHARE files and folders between local users so that's not a problem.</div>
<div>I'm not sure WHY you don't want to use a Microsoft account...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or maybe (shock horror) get your room mate to buy his or her own computer.....</div>

            <p>Yes, I am trying very hard not to use the functions the OS gives me because they are inconvenient for how I use the equipment.&nbsp; I'm unclear&nbsp;why it's necessary to try so hard when this basic functionality was standard for so long.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't think suggesting my roommates spend &gt;$500 is a reasonable solution just so they can access documents and files without giving them access to my email&nbsp;&nbsp;in the process.&nbsp; It's like Ford saying "we're going to weld your rear-view mirror in place for
 you when you buy the car.&nbsp; If your wife wants to&nbsp;drive it,&nbsp;she can either stop whining about not being able to see behind her, or buy her own car.&nbsp; You'll like it better this way, trust us".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your post is, however, the first I've seen&nbsp;to suggest sharing folders across local users.&nbsp; This may be a reasonable workaround.&nbsp; I've now&nbsp;tried this by logging into the administrator account, right-clicking on the folders in the "my computer" directory (My
 Pictures, My Music, etc) and clicking "Share" then selecting the new local account I set up to share with.&nbsp; When I log into the new local account, the files/documents/music etc are not showing up in the folders.&nbsp; Is there another step I have to do?</p>
<p><br />

<p>Use the second option to disable your password, located farther down in the article.&nbsp; The first option will not work if you are using a Microsoft account.&nbsp; The other option you may be interested in is the pin.&nbsp; This is a four digit code that you use to login.</p>
