<h2>            Screen Saver Not Working with Dual Monitors in Windows 10</h2>
                    Have extended display and only have screen saver working on one monitor. The other is black. Everything else is working fine. Can anyone provide a way to make this work? The monitors are large in size and there is a robust graphics card used on the workstation.

<p>Hi Patricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the possible reasons why the screen saver shows only on one of your monitors is that you have an outdated graphics card. For us to better assist you with your issue on screensaver, please answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any updates to your computer before experiencing this issue?</li><li><span>Have you tried turning off the second monitor while assigning the screensaver slideshow to the primary monitor?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried disabling and re-enabling the screensaver?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

            The graphics card and all equipment is brand new. We have a number of large applications (Navisworks, AutoCAD, Revit) that reside on this workstation. We have tried even using one of the basic screensavers (ribbons, bubbles) and the second monitor is still
 black.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Wireless loses internet connectivity randomly</h2>
                    <p>I work in an enterprise environment that is having a global issue with internet connectivity on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a user logs in to our wireless, using certificate based authentication on a smart card, the user's device shows "Connected, Secured" and they are free to use the internet without issue. After an unspecified period of time, the connection loses access
 to the internet and shows "Connected, No Internet". This occurs regardless of whether the user is idle or actively using the internet. They also do NOT lose access to internal resources like our intranet or other shared services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happens, the user can disconnect and connect to the wireless again to re-establish the connection without issue. As the network admin, I have verified none of our network&nbsp;devices are going down (i.e. Access Points, Wireless LAN Controller, switches,
 or routers). All of these devices are working properly and hard-wired users do not lose connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs on both Dell and HP workstations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 users are not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does NOT occur for any user when using other commercial wireless networks (i.e. home networks), so I suspect the issue is related to Windows 10 and&nbsp;it's certificate&nbsp;based authentication, which frankly is a headache for all services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried the following settings changes with no resolution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Release and renew the DHCP lease in the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Device Manager</p>
<p>Network Adapters &gt; Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265 &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management Tab</p>
<p>Unchecked "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"</p>
<p>Restarted the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Uninstalled the network adapter and restarted the machine to refresh the driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Reset TCP/IP and Winsock in Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I'm at a loss for how to proceed. Any advice would be much appreciated!</p>

            Make sure the wireless driver is updated from Laptop manufacturer's web site. Also make sure the laptop model is supported by Windows 10. If its an older laptop that may be the cause. If the laptop is still under warranty, have the desktop support tech contact them, they may have a better driver that is not easy to find. Are the laptops affected the same model?

            Hi OdongoBenard.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A new PC with WIndows 10 preinstalled should have a Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware chip on the motherboard.  To check this run ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to look for an OEM-BIOS Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If there is no such key then ask the seller how you are to activate preinstalled WIndows, because it is illegal piracy to sell Windows software without a way to activate it.  
<br />
<br />If you have a Digital License on another PC, it is possible it could be moved to this one if it's the exact same version following the procedure here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.    
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />Servers are overloaded lately so you may get a Try Back later error message.  So you can wait and try back in a day or two.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>Its working, but I wasn't able to choose only one monitor to share, or just a part of my screen. Screen share automaticaly shared both my monitors with no select option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to share only 1 monitor, if I have 2 monitors?</p>

<h2>            Changing default apps from Chinese to English</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a lot of trouble using the default apps from my Windows 10 single language version. I purchased a device in China with Chinese but was able to reinstall and English-language version onto the device with little issue when I first purchased it (as
 baffling as restricting language settings to particular versions of windows is). The biggest problem for me now is that all of the standard apps such as photos, email, store, calculator, skype, etc are all in Chinese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this, When I open the store app, I ALWAYS receive the message, 检查你的连接：Microsoft Store 需要联网。你似乎没有联网。</p>
<p>I am obviously connected to the internet, but the app itself doesn't seem to recognise that it is. While I can read Chinese, I still much rather using my computer in English. I would also like to make use of the Microsoft store particularly for book purchases,
 however, even in Chinese, I cannot access it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify as well, my "Country or Region" is set to Australia, My "Windows Display Language" is English (Australian), and "Preferred Languages" are in the following order: English (Australia); 中文(中华民共和国); and English (United States).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><em><strong>Windows 10 Single Language</strong></em> can only be installed with the default language it comes with. You can still download

<br />
What kind of hotmail account ?<br />
Windows Live Hotmail ?<br />
If yes.....<br />
Open WLHotmail &gt; left side, look for Manage Folders, click it&nbsp;&gt; on the new window click NEW. The rest is self-explanatory.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you remember making any hardware or software changes recently?</li><li>Have you installed any third-party security program in your computer?</li><li>Are you facing any issues with other Microsoft apps?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you to try the following methods to diagnose and resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><span>I would suggest you to run the Modern User Interface app troubleshooter to resolve such issues with apps. Refer to the link:
&nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
<br />
<br />
</span><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Troubleshoot problems with an app</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the Microsoft article above, it will guide you through some basic troubleshooting steps which help you diagnose and resolve basic issues with an app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, refer to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Clean Boot</span></span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more,
 follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting’.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 4:&nbsp; D</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">isable proxy settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Start <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the<strong>Tools</strong> menu.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the Tools menu is not displayed, press ALT to display the Tools menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Click the <strong>Connection tab</strong>, and then click on<strong>LAN settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Uncheck the “<strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN check box</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e. Select and check "<strong>Automatically detect settings</strong>" under "<strong>Automatic Configuration</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>f. After above step try opening website and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope these methods were helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried these methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Which Operating system are you using?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you try connecting the keyboard to different USB port and check if it works?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Were there any recent hardware or software changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to use On-screen keyboard and check if you face similar issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Type without using the keyboard (On-Screen Keyboard)</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-without-using-the-keyboard-On-Screen-Keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-without-using-the-keyboard-On-Screen-Keyboard</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to connect&nbsp;and disconnect the keyboard and check, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Shut down the computer.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Plug your device into the correct port. Make sure that the plug is pushed securely into the connector on the computer.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer. Microsoft Windows detects the change, and then installs the drivers on the new port automatically.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue continues to occur, try connecting the keyboard to a different computer. If the keyboard functions correctly on a different computer, the port to which the keyboard was connected on the original computer may be damaged. If this is the case,
 contact Microsoft Hardware support:</p>

<p>I rang 0800 587 1102 the gold premium pack is something for an xbox console I have no idea what it is as I only use a pc but someone bought the same thing using my account and many many other peoples accounts. They usually play for a little while on FIFA
 12 which is a surprisingly good way for a company to boost its game up the charts. MS believe the problem may lie with us all having an EA account and as EA make and sell FIFA 12 there seems to be a link. If you own an xbox you can report it and lose your
 account for months or swallow the loss and change your password... either way it's a lose- lose situation for us the customers.</p>

<h2>            Windows updates too big  for my tablet  PC</h2>
                    Why does Microsoft keep making windows 10 updates so big to the point you can't download them onto a tablet without doing a fresh install? I am Getting fed up with these updates, and getting apps I will never use&nbsp; and can't uninstall or move to the sd
 card, and only take up space on my hard drive. It should be the user's choice on which apps they want.

<h2>            Security mechanisms put in place by Microsoft, a real pain</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I am not happy at all with the recent changes in security policy being applied by Microsoft when using Skype. It used to be so much more user friendly. This is why I am feeling upset: I have configured a tablet for my grandmother, with
 Skype easily reachable. She presses the icon, and then she calls me. She is afraid of anything of a technical nature, any question such as “enter account name and password” would be a good reason for her to abandon using the tablet. With the new procedure
 put in place by Microsoft, she got a request to verify her details (apparently it will come every so often), which means entering an impossibly (for her) long chain of characters, one for the email address and the other one for the password.</span></p>
<p><span>Needless to say that she cannot do it. Skype is then blocked, as she cannot enter the requested details on her own.</span></p>
<p><span>I thought I would be able to deal with this issue remotely, by entering her Skype details on the web at
<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com</a>, and signing into her account (I have all details needed, email, password). It asks how I want to recover the code, I enter her Microsoft registered email address and wait for the code to arrive. When it arrives,
 I then enter it into the web site. I thought this was it.</span></p>
<p><span>But no, someone still needs to log her onto the Skype account from the tablet. The code is not requested at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that later on, the problem cropped up again. I had this time to provide a mobile phone number and a verification code was sent to it.</span></p>
<p><span>My grandmother is incapable of doing this and the only way for me to deal with it, is for me to go to her place, which may take a couple of weeks, at best, as we do not live close to another.</span></p>
<p><span>Skype has become a kind of lifeline for my grandmother, hence any brilliant idea on how to deal with this issue would be most welcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And by the way, does anyone understand what event or circumstances triggers this security mechanisms?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hello Pierre2020,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand why this is upsetting. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please provide us the exact error message your mother is getting with regards to unable to sign in to Skype.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><em>Note: Make sure not to post personal identifiable information for your security and privacy.&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Security info is the key to getting back into an account if you ever forget your password or if someone tries to break into your account. Without that info, you could permanently lose access to your account, your games, apps, subscriptions, email, photos,
 and files so we occasionally ask customers to confirm their info is accurate so that doesn’t happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will never use security info for any reason other than to send security codes and send notifications when there are problems with your account. Also, we will never share your security info with anyone else for any reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps us. I look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>I &nbsp;got as far as the end of point 2, "press Enter" and nothing happens for 30 min so I found another post that says restart the pc then, which I did, so I restart and see I an signing in as "administrator" all good click and now I have a black desktop with
 just the recycle bin, the start button does not work the search-box does not work either nothing works whether I right or left click. The only thing I can do is click the recycle bin and it opens a window with a popup "Location not available" C:\WINDOWS\System32\config\systemprofile\Desktop
 is unavailable" ans so on, if I click "ok" and close the pop-up I can see the usual windows explorer with empty library's and "Local disc (c) which I can click on, and navigate to find my way to control panel and open "User Accounts" but when I click on anything
 to manage/change user accounts nothing happens, I seen to be logged in as an administrator without any power to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way I have tried all the other suggestions in the advanced options/trouble shooting, I tried to restore to previous settings, told me I had no restore points. Tried to reset and keep my files....but that did not work either</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been searching the net and watching YouTube videos for <strong>THREE</strong> days and still cannot find a solution, I never had any problems with windows 7. Looks like the next office upgrade will be MAC.</p>
<p>I would be grateful if someone could help me fix this</p>

            <p>Hello Rakesh,</p>
<p>Thank you for your fast response and the suggested repair. &nbsp;So the good news is I have my pc back and working again, thank's, &nbsp; but the bad or not so bad news is I have lost all my desktop icons and in file explorer all the library's are empty(:</p>
<p>When I started my pc and inserted the ISO dvd it started, and i clicked to run and went through the Reinstall with save all apps and files.........Setup&gt;Run&gt;Preparing&gt;Getting updates&gt;We are getting things ready&gt;Updates&gt;Making sure you are ready to install.
 Installing Windows 10, a fresh reinstall.. I suppose I should have stopped the dvd and restarted my pc and booted from the drive to find the steps you suggested above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is not lost however, I have the os installed on a 128Gb SSD C\drive and I had a second hard drive 1TB partitioned (E(f)(G) &nbsp;where I saved 97% of all my Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos, so I have access to what I have stored there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do you know if there is a way to find the missing 3%, I reinstalled using the "save all apps and files" but as I said my library's are empty, or were they somehow deleted when reinstalling, &nbsp;I have all my apps when I click ALL Apps in the start menu but
 no desktop icons, I can always re-download these anyway. </p>
<p>The other thing is I was using Chrome and I had some websites bookmarked that I relied on daily, but now when I open chrome or Firefox they look like fresh copy's without any bookmarks, is there anyway that I can restore the old chrome app to find my bookmarks,
 or were these lost/replaced with the reinstall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ran my 360 total security scan and it tells my that I can clean up 2.6GB of space including&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Windows installation temporary files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1662 files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.9GB</p>
<p>b) Windows WinSxs Backup Cache &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2103 files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 257.3mb</p>
<p>c) Google Chrome Browser Cache Files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;550 files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 186.4mb</p>
<p>d) Windows 10Edge Browser Cache files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1697 files &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 101.1mb</p>
<p>(d) &nbsp;various other files of smaller sizes. </p>
<p>I have not clicked to clean this yet as I am wondering if my 3% of files and bookmarks could be among this clean up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will await your guidance and once again thank you for your help. &nbsp; Dermo.</p>

Windows WinSxs contains windows files to add features of OS IIS, hyper V etc. like Windows files to upgarde from Windows 10 Home to Pro or other versions but as it is cache file you can remove it as it is not necessary for updating or other use.</span></p>

            My sincere apologies. It is not possible to change Skype ID / Skype Name. This is one of the heavily demanded features and under consideration by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />However, you can change your Display Name.
<br />
<br />Login to your account
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here

            You can change your Skype display name, but not your Skype ID.
<br />
<br />If changing your Skype ID is what you want to do, you would have to create an entirely new Skype account and make sure you choose the right ID.

    <title>Desktop icons messed up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vyron.efstathidis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop icons messed up</h2>
                    <p><span>I’m using windows 10 for 2 weeks now. 3days ago I realized a problem with my desktop icons. All of them were arranged automatically and not as I had them (according to my needs).</span></p>
<p><span>First let me say, I have already checked, auto arrange is NOT on. I've also not right clicked my desktop and clicked sort by &gt;. This problem is happening on boot up, I can move an icon to a different spot, reboot and it will be moved back
 to the left side of my screen.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Except from this I also realized something else.<span>&nbsp; </span>
When I am opening a folder to see my files (any folder) they are arranged in details view and not in large view as I had them. If I change the view and fix them it is ok, but when I will close the folder and reopen it they will be again in details view.
</span></p>
<p><span>For your information I have auto arrange off as well as having the "allow themes to change..." box unchecked.</span></p>
Any suggestions here on how I can stop the icons from moving??

<p>Getting something very similar. After reboot the left-hand-most column of icons empties and the icons add themselves to the bottom of the next columns over.</p>
<p>Also, I have to try several times before the icons can be put back, e.g. After putting the top LH icon back into position, if I then add another icon to the column they both jump away again.</p>

<p>Also, I have to try several times before the icons can be put back, e.g. After putting the top LH icon back into position, if I then add another icon to the column they both jump away again.</p>

<p>Changing the Text and App size setting back to 100% cures the problem. Doesn't help my eyesight but it does cure the problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows Server  2012  setup cannot find a location to store temporary files</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to upgrade Windows 2008 R2 DataCenter to Windows 2012 DataCenter</p>
<p>I use the image en_windows_server_2012_x64_dvd_915478.iso - either unpacked on C:\ &nbsp;or burned on DVD</p>
<p>From DVD - upgrade is not allowed and I am referred to setup operation from Windows 2008</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When starting Upgrade I get the all Blue screen with "Install Now" followed by failure discussed many times Microsoft forums:</p>
<p>Windows Setup cannot find a location to store temporary files.. Error code: 0x80070490</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is plenty of disk space in Windows 2008 disks, also on Boot disk I created a big (16GB) partition just in case.</p>
<p>It does not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From all posts on this problem - I did not try yet the ones related to AHCI - not sure the relevance/importance.</p>
<p>The hardware is a old IBM server Intel Xeon 3Ghz 64Bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea is welcome</p>

            Hi Ernie,
<br />
<br />Windows does not have an application for that . .. 
<br />
<br />You would need an image editor that has enhance, sharpen, median  . . . and a few other filters and tools
<br />
<br />GIMP, is totally free and has those tools. Please note, it takes time to learn these tools and to know just by looking at a photo, which tool to use and when . . ..
<br />
