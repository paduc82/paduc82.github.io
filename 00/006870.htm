    <title>Access primary key auto-numbering malfunction - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access primary key auto-numbering malfunction</h2>
                    <p>I have a large access database that originally did not have a primary key field.&nbsp;&nbsp;(By large I mean 21,034 records totaling 127,952KB.) Recently an IT staff person told me the reason for instability of the database was partially the server (which was corrected)
 but also partially because&nbsp;of the&nbsp;lack of a primary key field.&nbsp; An auto-number primary key field was inserted.&nbsp; It worked for a bit but now is no longer following the numeric order but is instead choosing extremely large random numbers.&nbsp; Is something wrong?&nbsp;
 If so, how do I fix it?&nbsp; I ask because all of my smaller databases are auto-numbering perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;numbering example is this:</p>
<p>21000</p>
<p>21001</p>
<p>21002</p>
<p>21003</p>
<p>21004&nbsp; (this auto-numbering was working)</p>
<p>396176916 (then it began choosing these random numbers)</p>
<p>854736018</p>
<p>1229040776</p>
<p>1427489020</p>

            <p>If there is a real need for sequential numbering you must compute them yourself, an autonumber is not guaranteed to do this.&nbsp; You'll find an example as CusomNumber.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
However, it seems that your only purpose in introducing the autonumber column was to provide the table with a key, in which case the values are irrelevant as they will never be exposed to users.&nbsp; The fact that you appear to have been operating this database
 without this table having a key does make me wonder how data in it were referenced?&nbsp; One of the fundamental rules of the database relational model (Codd's Rule #2) is the Guaranteed Access Rule:<br />
<br />
<em>Every datum (atomic value) in a relational database is guaranteed to be logically accessible by resorting to a combination of table name, primary key value and column name.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the fact that your refer to the table as a <em>'database' </em>mean that you have only one table in the file?&nbsp; If so it almost certainly is in need of normalization by decomposition into a set of correctly normalized tables.&nbsp; A database is almost without
 exception a set of such tables.<br />

            <p>It sounds, as Mimmo suggests, that the counter property of the Autonumber field was changed from increment to random. As Daniel told you the value of the autonumber doesn't really matter as long as the value is unique. I'm not sure what will happen if you
 change it back to increment, it will probably start with an increment of the highest value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not be a problem as it sounds like you may only have one table. Pleas elt us know if that is the case so we can advise how to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't see any need for sequential numbers.</p>

            <p>Thank you all for your input.&nbsp; I feel much better knowing I do not have to worry about the randomness of the primary key number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give you an over view of my situation and please freely offer advice and direction&nbsp;for&nbsp;improving the coordination of my data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The records I have are municipal cemetery records - individual demographics, burial location, deeds issued, monuments installed/photos of such, other legal transactions such as assignment/transfer/re-sale info, along with pdf document scans etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have 3 Access files, some with multiple tables and each with many queries and/or reports.&nbsp; Currently those reports are specific within one access file but are not related to the other files.&nbsp; The three files&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &nbsp;Allburials = Name, death date/place, birth date/place, burial location, registry#, next of kin, military info, funeral director, information notes, type of interment/disinterment (21,000 + records)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Deeds = Name, burial location, date of purchase, cost, assignment/transfer/re-sale information and dates, registry #, monument info&nbsp; (eventually I hope to add fields for pdf scans of these documents&nbsp;and pictures of the monuments&nbsp;into additional fields)
 (approx. 15,000 records)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Pre-needs = Name, burial location, who is meant to use location&nbsp; (approx. 3,000 records)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought process was this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; I knew the main data file (Allburials) would be very large. &nbsp;The "registry #" would eventually be the primary key field, however, I could not make it a primary key at the time of creation or even now because of duplicity.&nbsp; I have approx. 500 records
 that do not have a unique registry # but instead that field is noted with "Ledger".&nbsp; This means that these records are pre-1900 and pre-issuance of an actual burial registry permit.&nbsp; These records&nbsp;are simply a written line in a historic&nbsp;ledger book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; My original idea was that each access file would contain the "registry #" and would therefore allow me to build relationships that would tie&nbsp;all the data together for reporting purposes.&nbsp; That, however, is not going to work.&nbsp; I also cannot use the
 burial location as a primary key because multiple people are sometimes buried in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I had not assigned a primary key because I could not decide what that common key should be between the three access files.&nbsp; I did not place all the information into separate tables within one access file because I knew it would be too large and I was
 concerned over stability of the files.&nbsp; We are a satellite office from the city's main servers and have regular issues with speed and connectivity.&nbsp; I knew eventually I would want to connect the three access files for reporting purposes but have not reached
 that state yet.&nbsp; It was one of our new IT personnel that required me to add a primary key field&nbsp;at this time to each table.&nbsp; When I added that field it assigned a chronological, unique number to each but then as I continued to add new records, the number became
 extremely random which made me concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been suggested by others that all this information be moved out of Access and into Sequel but I have little to no experience with that or what it would entail to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again everyone for your willingness to offer helpful suggestions.&nbsp; I know enough "to be dangerous,"&nbsp; so to speak, but hardly enough to comfortably use the program to its potential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First, your database should be split into a back end (tables) and a front end (everything else), you can have multiple back ends if it gets too large. You can also have multiple front ends if you want one application to have different functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are limited to a maximum of 2Gig in file size. Can you check the size of all your files and see what that totals to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, yes you should have had a primary key from the beginning. A relational database requires that you use unique identifiers. Even if you did not have some natural key or combination of field to create a key, you should still have used an Autonumber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your main problem now, is that, even though you have added a Autonumber PK, because you didn't have a PK in the beginning, you have nothing to tell which child record goes with what parent. Before you can go any further, you need to make sure every table
 has a Primary key and that every table that relates to another table has a foreign key that identifies the related record.</p>

            Your database is not large in terms of the number of rows in each table, so should be well within the capabilities of Access, and with a good design should in itself perform adequately.&nbsp; A sine qua non is, as Scott says, the splitting of the database into
 separate front and back ends.<br />
<br />
On the basis of your description of the table structures, the only possible candidate key at present for AllBurials would appear to be a composite one of Name and Burial Location, being the only two columns in Pre-Needs.&nbsp; Whether these two columns in reality
 constitute a candidate key on which the tables can be related only you can say, but if they do then it would be possible add an autonumber column, BurialID say, to AllBurials as its key, and update corresponding foreign key columns in Deeds and Pre-Needs,
 enabling you to delete the redundant Name and Burial Location columns from Deeds and Pre-Needs.<br />
<br />
As regards the incorporation of photographs and other ancillary documents, you can do this by storing the path to the location of such documents as text in columns in a table or tables the database, and building in the means to open them from within the database's
 front end on demand.<br />
<br />
Performance issues arising from your network infrastructure are a separate matter of course.<br />

    <title>Update Values from Formulas Between Two Workbooks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update Values from Formulas Between Two Workbooks</h2>
                    <p>I am working in Excel 2010.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>If I write in workbook A a link to a specific cell in workbook B, and while A is closed I change that cell in B, then close B, when I open A, it will ask if I want to update, and then will automatically update and show the new value from B.
</li><li>If I write in workbook A <em>a VLOOKUP formula</em>, the same holds true.&nbsp; The formulaic value will update if I say "Update."
</li><li>However, if I write a SUMIF formula in workbook A that points to source file workbook B, the formula will fail (ERROR) to update between workbooks if the source workbook B is closed.</li></ul>
<p>My questions:&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this functionality the design of Excel 2010, or am I experiencing an error?&nbsp; It seems odd some functions work between workboooks, and update, but others do not.
</li><li>If this is the intended functionality of Excel 2010, is there a way to trick this into working?&nbsp; Currently, the workaround in use is to make a worksheet in workbook A filled with direct links to workbook B, since these direct links will update, and then
 on my first worksheet in workbook A, I write my SUMIF formulae to the link worksheet to B that exists in A.
</li><li>If this is the intended functionality of Excel 2010, what other functional limitations are there when working between workbooks?&nbsp; I know VLOOKUP and single cell references will update successfully, but SUMIF will not.&nbsp; What other functions will not update?
</li><li>If this is NOT the intended functionality of Excel 2010, is there a specific update/service pack I need?</li></ol>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Harvey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, SUMIF formula requires the other workbook to be opened for calculation, otherwise it gives an error (which I presume you got).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using SUMPRODUCT formula to achieve the same result - It may work.</p>

                    I am trying to merge fields from an Excel database over to a Word document. One field has the customers work phone in it. The merged data always shows up as "0" instead of the phone number in the Excel cell. The column before and after the Work Phone field
 has the customers Home Phone and Cell Phone and this data merges correctly. Any ideas on why the Work Phone column merges as "0" for every customer in the list?

            Word determines the type of data in a field by the contents of the first couple of records in the data source.&nbsp; It sounds like Word may have determined that the work phone field is a text field and hence when it comes to a number in it, it does not handle
 it correctly.&nbsp; Try putting a dummy record at the top of the data source in which the data in that field is numeric and see if that overcomes the problem.

                    <p>I want to remove Bing as a search engine. I despise it, and I refuse to use windows search if it is a choice. I dislike Vista already, but this doesn't help my computer experience either. How can I remove it completely?</p>

            This doesn't remove Bing as the main search engine, it only adds it as an alternative. Bing is still on my messenger and at the top of my home page.

Hmm...<br />
<br />
Using that page to choose Google as your only search engine should change the search window in the upper right search box of IE7/IE8.</p>
<p>If Microsoft has paid your homepage site to put it there I don't think there is anything you can do about it.&nbsp; You can take a look at your user settings for that site (ie user account) and see if they will allow you to change it.<br />
<br />
If you are using MSN or Windows messenger I don't think you will have much choice.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
IE - TOOLS - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - RESET&nbsp;&nbsp; APPLY&nbsp; /&nbsp; OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE - set Search provider as you wish.<br />
<br />
Tools - Manage Add-ons - Search Providers - Select the Search Provider you want by clicking on one<br />
you can Move it UP or DOWN the list - Set the one you want as the Default (Usually the 1st choice)<br />
and you can REMOVE any you do not want on list. Then on LOWER LEFT&nbsp;check -&gt;&nbsp;Prevent programs<br />
from suggesting changes to my default search provider.<br />
<br />
Add Search Providers to Internet Explorer<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/searchguide/en-en/default.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Change Default Search Provider<br />

<br />
More than you need but a tip on where it is in registry<br />

<br />
You could also do this from another computer to correct your list.<br />

<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
Run through these to find the cause if needed :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Startup Programs<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a>
<br />
<br />
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unsual with<br />
Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. I have many scanners and they never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

            I cannot believe in this country of current lemmings we choose to sit around and accept inferior products as Bing. Who is it named after - that wierdo billionaire who rides around in an old old Lincoln having babies with old old starlets? Anyway this site
 is restrictive on what you can and cannot search - borderline (really) bias. Don't tell me what I can and cannot search for Big Brother!

            First, having tables for each year is not good design. it violates the first rule of relational databases that data should be defined only by values in rows and columns. You are defining data using a table name.
<br />
<br />You should have ONE table with a field that indicates the year. Either an actual date field if a date is part of the data or a fields for just the year.
<br />
<br />You can then, if you want, have separate forms, that are filtered for the year. But a better way is to have an initial form where you choose the year, then open your main form filtered for the year. If you designed your database properly, then you proabaly would not have your issue.
<br />
<br />But your issue depends on the Recordsource of your form. Without knowing what that it is, its hard to determine. what the problem is. So can you show me what the Recordsources is.

            You should not have separate tables or forms for each year; data for all years should be in a single table.&nbsp; If the table in question contains a date column (field) you can easily filter the form on the year of the date, if not then you should have column
 with the year value.&nbsp; Don't name the column Year, however, as that is the name of a built in function, so is a reserved keyword.&nbsp; Name it something like TransactionYear or whatever is appropriate.<br />
<br />
The single form should be bound to the table, and can either be opened filtered to a specific year, or you can include an unbound combo box in the form header to select the year, with code like this in its AfterUpdate event procedure:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Filter = "TransactionYear = " &amp; Me.cboSelectYear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.FilterOn = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.TransactionYear.DefaultValue = """" &amp; Me.cboSelectYear &amp; """"<br />

<p>Thanks Scott and Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have been unclear in my question. There is not a table for each year, but a field with the year and category such as (14Leaves, 15Leaves, etc.) within the table. There are then forms for each year that have many fields with the same year prefix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think recreating the form with a filter is likely the way to go as you said. Unfortunately I did not design the database and am trying to resolve an issue after being tasked with data entry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            Ok that's good to hear. But you still have a problem if you have fields like 14Leaves, 15Leaves, etc. This still violates the same rule. 
<br />
<br />What there should be is a child table with leaves and a date for each leave. The number of leaves by year should be calculated, not stored. 
<br />
<br />Again, for me to help further I need to see the Recordsource of at least one form.

            There are relatively simple ways to recast a badly designed table like this into a correctly structured table, or more likely a set of related tables, but we would need to see the full details of the table structure before we can advise you.&nbsp; One way to
 provide this information would be to use the built in documenter, including only the field's names, data types and sizes.&nbsp; The resulting report can be exported to a text file, whose contents can be copied and pasted into a reply here.

<p>owwwww.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have my permission to thwap the designer of this mess of spreadsheets (masquerading as a database) with a wet noodle (or perhaps with a large stalk of thistles). The Plants table is the only one not obviously incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you do each new year? Open all the tables in design view and add fields for 18, 19, 20...? Or do the tables have empty fields for some years out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll be a big job, but if you're going to need this database it's vital that you totally reconstruct it in a normalized structure. You can (with some tedium) migrate your existing data into new tables, and you can (with a fair bit of work) create new Forms
 and Reports to make it possible to add and report new data in perpetuity, without needing to create new ones every year. But it is certainly doable, and we'll be glad to help point you in the right direction; and it will make your ongoing work MUCH easier.
 Good luck and don't hesitate to post back!</p>

            OK, my mistake, I had assumed Leaves meant employee time off. 
<br />
<br />But again, your tables are badly denormalized and that is what is causing you problems. Whenever you have numbered field names like you have, that is not good design. Those fields should be moved into a child table. Each of those fields should be a record in a child table, not fields in a table. Each of those should be records in table not fields in a table. And instead of trying to use a multi-table recordsource, you should be using subforms. 
<br />
<br />So there should be a Flowering table, but that table should have child tables for StemDiam, Bipps

<p>Haha I didn't realize it is that bad! The solution that has been proposed will be likely even more time consuming so I would be happy to spend time on the front end to make life easier down the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first year working in it, so I'm not sure what has been done but I believe they add a field to each table, then create a form for that year associated with each field. There are measurements and counts entered for many of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest some new formatting for one of the new tables so I have a starting point? Or should I look into normalized table formatting and go from there?</p>

<h2>            Unable to merge calls</h2>

<p>Nokia 920</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was unable to merge a phone call and I after reviewing the How-To page on merging calls I thought I should be able to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps:</p>
<p>1) I received a phone call.</p>
<p>2) I&nbsp;tapped "Add call".</p>
<p>3) I placed the call to a 3rd party.</p>
<p>4) I tapped "Merge calls" and nothing happened. The button didn't appear to recognize the button press however the button did not appear disabled either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else experience a similar problem.&nbsp; Is this user error or a limitation placed by the carrier or perhaps a bug?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Odd there is no Topic for "Phone Calls"</p>

    <title>Office 365 AutoUpdate 3.8 &#40;161018&#41; Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lloyd1981  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 AutoUpdate 3.8 &#40;161018&#41; Failure</h2>
                    <p>Using Mac Sierra. Never a problem with the OS. However, from earlier Mac OS through Sierra, the AutoUpdate would finish, then advise that Download failed and programs were not updated. I would check the ID of each program and the latest version would actually
 have been installed and the revision or modified date would be the current date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today, a new Updater was itself auto-downloaded and installed, then performed the search for the latest Office versions, found all five for Mac, slowly (as usual) worked its way through the download and install process but much earlier than usual
 the alert of failure appeared, this time with a new logo showing an arrow pointing down to a Windows red box icon. Cut short the final process and nothing will update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great waste of time and another "improvement" that fails. Suggestions from MS?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're having problems. Can you do the following please:</p>
<p><br />
1. Quit Microsoft AutoUpdate if it's already running</p>
<p>2. Open Terminal and enter 'defaults write com.microsoft.autoupdate2 ExtendedLogging -bool TRUE'</p>
<p>3. Start AutoUpdate (through Help -&gt; Check for Updates from one of the Office apps)</p>
<p>4. Run through the update scenario - let it detect updates and install them</p>
<p>5. When you receive an error, open Finder and navigate to /Library/Logs/Microsoft/</p>
<p>6. Send the autoupdate.log file to me - pbowden at Microsoft dot com</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: The log will only exist if you're running MAU 3.8 or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your patience,</p>

<p>I responded directly to your email address, but for the forum:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your rapid and personal response.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The log is attached, along with some TIFFs I took with Mac based pix capture program Grab. Part of the scenario:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When I opened Outlook to access your mail, the [a] single update window popped up. Ended in failure. OneNote made it through a few days ago but you will see that the updates this evening were successful. See About Outlook shot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
[Screen shot of about 10 rows of most recent items in the Applications folder, sorted by update dates] Below the apps list, you’ll see some Mac products were updated this morning at 0418 hrs. There are more. As a result of Sierra incremental update to 10.12.1
 Developer Beta Version 6. That update was installed by me and I did not attempt to install [run] Office update after the OS update – had to leave for work.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Appears to me, the Mac OS Beta update helped. When I reopened the updated Outlook, I did notice that the database was being rebuilt. Had crashed twice earlier – probably because the [single] updater was trying to take charge.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The life of Alpha-Beta-Boom, it seems.</p>

                    <p><span>So I currently have Microsoft Office 2010 which I got through an upgrade deal through my Dad's work. So there is no disk or product key for the 2010.&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;planning
 on&nbsp;getting&nbsp;a new laptop and most of the ones I am looking at&nbsp;don't</span>&nbsp;have Microsoft Office included. Is there any possible way for me to transfer my 2010 office to my new laptop?? If not, I do have a disc with a copy of 2007 on it. Would it be possible
 for me to install the 2007 on the new laptop and then upgrade it to 2013 without having to buy a whole new office pack??<span><br />

            There is no "upgrade" to 2010, you got a full license.&nbsp; The question is what type of license did you get. If it is a 1-computer Product Key Card, then you can't transfer to the new machine.&nbsp; If it is a "retail/FPP" type license you will have the right
 to install on 2 machines and to transfer those installations to new computers as required.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It does not hurt to try to transfer the installation.<br />
<br />
You need the unique 25 character Product Key and the generic installation file for the correct Office bundle<br />
<br />
You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from the current computer:<br />
<div>
<b>Tools to Extract Product Key</b>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7tutorials.com/how-recover-your-lost-windows-7-or-windows-8-product-key</a>
</p>
<p><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>PS</span></b><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have
 all of your product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>FYI</span></b><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem.
 The underlying mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Your original package or purchase confirmation e-mail</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Online download account</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>You can extract the Product Key from the machine itself</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Image copy backups of system with Office installed</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Activation backup utilities</span></p>
<p>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called

<p>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</p>

                    All of a sudden today all of my subfolders for my Exchange Account are gone. &nbsp;I checked my iPhone and they are still showing there. &nbsp;However, last week I had to access my email through

<p>Hi Michele,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the URL you provided, it is an Office 365 account. If you set up the account via Exchange portal on Outlook client, the emails and subfolders will sync both on Outlook Web App(OWA) or Outlook client or other devices. The first time you find the subfolders
 are missing on OWA was 1 week ago, it means that they are missing since then, but the Outlook client sync now. So the issue is not related to the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please check whether the emails in those subfolders are missing too. If not, open Deleted Items and Recovery Items to check if the missing items are there. If you can find them, please recover them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the emails are missing too, to prevent data loss, contact the Office 365 admin to run eDiscovery in Security&amp;Compliance Center and recover the missing emails. See this link for reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-eDiscovery-cases-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-9a00b9ea-33fd-4772-8ea6-9d3c65e829e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suggest you using in-app support for further assistance, as we have dedicated support channel for this kind of issue. Open Outlook client and click

<p>If you saved your windows.old folder, you could use a program called UUPtoISO. Do a search for it on Ten Forums. There is a complete tutorial at the web site.</p>

    <title>Mail Merge Error Message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victoria whitsett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Merge Error Message</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm doing my first mail merge and have run into a problem. I'm trying to create a form letter using the names and addresses from an excel spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten this far: Start Mail Merge&gt;Letters&gt;Select Recipients&gt;Use Existing List.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the message "Open Document in Workbook." My options in the dropdown list are "Sheet1" or "Entire Workbook." Below that is a box that asks for "Cell Range." If I type anything in the "Cell Range" box, the OK button greys out. If I click cancel it goes
 away, but then nothing progresses. This happens with either the "Sheet1" or "Entire Workbook" options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me with this error message and get me back on track with my mail merge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't know what "Cell Range" means. Is the the number of cells I have in my excel list?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much.</p>

<p>The behavior you described occurs only if the entry being made in the <strong>
Cell Range </strong>field isn't being made correctly... The best way to avoid the issue is to not have to putt anything in that field in the first place :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, the recipient list should be the only content on the worksheet. The field names (aka
<em>captions</em>, <em>headings</em>, etc.) should be on Row 1 beginning in cell A1 with the list of records starting directly below them on row 2. If that layout is used you should need to do
<em>nothing</em> in the Open Workbook dialog window other than select the correct sheet name... That isn't even necessary if the sheet is the foreground sheet in the workbook or if the list is the only content. Word will find the correct cell range in most
 cases</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cell Range field needs to be used only if you want to indicate a specific range of cells where the records are located in the source workbook file. If used, the syntax of the entry must be exactly what would be used in Excel: Once the correct sheet is
 chosen an example Cell Range would be <strong>G10:L50</strong>. Alternatively, as Charles indicated, a Range Name can be used if one has been given to the range of cells containing the records to be included in the merge.</p>

    <title>How to Activate Office 365 License on Windows Phone 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr-in-hk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Activate Office 365 License on Windows Phone 10</h2>
                    <p>All, my apologies in advance if this is answered but I cannot find an answer and the whole windows mobile support infrastructure is abysmal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 950 XL (great phone...terrible battery life) with&nbsp;Windows Phone 10 O/S (Build 10.0.10586.164) and the Office 365 apps&nbsp;are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have subscribed to Office 365 Home (have paid annual subscription)&nbsp;recently and have installed on 3 devices so have (supposedly) 2&nbsp;device licenses remaining .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;(outlook) Live account I&nbsp;used to subscribe to Office 365 is different to the one I have used to activate (and always use) on my&nbsp;Lumia 950 XL&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>by way of example, <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span> is the one subscribed to Office 365 Home and&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span>
 is the one I have used to activate and use on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added the account <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span> to my accounts under settings on my phone and tried to add it to my Office 365 app on the phone (via word&nbsp;&gt; settings &gt; accounts) but it
 will not allow me to (tried to add it&nbsp;under work or school - no other&nbsp;option under Add Account) but it says "This type of account doesn't work with this particular service. Please enter an email address or phone number associated with a different account."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do NOT want to purchase another subscription and I do not want to change the primary account on my phone, is there anyway I can activate the license I have already purchased on my Windows 10 Phone?

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></p>

</span></span>When you use mail merge to create a document that incorporates all your data source records, you end up with a large document that is divided into sections. You can use a macro to easily split such a document into individual files, one for each

Normally, the mail merge result to a new document is one long file which can be edited and printed. Using the Master Document feature, it’s possible to save each as a separate file.<br />

</span>The mail-merge feature in Word is a fast, easy way to create form letters addressed to many different people. Sometimes, however, you might need to save the resulting documents into separate files for each address. Here’s how.<br />

The add-in works by merging to a new document and then splitting that document to separate files, based on the original merge document, so that formatting should be retained. It does however have limitations, but I offer it as a way forward when other methods
 cannot be used.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are experiencing this issue, one of those is due to the recent update you've installed. However, for us to fully identify the root cause, we need to get additional information. Just to confirm are you using Office Outlook
 or Outlook.com? If you're using Office Outlook, what is the current version and build number of your Office? To determine which version of Office you are using, click this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Outlook.com, we suggest clearing the cache and cookies on from your browser. To do it, kindly follow the steps provided by
<strong>Sergs Yves P </strong>in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/files/microsoft-please-fix-hotmail-search-not-working/b30caf5f-bb4f-4fe5-aed7-ff7fc14c6b1f">thread</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are using the Outlook app, we recommend performing an online repair via Control Panel. Kindly follow the instructions found on this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For my issue, MS support created a new profile and Outlook worked fine there.....but nothing else did so I switched back to my original profile (waiting for MS to call me tonight and remove the other one) and now Outlook works on that, too!!</p>
<p>Been having nothing but issues with Windows 10 since I got this machine 6 months ago and I am a 3D graphics professional. I've had numerous crashes, BSOD, had to factory re-image, and now this. Anyway, rambling off topic.<br />
I have an installation media stick from HP and that will be my nuclear option but I'd like to avoid it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Joe</p>
