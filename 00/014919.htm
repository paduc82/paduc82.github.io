<h2>            Excel 2007 - force open Excel files in a single instance of Excel</h2>
                    <p>I want to be able to share macros from a single Excel file with all open Excel files.&nbsp; As well, I really hate all of these Excel windows being open - when I click "x" to exit Excel, I don't want to have to do it for every single instance that's open.&nbsp; I
 really, really need a single instance of the 5 or 10 Excel files I may have open at any given time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the "Ignore Other applications" unchecked solution most commonly offered, but this changes nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to force Excel to a single instance in 2007?</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Close Excel first and On the Windows Taskbar </p>
<p>1) Start&gt;Run "excel.exe /unregserver"(no quotes)&gt;OK. <br />
2) Start&gt;Run "excel.exe /regserver"(no quotes)&gt;OK.</p>
<p>See the space between exe and /regserver </p>
<p>You might have to designate a full path to excel.exe. </p>
<p>In that case Start&gt;Run "C:\yourpath\excel.exe" /regserver(quotes<br />

            Gord, thanks, but I tried that after seeing it in a reference after a Google search on the problem I have.&nbsp; All that did was open up blank Excel sheets without solving the multiple instance problem.

            <p>Petie,</p>
<p>I have my Excel 2007 set up to have only one instance irrespective of the number of spreadsheets that are open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, you need to start&nbsp; Excel differently.&nbsp; <br />
1&nbsp; You cannot use the entry that its installation routine puts in the Start menu [or by selecting from its Jump list] because that starts a new instance.
<br />
2&nbsp; Start Excel by opening the xlsx/m files themselves.&nbsp; <br />
3&nbsp; To start Excel with a new blank file, create a shortcut to an Excel template file such as C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\XLSTART\Book.xltm [you cannot pin such a shortcut to the Start menu because the Start menu was designed by people who
 hate users - I have these and all other shortcuts in a Taskbar toolbar of my own*].</p>
<p>
</p><p>To close all open workbooks in one go, click on the Office button then Exit Excel.&nbsp; You can make this a bit more convenient to use by putting a macro [Application.Quit] on the Quick Access Toolbar.&nbsp; When you want to close a single workbook without affecting
 the other open ones, click on the red x as you do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that you explained your aim was to share macros across all open files.&nbsp; I moved to my current scheme for similar reasons, I have macros that involve counting open workbooks and the count cannot cope with multiple instances.&nbsp;
<br />
Do please note that all the macros you write in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\XLSTART\Book.xltm are available to all xlsm files in Excel so you can achieve your aim even without going as far as I have [unless, of course, your macros also&nbsp;involve
 counting the number of open workbooks].&nbsp; <br />
One other way to share macros is to put them in an Excel add-in xlam file [I use an xlam as a CustomUI that adds an additional tab to the Excel Ribbon with buttons for the macros that have been written in that xlam - this method has the added advantage of making
 the macros available to xlsx files as well as xlsm files.&nbsp; <br />
Another way to share macros is to use a "Personal macro workbook" but I found that extremely awkward in practice when I last tried it a decade ago and have not tried since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* I have a folder called Menus that has all the shortcuts to files and applications grouped as I need them into subfolders .&nbsp; For example, Menus\Office contains shortcuts to my Word and Excel templates, shortcuts to Office Picture manager and shortcuts to
 some individual Excel &amp; Word documents.&nbsp; The Windows XP Start menu could cope with having such folders visible; the Windows 7 Start menu cannot.&nbsp; To activate the Menus, I right-click on the TaskBar then select Toolbars, New toolbar and point at my menus folder.&nbsp;
 Menus behaves like an XP Start menu, subfolders fly out when hovered over.&nbsp; See <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/ccdb9b15-099b-4630-a854-89074a9b13a1?threadId=5c785b0f-3ec6-498f-b0dc-61f776c79928">

            <p>I appreciate the help.&nbsp; Unfortunately it has not changed.&nbsp; The issue started when my oldest son went to a "zombie" website.&nbsp; Sat down after he left and the system keep popping up with errors.&nbsp; I ran McAfee and it did find and erase the software.&nbsp; That is
 when the issue started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can access but I have to </p>
<p>1. Click start</p>
<p>2. Click Internet (9) Explorer</p>
<p>3. Window open and asks what program should it proceed with.&nbsp; If I click Internet Explorer, ask me to run program with a diofferent window, but if I do just goes back to the first window.</p>
<p>4. It gives an option to look for appropriate program on the web.&nbsp; I click, it goes to some page.&nbsp; I then click the home icon and I am good to go on the internet.</p>
<p>I tried going to&nbsp;the Mr/ Fix Websites and ran both.&nbsp; Did not help.&nbsp; On the install/uninstall Internet Explorere it stops and says I have the most up to date program.</p>
<p>On a window update it just mention about "Killer", I may need an update on it for my internet explorer.&nbsp; Was not sure what to do with that site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do appreciate the help.</p>

<h2>            Build 9926 - &#34;Windows can&#39;t activate with this product key&#34;</h2>
                    <p>About a week or so ago, Windows Technical Preview updated itself to build 9926. &nbsp;Prior to this point, it *WAS* activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it's not. &nbsp;When I plug in this key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PBHCJ-Q2NYD-2PX34-T2TD6-233PK</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(which has worked on several other machines I've tried it on)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>.... I get "Windows can't activate with this product key".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also tried this key:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>NKJFK-GPHP7-G8C3J-P6JXR-HQRJR</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And it comes back with "That key can't be used to activate this edition of Windows"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm not having this issue with four other machines - just one desktop, originally installed with Windows 8.1 and which I upgraded to Windows Technical Preview
 by downloading the first ISO (when first released, forget the build number), burning to a CD, and installing from that.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: every machine I've had that I've installed Windows Technical Preview on, came up as not-activated after initial install, but putting in the first key listed
 above has always gotten me past it. Until now, and only on this one machine.</span></p>

Activation pairs your product key with your computer. It is also used as a mechanism for copy protection in addition to defining support rights depending on the product channel from which the software was acquired: Retail, OEM, Volume License, Trial. With Windows 10, Microsoft has made huge announcements regarding product distribution. The most notable being that Windows 10 will be free to existing Windows 7, 8/8.1 users for the first year. Regardless of this, product activation remains a part of Windows 10 in current previews. It remains to be seen if the final release will include the technology.

<h2>            Project Online - Enterprise Project Type Field</h2>
                    <p>Hi All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our organization is using Project Online.&nbsp; I have a custom field that is calculated from a formula.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to change the value of the field depending on the type of project.&nbsp; Basically, what I'm trying to do is not perform the calculation for
 SharePoint Tasks Lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From using PowerBI, I can see that there is a field called EnterpriseProjectTypeName that will tell me this information.&nbsp; However, that field is not recognized when I try to use it in the custom field formula.&nbsp; Is there any way that I can determine the type
 of project in a custom field formula?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span>Thanks for posting the thread on our forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About “</span><span>&nbsp;I'd like to be able to change the value of the field depending on the type of project.</span>”,
 what formula are you using? Could you upload some screenshots showing “&nbsp;that field is not recognized when I try to use it in the custom field formula.” so that we can clarify the issue symptom and your detailed requirements to do a test in our environment
 for troubleshooting?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please upload the related screenshots here when you have time and I’m willing to help you here.</span></p>

<p>Hi Cliff:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the information you were requesting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the current formula (which works) - it's meant to determine a project temperature based on the sum of the task temperature values for each task in the project.&nbsp; Then the value is set to green, yellow, or red, depending on the sum of the task temperatures
 (.95-1.00 = Green; .90-.95 = Yellow; &lt;.90 = Red).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format([Task Temp] / [Total Tasks], "0.000")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to do a calculation for Sharepoint Tasks Lists, so I tried this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IIf([EnterpriseProjectTypeName] = "SharePoint Tasks List", 100, Format([Task Temp] / [Total Tasks], "0.000"))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I would set a graphical indicator of a clear button for any value &gt; 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try this, I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>The custom field could not be saved due to the following reason(s):</em></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em>This formula contains references to one or more fields that do not exist in the system. Correct the formula and try again.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>From Dale's response, it sounds like this is not possible.&nbsp; However, it doesn't hurt to ask.&nbsp; Thanks very much for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Since an AD account can have only one mailbox in all version of Exchange, as I understand based on your description, you want to create separate mailboxes for different user with the same user name. If there is anything wrong, please feel free to correct
 me. In this case, the value of Name field must be unique in your organization when you create a new mailbox. For more details, you can refer the link below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you still have any questions, may I know if your enviroment is pure on-premises?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<h2>            Firefox on Nokia N8&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I know Firefox Mobile is compatible on some Nokia handsets, is it or will it be available for Nokia N8? Best browser... I'm sure it will be great on a mobile.</p>

<p>Both Opera Mini and Opera Mobile work on my N8.&nbsp; I have Opera Mini set to 'mobile view' which saves on data packets when I don't need to see a full web page and a mobile view is OK (any web page is pre-processed on Opera servers to reduce size and reformat
 to a mobile view for fast transmission).&nbsp; I use Opera Mobile with 'mobile view' switched off for full web browsing. Works really well until Nokia bring us their new browser.&nbsp; Used it all the time on my N95. Good browsers.</p>

            skyfire from the 5th edition works great<br />
i have it on my phone and works perfect the heavy flash pages...the only problem is sometime it says too many users and try later so dont let me browse<br />
<br />
firefox maybe not plans for now but the later at least flash 10.1 it plans to come in symbian phones

<br />
Thanks for providing the complete NDR message in the private message. To move forward with the issue, you don’t need to reply to us with the problematic Office 365 account. Instead, we just need some basic information about your Office 365 subscription so we
 can transfer the case to our relevant team for further handling. If you don't know the related information, please confirm with your admin about it.&nbsp; I have sent you another private message to request the information again.
<br />

Regards,<br />

            I am trying to do it the same way as I did in Office 2003.&nbsp; When I opened word, then the tab for envelopes/labels came up and there was an icon that would open all of my Office 2003 contacts.&nbsp; The new program can't find it or maybe I'm not doing it properly
 in the new version.&nbsp; Message I am receiving is:&nbsp; The search cannot be completed.&nbsp; You must have an address list to search in.<br />

I'm not sure how to direct it to the correct place.<br />

            Whether or not you can get mail by logging in with a web browser has no bearing on whether or not the POP server is running correctly. The web interface doesn't use POP.

            Verify that your Yahoo account hasn't changed to 2 factor authentication. If that's the case, you need to use an app password to log into your account. My own primary ISP uses Yahoo as their email  backend and advised all customers to make the appropriate changes (as is the case with other ISPs that I'm aware of).

<h2>            smitfraud-c generic</h2>
                    My laptop has been infected with the <span>smitfraud-c generic trojan. I have only had the computer about six months. It has the Windows 7 OS and is 64 bit. I use Windows Security Essentials to protect my computer, and spybot as a
 backup. <br />
My laptop began to shut down on its own about a week ago . When I reboot it, it goes through a repair routine and then opens Windows 7. My&nbsp; IE and Firefox
</span><span>browsers</span><span> have been hijacked. I tried to uninstall Firefox, but it was reinstalled the next time I booted up.
<br />
&nbsp;I have ran a full scan with both security tools and both&nbsp; found the trojan </span>
<span>smitfraud-c generic. When I tried to remove it with Security Essentials, I was instructed to go to another computer and download an offline tool to a cd or flash drive and&nbsp; then boot my laptop up with it. I followed the instructions,
<span>smitfraud-c generic. When I tried to remove it with Security Essentials, I was instructed to go to another computer and download an offline tool to a cd or flash drive and&nbsp; then boot my laptop up with it. I followed the instructions,
 but the trojan is still there. With spybot, when I try to remove it, it tells me I have to be in the administrator account. I was running the administrator account when I attempted it. I am afraid to try any of the solutions I have searched for online.
<br />
Does anyone know anything about this, and how to get rid of it?<br />
Thank you<br />

            <p>I don't suggest you&nbsp;try to download and run Windows Defender Offline Beta.&nbsp; With certain types of malware the use of WDO Beta has sometimes&nbsp;contributed to&nbsp;further issues with the infected computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm concerned you might have a rootkit and that's why MSE suggested using WDO Beta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do try the suggestion of <strong>ahaap</strong> re the Bleeping Computer link.&nbsp; In fact, they (the Bleeping Computer Forum) might be able to help you locate and remove the malware.&nbsp; You can register with them, open a "case" and let them work with you step
 by step if you would like to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know how you were infected?&nbsp; Any strange popups saying your computer was infected and needed to be scanned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any trouble with browser redirects?&nbsp; Is that what you mean about browser hijacks?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing Spybot identified the trojan as Smitfraud Generic...what did MSE call it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not use the "Tea Timer" Mode in Spybot S &amp; D when using MSE or any other resident AV program that provides real time protection...to do so may cause conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you wish to seek remote assistance from MSE?</p>

<em><span>Decline.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>

            Hi Excel
<br />
<br />Has the whole bar disappeared or just the information on it?
<br />
<br />If that is the actual status bar, there is no setting in Excel for that. . 
<br />
<br />Click and drag the top bar of Excel so the Excel window is no longer full screen then release the mouse. Then click and drag the top bar of Excel to the center of the top edge of your screen and release the mouse
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this, restart (not shut down) your PC and check to see if the Status bar is back . .

            Hi Excel
<br />
<br />There is no setting in Excel to hide the Status bar
<br />
<br />If you now remove that macro, close Excel and re-open it, does the status bar still appear?
<br />
<br />The only time the status bar in Excel can disappear is due to placement of the Excel Window, it may be under the Taskbar, a macro has hidden the status bar or a corruption in the Excel application

<p>Hi, saxyphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Nokia Suppost Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try restarting your tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Close any desktop apps you have open.</p>
<p>2. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap&nbsp;Settings.</p>
<p>3. Tap&nbsp;Power &gt;&nbsp;Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you tablet does not respond to touch or mouse, do the following. This does not delete any of your personal files or settings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold down the power key for 10 seconds. Tablet turns off. </li><li>Press the power key to start the tablet again. </li></ol>
<p>If you're running out of space, you can check for and remove things you no longer need:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Text, multimedia, and mail messages</p>
</li><li>
<p>Contact entries and details</p>
</li><li>
<p>Apps (<span>Not all apps can be removed.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Music, photos, videos, or other files&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p>To free up storage space on your tablet, you can store your photos, documents, and other stuff on SkyDrive instead of your tablet. You can download the stuff back to your tablet when you need it. See:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/lumia2520/userguidance/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=GUID-79B90921-2436-4104-ADAC-011662B2DE3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/us-en/support/product/lumia2520/userguidance/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=GUID-79B90921-2436-4104-ADAC-011662B2DE3F</a>.&nbsp;(

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the restart did make a difference. Good day!</p>

<p>Just 1,5GB of the space is taken by apps and as you can also see from the screen snapshots&nbsp;attached there are no data files saved. So how the heck the operating system is taking 24GB i.e. 90% of the total space??!!</p>

<p>The 2520 does load and save a lot of data to install and update apps. This data stays under Windows on your C-drive.</p>
<p>I keep deleting this data to save a little bit of space, as it is not needed after the install.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don't have my 2520 with me, but you should be able to find the path searching through the interweb&nbsp;with Bing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even doing this the 32Gb is quickly full. I dont understand Nokias trend to not install enough of space on otherwise brilliant phones and tablets. It can't be that big of a cost issue. And the standard MS answer of use the cloud is just stubborn idiotism.
 Has nothing to do with not having enough space fro apps.</p>

<p>To think of it, the other thing to do is, move your pictures, vidoes, music, files on a memory stick.</p>
<p>By default they sit on C-drive as well, and can be easily moved to D. (properties on the folder)</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same issue on my Nokia 2520 but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with Nokia Mix Radio. &nbsp;There are NO files, pictures, videos, or music on it but my 25 GB of storage is almost full.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand the files on the C drive to delete as suggested.</p>

<p>This is nonsense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning I had 801 MB available, tonight when I turned on the tablet again I had 750.&nbsp; I did absolutely nothing with it from this morning until now.</p>

<p>OK, so I went to the Desktop and did some poking around with folders, to see where the heck all the space is going. My folder in the&nbsp;C:\Users directory is over 3 GB. So is my wife's. But,&nbsp;adding up all the sizes shown in the properties&nbsp;of each folder doesn't
 even come close to that size (it's around 400 MB, wife's is around 800 MB).&nbsp; If&nbsp;I show hidden items and get propereties on the "Local" folder, it's like 2.2&nbsp;GB.&nbsp; Inside are various folders, including one called "packages" which is 1.59 GB.&nbsp; Inside that folder
 is a bunch of other folders that appear to be related to apps and MSFT stuff, but also have gibberish as part of the name.&nbsp; The "Microsoft" folder is 800 MB.&nbsp; So there's my 2.2,&nbsp;+ 800+400 + random&nbsp;makes for 3+ GB.&nbsp;But, my "legit"&nbsp;stuff is only 400 MB.&nbsp; My
 wife's account has the same kind of thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what I can delete from these folder, or why they are so large. Are they supposed to be cleared out by the OS and this isn't happening? Considering the space keeps creeping down,&nbsp; that was a thought that popped into my head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone else check their folders and see if it is similar to what I have going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW Disk Cleanup gave me about 300 MB back.</p>

<p>Looks like we have an epidemic on our hands. I ran into this problem 6 months ago and still have not found a solution. I asked the question on the RT forum to no avail. I even took my tablet to a local Microsoft store downtown and they blinked and looked
 at me with a dazed and confused stare. Ultimately, they told me to "Refresh Your PC without affecting your files" - Tried that but got an error saying that I needed an additional 6.1GB of free disk space to perform the refresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in order to get more disk space I need to "refresh" my tablet but in order to "refresh" my tablet I need more disk space? And still I comb the net and forums for SOMEONE....ANYONE from a billion dollar company like Microsoft or Nokia to come to me with
 a better solution than "Have you tried deleting some of your files or maybe even restart your computer?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supposedly I have a 32GB drive. According to windows, the actual drive capacity is 25.33GB -- so approximately 7 GB of the 32 GB drive is off in never-never land, I suppose I can accept that IF I actually had access to the remaining 25.33 GB. According to
 my tablet the amount of space that I am using or have added as a user (docs, pics, apps) is a little over 4 gb of disk space. What the heck is tacking up the remaning 21 GB of my drive capacity?????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So even if I deleted every doc, pic, or app that I have installed, I STILL WONT HAVE ENOUGH DISK SPACE TO PERFORM A REFRESH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My windows folder shows a total of 14GB under properties while my user folder as previsously mentioned shows a tad over 4. That's still only 18 GB out of 25.33GB - what is taking the other 7? And why the heck does Windows need 14GB of my hard drive to opperate??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your solutions did not solve my problem. I removed all apps and reinstalled w8.1. This resolved the problem for a short period but the problem still exist. Memory still disappears and can not be recovered. &nbsp;Seeing how this is an RT tablet which Microsoft
 apparently won't support in the near future, it seems I am forced to explore alternative products. Thank you Microsoft for all of your non-support in this matter.</p>

<p>This is nothing about privacy or trust and nothing shady.</p>
<p>If you will look at battery saver and app usage the default is to show usage from the last 24 hours. You can also select to show usage from the last 48 hours or last week(7 days).</p>
<p>Battery Saver default will show any usage by an app in the last 24 hours even though the app is turned off or uninstalled.</p>

<h2>            Office Android apps show &#34;not signed in&#34; -- can&#39;t sign in</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Office 365 Home subscription, and activated the desktop Windows programs with no problems.&nbsp; Now I'm trying to activate my Android Office apps on my tablet running Android 7.0, but their settings show I'm "not signed in," as shown in the screenshot
 below.&nbsp; If I try to sign in with the user id and password used for purchasing Office 365, nothing happens and I'm just dumped back to this screen again:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b858202-dcb0-4dbb-8fa1-c46b3d8beb45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b858202-dcb0-4dbb-8fa1-c46b3d8beb45" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that it also shows that I'm signed in to "OneDrive - Personal," which is the plan with 1TB storage, and that is what I should have after having bought Office 365.&nbsp; So it seems the apps do recognize my subscription.&nbsp; So am I signed in or not?&nbsp; Do I need
 to sign in in order to get the full features I paid for?</p>

            Your solution didn't work.&nbsp; What fixed me for me was on my screenshot above, I scrolled down to the bottom and tapped the "Reset" button.&nbsp; That took me to a sign-in screen which did allow me to sign in, and it later showed that I was signed in.<br />

<p>Following on from what my partner said earlier the following <strong>may</strong> be useful to you...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Dependent on your accounts reputation these are the limits.</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The sending limit for outgoing email messages is 300 (three hundred) messages per day.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Maximum 100 per email.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<br />
<strong>How Many To, Cc and *****<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bcc</span> ***** Recipients are Allowed Per Message</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>If you’ve been notified that you have hit some limit on a Microsoft product, it’s almost certainly part of an effort to reduce spam.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The send mail limit depends on your reputation within Outlook.com</strong><br />
<br />
If you are a new user, a low sending quota is a temporary restriction and is upgraded to the maximum limit as soon as the user establishes credibility in the system.<br />
If you are an established user, recent account activity may have sent us a false alert.<br />

    <title>Duplicate in Outbox Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shashi h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate in Outbox Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have been noticing emails being sent are showing "1" then "2" and back to "1" before being cleared from the Outbox and shifting to the Sent folder. The problem started about two (2) weeks ago. Incidentally, only one (1) email is being stored at the
 Sent folder and only (1) as well is reaching the final recipient. The question is why is the Outbox showing "2" for every single email I send out. For the reference, this is an office email and computer and we are using the Office365. Outlook version on my
 PC is the latest 2013. Thank you so much for your kind feedbacks and advise.</p>

    <title>Creating a Nokia Account - Nokia E72 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating a Nokia Account - Nokia E72</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All my first post,</p>
<p>I'm in search of a quick answer as to how long should it take for my phone (e72) to create a nokia account? It's been grinding away for over an hour and so I looked online and found and joined here using the same codes names etc. The phone works, it connected
 to the internet fine and I actually got to OVI maps and downloaded them and found where I live etc. So anybody have any suggestions.? Do I just turn if off and start over? Now that I have an account here will it carry over to the phone ? Will it mess something
 up if I just turn the phone off and try again, first to long in and if that doesn't work try creating the account thru the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my first "smart phone"It's unlocked and used but in good condition. I bought it to use both for the maps and as a phone on an upcoming bicycle tour in France late this summer. I'll admit I'm an ignorant Luddite, frustrated with this new tech but
 not quite to the point of throwing wooden shoes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any and all help appreciated,</p>
<p>Wileyone</p>

<p>If you have created a Nokia account you would need these credentials to download applications from Nokia Store or Synchronise map "favourites" to HEREMaps. I would switch off and re-try logging in upon your E72 with your username &amp; password at another time
 as sometimes "server" not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to add an Email account to E72 bear in mind that network data connection needed to validate device, although you can alter to WLAN access point immediately after creating "mailbox".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have an E72 to hand, please post again if you run in to any problems setting up this device!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concerning "bicycle" tour of France, bear in mind that French map content &nbsp;is now available for ViewRanger topographic software which runs upon your Symbian device,</p>

    <title>Word for ipad&#47;iphone - connection problems when offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vjabs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for ipad&#47;iphone - connection problems when offline</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Word on the ipad and iphone for a couple of months and often use it whilst offline and travelling (in airplane mode). At first I had no issues but recently I get a very annoying message saying "Cannot connect to server. The server may be
 unavailable. Check your internet connection and try gain".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I am in airplane mode and don't want to connect to anything but this message is driving me crazy as it appears constantly with almost every action I do whilst navigating between files when offline. The good thing (or so I thought) about Word
 is that you could save files and work offline, then they would update when you are back online. But with this constant message harassment it is becoming impossible to use these apps. Any ideas on how to tackle this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just wondering if anyone has any ideas as to how to avoid this - the app is slowly becoming unusable due to the constant 'harassment' by these pop up messages saying 'cannot connect to server'. Is there a way to stop it trying to connect whilst using the
 app offline - surely the developers would have thought that users may use this offline just to draft documents and a constant connection to the servers is not necessary?</p>
<p>
