    <title>Refresh issues in message pane for Outlook in Office 20011 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Refresh issues in message pane for Outlook in Office 20011</h2>
                    This issue has just started happening. &nbsp;When I change to different folders in the browser pane of Outlook, the message listing pane is very very slow in updating to the newly selected folder. &nbsp;It appears to be the worst when selecting different folders
 that are on the Exchange server, both the basic folders as well as ones I have created for specific topics.
<div>At times it seems the message listing pane is never going to update, it is just left pointing to the prior folder. &nbsp;The message pane is not frozen at that point - I can even select individual messages, though they are in the prior folder, not the one I
 just selected. &nbsp;But the delays can extend for over 30 seconds. &nbsp;</div>
<div>In other instances, rather than message pane refreshing, it appears blank, or with just stray character trash in the pane. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm got all the Office 2011 updates in place, and am running OS X 10.7.2.</div>

            How many messages do you have on average in these folders? Is your Inbox relatively small (no more than a few hundred messages)? A large Inbox can cause problems because the Inbox syncs more frequently than other folders. Move as much out of your Inbox
 as possible and do not store folders within it.

            I don't have a lot of flagged messages. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>And these folders vary in size - even small ones refresh slowly. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Today the problem happened and just had to quite Outlook and restart it - just totally hung up with refreshing the message list views.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Admittedly, my Inbox is big. &nbsp;But it has been really large for a long time, and this problem just started occurring. &nbsp;</div>

            You could very well have hit the threshold for performance with your large Inbox. That's stil where I'd suggest troubleshooting by moving all but a few hundred out into other folders (not sub-folders within the Inbox).

            Here's the thing - if I just open a new Outlook window and point it to mail - then that new window is properly active. &nbsp;That's my work around.
<div><br />
<div>Meaning no disrespect, but I have found multiple aspects of Outlook 2011 that don't perform as well under Lion. &nbsp;Every try reordering the columns in a view? &nbsp;That used to work. &nbsp;That is just one of a number of elements that I wish would get patched.</div>

<h2>            Samsung Focus Not Charging</h2>
                    
<p>I left my phone charging overnight, like I always do, and when I wake up, and pick up my phone to turn off the alarm, I notice that the battery is really low. By the time I get up the phone is off. So I try the wall charger instead of the PC, and nothing
 happens. I went to school without my phone and left it charging the whole day, and it's still out of battery and I can't use it.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            publisher 2010 runs slow when trying to print.  </h2>
                    
<p>I bought a new Dell Inspiron desktop computer and Publisher 2010.&nbsp; When trying to print a page Publisher runs slow trying to get to the print window.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the top of the main window it says not responding, but if you don't do anything eventually the print
 window will appear, then it takes a couple minutes for the print preview to appear.&nbsp; I uninstalled and installed Publisher again, but get the same problem.</p>
<p>I previously had Publisher 2003 running on a old pentium 3 computer running windows xp, using this same database and I didn't have any problems printing.&nbsp; This old computer broke, thats why I bought a new computer and new Publisher 2010 and now it runs so
 slow its unacceptable.&nbsp; Any ideas???</p>

<p>==========================================<br />
Just a guess...but is it possible that you have a virus scanner that <br />
is causing the slow progress?</p>
<p>It's also a possibility that you need to go to the support website of <br />
your printer's manufacturer and search for an updated driver.</p>

<p>I didnt look into the virus scanner, I can try and disable it if there is one running and see if it helps.&nbsp; I did download the latest driver for my hp p1006 printer, as it didnt have the latest driver, but that didn't help.</p>
<p>I also notice that the job that creates this slow print window has about 500+ pages.&nbsp; I have another job with about 100 pages and when I try to print a page from that job it works fine, no delays.&nbsp; I don't think 500+ pages is bogging down publisher and windows

=============================<br />
It's possible that the 500 page file is at issue...<br />
especially if it includes lots of graphics/photos.

<p>This 500 page file contains no graphics/photos only text boxes.&nbsp; I don't have MS Office, I only bought Publisher 2010.&nbsp; When I have the document open and want to print a page, I click on file, print which presents a green progress bar saying scanning for
 printers, this takes about 1 to 1.5 minutes, then I have to wait another minute for the preview page to appear, then I click on print current page and that takes 30 seconds or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Publisher 2010 has capacity limitations on how big a project can be?&nbsp; Like I mentioned before, my Publisher 2003 running on my old computer had no delays when clicking on the print button.&nbsp; And with this new machine when I try to print a page from another
 project that has a 100 pages, the print window appears quickly, the scanning for printers only appear for a split second and the preview page appears, I click on print current page and hit the print button and it prints.</p>
<p>Is there any fixes for Publisher 2010 that I need to install if its running on a windows 7 machine?&nbsp; I tried looking online but couldn't find anything.&nbsp; If I can't resolve this problem, what are my options?</p>

<p>There is information on the above web site about cleaning out the print spooler. The information is old, it still is relevant.</p>
<p>Another workaround would be to convert the publication to a PDF. Maybe it would print faster. There is a Microsoft "save as PDF" add-in you can use. It is free:<br />

<p>You wouldn't necessarily need to copy/paste. Delete all but one-fourth of the document. Save with a new name. Do this with each section.</p>
<p>Did you try the PDF workaround? Or print from the XPS printer.</p>
<p>You can re-combine the 4 files in Publisher. Open section one, Insert tab on the ribbon, Insert file. (next to Draw Text Box).</p>

                    Specifically upgraded to 2013 from 2002 just to get the great kitchen templates I saw somewhere.&nbsp; But when I open the floor plan templates for Bathroom/Kitchen, all I get are bathroom elements, and none of the predesigned templates I saw, (I think it was
 2003).&nbsp; Cant find any reference to additional kitchen floor plans anywhere on MS Site.&nbsp; Plz advise!&nbsp; Thx!

<p>Which Visio version did you use? Professional or Standard? I'm afraid that the Kitchen stencil only be included in&nbsp;Professional.</p>

                    I can't get Cortana to shutdown, sleep or restart my computer. I heard it was supposed to be a new feature of the creator's update and I know you can create shortcuts, but I thought the update would fix that problem. I have the 15063 build. &nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The symptom you provided sounds like a broken system file. To assist you with your concern, may we know what troubleshooting steps you've done so far to resolve the issue? Did you encounter any error messages while trying to let Cortana shutdown, sleep or
 restart your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

            Well, I'm not sure if I'm taking the correct steps. I thought that the accurate commands were "shutdown my pc," restart my pc" and so on. I have not taken any troubleshooting steps because I'm not sure where to start. I wasn't sure if I had the correct
 build for this to work.

            I also seem to have this problem, i have however tried to repair with my own methods with no progress, Cortana works perfectly besides those commands, I HAVE heard people say those commands arn't actualy in the 15063 release of windows, if they arn't it
 would be nice to see someone from microsoft say so instead of providing false hope.

 told.

this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>None of the comments presented help me get Word 2016 (Version 16.11) to print a No. 10 envelope.&nbsp; I was on this site before and spend time with a Microsoft agent trying to get Word 2016 to print a No. 10 envelope correctly.&nbsp; The agent and I screen shared.&nbsp;
 The agent could not get Word to print a No. 10 envelope correctly.&nbsp; I have read people's suggestions about making various adjustments.&nbsp; To me, that is not the way Word was intended to be used.&nbsp; All you should need to do is pick the envelope, place the envelope
 in the tray of your printer and hit print.&nbsp; &nbsp;Word 2011 worked just fine.&nbsp; I was told by the agent that Microsoft is aware of the envelope printing problem.&nbsp; It is Word 2016 that is the problem and Microsoft, for whatever reason won't fix the problem.&nbsp; So,
 when will Microsoft fix the problem.&nbsp; I can print No. 10 envelopes just fine using Apple's Pages.&nbsp; So, I know the issue is not with my Epson printer; Epson Workhorse 3540.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has information or a detailed keystroke by keystroke description of how to fix this problem, please advise.</p>

<h2>            &#34;IE Has Stopped Working&#34; - Enable Enhanced Protected Mode - No Google Tool Bar</h2>
                    <p>For some time now I have had the issue of getting the message, "IE Has Stopped Working" and have tried about anything I could find to fix it.&nbsp; Sometimes I would just get it&nbsp;after exiting YouTube and it didn't mean anything because I had already exited and
 at other times it would stop working in the middle of a session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read about going to Tools, Internet Options, Advance and under Security checking the box Enable Enhanced Protected Mode.&nbsp; I did this and the "IE Has Stopped Working" issue seemed to have gone away.&nbsp; Amen?????.....................NO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can not&nbsp;get my Google toolbar to work unless I go back an uncheck it.&nbsp; I'm then back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Win 8.1 and IE 11 on this machine.&nbsp; I do have the same issue on my PC with Win 7, but that's for another day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question:&nbsp; How do I get the Google stuff to work with the EEPM box checked??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Uninstalled and reinstalled Google toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may have improved(slightly) but I stll get it&nbsp;while browsing and&nbsp;I get the message every time I exit YouTube.&nbsp; But, I have already exited that page so it makes no difference.&nbsp; I just hit the red "x" and move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does with browsing different webpages because it happens during chaging pages and all is lost at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p><span>One way would be call the Split function to parse the string into an array, and then read each value from the array.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can see how it works in the debug window:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MyString = "NORTH 2|14629.000|PUNJAB|NAVEEN VERMA |PUNJAB|LUDHIANA|Ludhiana|5424|Gold Package Punjab|0.000|2008-12-21 00:00:00.000"</span></p>
<p><span>? Split(MyString,"|")(0)</span></p>
<p><span>NORTH 2</span></p>
<p><span>? Split(MyString,"|")(1)</span></p>
<p><span>14629.000</span></p>
<p><span>? Split(MyString,"|")(2)</span></p>
<p><span>PUNJAB</span></p>
<p><span>? Split(MyString,"|")(3)</span></p>
<p><span>NAVEEN VERMA </span>
</p>
<p><span>.........and so on</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After adding the 15 new columns to the table you could then call the Split function in the above way in an UPDATE query.</span></p>

            Have you created the 15 new columns in the table?&nbsp; If not, do so.&nbsp; Then execute an update query along these lines:<br />
<br />

<h2>            OneNote 2010 will not connect to web&#47; onedrive</h2>
                    <p>I have searched all the answers for this. And I am sorry to say that I have not documented well my problems. This product worked great for many years, evem after the switch from Live to OneDrive. It works at my workplace. It just not longer works on my main
 home computer, my laptop. Message is that OneNote cannot connect to OneDrive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily all my work is still online and backed up (I hope) on my work computer. I cannot "open in one note" from one drive.</p>
<p>i cannot "share to the web" for a new notebook started on my laptop. I am running Windows 7 home premium as 32-bit. All my software is updated. In fact, i think this started when there was a message to update onenote and I did. seemed odd to update just
 one product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am loathe to uninstall Office and re-install. Because I am not living in fear of losing all my stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

                    I have started receiving e-mails that are not addressed to my e-mail address. I have an @live address but the name in front of @live on the messages in question is not mine. Is this some kind of scam, how can it happen? How can e-mails not addressed to
 me end up in my inbox? Does anyone know how I can stop this ?

<h2>            Class Notebooks - Students on Macs can&#39;t type</h2>
                    <p>For 2-3 weeks, about 6 students (all on MACS) can open OneNote but cannot type in their student pages. One student can only type one letter at a time and has to reclick the page to add one more letter. One student can edit her page in Chrome but not Safari.
 These issues started all on the same day, so I was wondering if it had something to do with an update that went out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. They need to be able to submit their work in OneNote for class.</p>

<p>
</p><p>They confirmed&nbsp;a few things: the MS IP's&nbsp;were not flagged for spam, I am not exceeding the allowed SMTP relays, and there&nbsp;is nothing&nbsp;in the error logs with the MS IP's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They wanted to try port 80 and 3535&nbsp;and&nbsp;select 'outgoing smtp requires authentication', but these are not options in outlook.com's settings.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. It is an issue with sending/replying via&nbsp;Outlook.com and everything connected to outlook.com--Office PC,&nbsp;Lumia, and Surface. It has completely shut down my business and need to fix asap. Luckily, I can still send emails via GoDaddys email interface--It's
 just a major pita to read via outlook and login to GD to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>***UPDATE 1/17/2016***</p>
<p>Outlook.com still will not send emails through the outgoing server after two days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After another day and&nbsp;another call to Godaddy (who does not support Outlook.com or Windows 10 phones), I installed Outlook2013 and set up a pop&nbsp;email as a test. Outlook2013 can send and receive--so the outgoing server is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the same incoming/outgoing servers and ports in <em>Outlook.com's 'add a send/receive account'
</em>and the outgoing emails bounce. I really need to fix this after spending all this time to migrate to outlook.com to get all my devices using the same email program.</p>

 to do with the Esmpt Microsoft server and the old Godaddy Pop3 servers.</p>

            <p>Thanks Andewwe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heard&nbsp;that MS/outlook was making some "updates" (thanks *roll*) that&nbsp;is creating&nbsp;havoc on outgoing mail. I tried&nbsp;testing&nbsp;this&nbsp;by creating&nbsp;additional accounts on&nbsp;other GD outgoing servers through various URLS and networks&nbsp;and none worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish outlook.com had the 'test' function that outlook 20XX had so we didn't have to wait 20+ minutes for a email bounce failure response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Four days and counting&nbsp;using texting or non-business (unprofessional) emails to confirm/reply...it's hard to defend windows 10 (windows mail/outlook)&nbsp;when it fails in front of clients--it's unprofessional and &nbsp;embarrassing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Godaddy says it works fine, since Outlook2013 works. That does lead me to point the finger at Outlook.com.&nbsp;The Outlook.com&nbsp;header format is different&nbsp;from Outlook2013's header&nbsp;going to&nbsp;the same outgoing server--There are some differences there for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft support wants to run remote access to take control&nbsp;our office&nbsp;pc's (which&nbsp;we can't authorize)&nbsp;to simple see outlook.com's outing settings. Seriously...remote access to open a URL at outlook.com, login, goto email accounts,&nbsp;and see the
 same server info I am telling them...really? **** tech support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, l love where&nbsp;MS is&nbsp;headed with win 10, Surface, Lumia, Continuum...but this sucks. I don't know where to point the finger--I just want it fixed. Something changed in the past week. If it is GD or MS--either way, they will be on our SL for
 a while.</p>

            <p>Another day and I am without email with outlook...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are todays efforts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted all email accounts from Godaddy and set them up from scratch. I setup&nbsp;a fresh&nbsp;(but the same user/pw) *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. re-saved the settings of that email as a send/receive account on outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. received emails (and stress that I cannot reply)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. sent a test email to myself and it bounced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. set up that email on outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. tested account. send/receive was successful from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. sent a&nbsp;test email to myself and it bounced. it was visible in the godaddy workspace webmail in a minute, then transferred via POP to outlook.com after nearly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. created a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. added the test**@ as a send receive account to outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. changed that account to my default 'from' address</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. sent an email from the test account to my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account and it bounced the same as above. The non-informative error cores are below going from the first received (lowest) up to the diagnostic code..</p>

            <p>I believe this is a message&nbsp;transfer&nbsp;problem between Microsoft's Microsoft&nbsp;Exchange SMTP component (they probably have 20-40 servers running SMTP) and the Godaddy SMTP Servers.&nbsp; According to Godaddy Microsoft started updated their SMTP servers about 7 days
 ago (when they first started getting calls).&nbsp; What I'm saying is that it probably doesn't make any difference what Outlook client you use, all your outbound mail will bounce.&nbsp; I've tried calling MS several times but keep talking to the support centers in India
 (they are of no use on this one).&nbsp; I'm not going to waste my time call anyone on this any more.&nbsp; Hopefully, the crews doing the upgrade get a clue from Godaddy that there is a compatibility issue happening.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for filling in the gaps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I only moved to outlook.com for the outlook interface rather than the Godaddy provided interface.&nbsp; But the ol.com isn't nearly as functional as the Office version.&nbsp; So I guess I just go out shopping for a new email client to use with my Godaddy account.</p>
