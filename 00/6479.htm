<h2>            Word 2011 for mac&#58; certain files won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Word 2011. I'm using Macbook Pro with OS X Yosemite 10.10.5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain docx-files won't open. Word-application just disappears from the dock when I'm trying to open them. It doesn't make any difference whether I'm trying to open them by double-clicking the file or first opening Word and then File -&gt; Open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's weird that some docx-files open normally and some don't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could somebody help me please?</p>

            When Word disappears from the dock, has it crashed? If not, does it reappear? Can you think of anything in common that unopenable files have in common?

            <p>How can I tell if it is crashed or not? Word just disappears but it doesn't say anything. When I re-open Word, another documents that have already been open also re-open, but there's still no warning, no pop-up windows that would tell the cause of this,
 nothing. I have tried to think something that connect's these files, but at this point I haven't been able to figure anything out. This problem started like a month ago. I don't think that the files are corrupted or something like that because other people
 haven't had problems opening them.</p>

            <p>Since you have to re-open it, then that means it crashed. The files that open up are probably AutoRecovery files. If they contain unsaved work, it's a good idea to save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming you can open Word and create a new file without problems, this only occurs when opening existing files. As a diagnostic step only, you can use
<strong>System Preferences&gt;Users &amp; Groups</strong> to create a new user profile. Then log into this profile instead of your usual one and see if Word is better-behaved when opening files. Then let us know your results, thanks.</p>

            It sounds like it's the documents themselves. Try opening Word Online in a browser and upload a couple of problem documents to see if that version can open them.

            <p>No problem. Please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your web browser and enter onedrive.com as the address. If it asks you to sign in, do that.</li><li>Drag a couple of the problem documents to the Files area of the browser window. OneDrive uploads them.</li><li>Click on the document and it should open in Word Online. If the document opens successfully, the issue is probably with your installation of Office. If the document does not open in Word Online, there is more likely a problem with the document.</li></ol>

            <p>OK, so the problem with with your installation of Word. Since the Mac version lacks a Repair utility, you'll have to completely uninstall, then re-install Office. Here are the steps to uninstall:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2398768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to completely remove Office for Mac 2011</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To re-install, you'll need your original installation DVD or download, plus your 25-character product code. The product code is printed on the DVD package, or if you downloaded Office, the code would be in an email from Microsoft. Make sure you have these
 before uninstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only have the product key, you can re-download Office 2011 from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.downloadoffice2010.microsoft.com/macdl/registerkey.aspx?culture=en-us&amp;ref=macdl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office for Mac 2011 Download Site</a></p>

<h2>            Windows phone 8.1 - cant connect to my company email</h2>
                    <p>I try to connect to my company email account via OWA on my windows phone. I keep getting errors, TMG will not let me in. I can do this on my home PC (windows 8.1) and it works fine, no problems. I enter the 'https://email.carefirst.com' in my web browser,
 takes me to the OWA and I login with my email user name and password with no problems on my Pc. When I try the exact same process in my windows phone (Nokia Limina 830 and windows 8.1) I get the&nbsp;Forefront TMG error. Any ideas?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it something my company must do or can I do something on my phone; like create this account as a Pop3/Imap email account?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help&nbsp; is appreciated. </p>

            <p>Hi BrianHinderer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having difficulties accessing your work email through&nbsp;it's website on your Windows Phone Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit you're very much right in the way of thinking, your company's IT department will more than likely be able to help out in that particular situation,</p>
<p>Adding the Account into Settings &gt; Emal + Accounts would be my strong recommendation indeed, although the webserver might need specific settings which again you might need to ask for your company's IT department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

    <title>Examples of ways Microsoft is dumbing down Word - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Examples of ways Microsoft is dumbing down Word</h2>
                    <p><strong>Example 1: Full justification</strong></p>
<p>In versions of Word before 2013 we had the option to "Do full justification the way WordPerfect 6.x for Windows does." This option gives a lovely, smooth, professional look to pages with full justification. Word has always failed that test with their default
 setting which gives a clunky, clumpy "do-it-yourself-on-the-cheap" appearance. A book self-published with Word sticks out like a sore thumb compared to those laid out in InDesign. Activate that WordPerfect option and you're entirely presentable to the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Workaround: </em></p>
<p>Save your document as a Word 97-2003 doc. Then open the Advanced tab in Options and scroll down to the bottom to Compatibility option. Select&nbsp;"Do full justification the way WordPerfect 6.x for Windows does." That's the eighth item on that list. Click OK.
 This setting will stick when you resave in docx format to retrieve the power formatting tools available in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately if you do this with a heavily formatted document, lots of your setting will be lost. Remember to do it early -- or set it as your default by selecting "all new documents" rather than the current one when you change the setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example 2: Suppressing space at the top of the page.</strong></p>
<p>Until 2013 Word allowed you a choice about having space above a heading at the top of a page. With the advent of 2013 they removed that option and stripped out space above headings on all pages other than those immediately following a section break. Now,
 all headings after a chapter title are jammed tight against the top margin. Yuck!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Workaround:</em></p>
<p>Edit your heading style. Remove all space above from the paragraph setting, i.e. 19 pt. Open the font menu. On the Advanced tab, select Position and lower the font by the same amount you just removed, i.e. 19 pt. Make sure your style is updated. You have
 control again! This workaround will add space at the top of a page after a natural page break or New Page break.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Microsoft trying to create business for Adobe by forcing people to buy InDesign?
</strong>Or maybe they think users are too dumb and irresponsible to exercise good taste?
</p>

            <p>Word 2013 has a much better justification engine than previous versions, even with the&nbsp;"Do full justification the way WordPerfect 6.x for Windows does" option, so the option was removed from documents based on Word 2013 templates. Going back to the old doc
 format&nbsp;so you can use an inferior tool&nbsp;is a retrograde step; you lose access to a plethora of enhancements that the old format simply doesn't support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your 'workaround' for headings isn't one I'd recommend. What you should do is implement a suitable 'space after' paragraph setting for the header paragraph(s). That gives a consistent space between the page header and whatever follows.</p>

            <p>Paul, 2013 may be better at justification that previous versions, but it's still klunky looking and inferior for professional-level publications compared to the WordPerfect version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand what you're saying about a "space after" setting to solve the problem of no space above. Are you saying the last paragraph of previous text should have its own style with, i.e., 23 pts after? My dilemma is the lack of space BEFORE the
 heading, not after.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the other hand, if my choice is to have space above Heading 2, and I want that space there even at the top of a page, I do not appreciate Microsoft "saving me from myself."&nbsp;</p>

<p>One workaround that has been suggested is to put the heading in a frame. The frame can be incorporated in the style (so applying the style inserts the frame), and Spacing Before is honored in a frame at the top of a page. This won't cause any problems with
 the TOC, either, as Word has no problem seeing headings in frames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've been using Word long, you probably are familiar with frames. In Word 2007 and above, they aren't accessible from the Ribbon, however; you have to add the Horizontal Frame command to the QAT (or you can use
<strong>Format | Frame</strong> in the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog).</p>

<h2>            Cannot get notebooks from OneNote Class Notebook endpoint</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
I'm currently developing Windows Store app (UAP) that utilizes OneNote Class Notebook API (OneNote SDK). I've been following this link
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/onenote-auth#aad-auth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/onenote-auth#aad-auth</a>&nbsp;to get the access token for calling the API. I have acquired the access token and fullfiled all of the required scope. But it seems whenever I initiated a HTTP call to the
<strong>"me/noteBooks"</strong> on OneNote endpoint (<a href="https://onenote.com/api/v1.0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onenote.com/api/v1.0/</a>) I always get a 401 error code (unauthorized).<br />
<br />
Is OneNote class notebook on a maintenance? or is it only available to specific countries other than US? (because I'm from South East Asia).<br />

<p>Hi Sanga,</p>
<p>OneNote Class Notebook is available all around the world and it is not on a maintenance. May I confirm if you can access your Class Notebook successfully via the web browser interface or the OneNote desktop application? If you can use your Class Notebook
 normally via the out-of-box interfaces but encounter error with the API, we suggest you turn to our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Developer Network forum</a> for the dedicated help.</p>

<p>Hi Swati,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can understand the inconvenience caused by it. By default, when we open the Excel application it displays as below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2e189b3-de54-4989-b6d6-1765d66fbfb8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2e189b3-de54-4989-b6d6-1765d66fbfb8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you already added the add-in provided by the J.P Morgan Access Insight, which is not the product of Microsoft. Based on your description, the problem
<strong>windows struck </strong>occurs when you try to login to add-in. So, the problem is not related to Excel application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi &nbsp;,</p>
<p>On my Lumia 720 the Denim update is essentially the Preview for Developers as seen a couple of months ago. It is expected there will be additional updates to Denim over the next months to correct errors and add new features.</p>
<p>Lumia Camera 5 was updated yesterday, and there is an update on Lumia Conversations regarding Denim:</p>
<p><a href="http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2015/01/15/lumia-denim-update-coming-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2015/01/15/lumia-denim-update-coming-way/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the default settings, the phone will check daily and&nbsp;prompt when updates are ready - or it can be checked manually in Setting &gt; phone updates, and in the Store app &gt; options &gt;&nbsp;settings &gt; scroll and tap 'check for updates'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no public information available regarding the timeframe in a specific country or for a specific phone variant.</p>
<p>All we can do is wait, more or less patiently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Lumia 830 shipped with Denim, then it would be the full Denim for the 830. Maybe somebody else got confused and assumed you were running the developer preview that hs been made available for other models. Most pre-existing models do not have the full
 Denim yet.</p>

<p>Regarding the new Lumia Camera 5 on Lumia 830, an additional firmware update&nbsp;for the preloaded Denim is required:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jalakarhu/status/553390565837271040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://twitter.com/jalakarhu/status/553390565837271040</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect there will be an updated Denim firmware package for older phones through the Lumia Software Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>The Denim update came as an additional Over The Air update after using the recovery tool on my Lumia 720 recently.</p>

            Apparently and annoyingly not full Denim! For Lumia Camera 5.0 the 830 needs a fw update!! This was not apparent on launch, a bit deceiving IMHO!!

                    I am running Office Professional 2010 under Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64. I have set the Normal style to use "Body" as the required font. Where do I set the font style? Under Word 2010, the default font style can be set in the Styles section of the Home
 tab, but the Change Styles command does not seem to be available in Excel 2010. I really would like to get rid of the Calibri font and use a font of my choice with the ability to change Heading and Body fonts at a whim.

            I have discovered how to setup the defualt fonts for Excel. Two templates can be created in C:\Users\MyName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART called Book.xltx and Sheet.xltx. The Book template will be used when a new workbook is created, and the
 Sheet template when a new sheet is added to an existing workbook. In both of these templates, a default font can be set.

<h2>            Windows 10 and Microsoft Access</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; This year I need to update my PC from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will Windows 10 Home be sufficient to run MS Access or should&nbsp;I&nbsp;get Windows 10 Professional?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MS Access as part of MS Office Professional 2013.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

    <title>&#34;Find&#34; button and Ctrl-F shortcut do not work in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian f. kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Find&#34; button and Ctrl-F shortcut do not work in Word</h2>
                    <p>I have a very strange problem.&nbsp; When I click on the "Find" button or hit the Ctrl-F shortcut, nothing happens at all.&nbsp; The Find dialog box does not come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is particularly strange is that if I click on the "Replace" button (or hit Ctrl-H), the Find &amp; Replace dialog pops up just fine.&nbsp; I can then click on the "Find" tab in that dialog box and the actual search process works perfectly well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting the ribbon and I have tried repairing Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:&nbsp; Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Word 2010 SP2 32-bit, plenty of disk space, memory, etc.</p>

            <p>This is what is called a Keyboard shortcut in Word jargon. Does the Navigation pane possible show a find box?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly some other Add-In (or program) has hijacked the shortcut.</p>

            <p>In Word 2010, <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> is assigned to <strong>NavPaneSearch</strong>. Is the Navigation pane not opening when you press
<strong>Ctrl+F</strong>? If you really prefer to have the shortcut open the <strong>
Find</strong> dialog, you can change the assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Ribbon and choose <strong>Customize the Ribbon...</strong></li><li>In the <strong>Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts</strong> dialog, in the bottom left corner next to "Keyboard shortcuts," click
<strong>Customize...</strong> </li><li>In the <strong>Customize Keyboard</strong> dialog, under "Categories," select
<strong>Home Tab</strong> or <strong>All Commands</strong> and scroll down to <strong>
EditFind</strong>.</li><li>In the "Press new shortcut key" box, press (do not type) <strong>Ctrl+F</strong>. Word will inform you that the shortcut is "Currently assigned to: NavPaneSearch."</li><li>Since there is no other convenient way to open the Navigation pane with the Search function on top, you may want to assign a different shortcut to it (or at least unassign
<strong>Ctrl+F</strong>), so select <strong>All Commands</strong> and scroll down to
<strong>NavPaneSearch</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Ctrl+F</strong> in the "Current keys" box and click <strong>Remove</strong>.</li><li>You can then enter a different keyboard shortcut for this command if you like.</li><li>Click <strong>Close</strong> to close the <strong>Customize Keyboard</strong> dialog and
<strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong> to close the <strong>Customize the Ribbon and keyboard shortcuts</strong> dialog.</li></ol>

I could not find a Normal.dot anywhere. &nbsp;I did find an instance of Normal.dotm at C:\Users\administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates<br />
<br />
(I also checked C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP)<br />
<br />
With Word closed (double-checked Task Manager and closed all Office apps in case there is something shared, such as the editor for Outlook), I renamed it to have a ".bak" extension and re-opened Word.<br />
<br />
The problem persists. &nbsp;A new "Normal.dotm" file was auto-generated by Word in the same folder, so I'm pretty sure I found the right one.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the on-going suggestions.

            <p>I am quite certain that is the location of the normal template--I am logged into the machine as "administrator" and I checked it using VBA. &nbsp;It is absolutely at&nbsp;C:\Users\administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While renaming it to ".bak" is certainly going to ensure it is not opened, I went ahead and renamed it to "NormalSave.dotm" instead as you suggest and the result was exactly the same.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Smart Folders Display Number of Items</h2>
                    <p>Hi in Outlook 2013 for Windows (and many previous versions) you could have the search folder display the number of items. &nbsp;So for example I'd have a category for Project X Follow Up items. &nbsp;Any emails categorized this way would sum total and be displayed
 in a way similar to below. &nbsp;This is pretty useful functionality so I know how far behind I am. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Does this exist in this version of Outlook for Mac?</p>
<p>

<p>-- Project XX (34)</p>
<p>-- Project XB (2)</p>

<h2>            Nokia Mail - &#38;quot&#59;Other&#38;quot&#59; Account Setup Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Help.&nbsp; Nokia Mail Other/Manual Setup Not Accessible.</p>
<p>A previously manually setup IMAP account got deleted from my C3-00.</p>
<p>It is an account that requires manual setup, but when I tried to set it up again under "Other" the Nokia Mail App will no longer let me.&nbsp; It had been working before and I inputted manual settings when it was previously set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now under "Other" instead of going from the mail address and password screen to the manual setup (POP3/IMAP) screen it just says: "Could not sign in. Try again."</p>
<p><br />
The email address is on the @mytyndale.ca and I need to input these settings manually:<br />
&nbsp;IMAP setting:&nbsp; Server name: pod51011.outlook.com&nbsp; // Port: 993 // Encryption method: SSL<br />
SMTP setting: Server name: pod51011.outlook.com // Port: 587 // Encryption method: TLS<br />
<br />
Please help or fix this for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a way to force manual setup that I am missing let me know about that.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>NOTE: I was able to get the account setup by putting in an incorrect email address and then putting the correct login information in the manual setup&nbsp; set up sceeen.&nbsp; But Nokia Mail will not let my change my email address after the setup has been made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone Model: Nokia C3-00</p>

<p>Help Me Too!</p>
<p>When I try to create an Other account for the dccnet.com mail server, first I get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unknown domain.</p>
<p>Provide your server information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then after putting in "mail.dccnet.com"/993/SSL,</p>
<p>and mailserver/465/SSL I get:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Server not found.</p>
<p>Check your details and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the details are correct. I know the server's cetificate is not 100% valid, but other phones can use it.</p>

<p>It is a mess! Because the chain of certificates is disordered, as well (in IMAP&nbsp;port 993). With SMTP&nbsp;(587 and 465) and IMAP STARTTLS (port 143), important intermediate certificates are missing completely. Which other devices do you use successfully?</p>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7CAC1CDC-1D61-4F65-BA9E-ECA5E8DEC471">SunshineBC</a>, on your desktop computer, when you go for&nbsp;<u><a href="https://webmail.eastlink.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">webmail.eastlink.ca</a></u>, are you
 able to login with your password? (double-checks we are using the right credentials). Are you able to log-in via&nbsp;<u><a href="https://webmail.dccnet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">webmail.dccnet.com</a></u>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let us double check the origin of your request (IP address outside of Canada). Please, try the same from within the Nokia browser of your phone because it does use a proxy based IP address. Does it work? If yes, please, try Opera Mini as well – because
 that useses yet another IP address. In all these browsers (yours on your desktop, in Nokia browser, and in Opera Mini), please, check your IP with
<a href="http://my-ip.mobi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>my-ip.mobi</u></a>. Please post your IPs and results (worked, did not work) and I check the location of that IPs if there is a did-not-work. Perhaps Eastlink has an outside filter in
<em>combination</em> with some passwords – the procedures above checks that.</p>

<p>Apple Mail 4 » Menu » Mail » Preferences » Accounts » Eastlink » Advanced » Port = 143</p>
<p>I recommend to use mail.eastlink.ca IMAP, port 143, security STARTTLS. That is the only combination which gives a valid certificate and chain up to a known certificate authority (root CA). Because that is just a guess, from looking at the server responses,
 did that help? If that works without security warning, you are able to use the same in your Nokia. Does it work now?</p>

<h2>            Timeline has&#47;shows no history &#40;17133.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I installed RS4&nbsp;<span>on my Surface Pro (2017)</span> via Insiders slow ring (directly from 16299.309), but the Timline feature (Task View) shows
<em>only open apps</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Timeline has no history, and as soon as I close an app it disappears - and when restarting the PC TaskView/Timeline is emptied. It does show a scrollbar (when enough apps are open) and I can create new desktops (but there is no search available). Edge shows
 the *window* but not the individual sites/tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When troubleshooting, I've made sure the check boxes under Activity History for allowing Windows to collect activities and toggled my MS account to on. I've tried unchecking, rechecking, both with and without restarting the PC, but nothing seems to help.
 I also found online that one can create a registry key to allow Timeline, but it too makes no difference:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System\EnableActivityFeed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from others having installed RS4/1803, Timeline is supposed to "just work." I'm at a loss for how to solve this problem, even though I've seen Insiders have had this problem with previous (very early) builds too. Any thoughts on how to solve this?
 Will I need to restore Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The problem was solved, but I can't say how. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I suddenly received a whole bunch of driver updates on my Surface Pro 2017, all of them dated 2017 (so at least 4-5 months old, some over a year old). I took screenshot of the updates and managed to post them to Twitter before I received a Green
 Screen of Death (BSOD for Insiders). Here are the updates:&nbsp;<span>https://twitter.com/PerBylund/status/984362767149948929</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Upon restart, Edge had lost all its open tabs (and they're not in history) but Timeline suddenly shows activity going back to 3/13 (a whole month, since today is 4/12!). I've restarted the computer again to make sure there are no temp files
 etc left in the wrong places from the GSOD. Timeline still works, and all the drivers are shown as "Installed Successfully" in Settings under View Update History.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm including the "what happened" information and the driver updates so that you can find and correct the error (since something obviously caused the GSOD, but that something also is related to making Timeline work).&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;<span>Hi
</span><span>ssbtech</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>You can try to sync the library via OneDrive for business app instead of the online page. Below are the steps:
</p>
<p>1. Right click the OneDrive icon on the system tray &gt;
<a href="https://contoso.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://contoso.sharepoint.com</a> &gt; select the Shared Docs library &gt;<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sync selected. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd3b118a-ef5f-4aef-b07e-c4aa1068a44e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd3b118a-ef5f-4aef-b07e-c4aa1068a44e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please let us know the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. Can you use the account to sign in to Office 365 portal, OneDrive library and the SharePoint site now?</p>
<p>2. Is the account you used to sign in the same as the one you access the SharePoint?</p>
<p>3. Please try to sync a new library or sync with a new browser to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jared</p>

            <p>Thanks Jared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this isn't working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll answer your questions first:</p>
<p>1) Yes, the account logs in successfully to the Office 365 Portal, OneDrive and the SharePoint site</p>
<p>2) Yes, using the same username (email) and password to access the SharePoint site</p>
<p>3) I've attempted this on multiple VMs with multiple different SharePoint/Office 365 accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some additional screenshots.&nbsp; I appear to have a different version of the OneDrive apps than you do.&nbsp; Note that the apps that I have installed came with the Office 2016 downloaded through the Office 365 Business portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there are <em>no</em> errors associated with the login attempt - the blue
<em>Sign in</em> simply doesn't work.&nbsp; It's as if it's not connected to anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi
</span><span>ssbtech</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure your office 2016 sign in account is the same as this account you are using to sync SharePoint library by OneDrive. To check this, you can open Word &gt; File &gt; Account &gt; if it's not
 this account, then click Switch account &gt; Sign in with this account (may need to wait a while). After you signed in, wait a while until all the Office apps are signed in with this account. (you can open them to check it)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfcd12d3-332b-4891-8d0c-d5842da85f70" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfcd12d3-332b-4891-8d0c-d5842da85f70" height="428" width="618" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, in the account page, you can click Update Options &gt; Update Now to update the Office apps to the latest version and then sign in with this account again to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Skype generated a new account for me when I selected 'sign in'.&nbsp; I now cannot access my previous account under the same email log in and the previous account is not showing under that email.&nbsp; I need to access this account urgently for my work. I can see the
 previous account when I search (under the new account) but do not know how to recover it to sign in to it. I have the original confirmation email from Skype with the account live number.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your assistance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately the problem remains.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All mail and calendar functions work perfectly but after initial contact sync, which works fine, no modifications or additions are synched in either direction.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any further advice or suggestions would be appreciated.</div>

                    I got my daughter a new windows 10 tablet for christmas. It meets the 10.1 inch and under criteria and came preloaded with word mobile,excel mobile, and powerpoint mobile. These are supposed to be free apps yet when she tries to use them it says windows
 365 subscription required. Are they free or not? if free how do we activate them without the subscription?

            <p>The following steps worked for me (don't ask me how or why :( ):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click any office app on windows phone.</li><li>In the screen, it shows New, Browse &amp; recent files. It also shows my name/account at the top-right.</li><li>Clicking on you name/account at top-right shows 2 accounts associated with this application.
<ul>
<li>Personal Account</li><li>Official Account</li></ul>
</li><li>Clicking on any of these accounts, only gives an option to sign-out.</li><li>Since Microsoft Support technical team suggested that I reset my device. I did not want to reinstall all the apps, take backups &amp; then reconfigure all of these again after the reset, unless it was the only option left.</li><li>With no better option, I clicked sign-out on both the accounts listed in step 4 above. I then signed in with my official account. I was able to create new Office documents now.</li><li>I logged-in to my other personal account also now. My office app still worked &amp; allows me to access onedrive associated with both my personal &amp; business accounts.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I was facing the same issues &amp; even had multiple calls with Microsoft Support &amp; waiting for a resolution.</p>
<p>Going through the above thread, I realized that multiple Microsoft accounts (personal &amp; office) are associated with these apps. When I signed out of both these accounts from within the app &amp; signed back in, I was able to edit using the office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>This was very helpful. It worked for you but may not for the initial poster, since your work account may have the necessary Office 365 subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, though I have both an Office 365 subscription for my work account and an O365 personal subscription, initially when I set up my new Lumia 950XL, I was being told that I needed O365 to edit my documents. I had several fruitless calls with Microsoft
 support but got the edit feature only after adding my work account. It should have worked with my personal account but it might have if I logged out and logged back in.</p>

</p><p>I also now realize that when the support person was asking me if there was a activate button she may well have been trying to point me to my name in the upper right corner, which marked my account login. I would not have know how to log out since I did not
 fully recognize the relevance of my name there.</p>

</p><p>In the product description for the app it says that this app is designed for phones and tablets. A valid Office 365 subscription is needed to edit documents on PCs and big tables (&gt; 10.1").

<p>This saved my 1 year old impasse! I am now editing documents without any problem. When I did this trick (log out, login with work email), my license type changed from "Read Only" to "Office 365" and now the interface is working well</p>

<p>Not sure what you are referring to by point 4 &amp; 5. However, the crux is that you need to signout &amp; signin from within the app.</p>

<br />
Save the file in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows XP the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\[User Name]\Application Data\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
In Windows Vista and Windows 7, it is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
When you have done that, the tab shown below will be added to the Ribbon:<br />
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07cc7b6c-5478-47fa-8393-ad3180bee1aa" /><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>One thing to note is that the field names in your data source must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).</span></p>
<span>You may also want to download the Merging with Attachments document that is also on that page which explains how the system is used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not actually necessary to have separate attachments as the facility can be used to send just the documents created by the merge itself as attachments, either in the form of Word files or .pdf files.<br />

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply although I don't see how it really helps me.</p>
<p>After looking and trying the merge tools,&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not really sure what anything does and if this can&nbsp;be accessed through code.&nbsp; I even found your document Merging with Attachments confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking the icons of your merge tools; however, I kept getting the message that&nbsp;I have to use letter type main document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't looking for an alternative to Word's mail merge, just how to add text to the body of the email with the VBA code I provided.</p>

            <p>There is no way that you can modify that code to do what you want.&nbsp; In fact, I am not sure why you are using code if you are not looking for an alternative to Word's mail merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are executing a merge to email, the text will need to be in the mail merge main document and if you want variable text, you could use an { IncludeText } field that references a field in the data source that contains the variable text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you use the Merge with Attachments facility on my MergeTools add-in to execute the "merge" to a Word or PDF Attachment, you can enter text into what will be the covering email message that is sent to the recipients with their "merged"
 document as the attachment.</p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Perhaps either you misunderstood my request or I haven't communicated my thought clear enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your documentation, your MergeTools seems to take the data source from an excel file.&nbsp; I am using a dbf file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in no way looking for an alternative to Word's mail merge.&nbsp; I am performing the merge via code so that the merge can progress several ways depending on the user's actions.&nbsp; This is an automated process, not a manual one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me provide some more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a batch file that calls a word document.&nbsp; Using VBA code, after the data source is accessed, if the email field has an email address, then the code above is executed, otherwise a slight variation of the code is executed to either allow the user to
 view the merged documents or to send them to a printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the original word document, I had a footer with address information.&nbsp; I have recently learned that header and footer information is ignored when performing email mail merge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some code to allow me to extract the text from the footer except I didn't know how to add that code to the email body using my existing code as displayed above.&nbsp; Apparently, according to you, this is not possible unless I am accessing data from the
<p>
</p><p>I found an alternative solution that seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I placed the text from the footer into a text box, then vertically positioned the textbox to the bottom relative to the page.&nbsp; This way it still looks like a page footer, although it isn't actually a footer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text in this textbox appears exactly as&nbsp;expected whether the page is viewed, printed or emailed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your replies.</p>

<p>Hi Helge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if you finished all the&nbsp;preparation of an IMAP migration. Especially the connection to your IMAP server. Please run below commands to verify:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell</a></li><li>Run below command:</li></ol>
<p><strong><em>Test-MigrationServerAvailability -IMAP -RemoteServer &lt;FQDN of IMAP server&gt; -Port &lt;143 or 993&gt; -Security &lt;None, Ssl, or Tls&gt;</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:&nbsp;<span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/use-powershell-to-perform-an-imap-migration-to-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/use-powershell-to-perform-an-imap-migration-to-office-365</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Besides, may I know if the error occurs to just some specific users or all users? You can try to do an IMAP migration (Data migration) in the Office 365 Admin Center to check you can complete without any error.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            Thanks Iry. After a second restart attempt it synced completely. So it seems to be a weakness of the sync engine.

<h2>            The &#34;ruler&#34; within the Draw tab is not active</h2>
                    It says in the help section that we can use "Draw" tab to use the ruler to measure length of picture or anything. we can also twist the ruler in any direction as we want. But my ruler under tab is always inactive, it doesnt respond when i click it.
