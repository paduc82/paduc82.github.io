<h2>            Complaint about IP not related to my FBL</h2>
                    <p>HELLO,</p>
<p>I am a reputable ESP (Email service provider) with FBL with all major ISP including hotmail. Interestingly, It seems that my servers have recently been blocked (as I can not get any emails to hotmail)..and learning that i have been getting abuse complaints
 (through FBL) but those abuse complaints have nothing to do with my IP or servers..who do I contact to report this matter&nbsp; as there is some misunderstanding ?</p>
<p>thanks in adv</p>
<p>Nilesh</p>

                    <p>I run several VPS servers, each server provides services to a small number of charities, including sending bulk mail to supporters.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>None</strong> of these servers is used to send unsolicited marketing mail; they only send mail to people who have specifically asked for it, either through supporting the charity/campaign or by supplying their email through the charity's website
 (e.g. signing a petition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But recently all mail to ...@hotmail and ...@outlook is being rejected with errors like "550 SC-001". Looking this up it says "<span style="color: rgba(51, 68, 85, 1)">Mail rejected by Outlook.com for policy reasons. Reasons for rejection may be related
 to content with spam-like characteristics or IP/domain reputation"</span></p>

    <title>Outlook won&#39;t delete messages from server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awjensen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t delete messages from server</h2>
                    I am using Outlook 2013 32 bit on Win 10 64 bit. I have several POP3 accounts on three different servers and until recently, Outlook would delete messages from the server when I deleted the message in Outlook.<br />
<br />
"Leave a copy of messages on the server" is checked and "Remove from server when deleted from 'Deleted items'" is also checked. Until recently messages on the server were deleted when I delete them on my desktop.&nbsp;Because the same issue is happening with the
 e-mail accounts on three different servers, this is almost assuredly an Outlook issue.<br />
<br />
I have tried to uncheck "Leave a copy ..." and restart Outlook then recheck this box. I have tried to repair the .pst file. I found a post which suggested that I enable Outlook logging and look to see if Outlook is sending the delete messages to the server.
 I have looked at the log file but can't make any sense of it and I can't find info anywhere on the web to help in this regard.<br />
<br />
What can I do to get the deletion functionality working again?

            <p>I created a new profile and added two e-mail accounts that are on two DIFFERENT servers. Created and sent test messages for both. In Outlook 2013, I deleted the messages from the deleted items folder and then used web mail to check if the messages had been

            It has been mentioned that users are having problems with version 16.9 and 16.10 of Office. 
<br />
<br />There may be a fix coming soon. I‚Äôd suggest checking for updates - it make take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times. 
<br />
<br />In the meantime, rollback to a previous version until it is fixed. 
<br />
<br />You‚Äôll need to uninstall the current version, download the old version, and install it. 
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:

            You should try following
<br />
<br />A. I am assuming that your OS is up-to-date. If not, make your OS also up-to-date. The latest OS version is 10.13.3. This is reported to solve the issue.
<br />
<br />If your issue solved, no need to read further down.
<br />
<br />B. Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognized by your Office.
<br />
<br />Latest versions of both OS and Office go hand in hand together and work seamlessly.

<p>2. The Skype addin is not present in the list of IE 9 addons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to uninstall and reinstall Microsoft Office to fix an unrelated problem and the problem no longer occurs.</p>

<p>For the curious, I uninstalled all traces of Office 2007 and installed Office 2010 (also, I've got to love how My One and Only OneNote got into the Getting Started video :D ).</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program
 or service that starts up when you boot the machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>

            <p>Try this. You can even try by omitting the first 2 steps if openvpn managed to install.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>uninstall all tap adapters&nbsp;</strong>in device manager&gt;network adapters</li><li><strong>install openvpn</strong> with default options<br />

<p>Hi EGibby,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To export contacts from IPhone XR to Outlook, I recommend you can try to do the operation below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Connect your IPhone to a computer with a supplied USB cable.</p>
<p>2. Launch the <strong>iTunes</strong> device.</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>your IPhone</strong> on the left panel.</p>
<p>4. Click the ‚Äú<strong>Info</strong>‚Äù tab, check on the ‚Äú<strong>Sync Contacts with</strong>‚Äù option and select ‚Äú<strong>Outlook</strong>‚Äù under the drop down box.</p>
<p>5. You can select ‚Äú<strong>All</strong> <strong>contacts</strong>‚Äù or ‚Äú<strong>Selected</strong>
<strong>groups</strong>‚Äù if you want to select specific contacts.</p>
<p>6. Click ‚Äú<strong>Apply</strong>‚Äù to sync your iPhone contacts to Outlook. Click the "<strong>Eject</strong>" button on the right panel to disconnect your phone from the computer. Close iTunes.</p>
<p>7. Launch Outlook and click ‚Äú<strong>Contacts</strong>‚Äù tab to see the imported contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Betty</p>

<h3> cyndiwiseman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Publisher 2013 with existing Office 2010 Home &#38; Business install</h2>
                    <p>I currently have Office 2010 Home &amp; Business (32-bit)&nbsp;installed on my Windows 7 Professional (64-bit) desktop. Now I need to install Publisher. A representative from Microsoft told me that I couldn't install Publisher 2016 because it would conflict with
 my Office 2010 programs (Outlook, Word, Excel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can buy a new key card for Office 2013 Professional from a local system builder for less than Office 2016 Professional. Will I need to install the whole Office 2013 in order to use Publisher 2013? Or can I choose to just install Publisher 2013? Or, will
 there be a conflict with my Office 2010 programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - I'm not interested in moving to subscription Office 365, and I do not have a tablet or smartphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cyndi</p>

            <p>The information I have read indicates that the rep you talked to was wrong. The conflict is with Office 2013 programs, not Office 2010 and older.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot run multiple versions of Outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot do a custom install with Office 2016. You have to install the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You CAN do a custom install using Office 2013 and install just Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO I would stay with the older versions of Publisher if possible. A lot of people feel Publisher has gotten quite a bit buggier since Pub 2007.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Publisher 2010 still allowed two installations. Pub 2013 &amp; 2016 allow only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of these facts might be changing but I would research the downside of moving away from Office 2010 to Office 2016 before you make any decisions. Here are some links to get you started:</p>

            A clean install may help, but I've been finding that default settings for Internet Explorer have been leaning more heavily towards security rather than performance lately. Options such as Smart Screen can cause delays just by it's nature of having to go
 out to verify if a website is safe to view before it can be displayed to you. You can try adjusting this and other settings through Internet Options which can be found in the Control Panel or from Tools if you have your menu bar enabled in your browser. You
 will then need to click on the Security Tab and then select the Custom Level button. You will be presented with a list of security related options which have to go through to find the setting. While you are at it, you could try adjusting other settings in
 their to improve your browsing experience. If you get too far off base with the settings, you can always press the Default Level button to get you back to where you started from.

<p>I get no error messages, I just need to use Task Manager to close IE. Restarting it doesn't always help, sometimes it will simply freeze again. It can take several goes before it becomes responsive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not experienced the issue with other browsers, I've used Chrome, Firefox and Opera as well as Edge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be worse when started - I have 5 home page tabs to open, Google, BBC, BBC Radio, Alphr and Into Windows. It can happen with one page open but is worse with multiple tabs - I wonder if this simply increases the chances of a problem occurring .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try reducing security setting as Rick-M suggested to see if this makes any difference,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm planning on doing a complete reinstall now I've got the ISO for build 15063, I just need to wait until I've got a whole day free to do all the program reinstalling!</p>

<h2>            Revision History&#63;</h2>
                    I made edits to an original document of mine (and pressed save), but when I opened the document a few days later, it was back to its original state, not reflecting these edits. Is there a way to get my edits back? Because if not, I may have to start using
 Google docs again...

            <p>You might also consider implementing a 'version control' kind of thing for files like this that you may alter and work on over a period of days or even weeks.&nbsp; This gives you kind of a separate backup in case things go really south and you can't recover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start out with a file and tack on a 'version number' like</p>
<p>NewProject_001.xlsm</p>
<p>Now, when I next open it to work on it some more, I immediately use Save As and give it the next sequence number</p>
<p>NewProject_002.xlsm</p>
<p>and then proceed to do more work with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This continues until I'm finished with the work and then I give it a more 'common' name like maybe just NewProject.xlsm</p>
<p>so that this holds the current version, and any links or shortcuts I set up to it will always work.&nbsp; If I have to work on it some more again, I revert back to giving it next sequential version number and press on, saving the final (is it ever really final?)
 version again as the basic filename.</p>

    <title>Conditional formatting on redirected emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> genvolkers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conditional formatting on redirected emails</h2>
                    <p>Any idea how to create a conditional formatting on redirected emails? Eg. Emails sent to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** gets redirected to me. When I received them, I need them to be colour coded in Red.
</p>
<p>As they are redirected to me, when I open the emails, they are from individual senders not
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp; as the sender. So, it's not as straightforward to create a conditional formatting where condition is emails From:
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** colour them Red.</p>

            If you examine the headers of the messages, can you see anything that will typify the messages as redirected, such as the "received" headers?&nbsp; If so, you can use a rule to move the message to a particular folder, assign a particular flag, or assign a particular
 category.&nbsp; Conditional formatting can't access header information, as far as I can see.

            Thank you Jay for your prompt reply, however, the issue is that when "Remove personal information...." is checked and a user opens the document in Office 2013 it may show that pop up, but a different user will open it and NOT get the pop up. What's the
 difference. It's the same document.

            <p>I find that I'm not able to get the popup to appear, either on the same PC where the Document Inspector was used to remove personal info or on another computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can pass your question to the Microsoft development team, but to do that I'll need you to list the exact steps you used to create and modify the document and to see the popup (or not). Things to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the Document Inspector run on the same PC or on a different one?</li><li>Does it make a difference whether the document was created in Word 2010 or Word 2013?</li><li>How is the document being transmitted from one computer to another? Network, email, etc.?</li><li>Is Track Changes still turned on, or is it turned off but there are still unaccepted changes in the document?</li><li>What method are you using to open the document, double-clicking in File Explorer or using the Open command in Word?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It will also help to have the Word build number (shown at File &gt; Help in 2010 and at File &gt; Account &gt; About Word in 2013) and the Windows version for PCs that do and don't show the popup.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am experiencing this same problem. I have been searching the forum for a sensible answer to this issue without any success. No moderator has been able to provide a concrete answer or solution. All i keep seeing are obvious copied and pasted answers, about
 domains.live.com being redirected to Windows Live Admin Center since 31st July, 2014.<br />
<br />
That's not an answer and yes we were all informed, that from July 31st no admins will not be able to add or remove users on their domains. However we were not informed that the domains will be removed from the admin center.<br />
<br />
It would have been great help if we were informed that all domains will be removed from the admin center, so we can backup our information.<br />
<br />
My company has an existing email service on domains.live.com, but now we can't view any of our existing users or backup the list of users previously created.&nbsp;Yes we understand the service was being offered to for free, but that's no reason to take more than
 we were told from us leaving countless of people frustrated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What i need to know now, is how can we view the list of existing users previously created on our Live Admin Center. Just get us the list and save us the frustration.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Howard<br />

            Saying there is no facility is false information. We are not stupid, long as users can login on outlook.com, there is a record. I have spoken with several microsoft support personel and they all seem to have no idea our domains disappeard from our Windows
 Live Admin.<br />
<br />
The best thing you can do is admit there flaw in the system and try to resolve our issues. Your actions will only prove to the general public how concerend microsoft is about its customers and how we can rely on your service regardless if its free or paid.<br />
<br />
We need a solution and encouragement please...

            What you describe suggests that "Different first page" has been selected in the Page Setup dialog box (or on the Header &amp; Footer Tools Design ribbon tab). You can simply copy the content of the first page header (and footer) and paste it into the counterpart
 on the second page.<br />

                    <p>Hi, I represent an organization that makes community service in poor areas of Mexico teaching locals how to build their own houses the best way possible with low resources and eco-friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is Custom Domain is closed for new accounts and we need more than the actual 12 we use. So I'm taking down our domain from Outlook Custom Domains services (Domains.live.com) but i need to back up many (or all 3000+) emails from one of the accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Outlook.com's Import Email Accounts but they offer me to add it as "Send-Only" and this doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to import this emails from a GMail with the correct settings (Server: pop3.live.com, Port: 995 with SSL) but it says the password is wrong (which is not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me export/backup those emails. if possible i would like to avoid ussing Office's Outlook to create .pst files. I prefer to have this mails in another Web account.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Word 2007 - Is there a way to copy background color&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am editing a document that has some background colors that are not from the normal pallett.&nbsp; I am creating some new documents that need to be formatted the same way.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out what the existing background color is so that I can copy it into other documents?</p>

            While Stefan's approach is definitely the most practical, it should be possible to determine the color. At Page Layout | Page Background, click Page Color and select More Colors... In the Colors dialog, select the Custom tab and note the RGB colors. Replicate
 those in your new document.

            <p>You may find it easier to reverse the process: Using the document with the desired formatting as a starting point, create a template. Create a new document based on the template, and then copy in the content from existing documents that you want to reformat.</p>

    <title>1st Time Email Verification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gruffyndork  say:</h3>
<h2>            1st Time Email Verification</h2>
                    <p>My issue stems from the initial set-up &nbsp;of my new email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have no phone</p>
<p>- I'd rather not have this new account linked to one of my current or old emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that I'm missing something very simple here, after creating my account it's asking me to find the verification email, but, I can't get into my inbox because it's still asking for my account to be verified.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92bbc139-0da6-4395-a311-c4a2e2f57b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92bbc139-0da6-4395-a311-c4a2e2f57b19" /></a></p>

            <p>Mike, which drive was selected as the boot hard drive?&nbsp; The safest way to keep the two OS's completely separate on one computer with two physical drives is probably to select the desired installation location to be the boot drive.&nbsp; You can later add the
 win7 install to the win10 bootloader using bcedit or easybcd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At three hours in, I would think you are now trying to upgrade your Win7 install and don't know if you'll be able to roll that back or not.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t alter hierarchy chart layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hans.pnw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t alter hierarchy chart layout </h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to set up an org chart using Smart Art. I can't really draw it here, so I'll describe it thusly:</p>
<p>Top level: one element<br />
2nd down: one element, an assistant<br />
3rd down: one element<br />
4th: two assistants<br />
5th: one assistant</p>
<p>In the chart I have added three "Assistants" to a single individual's box. Word will NOT orient these three Assistants on the same line; instead, it puts two next to each other and drops the third one below the two. There is ample space to line up all three.
 I cannot seem to move these elements, either&nbsp;with my mouse or by messing with the text-based hierarchy?</p>
<p>Any assistance is appreciated...&nbsp;</p>

                </div>


            <div role="alert" class="m-alert f-information">

</span>
            <div id="threadBottomSection" class="">
<div  class="thread-message thread-message-answer shading thread-message-enus"
     pagepos="1" msgpos="0" msgsection="Answers"
     translated-to=""
     translated-from="">
            
        <div data-bi-id="message-username-image-link" class="message-user-image message-username-image-link avatar-size-small circular-display" role="img"
           title="Adam Vero" aria-label="Profile picture" >
            <img onerror='this.className="default-avatar-profile circular-display red185 avatar-size-small"; this.setAttribute("alt", "AV"); this.style="display: inline-block";'
<h3> adam vero  say:</h3>
<ul class="message-user-info-affiliations-list">
    </ul>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I can reproduce what you are seeing, but I wonder if the problem is that you don't really want assistants, but subordinates.</p>
<p>Usually you would have the big boss, then senior management then middle management then those that do the real work at the bottom. In some places you may also have an assistant, for example the personal assistant to the big pointy-haired boss. They can't&nbsp;
 be shown at the same level as the senior managers as that is not really their 'rank', but they do need to be shown reporting to the PHB. They are usually shown to one side of the line down from the boss to the next level, almost like a callout box.</p>
<p>Your org chart sounds like you have several assistants to one person, but I wonder if you really just mean they are direct reports.</p>
<p>Normally you can simply add people to the text pane next to the Smart Art - type a name and hit enter for the next person, or tab to 'indent' to the next level of hierarchy, shift-tab to outdent back up.</p>
<p>You will see that if you have three direct reports they are shown equally spaced in a single line (by default) rather than assistants where it tries to show them all associated with the down line and won't move them across the page.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
