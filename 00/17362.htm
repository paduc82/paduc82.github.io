<h2>            Calendar Date Quirks&#58; WMDC, Outlook 2007, WM 6.1 Touch Pro 2</h2>
                    Verizon Touch Pro 2, running Stock ROM, Outlook 2007, Vista Home Premium 64-bit Desktop running most current version of WMDC.<br />
<br />
I've had this phone since October or so, and ActiveSync has run fine, syncing Contacts, Calendar, Email, Notes, etc.&nbsp; But starting around the first of the year, the dates for various calendar items has become screwy.&nbsp; A few examples:<br />
<br />
In Outlook 2007, my wife's birthday is entered correctly in her Contact Info as June 1st, and appears correctly in Outlook 2007's Calendar as June 1st, an all-day event.&nbsp; But on my Touch Pro 2, it appears as January 1st!!!&nbsp; But if I change it to a partial-day
 event in Outlook 2007, e.g. 8 am to 8 pm, it will then appear on the correctday on my Touch Pro 2, but will show as 7 am to 7 pm.<br />
<br />
If I enter a recurring all-day event in Outlook 2007, for a vacation, let's say from May 21 to June 7th, it appears correctly in Outlook with those dates.&nbsp; But after ActiveSync, it shows as being from May 20 to June 6th, 1 day early for both start and finish.&nbsp;
 Once again, if I change it from all-day to half-day, say 8 am to 8 pm, it will then show on my Touch Pro 2 on the correct dates, but once again, one hour earlier, i.e. 7 am to 7 pm.<br />
<br />
To try and correct this, I disabled the Calendar Sync option within WMDC while my phone was connected via ActiveSync, and as expected, it wiped out all Calendar Entries on my Touch Pro 2.&nbsp; I then re-enabled it, expecting it to re-Sync the Calendar onto my Touch
 Pro 2.&nbsp; But nothing happened.&nbsp; But I then initiated the ActiveSync from my Touch Pro 2, and this time it did re-Sync all the Calendar entries onto my Touch Pro 2, although the date/time anomalies documented above are still present.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a basic bug in ActiveSync, although I don't know if it's in Outlook 2007 or WMDC.&nbsp; But to not be able to do something as basic as Calendering is pretty ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I did some searching here, but didn't see any mention of this, which surprised me.&nbsp; There are several threads in the PPCGeeks Touch Pro 2 Forums, and this problem is actually fairly common.<br />
<br />
Any information, and hopefully a fix, greatly appreciated.<br />

            Have you recently traveled where the time zone would have changed?&nbsp; That seems to be the most common cause of this issue from my experience (personal and helping others).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you have not traveled, my suggestion would be to completely remove the partnership between your phone and WMDC as something within the database has corrupted would be my educated guess.&nbsp; Before setting up the new partnership, verify the calendar on your
 PC is indeed correct.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

            Hi Clinton,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I did travel to Peru at the end of October, for about 11 days.&nbsp; I don't recall the problem existing before that, and since I don't know exactly when it started afterwards, you might be right.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about your suggestion, though, because of this: my TP2 started having erratic Display Alignment and I received a Refurb to replace it, several weeks ago.&nbsp; I did use my SPB Backup to restore everything to the new device, but when I did my first
 ActiveSync, it created a new partnership.&nbsp; The problem persisted despite this.<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat new to ActiveSync (in the Palm World for several years prior to my TP2), so if I do try your suggestion, am wondering precisely what happens.&nbsp; If I remove the Partnership within WMDC, when the device is *not* connected, what exactly happens the
 next time I ActiveSync?&nbsp; I want to make sure that my Contacts, Calendar, etc. in Outlook are not somehow removed.&nbsp; And what happens to the Contacts, Calendar, etc. on my TP2 in this scenario?<br />
<br />
Or should I remove the Partnership when the TP2 *is* connected?&nbsp; Same question - what exactly happens on both PC and TP2?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

            Do you receive any errors during your Sync with WMDC Sync Center? I had individual calendar errors on Outlook 2007 &amp; my WinMo phone. This is what I did to resolve the problems.
<div><br />
<div>
<p>My errors were due to "re-occurring calendar entries" which were entered on my XP Pro 32-bit PC &amp; ActiveSync 4.5 and were simply incompatible with Win7 64-bit. I had to switch from erasing these recurring calendar entries on both my new PC as well as my
 Smartphone. Additionally, not all of the reoccurring calendar entries were removed when I chose "delete all". Therefore, I had to continue syncing to identify individual calendar entries and then remove each individual calendar entry. This took approximately
 2 hours so unfortunately you will need to be patient if you run into this problem.</p>

            Thanks MikeWBL but no - no error messages. I was reading the rather long thread here about how sometimes ActiceSync will completely erase contacts from both PC and Phone which is why I'd like to understand ActiveSync better before removing any Partnership.
 Any details on this and how to ensure this doesn't happen would be appreciated.

            Bump - any ideas on the original funky Calendar behavior, or how to eliminate the possibility of losing Contacts/Calendars if I remove and recreate a Partnership (see my post above)?<br />

            Have you tried erasing the&nbsp;<span>reoccurring</span>&nbsp;calendar entries? I did this but found that "erase all" did not work. I had to go through and keep erasing some of them.
<div><br />
<div>Once you are confident your reoccurring entries are deleted, you can reenter the reoccurring birthdays.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This worked for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck!</div>

<p>So your system is not moving on to the latest Insider update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised uninstalling the CU for that build did not allow the update to be resent and installed, but the only other option you might have is to rollback 17133.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to try the WindowsUpdate.log, you can get it by using the Admin PowerShell and the command below.&nbsp; It might be helpful, depending on who is looking at it but be aware there
<em>may </em>be some sensitive info included.</p>

[a]Kindly check compatible apps,ie jad.,jar.,though some phones may also pick sis.apps!<br />
[b]check your settings especially device encription.If this is on,then your phone is prohibited to instal any app.<br />
[c]check online certificate check and verification.Any app whose certificate can't be verified/passed by your phone can't be installed.You may turn this off(this would damage your phone)!

            Hello friends, I need your help urgently. I have a Nokia 2700c and I need the answer of following questions serialwise : (1) Can Nokia 2700c be installed with Flash Player, PDF reader? If yes,then, how much memory size will it be covered? (2) In the internet
 advertisement, there is availability of PDF reader to be downloaded for Nokia 2700c with different memory capacities. Can that be downlaoded directly from the mobile? Can that be involved virus? (3) There is also internet advt for antivirus for Nokia 2700c
 to be downloaded. Can that be directly downloaded from the mobile? Can that antivirus itself be involved virus. PLEASE REPLY...

<p>Same thing happened to me but thank God now its solved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the solution&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hold Menu Key,Volume Down Key,Camera Key and press the switch on button (power button) and when your phone vibrates release the switch on button (power button) and keep holding the Menu Key,Volume Down Key,Camera Key and wait for a while and your phone will
 be as good as new</p>

    <title>Sporadically unable to type in a PPT text box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sporadically unable to type in a PPT text box</h2>
                    
<p>PowerPoint for Mac version 15.17 (151206)</p>
<p>MacBook Pro</p>
<p>Is anyone else having this problem? I have numerous PPT files where I sporadically cannot edit in a text box. I click inside the text box, try to start typing, and get the "ding" sound that says nope can't do that here. Paging up and/or down several times
 solves the problem, but the issue is so pervasive that it's becoming a huge time suck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue occurs on both newly inserted slides, as well as existing slides. In addition, I could just have edited a box, paged down (or into another app) to look at sometime else, come back to that same box, and wham, can't edit it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most (all?) of the PPTs that I am working were created from the same master template. Some of the files where created on Office 2011 for Mac (by me). Others were created by co-workers who are running Office 365 on Windows (primarily Win 7, maybe some Win
 10).</p>
<p>I haven't explored whether this happens using files created using other master templates, so I am not sure if it is a problem with this particular template or not. If it is a problem with the template, it's still got to be a bug... Can't imagine how I would
 fix it on my own, other than continuing the cumbersome workaround.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I am having exactly the same problem. I have been on the phone for 7 hours with Microsoft and they are still unable to find a solution. So, you are not the only one with the problem. However, Microsoft is telling me no one else is having the problem, but
 clearly several of us are!</p>

<p>This may have been fixed in the latest update. I am running update 15.18. I did some editing in PPT and did not experience the issue, although I wasn't using PPT for that long this time. Are you on the latest update and still experiencing the same problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Super Sarah, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand you're trying to remove the primary Microsoft Account from your phone and are experiencing some difficulties doing so. By design; a Windows Phone must be factory reset in order to remove the
 primary account on the phone. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We advise that any photos, purchased music, or videos on the phone be backed up using the Zune software prior to resetting as it will erase everything on the device. To perform a hard reset, simply navigate to the phone settings &gt; system &gt; about and click
 the reset phone button at the bottom. You will then be able to set up the phone using a different primary account. Please also keep in mind that any Music Pass content or&nbsp;purchased apps and games aren't able to be transferred to a different account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Nate W.H.</p>

<h2>            Why no free navigation on E75&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear support team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The free navigation as Nokia says, is for smarphones. My question is why E75 is not included in compatibile devices which qualifies for free navigation? I own an E71 and I have free navigation, but my girlfriend who paid even more for her E75 doesn't have.
 Could you please explain this to me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Bogdan</p>

<p>The free version of Maps was a totally new version of the app which wasn't compatible with all of the past models at the time. The E71 isn't even compatible with the full free version of Maps, but because it was a tremendously popular phone, a version was
 rushed out for that model; but the same wasn't economically viable to make it backwards-compatible with other older models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some Nokia employees active here, but if you want an official statement you'd be better off contacting the Nokia Care people by the Contact Us link.</p>

<p>Okay, this explains a lot. Been trying for ages to get maps to work on my E75.</p>
<p>Strange that on the compatibility guide it expressly shows the E75 as compatible and even takes you to the map download section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the issues on these pages regarding GPS on Nokia, I think it's time for a change of brand.</p>
<p>Currently using the Garmin mobile software on my E75.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next up will be a Blackberry - tired of trying to find solutions to previously non-existent problems.</p>

    <title>AD user synced with wrong domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xmekmekx  say:</h3>
<h2>            AD user synced with wrong domain</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Support,</p>
<p>In our Office 365 portal have 2 subdomain.</p>
<p>constoso.onmicrosoft.com</p>
<p>Contoso-A.com</p>
<p>Contoso-B.com</p>
<p>Initial office 365 user are manually created in Office 365 portal and after this, &nbsp;we configure ADD Connect &nbsp;with Email-attributes filtering to sync AD user with Office 365 user.</p>
<p>We found out tht there are two users from different domain have same email address insert into AD object Email attribute. When we perform synced that time, we accidentally synced with wrong Office 365 user.</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD object Email attribute for user1 - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD Object Email attribute for user2 -&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>It means a contoso-A AD user, is synced to a contoso-B office 365 user which is wrong, supposedly should be contoso-B AD user synced with contoso-B office 365 user. May i know how to fix this issue so&nbsp;contoso-B AD user synced with contoso-B office 365 user?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since it using OU + Email filtering, i can not just remove email attribute to make&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** become *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and perform sync to sync contoso-B AD user with&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** ( once remove email attribute and sync,
 it will delete office 365 mailbox to deleted item.)</p>
<p>What is the proper step to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi khleong9122,<br />
<br />
It is a little confused me.<br />
Since the accounts are created in Office 365, we should use <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2641663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SMTP matching </a>to match on-premises user accounts to Office 365 user accounts for directory synchronization.<br />
<br />
Do you mean these two accounts have the same email address in local AD?<br />
If so, I’m afraid it is not feasible to sync two different accounts to Office 365 in this scenario.<br />
<br />
Can you change one of the email address to user2@ contoso-A.com as a workaround?<br />
<br />
If I have misunderstood anything, please give us the detailed example for further troubleshooting.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jason Jiang</p>

<p>Hi Jason Jiang,</p>
<p>Yes, you are right,&nbsp;these two accounts have the same email address in local AD due to we not notice these 2 user have the same email address.</p>
<p>We user SMTP matching to sync but we accidentally match the wrong user to account created in Office 365.</p>
<p>Which is we after perform SMTP matching to match *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD Object) to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365) and now is synced with Active Directory. We found out is we match the wrong AD object due to both user are use the same email address in their
 Email-attribute.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The SMTP matching should be like below but we have duplicate email in both AD object caused it match to wrong user.</p>
<p>AD Object &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD object Email attribute for user1 - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox)</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD Object Email attribute for user2 - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) -&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox)</p>
<p>Supposedly correct should be like this.</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD object Email attribute for user1 - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) - &gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox)</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD Object Email attribute for user2 - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) -&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox)</p>
<p>Since we already synced with wrong user, may i know how to resolve this issue?</p>

I understand you have already synced with the wrong user.<br />
I’m afraid it is not feasible to roll back it.<br />
Have you tried manually change the local *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'s email address and then re-sync to see the result?<br />
If it not works, we can only manually re-create the accounts.<br />

<p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>Please find below for my reply.</p>
<p>Jason: Have you tried manually change the local *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'s email address and then re-sync to see the result?</p>
<p>May i know how to do in order to let *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to sync with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox) since *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox) &nbsp;already synced with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (AD Object)?</p>
<p>It is follow your advice to manually change the local *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'s email address and then perform re-sync? I'm afraid it will delete the mailbox or show duplicate user detect when try to sync.</p>
<p>Currently, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 mailbox) is using by user so i can not just try to change at test it out.</p>
<p>Jason: If it not works, we can only manually re-create the account.</p>
<p>Can you please explain more on this, what you mean manually re-create the account? Re-create AD account or office 365 user account?</p>
<p>Delete AD object *** Email address is removed for privacy *** from AD and perform sync to delete Office 365 mailbox, perform sync again to create *** Email address is removed for privacy *** in office 365?</p>

<p>Khleong9122,<br />
<br />
Based on my test, there is a workaround may work for you.<br />
First, we should deactivate the DirSync server in portal.<br />
<br />
And then we can use hard match to match the local user and Office 365 user. You can match the userA to Office 365 with userA and userB to Office 365 with userB.<br />
Please refer to the following link for detailed steps:<br />

<h2>            windows 950 can not hard reset</h2>
                    <p>I have really tried hard, and I mean hard! to stick and trust windows. I might be just one of your fans but today I am truly unsatisfied with the windows phone 950.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly way back during the launch, the phone had heating problems, that's ok.</p>
<p>then battery had to be exchanged, that's still ok.</p>
<p>cracked my screen, my fault but no market in such a massive place like India (after 1 year of release)? you know what, still ok, I ordered it online.</p>
<p>wanted a screen guard and a cover,oh wait no accessories available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now finally, out of nowhere my phone resets and never turns back on because it just felt like it? ok fine, let me lose ALL my data and hard reset... NOPE!&nbsp; can't do that either cause Windows just knows how to _ with us all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>your 'reset' exclamation mark never shows up, and all it does is keep vibrating over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, anyone cause clearly Microsoft isn't going to answer to me. Also, if anyone has phone suggestions, I'm def up for it.</p>

</p><p>I have setup an app in PowerApps which is linked to an Excel file saved in my OneDrive account. I can access the data from my PC using the PowerApps but when I download the app on iOS, I have only managed to access the data once. Now if I select my app from

    <title>Microsoft Lumia 640 Storage Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scdaniels  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Lumia 640 Storage Problem</h2>
                    <p>My "Other" category has 560KB total, and "no files or folders to show." In Storage&gt; This Device&gt;Documents&gt;OneNoteFiles&gt;Local: There is something called Roaming with 448KB. Can this be deleted? There is almost no storage left on this phone, and this seems
 to be taking the bulk of it. My phone is refusing updates and apps are malfunctioning, and often my home WiFi stops working part of the day, and so does the internet connection. What can I do to fix these problems, and if clearing storage is the answer, is
 it safe to delete the big Roaming thing above? Thank you in advance; this MS Lumia 640 is only a few months old, but has had these problems from the start. Also wondering: If I delete pictures taken on the phone, will the same picture files stored in OneDrive
 also delete? It always warns that all existing, or multiple copies of the pictures will also delete, and I want to save content in OneDrive, then delete just the content left on the device.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, you can have your device automatically back up texts, photos, app content and device settings like your passwords, and accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your phone go to <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Backup</strong>.</p>
<p>From there, flip the switches on to backup app data and your system settings.<br />
</p>
<p>To make sure your photos and videos are backed up, open <strong>OneDrive</strong> and then tap the menu icon and head to
<strong>Settings &gt; Camera upload</strong> and turn it on.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can safely remove photos and videos off your phone and they will still be available on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To learn more on this, read our article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-OneDrive-on-Windows-Phone-6D8496DD-7E1E-44FA-8DC8-B8CF6EF6A1A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Word 2013 Xml Mapping Pane questions</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Xml Mapping Pane feature with Word 2013 to map custom xml to the word document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I do not see any option to edit existing elements in the mapped xml in the designer after mapping custom xml?</p>
<p>2. There is no option to delete added custom xml in the designer.</p>
<p>3. Also there is no option given to add new elements to the mapped custom xml.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I request to Microsoft developer team to look these obvious missing features. I have used Word Content Control Toolkit but that does not work/support Word 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take this forward to Microsoft, so we can see these missing features in upcoming release or patch. Do you have any suggestion or help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Vijay</p>

    <title>Make it fit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rev-jay-z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make it fit</h2>
                    I'm looking for a function similar to WordPerfect's "Make It Fit" - automatically reducing font size, etc. to make a document fit on a specified number of pages.<br />
I've seen some other posts about adding MS's "Shrink One Page" command, but I can't get it to work. I've added the command to my menu, but I always get an error that says: "After several attempts, Word was unable to shrink the document by one page." I've tried
 with several different files, with as little as one line on the page I'm trying to eliminate.<br />
The Decrease Font Size command is an option, but can that by edited to decrease by 0.5 points at a time, rather than 1.0?<br />

            I believe that what you found is actually a legacy feature that should have been excluded from the list of commands. It hasn't been functional since Office 2004. My guess is that OS X assuming most of the print responsibility may have had a lot to do with
 its demise.<br />
<br />
Although it has been carried on in the Windows version IMO it really seems to be more
<i>de</i>structive than <i>con</i>structive in contemporary word processing documents. It can really wreak havoc with the layout &amp; flow of all but the most basic documents.<br />
<br />
Depending on how the document is constructed there are usually much more suitable methods, such as fractional adjustment to Line Spacing as well as many other formatting options.<br />
<br />
The incrementation of the Decrease/Increase Font Size tools can't be changed, but you can use font size in .5 pt increments by typing the value into the Font Size device... or preferably in the pecs of the formatting Styles used.<br />

            What shortcuts do you want to disable?  Generally speaking, you can't just disable shortcuts - you'd need to disable the features but a few. like Ctrl+Enter can be disabled in options.

            You can modify and delete keyboard shortcuts: Keyboard Shortcuts in Word 2016. The only trick is finding the appropriate command name.

<h2>            Need to auto-forward to an Office 365 group or need help setting one up</h2>
                    
<p>We have a distribution that is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** that goes to 3 individuals.<br />
<br />
I would like this to now go to an Office 365 Outlook Group so there is really only one email (not 3 - one to each user) in the Outlook group. That way it is handled once and not potentially duplicated.</p>
<p>Last night I deleted the distribution list and created a new Office 365 Group in the O365 admin panel, but after several tries over a 15min period, it kept saying the AccountsPayable@ alias wasn't available.<br />
<br />
So, two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I somehow add the O365 group to the distribution list and remove the other individuals?
</li><li>Or - how do I remove the distribution list and successfully add the O365 group with the same email alias. Our vendors have this email and it is how they send us invoices, so it cannot be down for an extended period (like waiting overnight for example) and
 it cannot be changed. </li></ol>

<p>hi ed hansberry,</p>
<p>when you say “<em>last night i deleted the distribution list</em>”, i would like to know where did you deleted the distribution group from admin portal or exchange admin center.</p>
<p>could you please try to check this issue via using the new-unifiedgroup cmdlet to create office 365 groups to see whether the problem still occurs?</p>
<p>to do this, follow these steps:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online using remote powershell</a><br />
run the following powershell commands: for example, creates a new office 365 group named engineering department.</p>
<p><strong>new-unifiedgroup -displayname "</strong>engineering department<strong>" -alias
</strong>engineering</p>
<p>for your reference:<br />

<p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Below are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>Q1. Can I somehow add the O365 group to the distribution list and remove the other individual?</p>
<p>A: No. It’s not feasible to add the Office 365 modern group to the distribution list.</p>
<p>Q2: Or - how do I remove the distribution list and successfully add the O365 group with the same email alias?</p>
<p>A: After clicking <b>DELETE GROUP,</b> the distribution list will be removed and it may take some time to take effect. Then we can use the distribution list email address to create a new Office 365 modern group. Since you deleted the distribution list last
 night, please confirm if any other recipients’ email address prefix is the same as ‘accountspayable’ in EAC (Exchange admin center)-&gt;<b>recipients</b>-&gt;<b>mailboxes</b>/<b>groups</b>/<b>resources</b>/<b>shared</b>. In addition, please clear the browser cache
 or <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/features/in-private" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
use the browser in private mode</a>&nbsp;to check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Because the UI (user interface) may have a delay, we need to use PowerShell to get the latest result. About the PowerShell error, please run the
<b><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee176961.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</a></b> first and then run the three commands to connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell. If the error persists, I need some information below
 to better understand the situation:</p>
<p>1. Your OS (Operating System) version such as Windows 8.</p>
<p>2. Does the error occur to other administrator accounts?</p>
<p>If PowerShell works well after that, please run the commands provided by Shyamal to check if you can create the new group.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Larry</p>

<p>I deleted the distribution via the Exchange area in the Admin section and not the Groups section. That seemed to free up the email address properly and let me create the group.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

 This error usually occurs because of macro security settings. If you know that the macro comes from a source that you trust, you can change your macro security settings to allow you to enable the macro." etc, etc. I tried every combinations under File, Options,
 Trust Center, Trust Center Settings and&nbsp;Macro Settings and nothing seems to work. Once I press enter, the message goes away and Word works fine. Once a document is opened, if I open another one, this message does not appear. It is only when I start Word or
 a Word document. I re-install the whole Office Suite but the same message appears. I had Office 2010 Professional before which I un-installed before installing Office 2013 Professional. I am using

            <p>If I have it, it came with Office 2013. I know I can open a PDF file as a&nbsp;Word document.&nbsp; That is one of the reasons I purchased Office 2013. Is this what you mean? If yes I don't really way to delete this since I use it. I don't understand, my son has also
 Office 2013 Professional and he does not have this problem. Weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked again my add-ins and it was my ABBYY Fine Reader that came with my Epson Scanner.&nbsp; I uninstall it and the problem went away.&nbsp; I'll have to find an upgrade to this reader that is compatible with Office 2013 Word.</p>

            You can have the hyperlink in your presentation select a text box or picture go to the insert menu and go to hyperlink, then copy and paste the url address for the web page you want to display then when in on-screen mode when you click on it the web pages
 will load and your browser will show on your screen you can navigate around the web page and when you are done showing the web page just toggle back to PPT&nbsp; using the command and tab keys you can do this without leaving on-screen mode.<br />
