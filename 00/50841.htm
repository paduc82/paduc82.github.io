<h3> albert406  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Android will not allow me to log in.</h2>
                    <p>As Skype no longer seems to care about its product since it was purchased by Microsoft, I am reduced to asking questions here. My Skype for Android will not allow me to log in. I was forced to change my password for my Skype account to a common password
 and it has buggered everything. My Skype for Android will not accept any password, sending me into an endless go-to loop. I am exceptionally annoyed and seriously considering dumping this piece of crap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, by desktop Skype works fine and allows me to log-in, but not with the original password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be very helpful if we weren't forced to sign in with a common password for everything and go back to the original way of per account login. I don't want my e-mail and Skype to have the same password.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Addendum:</em></p>
<p>Went to an Skype version from about a year ago found at https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/skype/skype-skype/skype-skype-7-06-0-617-release/skype-7-06-0-617-android-apk-download/download/ and I was able to restore Skype functionality on my Android. This after
 wasting about 5 hours this afternoon trying to get the newest piece of junk update to work...</p>

<p>Mikael,</p>
<p>The issue is that the NEW APK DID NOT work while the older APK did work.&nbsp; The difference between working and not working was ONE update, and caused me to waste 5 hours trying to fix things. I removed and re-installed Outlook and Skype at least 3-5 times
 each trying to address the log-in issue, but it served no other purpose than to make me want to dump all Microsoft programs on my phone...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is spending an inordinate amount of time and effort "Fixing" things that don't need fixing while ignoring issues that have needed fixing for some time. I'm all for improvements when the changes are useful, however I liken this process to putting
 a new &amp; expensive paint job on a car with half an engine that doesn't really run.</p>

<p>This was enormously frustrating. Skype works (worked?) fine on my desktop, but after repeated efforts to activate it on my 5.0 android phone, with multiple requirements to keep changing password, I kept getting the message "Skype doesn't yet run on this
 device" or words to that effect, even though it launched, opened, &amp; I logged in using the same p.w. that works on my desktop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just now gone through this whole process yet again, just to be able to get to this email screen. &nbsp;And changing my password yet again (now matching my MS account p.w. which, BTW, does not conform to the minimum security standard Skype had required),
 it did finally open on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I still have a question for Microsoft, if they're even paying attention, or anyone else out there who might have an idea: &nbsp;I see now that I have 3, count'em, 3, different Skype accounts. &nbsp;The main, current active one I know I use, maybe one from long
 ago I never really used &amp; forgot about, and now yet a third which suddenly appeared. &nbsp;Is there any way for them or me to align them or merge all 3 into just one? &nbsp;Or am I just begging for more trouble by even asking? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>

            I think that version has known bugs, i also got the same issue when using that version, i use stable version 8.9.0.64295 from
<a href="https://www.androidapksbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">androidapksbox</a> and it works great. You can try to update your app to fix this issue.

I burned a dvd with Windows XP installation files, and then tried to boot from it.<br />
After restart my PC just skips the cd and starts loading Windows 7 Ultimate like there's nothing in my optical drive.<br />
Then I went to bios and changed boot sequence, and the only thing that changed was load time, my screen went black for a while then I saw the blinking underscore, it made few jumps down and I was pressing like crazy every key and also "Enter", because i thought
 maybe it tried to boot from cd but didnt display "Press any key to boot from dvd" message or something, but afterwards Windows 7 Ultimate started again.<br />
I also tried to install XP through Vista by autorunning the dvd and pressing Setup.exe but the weird thing is that the option "Install Windows XP" was grayed out.<br />
I don't know what to do now, I really want XP on my pc but this isn't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
please help...!!!<br />

<h3> the ammoniacal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro OEM version for Surface Pro 2 &#40;where to download&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had a Microsoft Surface Pro 2 as my only computer at the time of the Windows 10 TP release, which I've been rather excited about and wanted to try right away. I knew the previous OS would be deleted if I upgraded, so I downloaded a software to "retrieve"
 the product key installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed this product key would work on any Windows 8.1 Pro versions.. but no. It only works on the specific Surface Microsoft OEM version. A version I have not been able to find. When I do try to use the product key on a regular 8.1 Pro it says it's not
 for a retail copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know where I can find an ISO for exact Windows 8.1 Pro version/edition that came with the Surface Pro 2? One where this product key will work? The recovery partition on the surface have never worked either.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>

<p><span>3. Which programs are you referring to?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>

            <p>This is part 2&nbsp; of my response - part 1 was a couple weeks ago. Sorry for the delay but just learning how to follow the instructions was a chore due to my non-tech use of computers.</p>
<p>Without regard to the confusion of running the recommended solutions I can report the following:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - There was NO occasion where I could turn on/use the troubleshooter. Even when advised to employ it the 0x 800.... error was displayed. Always told there was a problem preventing the Troubleshooter from activating. ((However, what that problem was/is
 remains undisplayed and unknown.)) Frankly this thing is driving me batty!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - The 'clean boot' appeared to work however every time I made an entry as directed by the diagrams presented I lost the Restart 'window' and then had to go back to the beginning and enter the 'msconfig.exe' in the start area and pick up with the next
 instruction. Don't know what I was supposed to learn and am no better off than when the question was posed almost a month ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - I can't even print full pages with my Canon 4700. Attempting to print a reservation made for my wife on Southwest all I get is the heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can reiterate is HELP!.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the answer is that the suggested solutions were NOT helpful. But sure would like to try more as</p>
<p>my tech capability is negligable.&nbsp; Thanks to all who contribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Not trying to be a wet blanket but so far I haven't made any forward movement.
</p>
<p>Found that the error cited - 0x 800.... continues to be a blocker for me to get this cmptr square. Just the fact that I cannot run the Troubleshooter is a big hurt. Zero items can be 'repaired' or even tested since the error blocks Troubleshooter opening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be grateful for someone/anyone leading me by the hand to do a fix. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All assistance for this old man is appreciated - even if some of the suggestions don't work!</p>

<h3> art0331  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have the blue screen of death in windows 7 pro</h2>
                    I have windows 7 pro on my brand new computer. This morning it has the blue screen of death on it. Yesterday I configured microsofts xp mode on my machine and it was running fine. I shut it down last night. Today I can not get windows 7 to come up. I have
 tried all the safe modes and I can get "safe mode with command line" to come up.&nbsp;I am thinking there was some auto update from microsoft put on last night.&nbsp; Is there a command line command I can run to get the system restore wizard up and running? I sure think
 this has something to do with the xp mode I put on. I am doing to take it off if I can get my pc running again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

    <title>Cryptographic Services failure after installing a new hybrid SSD &#43; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> monsieur-smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cryptographic Services failure after installing a new hybrid SSD &#43; HDD SATA drive</h2>
                    <p>In March, the hard drive of my Lenovo ThinkPad failed and I purchased a replacement drive, a Seagate Momentus XT 750 GB SSD + HHD solid state hybrid drive.&nbsp; I was able to use a backup image to recover my data and the performance was phenomenal.&nbsp; However,
 just recently, I began receiving popup messages saying that I was not running a genuine version of Windows 7 Professional after nearly two months.&nbsp; I checked the application log and I found that the following error start filling the logs immediately after
 installing the new hard drive:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The Cryptographic Services service failed to initialize the Catalog Database. The ESENT error was: -583.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted a system recovery and still this error appears.&nbsp; In desperation, I back leveled to the original shipped O/S of Windows XP and the issue went away but I do not want to run that version of Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the drive is moving files that is corrupting
 some index somewhere or something; I don't know.&nbsp; Exhaustive searches have provided no additional insight as to why these two, the new hard drive and Windows 7, are not playing well together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isssue has disabled my ability to use Windows Update and even when I attempt to use the tools provided by Microsoft the validation tool has a fatal error.&nbsp; I've run extensive surface testing on the drive itself, wiped every sector, cleared the boot
 record, etc.&nbsp; No matter what I do as soon as the factory recovery has completed the above error message begins filling the application log file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/05/12/customer-guidance-for-wannacrypt-attacks/</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In March, we released a security update which addresses the vulnerability that these attacks are exploiting. Those who have Windows Update enabled are protected against attacks on this vulnerability. For those organizations who have not yet applied the
 security update, we suggest you immediately deploy <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 confirm with their provider, that they are protected.</li><li>This attack type may evolve over time, so any additional defense-in-depth strategies will provide additional protections. (For example, to further protect against
<a href="https://aka.ms/disablesmb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">SMBv1 attacks</span></a>, customers should consider blocking legacy protocols on their networks).
<p>We also know that some of our customers are running versions of Windows that no longer receive mainstream support. That means those customers will not have received the above mentioned Security Update released in March. Given the potential impact to customers
 and their businesses, we made the decision to make the Security Update for platforms in custom support only, Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003, broadly available for download (see links below).</p>
<p>Customers who are running supported versions of the operating system (Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016) will have received the
 security update MS17-010 in March. If customers have automatic updates enabled or have installed the update, they are protected. For other customers, we encourage them to install the update as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This decision was made based on an assessment of this situation, with the principle of protecting our customer ecosystem overall, firmly in mind.</p>
<p>Some of the observed attacks use common phishing tactics including malicious attachments. Customers should use vigilance when opening documents from untrusted or unknown sources. For Office 365 customers we are continually monitoring and updating to protect
 against these kinds of threats including Ransom:Win32/WannaCrypt. More information on the malware itself is available from the Microsoft Malware Protection Center on the&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2017/05/12/wannacrypt-ransomware-worm-targets-out-of-date-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows
 Security blog</span></a>.&nbsp;For those new to the Microsoft Malware Protection Center, this is a technical discussion focused on providing the IT Security Professional with information to help further protect systems.</p>
<p>We are working with customers to provide additional assistance as this situation evolves, and will update this blog with details as appropriate.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's get this sorted out. To start, let's uninstall the keyboard driver and then reinstall it. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the <strong>Search </strong>box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Double-click <strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>&nbsp;Right-click the name of your keyboard. Normally, you will see the brand as the name.</li><li>&nbsp;Select <strong>Uninstall </strong>and restart your computer.<br />
</li><li>&nbsp;Let Windows reinstall the keyboard driver. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Share with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you try to Adobe Photoshop software, you receive script errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To assist you better, we need more information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How
<b>exactly</b> are you trying to install the software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some third party software may cause the issue. You could try to install the software in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Clean boot:</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption
 from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site mentioned:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows
 8</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
</span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration
 Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists or if you face any Windows issues in future, let us know and we would be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            I wrote the incorrect instructions:
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Command Prompt
<br />
<br />	At the command prompt, type:
<br />	net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />	Hit Enter
<br />
<br />	Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account. 
<br />
<br />If this does not work, I recommend you perform install.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<h2>            Gauntlet and other classic games missing</h2>
                    
<p>Gauntlet was a launch 360 live arcade title, and one of the most fun games to play!&nbsp; Why was it removed years ago?</p>
<p>If it really was to save space, how can this be?&nbsp; The game is only a few MB, and with the cloud now, what sense does this make?</p>
<p>Please reinstate these old games and bring more to the arcade, the 360 live arcade is a perfect place for a new generation to relive these smash hit games!</p>
<p>Tim</p>
