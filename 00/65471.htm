            Hey <strong>Blue122, <br />
</strong><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
<br />
I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue so we can better assist not only you but other users with similar problems as well.&nbsp;
<p><span>1. What version of Operating system are you running (Windows Vista or XP)?<br />
<br />
2. What Hardware are you trying to install in order to use TI-84[</span><span>Texas Instrument]?<br />
<br />
3. Is the Hardware device getting recognized in Device Manager?<br />
<br />
</span><span>Refer the link below in order to get into Device Manager:
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Computer won&#39;t start after Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3124200&#41;</h2>
                    <p>If I install this update the computer won't start. &nbsp;System Restore works after a fashion so I've been able to get the system going again. &nbsp;I'm trying to disable updates while I work on an answer, any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the old settings are still there in Group Policy (https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/328010) so I can at least stop it installing updates without asking me, however I do miss being able to choose not to install a particular update.</p>

            <p>As you can imagine, I was getting frustrated. &nbsp;I tried several times. &nbsp;Each time I let it install the update the computer wouldn't restart. &nbsp;It would go to the BIOS screen it gives me when it can't find anything to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair achieves nothing. &nbsp;The PC Reset option I've tried before, it was a disaster. &nbsp;I could do a System Restore which failed with an error 0x80070002, however a couple more reboots would get me a system which started up and said it had been "restored
 to an earlier state". &nbsp;It doesn't seem to be possible to really stop updates any more so I buckled down to trying to sort it out. &nbsp;One post mentioned disabling Fast Startup, that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was considering clearing the update cache but thought I'd just try once more...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After another round of it installing the update and the computer not restarting, I was looking at the options from the repair menu of the install disc, one of which was to "exit and continue to Windows 10" and wondered if it would work since I could boot
 from the DVD. &nbsp;It did and finished installing the update. &nbsp;Finally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't restarted the computer again since, I'm bored with fixing it now and want to have some fun. &nbsp;I'm sure there's an important lesson in here somewhere when I have the inclination to figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't trust my computer at the moment. &nbsp;It may or may not start next time I turn it on. &nbsp;I never felt that way before Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do
 so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download the upgrade files and create an installation media.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />

            <p>It might help you to know I am in IT support and an MCSE. &nbsp;I don't need you to tell me to do the obvious. &nbsp;What I do need is for Microsoft to not create an unstable marketing based OS and foist it on people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one machine I can't rely on to start after an update. &nbsp;I have another machine which keeps deciding to turn itself on at night to install updates. &nbsp;They belong to me, not Microsoft. &nbsp;I should be able to decide how they work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 had got to the point of being a reliable and flexible system to run a PC. &nbsp;Windows 10 is unhelpful and unstable, it really does seem flaky to me. &nbsp;My plan at the moment is to put Linux on one machine and go back to Windows 7 on the other since
 MS seem unable to provide a useful OS yet. &nbsp;Perhaps eventually they'll sort Windows 10 out but for now I simply can't rely on it.</p>

<p>I too suffered the effects of the most recent update to windows 10 on the eighteenth of December 2015 and it shut my computer down, It took an hour and a half on the phone with microsoft help desk to get it back. I have talked with other people who have
 had these kinds of problems with Windows 10 and they wound up going back to Windows 7 or going with a Mac computer. Unless Microsoft gets it straightened out real quick they are going to be losing a lot of users including me.</p>

            <p>Since I am persistent with these things, as you must be if you're going to do this, I eventually got a workaround - I've disabled Fast Startup in my BIOS and removed all boot options except the system RAID. &nbsp;Now it starts without the install CD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was nearly enough to make me wipe it and put Windows 7 back on, Windows 10 is like running Beta software at times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarity: Although it used to be OK, I can now only get going with the BIOS Fast Boot disabled, CMS set to Legacy Only and all other boot options but the Windows RAID volume disabled.</p>

            It appears that KB3124200 is seriously flawed for a large number of Windows 10 users with no known fix and even a hint that it will not be fixed until the next cumulative update.&nbsp; There is a Microsoft app titled wushowhide.diagcab that when executed allows
 one to hide KB3124200 such that it will no longer attempt to execute this specific update.&nbsp; Microsoft Article ID: 3073930 "How to temporarily prevent a Windows update from reinstalling in Windows 10"&nbsp;gives some insight into use of the WUSHOWHIDE troubleshooter.&nbsp;
 The key is to hide the KB which will be&nbsp;identified when WUSHOWHIDE is executed.

            I had the same issue as everyone above and had to use an Acronis image of my system partition to get up and running. The worst part is, it happened again yesterday with the cumulative update released this week. It happened on two HP Desktops (one running
 W10 Pro and one running W10 Home), but my W10 laptop seems not to be effected. Regardless, this is absolute nonsense. And not being able to select which updates to install is moronic.

<h2>            Did Not Setup A Password Yet Asking Me For One&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I decided to sign into my Microsoft account on my windows 10 PC. All I did was sign in when it asked me to set up a PIN password, I said no and that was the end of it. I did not want a password on my computer! When I went to start up my computer again, it
 asked me for a password. So I put in my Microsoft&nbsp;password, nothing... Then I changed my Microsoft&nbsp;password and tried again, nothing. I tried typing in nothing, nothing... My PC was connected to the internet so I have no clue why it is doing this to me, I
 have stuff on there I would like to keep but not desperately. I can just wipe my computer and reinstall windows but I don't want to do that if there is another solution.</p>

    <title>Cannot change default format quality for my headsets - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot change default format quality for my headsets</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Plantronics Audio .478. The specs of it say I can do 24-bit 48hz quality, however, Windows sets it to 16-bit 44.1hz quality and I am unable to change it. It is greyed out for me. Is there anyway to change this at all? I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Updating sound, headset and Windows drivers.</p>
<p>- Running troubleshoot.</p>
<p>- Running the "configure headset" thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None have worked so far. I am on a Windows 10 pro 64-bit and a Asrock AB350 Pro 4 motherboard using the built in sound card on it. This issue has been a issue for a long time now and I have not been able to solve it. I have done some research with a few
 people with same issue, but never have been able to find a solution. Does anyone know how to solve this?</p>

<p>After making this post, Plantronics staff got back to me on the support ticket I made. Apparently, they plugged the same headsets in and have the same issue. I guess this is a problem with this specific headsets and not Windows. They offered to ship me a
 different pair of headsets that doesn't have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways thanks for your help. You can close this as solved.</p>

<p>I have found a workaround if i push the cable into the mic it works until it falls out so i have to use paper to make it tight. If i try using earphones with built in mic they do not work with both controllers?

    <title>What program installs mss32.dll to system32 on Windows 7 x64&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas lemarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            What program installs mss32.dll to system32 on Windows 7 x64&#63;</h2>
                    I'm having some issues with Microsoft installer system, and it's giving me all sorts of error, but only when I try to install one specific program. I've came to the conclusion that it's a missing ms32.dll (which I renamed to install another program ironically)
 and I must have accidentally deleted my .bak files and cleared the ms32.dll. Mss32.dll version 7 and below don't work. The x64 versions from syswow64 don't work (of course) either.<br />
<br />
What program installs it into that directory? I'm assuming some .Net, but I don't know.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium and Patch KB3004394</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I really would appreciate some help.&nbsp; I am getting the same errors as many others on this site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I began receiving a "Not running Genuine Microsoft." about 30 days ago.&nbsp; This is not my primary system so I don't use it all the time and it may sit idle for several weeks at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>History</p>
<p>The system is a Dell Inspiron low end laptop bought in August 2014 </p>
<p>Came preinstalled with Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; 64Bit Intel CPU / 4GB of RAM</p>
<p>I activated it.</p>
<p>I activated Office 365.</p>
<p>Activated McAfee</p>
<p>Added the paid version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes</p>
<p>Added the paid version of&nbsp;Spybot S&amp;D</p>
<p>All Settings were on Automatic for updates.</p>
<p>I have approximately 100 hours use time on this laptop since August.&nbsp; I use a business laptop most of the time so my personal systems sit unused..</p>
<p>No - zero - issues until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began receiving the pop-up that the copy of Windows was not genuine in mid-February.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using CLI SLUI, the Windows activation key shows good and shows Windows is permanently activated.</p>
<p>Using CLI SLUI, the Office activation key shows good and shows Office is activated.</p>
<p>Both the Windows GUI and the Office tabs show both products activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching this issue for several hours,&nbsp;I identified&nbsp;the&nbsp;KB3004394 as the likely problem.</p>
<p>Patch KB3004394 was installed automatically in mid-February (2/15/2015), coinciding with the beginning of this problem.</p>
<p>I removed the patch</p>
<p>Rebooted twice. No effect.</p>
<p>I continued researching this and found KB3024777.</p>
<p>I installed KB3024777 which removed KB3004394.</p>
<p>Rebooted twice. </p>
<p>Windows update reinstalled KB3004394 </p>
<p>I disabled the automatic update feature which was still trying to download the patch.&nbsp; Its apparently is still available for download.</p>
<p>I re-installed KB3024777 which removed KB3004394.</p>
<p>Rebooted twice. No effect.&nbsp; Still getting the pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dell has hidden all of the GUI driven activation interfaces so all the re-activation or add-a new key features are not visible.&nbsp; So I went to the CLI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried SLUI -3 and -4, no reactivation window or reactivation pop-up appears.</p>
<p>I tired manually re-entering the key from the CLI.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>I tried the manual upgrade approach, key was wrong for an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran McAfee, Spybot, MalwareBytes - No malware or issues found.</p>
<p>Ran Regedit to check for the keys - all were present (articles indicate that they may have been deleted as a source of the problem).</p>
<p>Checked and confirmed that the WAT director in System32 was present (though I am beginning to consider editing those files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 6 other Windows products running at my house. 2 Window 7 Professional laptop (both 64bit), 2 Windows Home Premium&nbsp;(both 64bit), , 1 Windows 8.1 &nbsp;(64bit), and 1 Windows Server.&nbsp; I have similar application installs on each.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also removing those
 patch installs as well but I am concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are registry key settings that need to change or some file setting that needs modifying, what ever, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>Ed</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image can not be on the physical drive as Windows... Even a different partition...</p>
<p>This is because in the process of Restoring the image, the entire drive... your entire SSD...&nbsp; will be overwritten...</p>
<p>

            Hi  MedAKZAZ
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, thats not how system imaging works, you need to keep the system image on an external drive in order to restore it. It seems the system image restoration wizard is confused by the partition layout. 
<br />
<br />Thankfully, you should be able to boot to the desktop, connect an external drive if you got one browse the partition and move the system image folder to the external drive. 
<br />
<br />Once you do that, it should be detected, then you can restore it.

<h2>            How do I get my Microsoft sidewinder 3D pro joystick to work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an older microsoft sidewinder 3D pro joystick Model 63545. It has a male<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">serial port connector.
</span>&nbsp;Microsoft claims this will work on windows -7 both 64 and 32 bit.</p>
<p>My newer HP computer running&nbsp;Windows 7 -&nbsp;64 bit does not have a serial port! It does have several USB ports.</p>
<p>I can purchase an adaptor on Ebay that will convert the joystick from Serial to USB....BUT the seller claims the adaptor will not work on Windows-7 64 bit.....only 32 bit!</p>
<p>This is JUST a plug adaptor, why should it make a differnce if I'm running 64 or 32 bit???</p>
<p>The adaptor is $ 6 bucks, should I buy it anyway?</p>
<p>-Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Taka K,</p>
<p>First of all, please check if USB hub of the computer has been set for power save.<br />
If yes, please turn it off.<br />
If the issue persists after power save is turned off, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Is there any other application which need to use audio device encountering the same issue?<br />
2. Does the issue occur if you unplug all USB devices?<br />
3. Does the issue occur if you plug in a microphone?<br />
4. Have you tried to reinstall Skype for Business?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

<p>Hi Franky,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply! How can I check if USB hub of the computer has been set for power save?</p>
<p>1. I don't use any other application using audio device in my daily work.</p>
<p>2&amp;3. regardless of pluging in/unpluging USB devices/microphone, I see same message.
</p>
<p>3. Can I individually unistall Skype for Business? If yes, how can I do it? I install Office 365 and Skype for Business was in it. I didn't install Skype for Business separately. Is there any way not to uninstall/reinstall whole Office 365?
</p>

<p>hi taka k,</p>
<p>thanks for you updates.</p>
<p>please refer to the following steps to check if the use hub of the computer has been set for power save:<br />
1. open <strong>control panel</strong>&gt; <strong>device manager</strong>.<br />
2. under <strong>universal serial bus controllers</strong>, make sure <strong>allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> of every usb hub is
<strong>unchecked</strong>.</p>

<br />
meantime, if the issue persists, i’d like to further narrow down the issue with the following details:<br />
1. if possible, could you find another audio device which works fine on another desktop and test if it will work on your own one? this helps to figure out if your audio device is working fine.<br />
2. also, please test if your account can detect the audio device if you configure your account on your colleague’s computer with an audio device connected. this helps to identify whether your account is ok.<br />
3. make sure the audio device driver is the latest and check if there is any improvement.<br />
4. as it’s not feasible to individually uninstall and reinstall the skype for business application alone, you may try to uninstall/reinstall the whole office suite to check if it is actually related to the client itself. i understand it may take a long time,
 so you can do it when your pc is idle.</p>
<p>with the information collected, we are glad to do further research for you.</p>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>Thanks for your advise.</p>
<p>I turned off USB hub and switch on/off the audio device. Then Skype for business detect the audio device.</p>
<p>However once I shut down PC and next day when I open again, I saw no detection of audio devise message.</p>
<p>After switch on/off the audio device, it recovers again.</p>

<p>Hi Taka K,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Glad to hear that we’ve moved forward that Skype for Business can detect the audio device now. But as the issue persists when you restart your computer, could you please perform more tests as I mentioned above to check where the issue eventually lies in?<br />
1. Audio device: use another audio device on your own PC and check if it can be detected.<br />
2. Computer settings: set up your account on another PC with the same audio device connected and test if Skype for Business works fine.<br />
3. Driver: update the audio device driver to the latest and check the issue.<br />
4. Application: uninstall/reinstall the Office suite and check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued time and efforts on this issue.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>It seems the detection problem is solved. Now I can see the audio device detected when I open the audio setting of Skype for business.
</p>
<p>However I don't have the success to communicate with others through Skype for business.</p>
<p>I could chat and share the file through Skype for Business, but couldn't hear other's voice and other couldn't hear my voice.</p>
<p>It seems it's my PC problem. I checked microphone setting of my PC and found the error message it doesn't recognize the microphone. I tried with different headphone, but same result.</p>
<p>Audio device is Conexant 20584 Smart Audio HD. </p>
<p>When I check the setting of Conexant 20584 Smart Audio HD itself, I see the volume bar move when I talk.</p>
<p>But when I check in microphone setting of PC, the volume bar move is very subtle.</p>
<p>I installed different audio device: Realtek to try. But after the installation, I found "code 10: Device doesn't start" message.</p>
<p>It didn't work.</p>
<p>I can hear the sound from audio file.</p>

<p>Hi Taka K,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates and sorry for the delayed response.<br />
<br />
Glad to hear the detection problem is resolved. As to the issue that you still cannot hear others or let others hear from you, I think the issue might still be related to the compatibility between the headphone and the computer although you’ve tried another
 headphone and the issue persists. Therefore, would you mind setting up your account on another desktop with a headphone connected and check if Skype for Business will work fine?</p>
<p>Also, as we’ve always been talking about headphones connected by USB hubs, I’d like to confirm if the issue persists if you use another headphone which is connected via the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Sam</p>

<h2>            Windows Surface Pro 4 - Tablet physically coming apart - tablet separating from the backing - but still works for now</h2>
                    <p>My windows surface pro 4 is 3-4 years old.&nbsp; I do not have any problems with the tablet except the tablet glue has come apart and the screen is separating from the back.&nbsp; I have a keyboard and I&nbsp;always use the tablet in the "upright position."&nbsp; So I am not
 sure what the fix is.&nbsp; The gap is now more than 1/4 inch on one side.&nbsp; Sooner or later I expect performance will suffer.&nbsp; I would love to re-glue the tablet but have no idea what&nbsp;glue to use. The separation started about 4 months ago.&nbsp; Only use the table at
 home, nothing unusual about my use.&nbsp; Normal conditions in the home temperature and humidity. However, the tablet will be on for 6 continuous hours at night and on the weekends.&nbsp; I fold the tablet flat during the day when not in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for a fix or are others having this problem?&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hello CSmoot.
<br />
<br />Forum can help with technical issues, but not hardware :)
<br />
<br />Because you use your devices 3-4 year, the warranty is no longer available. 
<br />
<br />For this better to get correct suggest in service center or use their support.

<p>No, the online pass codes are only for the specific game. If you purchased used, then it is always a chance the code would be missing or used. You can buy a pass through Live for $10 for the game, though I would check the forums of the game (specifically
 on the publisher/developer web site, not Xbox.com) for more details about whether the online portion still has an active community to see if it is worth investing in the older pass or just getting the new version of the game.</p>

<h2>            Cannot process payment with Paypal on Windows Store&#47;Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to purchase a game, using my paypal account, and I'm receiving the message that my payment cannot be processed, I'm located in Argentina but I have a paypal account that I've been able to use without issue with steam, origin and even uplay, but
 I can't use it with Windows Store, first of all, in order to use it I have to change my location to US, then when I choose to use the payment that I have configured I get this message:</p>
<p>

</p><p>I've bought using the same method before without issues, has there been an update to the store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it work for you now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Today in Windows Store I get the message: We can't process your payment.<br />
There were no issues in the past.&nbsp;<br />
I bought 2 games a few months ago in the same Windows Store.<br />
And I just tried a payment with Paypal in Steam and had no issue.<br />
</p>
<p>The exact message is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contact Microsoft support.</p>
<p>We can't process your payment.</p>
