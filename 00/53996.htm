<h2>            Typing Vietnamese in Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone have an idea of how to type Vietnamese in Surface Pro 4 either using Telex input method or VNI method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a way to set it up. The way Microsoft is using is so confusing. Is Windows 10 Pro in Surface the same as PC? If it is yes, how come I cannot type Vietnamese the way I type in PC</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try everything. On PC, I just download the tool called Unlikely and it allows me to write Vietnamese in either Telex or VNI input perfectly. But it does not work on Surface Pro 4. I even try to download the language pack from Microsoft, but none of
 them is working. I thought the architecture may be different from&nbsp;PC. </p>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you figure it out yet, but I still want to give you my answer.&nbsp;I had the same problem as you just now, and so I downloaded the program called Unikey, I think you know it. At first I thought it didn't work, but it turned out that I didn't
 turn the Vietnamese mode on, and after I turned it on it worked just fine. So if you're still struggling with typing Vietnamese, you can try download Unikey, and make sure to turn on the Vietnamese mode. I have attached a picture here in case you don't know
 where to turn the mode on. Hope this helps. :)</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<h2>            Upgrade from 8.1 to 10 Home - failed with video_memory_management_internal BSOD on Acer 7600u all in one</h2>
                    <p>I tried upgrading my Acer 7600u All in one PC several times now. The full update process seems to work, but upon reboot I get a BSOD with the VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL message. I strongly believe this has to do with the fact that the PC has dual video
 cards. An Intel HD Graphics 4000 and NVidia GeForce GT 640M and/or that Windows 10 comes with bad drivers for either one of these (likely NVidia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reboot I get a message saying "Windows 10 cannot be installed" with errorcodes 0xc1900101 - 0x40017 with a reference to SECOND_BOOT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bios doesn't allow to disable the graphic card switching nor does it offer the option to set a primary card (these options are grayed out in the BIOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried setting the SAFE MODE boot options (F8) with a recovery USB stick. This works, SAFE MODE boots, but then still the machine is reverted back to 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried disabling the NVidia card in Windows 8.1 Device Manager and then doing the upgrade. To no avail, same story.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am stuck. Cannot upgrade and reinstall of Windows 10 is also not an option (want to retain my license activation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix? Eg. is there a way to change to boot to SAFE Mode after&nbsp;FIRST_BOOT or something like that?
</p>

</p>
<p>Through other support channels my problem is confirmed to be a known problem in Windows 10 combined with NVidia drivers. I will refrain from upgrading and wait for a resolution.</p>

            <p>I am having the exact problem with My ASUS all in one, which has a similar configuration (Intel HD Graphics 4000 and NVidia GeForce GT 640M). It was perfect in Windows 8/8.1. When I upgrade to Windows 10, I had the exact same error as you described.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several tries, I finally installed Windows 10 by wipe clean the hard drive with a fresh Windows 8 install and Windows 10 upgrade. The installation was able to go to completion, but after I log in, presumably after the NVidia driver is installed, it
 had BSOD with the VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL message. Then I reboot to safe mode with command prompt (regular safe mode is not enough), then type "explorer" to load the windows UI, then I go to device manager and disable the NVidia video card. After
 restart, everything is normal and I can enjoy Windows 10 now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install NVidia's newly released driver, it still crashed my computer with the same error. I just had to use the same method of disable the NVidia video card.

            Windows 10 drivers do not work for this computer, yet. Install Windows 8.1 Nvidia 350.12 drivers and you will be good to go, providing you also block auto updates of the Nvidia drivers in Windows 10.

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have given up now after multiple failed attempts and having my computer down for nearly 2 weeks. I have now decided to wait until NVidia updates their driver for Winodws 10 and try reinstall may be after 3-6 months.</p>
<p>For now I am happy with Win8. In fact my Win8 PC is now faster with a fresh installation and I am not as frustrated as I was earlier with it. During the short period of time that I had opportunity to play with Win10, I realised that is not as compelling
 to jump straight into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is just a word of caution for all others who come here with similar issues to have some patience until other companies catch up with their drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming from a Mac userbase where OS upgrades almost always goes fine without any issues, I didn't realise that the Windows ecosystem is very different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately using 350.12 on my home pc didn't resolve the problem. Windows 10 just comes with the wrong drivers for this NVidia card, or download the wrong ones from Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just going to wait a few more weeks... </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW. to Prad77. The Windows ecosystem is much more complicated because it basically supports any videocard/audiocard/and whatever other devicetype and the goal for Microsoft is to support also some very old hardware. Macs typically only get support for a
 few years and Apple devices don't need to support many different hardware devices and combinations of hardware devices. That makes it much easier for them to do an update.

            Her is how 350.12 worked for me. First I installed Windows 10 and allowed it to install Windows 10 drivers. This resulted in bsod. I then booted into safe mode and disabled the NVIDIA 640m driver in Device Manager. I then rebooted in Windows 10 and it
 was stable enough for me to install the Nvidia 350.12 drivers. Good to go. One more thing, however, you need to disable windows updates on this driver. I don't remember exactly but there is a Microsoft website where you can download a little program to do
 just that.

            There is no public information whether Microsoft plans to introduce such functionality with Cortana and Windows Hello. But taking into consideration all the major digital assistants are battling it out in the market, if Microsoft wants to remain relevant, it will likely have to introduce feature parity with other competitors. 
<br />
<br />They recently introduced their own smart speaker with a third party vendor called Harmon Kardon, which is similar to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. So, I wouldn't be surprised to see object recognition in Cortana's future, but the thing is, Microsoft has a limited play in mobile since they exited making their phone and mobile OS.

<h2>            Edit colors  of drawing in Microsoft Paint &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    I have a graph (provided by someone else) in which some of the lines are green and some are black. How can I edit it so that all the lines are black? - Paint's help function isn't helping me.

<p><span>Hi Derek,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the file format of the picture that you’re trying to edit in Paint?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Paint doesn't work with all types of picture files. For example, you can't open a picture in RAW format using Paint. For file types that Paint
 doesn't support, you'll need to use a photo editing program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, you can use the Line Tool in Paint in order to get all the lines in black.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to use the Line tool in Microsoft Paint</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Use the<em>Line</em> tool to draw a straight line. When using this tool, you can choose the thickness of the line, as well as the appearance of
 it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the Home tab, in the Shapes group, click the Line tool.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Size, and then click a line size, which determines the thickness of the line.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Colors group, click Color 1, choose black color, and then drag the pointer to draw the line.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to rename&#47;delete folder in OneDrive that has name problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to rename&#47;delete folder in OneDrive that has name problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently allowed the Windows update to v1903 and all looked OK, except I know have a c:\users\xxxxx.000 directory (where xxxxx is the user name). Anyway, while trying to ensure everything was OK with OneDrive, somehow I managed to create a directory call
 "desktop " - with a space at the end - in the OneDrive folder list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I receive a OneDrive sync error saying that this folder contains characters not allowed. When I try to rename it, I receive a message in explorer saying that the item doesn't exist. Similar message if I try through a command line. Note that the folder
 hasn't sync'd so it is on my laptop only.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f42f528-3ecc-4365-9db4-9567b666dc14?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f42f528-3ecc-4365-9db4-9567b666dc14?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions on how to remove the folder? Short of rebuilding the PC!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Shakey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />OneDrive introduced some features recently that were set as default for some users without their knowledge, so be aware and adjust as necessary
<br /> 
<br />If the new Folder Protection is chosen in OneDrive Settings &gt; AutoSave Tab, then Documents, Desktop and/or Pictures folders will be moved into the OneDrive folder. See Folder Protection details here to change this or read more:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Another setting designed for smaller hard drives removes files from the hard drive and stores them only in the cloud if Files On Demand is chosen in OneDrive Settings.  This feature is described here:
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks Greg.</p>
<p>This is not to do with folder protection, as it is off. It was on once before, but not now since the update as it broke the profile location as I mentioned. The issue is that I cannot rename/delete the folder in explorer or a command line.</p>

            I understand.  Do you have files unhidden in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; enable Show Hidden Files and uncheck Hide Protected Operating System Files, approve security box, Apply, Save.   
<br />
<br />That may be an desktop.ini file used only to hold file display information for the folder.  
<br />
<br />If it's not present when you try to delete it, that could explain why.  Can you delete it online in OneDrive?  How about from Command Prompt using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> ?

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>I can create a new local folder in the OneDrive path but it doesn't appear to sync up - weird. I can delete the newly created folder fine though.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the folder I'm trying to delete ("desktop "), just an empty folder tree. I can't delete it or any of the underlying folders.</p>

                    <p>Olá jovens,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depois de cinco anos quase desejando um Xbox e Kinect enfim ontem realizei o sonho de comprar um Kinect, porém o mesmo não veio com o adaptador para o Xbox One S.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ontem esse adaptador na Amazon The perseids Kinect Adapter for Xbox, Windows PC Adapter Power Supply for xbox One S X kinect 2.0 Sensor, Windows Interactive APP Program Development&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CWQK6XG/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CWQK6XG/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Há pergunta é, vai dar tudo certo e vou poder utilizar meu Kinect no meu Xbox One S?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Quais os games vocês recomendam?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft continua produzindo games para o Kinect ou o Projeto foi descontinuado?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Não tenho vidos muitos lançamentos de Kinect e meu medo é que ele fique inutilizado.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obrigado e bom dia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<strong><em>Translation</em></strong>]</p>
<p>Hello young people,</p>
<p>After five years almost wishing for an Xbox and Kinect at last yesterday I realized the dream of buying a Kinect, but the same did not come with the adapter for the Xbox One S.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yesterday this adapter on Amazon the Perseids Kinect adapter for Xbox, Windows PC adapter Power Supply for Xbox One S X Kinect 2.0 Sensor, Windows Interactive APP Program Development
<a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CWQK6XG/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07CWQK6XG/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>
<p>There's a question, is everything going to be all right and I can use my Kinect on my Xbox One S?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;What games do you recommend?</p>
<p>Does Microsoft continue to produce games for Kinect or has the project been discontinued?</p>
<p>I have not experienced many Kinect releases and my fear is that it becomes unusable.</p>
<p>Thank you and Good morning.</p>

<span>Quanto ao link da Amazon que você forneceu, não podemos recomendar dispositivos de terceiros, pois não temos como saber se funcionará ou não.</span>

You can try it but please note that it will be at your own risk if it does not work.</span></span></p>

<p>I wouldn't really recommend 3rd party adaptors. You can't really put all your trust in them and if they malfunction it could ruin your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Kinect itself, it has been discontinued as has the adaptor. They've stopped producing content for the device as a whole. It wasn't a bad peripheral. I only used it for exercise game though. There just wasn't much more than that that I was interested
 in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obrigado&nbsp;ChiefJoboo.<br />
<br />
Gostei do carinho em me responder em portugues, uma coisa que os demais embaixadores não se preucuparam.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apesar de ser fluente em inglês é importante ser respondido na linguagem na qual nos expressamos melhor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bom eu vi varias reviews sobre o produto e claro posso devolver e possui garantia que protege todo o Sistema. Fiz questão de comprar assim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meu objetivo é fazer exercicios com minha família logo acredito que vai servir para o proposito.</p>
<p>
</p><p>É uma pena o projeto ter sido descontinuado, por isso a difuculdade em encontrar o adptador.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Novamente, Obrigado pelo carinho.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Atenciosamente.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<strong><em>Translation</em></strong>]</p>
<p>Thank you Chiefjoboo.</p>
<p>I liked the affection to answer me in Portuguese, something that the other ambassadors do not care.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although fluent in English, it is important to be answered in the language in which we express ourselves better.</p>
<p>Good I saw several reviews on the product and of course I can return and has warranty that protects the entire system. I made a point of buying like this.</p>
<p>My goal is to do exercises with my family soon I believe it will serve for the purpose.</p>
<p>It's a pity the project has been discontinued, so the difficulty of finding the adapter.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for caring.</p>
<p>Best regards.<br />

<p>Olá Omega Chefe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Infelizmente o Kinect foi descontinuado, mas o console ainda suporta os games que foram lançados. Uma das poucas desenvolvedoras que mais lançou e ainda lança coisas pro Kinect foi a Ubisoft, como a franquia Just Dance e até mesmo Shape Up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>O meu Xbox one ainda é da primeira edição, e o Kinect é mais um item de decoração do que um acessório funcional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realmente não sei te dizer se seu Kinect ficará inutilizado pois isso dependerá do seu gosto pessoal para os jogos disponíveis. Just Dance faz o maior sucesso nas festas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boa sorte com seu Kinect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[<strong><em>Translation</em></strong>]</p>
<p>Hello Omega chief,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Kinect has been discontinued, but the console still supports the games that were released. One of the few developers who launched the most and still launches things for Kinect was Ubisoft, like the Just Dance franchise and even Shape up.</p>
<p>My Xbox one is still the first edition, and Kinect is more of a decorating item than a functional accessory.</p>
<p>I really can't tell you if your Kinect will be unusable because it depends on your personal taste for the games available. Just Dance makes the biggest success in the parties.</p>
<p>Good luck with your Kinect.<br />

</p><p><span><span>Sim, na verdade esse é o oficial da Microsoft e posso recomendar esse.</span>
<span>Por favor, note que será caro em comparação com os terceiros, porque eles não os fazem mais.</span>
<span>Se você não receber a marca Microsoft / Xbox, devolva-a, pois a Amazon reembolsará uma compra assim, se não for o produto anunciado.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>------------------</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, actually that is the official one from Microsoft and I can recommend that one. Please note that it will be expensive compared to the 3rd party ones because they don't make them anymore. If
 you do not receive the one that is Microsoft/Xbox branded please return it as Amazon will refund a purchase like this if it's not the product advertised.</span></span></p>

<p>That link did nothing for me. &nbsp;First, it's a sound issue, not a microphone issue. &nbsp;The sound from games, videos, even windows itself is only coming from the right side. &nbsp;Second, The same problem is happening with a USB headset as well as my normal headset
 that plugs into the motherboard through the 3.5mm sound jack. &nbsp;Therefore that would lead me to believe it is not the jack itself nor the pair of headsets as each are quite new and not abused in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: &nbsp;Tried boosting the mic anyways and as suspected it did not affect anything. &nbsp;Also tried using the built-in troubleshooting for sound within windows.</p>
<p>Edit 2: &nbsp;This all started suddenly. &nbsp;I had not installed software or hardware anytime close to this happening. &nbsp;I shut it down like normal one night with it working normally, using the start menu, and turned it on the next morning and here we are.</p>

            Hi Ken.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'll need to restore the files from backup.  But first Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you'll know the exact condition of the drive with certainty.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Christopher, yes that can and does happen . . .
<br />
<br />A power cut can fry your Operating system and it can sometimes fry your hard drive or other system components.
<br />
<br />That is why a lot of users and especially companies and organisations use a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), which is basically a battery pack that will kick in immediately a power supply is detected . . .
<br />
<br />Are you experiencing problems since a power cut?

            Hey Christopher,
<br />
<br />The short answer is, it is possible in varying circumstances.
<br />
<br />The long answer:
<br />
<br />While anything is possible, the most common damage that occurs from an unexpected power loss to a computer is data corruption. Checking for hardware damage can be difficult and it may not be conclusive (intermittent) or even show up for some time. But usually, if there’s no immediate problems, then you can assume that it’s okay physically, especially if the sudden shut down was merely due to a power loss as opposed to a power spike. You should however make sure that your files are okay. You can replace hardware and reinstall Windows, but the files you create are irreplaceable, so if there is corruption, the faster you detect it, the better the chances of recovery (especially if you keep backups).
<br />
<br />Technical
<br />When a complex OS like Windows is running, there are all kinds of open files. To increase performance, the OS does not always write everything to the disk the moment the write command is issued and buffers them so that they can be written in batches. This makes the system more responsive by cutting down on disk accesses.
<br />
<br />Because of the fact that files are left open and writes are buffered, if the system loses power unexpectedly, there may have been data that was still in memory and not yet written to the disk, and therefore you could lose some data. For example, you may have had a file open in an editor, and even if you did clicks save, it may not have been written to the disk yet and been in cache, so when you power back up, you find that the changes are gone (or the whole file is empty/corrupt if you had never saved yet).
<br />
<br />Worse, because of how file-systems work and how OSes manage files, sometimes things can get corrupted. The OS may have been in the middle of a file-system operation like moving a file, deleting a file, or updating the file-system when the power went out. In this case, the file-system can be in an indeterminate state and files could have been messed up and making new changes to the disk (like simply booting up), could end up corrupting files or causing them to be lost altogether.
<br />
<br />Auto-Repair
<br />Your best bet to check for damage after an unexpected power loss is to scan the file-system for corruption. What normally happens is that Windows writes a flag to the disk to let it know that the file-system is active, and clears the flag when it is not (e.g., when it shuts down). If the power suddenly goes out, the next time that Windows boots, it detects that the flag is set and thus the file-system may be corrupt. In that case, it automatically runs a scan of the disk during its pre-boot phase (before Windows actually loads, and therefore no other file activity takes place that could corrupt the disk).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, Windows’ automatic scan does not always trigger, so whenever you have an unexpected shut down like that, it’s always a good idea to boot up in safe-mode first (so that no programs or anything run and make changes to the disk), and run a scan yourself.
<br />
<br />Advice
<br />You can scan your disk by right-clicking the drive in My Computer, selecting Properties, then clicking the Check Now button in the Tools tab. You can also open a command-prompt (Run ⇨ cmd) and run the chkdsk command to see the technical details of the scan
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! If not, let me know and I'll be glad to help.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Carson

            <p>Go to Power Options - SYstem settings (Define power buttons and turn on password protection)<br />
<br />
just turn OFF option "Turn on fast startup (recommended)" and shut down will be available but it takes time.<br />
Also startup is not so fast, but... shutdown works :)</p>

<h2>            Windows update seems to have broken a stable internet connection - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if it might be coincidence that my WiFi's playing up or something at the same time. But ever since a recent Windows update my connection to the internet has been awful and in some cases non existent.</p>
<p>I'll try playing any game and it will constantly sit at about 300-600 ping when I used to sit at 30-50 easy. In fact the absolute best I've gotten is still 250. Calling on discord is constantly interrupted by poor connection. And sometimes the connection
 drops entirely and I simply can't connect to any site at all. YouTube when it's working seems to load and play videos fine, and every other device in the house doesn't seem to have a problem when I do. No one is using it for anything else either when I check.</p>
<p>Just tonight I was pushed to ask this because it got so bad that I would have a connection for literally just 10 seconds and it would black out again. I tried troubleshooting for problems, I tried restarting the computer, I tried uninstalling the recent
 updates from windows (that it would let me uninstall) and all of them only fixed it for 10 seconds. Eventually what gave me a connection but still a bad one was turning the router off and on again. But if no one else's devices are having problems, I wouldn't
 think it'd be the router that's the problem. But I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Another odd thing it seems to be doing is prioritizing a lesser grade connection over a better one. The computer has a built in WiFi receiver, but the computer's tucked away in the desk, so I hooked up TP-Link USB and installed that and hooked it up to an
 extension cable to give a better connection. And that's worked just fine up until now. But now the computer, no matter how many times I uncheck the 'connect automatically' box on the built in WiFi which has a far worse signal. It keeps checking it and automatically
 connects to it when I turn on the computer. And going into properties to change it doesn't seem to do anything either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just something odd to do with my WiFi? Or is this something that can actually be fixed.</p>
<p>Cause this is starting to become annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi 0_Exterminator_0,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />C. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi 0_Exterminator_0,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />I would suggest you to disable the built in wifi adapter, using only the USB one, in your situation. To do so:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Network card"
<br />4. Right click on your built in wifi adapter
<br />5. Click on "Disable device"
<br />6. Reboot

A major problem with those steps is. My windows key has never worked on this keyboard.</p>
<p>I did manage to find the troubleshooting thing you were talking about but whenever I run the troubleshoot it just says it couldn't identify the problem because the internet will be fine or cut out at random times. Other then that the computer just thinks
 it's fine when the ping is still through the roof.</p>
<p>None of the microsoft solutions in the link changed anything by the looks of things.
</p>
<p>And I'm not very confident in doing the reset repair in fear of losing something that may be a giant mess around to get back if it's lost. Because it does warn that some other windows things may be lost. (And if that involves microsoft word then it'll be
 a massive fuss to get that back)<br />

<p>There is no Network card option, and I do not know what the name of my built in adapter is because if you meant Network adapters there is probably about 10 options.</p>

            Repair upgrade doesn't make you lose anything. This is not a reinstall of Windows. This just repairs corrupt Windows files.

<p>After I took a bit of a guess at which adapter was the built it one, I disabled it and it actually fixed it. It seems to be just fine now, I don't know what about the update caused it to prioritize the bad port but it's working now. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Activate Windows 7 64-bit &#40;HELP&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit on my iMAC computer (using VMWare) and it works fine.&nbsp; My geek son said under that format Windows does not take advantage of all the true hardware features of my iMAC so he installed the Windows 7 Home
 Premium 64-bit&nbsp; on the SAME computer! (using the iMAC BOOT CAMP&nbsp;procedure).&nbsp; My Windows 7 Home Premium is a Full Install NOT an Upgrade and it came with the 32-bit and 64-bit CD.&nbsp; Now to my problem:&nbsp; When I bring up the Windows 7 64-bit and go to systems maint
 I see the message "2 days until Automatic Activation. Activate Windows now"&nbsp; when I click Activate Windows now and key in my valid Product Key I get the message "THE ACTIVATION SERVER DETERMINED THAT THE SPECIFIED PRODUCT KEY COULD NOT BE USED" I'm thinking
 mabe I should uninstall the Windows 7 32-bit so my question is how do I DEACTIVATE my Windows 7 32-bit so Windows wont think I have 2 Windows 7&nbsp;versions on the same computer?

            You may only have one copy installed, either 32 or 64-bit.<br />
<br />
Uninstall the 32-bit copy in the VM, then use telephone activation to activate the Bootcamp copy.<br />
<br />
Installations cannot be deactivated; if you transfer to new hardware you need to use telephone activation to override the previous activation.

<h2>            corrupted 34524.rbf</h2>
                    
<p>HI, I have tried to get an answer before, but nobode answered. Problem is, when I start or restart Windows 7, it appears window on the screen, with message "windows installer prepares to install" for short, and then disappears. In attempt to solve this problem,
 I have tried many things. For example, I also uninstall JavaSofware, because it cannot be installed because there is message that dowloaded file is corrupted ( C:\users\jelena\appdata\locallow\sun\java\jre1.6.0_21\jre1.6.0_21-c-l.msi).</p>
<p>I have found also that file 34524.rbf in config.msi cannot be opened, I tried to open it by windows choose the program, but there is information that Windows does not recognize this file tipe. I tried to open it by Adobe reader, but there is message that
 "it is not supported file type or the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasn`t correctly decoded).</p>
<p>If you be so kind to tell me, what is wrong, and how can I fix the problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<div>The RBF file type is primarily associated with 'Rollback' by Microsoft Corporation. The .RBF files and the config.msi folder are used by the Windows Installer rollback process. The .RBF files are stored in the Config.Msi folder located on the drive where
 the application that is being backed up currently resides.&nbsp;Files with a RBF file extension are backups of existing files.</div>
<div>The .RBF file&nbsp;and the Config.Msi folder are deleted when the installation completes successfully.</div>
<div>So since you are seeing .RBF files would mean that the backup didn't complete successfully.</div>
<div><br />
I would make a copy of the file and then delete it.</div>
<div>Are you getting any other Windows Installer error?</div>
<div>I would search for a 3rd party software&nbsp;uninstallation program and remove&nbsp;the Java install as it seems to be corrupted.</div>
<div>Please reply back and let us know if this helps.</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>
<p><br />

<h2>            NAS Storage</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way to use a NAS on my network as additional storage for my XBox? It would be nice to be able to install games to my NAS rather than having to fork out for an external HD now that ive filled the internal one by installing 10 games!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>SpikeyHairFool,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This will likely not be possible. The Xbox will want to format the drive so it's compatible and can install games. With a NAS I'm assuming you're hosting other files on it, so the answer would be no if that's the case. Also you would need to attach it via
 USB 3.0, which also likely isn't something your NAS can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whilst this isn't a feature currently, it might be a good idea to suggest it here:
<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xbox.uservoice.com/</a></p>
<p>The Xbox could search for NAS devices on the local network and, if found, connect to them. However, yes, you would need to solely use it for the Xbox.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions / replies guys.</p>
<p>It seems crazy that it won't allow it. I could partition an area of the NAS solely for XBox usage. The access speed would be faster than USB so that shouldn't be an issue.
</p>
<p>Is the XBox able to stream media from a NAS? Other than using Plex? </p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>SpikeyHairFool,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you have your NAS on a PC you can enable Steam to in Xbox Video, and then enable Media Sharing on your PC. This will allow you to stream using DLNA. I do not know of a way other than Plex to stream directly from the NAS to the Xbox. But on that note Plex
 is amazing if you haven't tried it :).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NAS is a pure NAS, it doesn't need a PC on to stream. It has DLNA turned on already as I use it to stream to my Apple TV and also for my Plex setup. I don't have the Plex pass and can't really afford the £100+ price for that at the moment so Plex on
 the XBox will have to wait for the moment till they release a separate client for it on Xbox.</p>

<p>Understand. Well if DLNA in your NAS works with Xbox Video should be fine.. If not you'll need to use the "play to" feature in Windows.
