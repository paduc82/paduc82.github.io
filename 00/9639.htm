    <title>Unwanted horizontal scrolling in Excel 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted horizontal scrolling in Excel 10</h2>
                    How do I get rid of unwanted scrolling in Excel 10? &nbsp;The slightest movement of the cursor takes me back to where I do not want to be. &nbsp;I have columns and headers locked and after I scroll to a particular column (say K3) to do some work, the thing whooshes
 off to shift the whole view back to column B3. &nbsp;After scrolling to column K, &nbsp;I find I have to move the cursor cell by cell, very slowly and VERY carefully, clicking on each cell as I go to get the cursor to col K to prevent the thing from whooshing back to
 col B. &nbsp;Surely this is not a 'feature'. &nbsp;I do not want any of these 'features'. &nbsp;Thank you anyone who can help.

            I have never seen that or even heard of it, but try changing your mouse settings to reduce its sensitivity, and make sure that you don't have scroll lock on.
<div><br />
<div>Also, check to make sure that you don't have a protected sheet, and check your setting for movement after entry. If you combine protection with Allow selection of unprotected cells with move to the right after entry, you could get that jump from K to B
 after entering something in K.</div>

<p>el loco, it is a Linux computer and if you want more people using it then it would be helpful if you could have a helpful attitude. Many people may want N900 because they may not want to be tied to Apple iTunes or tied to Google and they want open source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe because of N900 more people would be open to learning Linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one, I am open to learning Linux because of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea of open source is ability to do things without someone dictating what you can or cannot do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For it to succeed and for N900 to succeed, it would need to be accepted and desired by more people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found N900 to be frustrating to use, especially loading music from PC to N900...I have not been able to do it yet, And I am quite computer literate after using Macs for years and then moved to PC's...</p>

            By the way, the new OVIS SUITE is able to move music from PC to Nokia. Finally I was able to move it. Woopeee!!!! Music sounds great on the N900...it is a great phone/puter. The stereo speakers sound better than many laptops!!

<h2>            Access 2003&#58; I need a listbox to create multiple records</h2>
                    
<p>I have a DB that stores information about patients in a long-term hospital setting. They attend groups based on their treatment needs.</p>
<p>I have a form that uses a listbox that shows all patients in the selected area. Usually ~20 patients are listed per area.</p>
<p>I have multi-select set to extended. When I click a name, it adds the name and 4 patient identifiers to the record, as well as adding group information. Click the next name, it is added, etc.</p>
<p>Sometimes, all patients attend the group. I would like to be able to select 20 names, all all 20 people are added as individual records. I can't figure this out.<em>(I'm a self-taught imbecile)</em>.</p>
<p>When I click on a name in the listbox, the following code runs:</p>
<p>Private Sub cboNames_Click()<br />
Me.txtName = Me![cboNames].Column(0)<br />
Me.txtMR = Me![cboNames].Column(1)<br />
Me.txtUnit = Me![cboNames].Column(2)<br />
Me.TxtArea = Me![cboNames].Column(3)<br />
Me.TxtAdmitted = Me![cboNames].Column(4)<br />
Me.txtalert = Me![cboNames].Column(5)<br />
DoCmd.GoToRecord , , acNewRec<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what to add to make this work?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>If you want to add a bunch of names in batch, you need two things. Firstly, you need a button to 'select all', and secondly, you need code to add the records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But before we implement this, I recommend altering the way you do things. Right now, the instant you select something from the listbox, your code automatically adds a new record. That's problemmatic because it's possible, nay
 easy, to add an unwanted record by accidentally selecting the wrong listbox item. As far as selecting multiple items is concerned, what if you want to select all but one? In that case, the easiest way is to select all the listbox items, then deselect one of
 them. What I'm saying is that you need the flexibility to freely select items without fear of inadvertently creating records. Only when you're happy with your selection do you want to create records.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So...Add two buttons to the form (cmdSelectAll and cmdDeselectAll). Add the following code to the respective buttons.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Private Sub cmdSelectAll_Click()</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intIndex As Integer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Me.lstMyList.ListCount &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For intIndex = 1 To Me.lstMyList.ListCount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.lstMyList.Selected(intIndex) = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next intIndex<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</em></div>
<div><em>End Sub</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Private Sub cmdDeselectAll_Click()</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In Me.lstMyList.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.lstMyList.Selected(varItem) = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem</em></div>
<div><em>End Sub</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then add another button (cmdAddRecord), and the following code. WARNING: Untested.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>Private Sub cmdAddRecord_Click()</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In Me.lstMyList.ItemsSelected</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO myTable ([Name], MR, Unit, Area, Admitted, Alert) " &amp; _</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "VALUES (""" &amp; Me.lstMyList.Column(0, varItem) &amp; """, """ " &amp; _</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me.lstMyList.Column(1, varItem) &amp; """, """ " &amp; _</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me.lstMyList.Column(2, varItem) &amp; """, """ " &amp; _</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me.lstMyList.Column(3, varItem) &amp; """, """ " &amp; _</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Me.lstMyList.Column(4, varItem) &amp; """, """ " &amp; _</em></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBEngine(0)(0).Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError</em></div>
<div><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem</em></div>
<div><em>End Sub</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then get rid of your existing cboNames_Click() procedure.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can see that your form is bound to the same table to which your code is adding records. Unless there are other controls on this form (aside from the textboxes listed in your code), you can get rid of all of them, an it'd probably
 be OK to unbind the form.</div>

<div>I don't know. Have a look at your&nbsp;form's RecordSource&nbsp;property. myTable refers to the table in which Me.txtName (and the other form controls) are stored.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What the code does is add a record to the form's underlying table.</div>

                    Has Microsoft temporarily blocked downloads from myphone to windows6.x devices?&nbsp; I wiped the phone and cannot connect to windows live server from the myphone software that is preinstalled on my HTC Imagio with Verizon.&nbsp; (nor will the Marketplace connect,
 either)&nbsp; I know I'm using the correct uid/pwd, since I can sign into myphone.microsoft.com from the computer, but it's not a uid/pwd error msg.&nbsp; I also got a refurb, thinking something went haywire with the phone after the hard reset, and this device also
 will not connect to myphone software.&nbsp; Verizon tech support is thinking that you blocked the 6.x devices since the OS-7 was released.&nbsp; Please advise what is going on, and when it will be 'fixed' so that I can download my contacts again.

            So what is the problem?&nbsp; HTC confirmed they're getting calls with issues like mine where programs (such as MarketPlace and MyPhone) that use a live.com login aren't working.&nbsp; The&nbsp;tech I spoke to said she started getting calls last week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, it's
 specific to Verizon HTC's because Verizon has a setup with Microsoft to have the MyPhone app on the phone.&nbsp;

            There are lots of threads in this forum which have been posted by users who are having problems logging into the Marketplace and to a lesser extent the My Phone service.&nbsp; I tested this out on my windows mobile phone and can still log into both places (an
 HTC Touch Diamond 2), but late last week I escalated several threads and emailed Microsoft directly.&nbsp; I will followup with my contacts at email later this week to see what they can tell me.<br />

<br />It simply be that many web pages are not officially supporting Internet Explorer anymore. Internet Explorer 11 is hardly being maintain and is still around as a legacy web browser for Intranet websites and LOB apps that require ActiveX controls.

<br />You really should switch to a modern web browser such as Firefox (preferred) or Google Chrome.

            Hi Emery.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Internet Connection Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot, type in the URL you're using and it will find out why it won't connect.
<br />
<br />Try another browser.   I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Internet Explorer 8 is constantly flickering</h2>
                    We just upgraded (clean/fresh install) a client to Windows 7 (32-bit) and whenever they are using Internet Explorer 8 (32-bit) they all get the constant page flickering problem. Different monitors,&nbsp;different screen resolutions, all have the latest version
 of Flash Player installed.<br />
<br />
Any ideas why its flickering and how to resolve it?<br />
<br />

            I am not sure how to propose a solution but this is what I did to get the flickering on IE8 resolved.<br />
<br />
It happens on both of my laptops and on web-sites rendering Adobe Flash, also javascript mouse hover-over flickers such as pages running Dynamics CRM and Silverlight (i.e. Netflix). The problem is with the video drivers. Even updating the drivers from manufacturer
 website does not resolve the issue. What you need to do is get the driver from the graphic card site, such as ATI Technologies. Then do a clean uninstall of all display drivers first, reboot and re-install.<br />
<br />
OS: Win7 Ultimate 64-Bit &amp; Win7 Enterprise 64-bit<br />
Video: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3400 Series (Lenovo laptop) &amp; ATI Mobility Radeon HD 3670 (Dell Studio XPS 16)<br />
<br />
1) Go to your graphic card vendor download and save the driver. DO NOT INSTALL YET.<br />
2) Open Device Mgr and uninstall your display driver.<br />
3) Open Add/Remove programs and uninstall any display driver software, i.e. ATI Catalyst Control Center.<br />
4) At this point your screen is in low VGA mode.<br />
5) Reboot<br />
6) When Windows load it will try to install a VGA driver from WDM. Let it go.<br />
7) Install the driver you download from step 1.<br />
8) Reboot<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

    <title>Set Shared mailbox to default size limits. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmcnally- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set Shared mailbox to default size limits.</h2>
                    <p>I received a warning message for one of my shared mailboxes that it is near the size limit. Upon examination, the mailbox size limit in EAC shows as 9.75GB. Looking at the information published at https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/exchange-online-limits.aspx,
 I can see that the current limit for shared mailboxes should 50GB. A shared mailbox which I created several weeks ago does reflect this size limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that shared mailboxes which were created before the default size limit was raised to 50GB still have the old size limit and will need to be changed manually. Hoping for an easy way to do this, I tried "Set-Mailbox credit -UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults
 $true".</p>
<p>This gave me the completely nonsensical error message of "UseDatabaseQuotaDefaults can only be set to false in Datacenter". This is nonsense because the value is already set to false, and I am trying to set it to true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a method for setting the various storage limit values on older shared mailboxes to the correct current default values. How can I do this?</p>

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
To increase the size limit of the shared mailboxes which were created before the default size limit was raised to 50 GB, please refer to the following steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Run the command to get the size limit of all the current shared mailboxes in your Office 365 organization:<br />
<strong>Get-mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited -filter {RecipientTypeDetails -eq "SharedMailbox" -or RecipientTypeDetails -eq "RoomMailbox"} | Select DisplayName, Prohibit*Quota | ft</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try running the command below to increase the size limit of a single shared mailbox to 50 GB:<br />
<strong>Set-Mailbox *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -ProhibitSendQuota 49.5GB -ProhibitSendReceiveQuota 50GB -IssueWarningQuota 49GB</strong><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Replace the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with the email address of the shared mailbox which you want to increase the size limit for.<br />
<br />
If you still have the problem after running the above PowerShell command, please don’t hesitate to post back. I will help you further.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mouran<br />

            I don't think you can open embedded files from onenote. Instead of inserting the files, print the files to onenote to access them on devices.

<p>Hi EThompson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, your OneNote 2016 for Mac keeps syncing and never stops. We need to confirm some information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Does this problem only happen to one of the sections in one of your notebook?</p>
<p>2. Is there a&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f87d50bf-49f1-44fb-8807-657b8bd7f53a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f87d50bf-49f1-44fb-8807-657b8bd7f53a" /></a>
 next to the notebook? Could you please provide a screenshot of the problematic notebook so we can clarify your situation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can follow the steps below to check whether the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Create a new section in the same notebook </p>
<p>2. Copy (but don’t move) all of the pages from the old section into the new one you just created.</p>
<p>3. When all of the pages have been copied to the new section, click <strong>File &gt; Sync All Notebooks</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Check to see if the notes you copied also have trouble syncing or if it’s only the original section that’s still affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we suggest you update your Mac OS version to the latest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem is happening with all section of a single notebook. Other notebooks are not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sync never errors out, it also never completes. It looks like this:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I created a new section in this notebook, a both created a new page and copied a page from another section to it. I then selected sync all notebooks, and the notebook in question just sits at syncing. I checked the online version of the notebook and neither
 my new section nor either of the two pages has synced.</p>

<p>Hi EThompson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you mentioned that only this notebook has sync problem. If you create a new notebook then copy the problematic notebook to the new one, will it still has the problem?</p>

    <title>How do I type vertically with WordArt in Office 2010&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stounzen  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I type vertically with WordArt in Office 2010&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In Office 2007, I was able to use WordArt to type vertical text where the letters were still horizontal, like this:</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>e</p>
<p>r</p>
<p>t</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>c</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>l</p>
<p>But the spacing was obviously closer.&nbsp; In Office 2010, the only vertical options I can find require even the letters to be rotated, so that you have to tilt your head to read it.&nbsp; How can I achieve the above effect in the newer version of Office?</p>

            <p>To get the same effect, after inserting WordArt text do this: &nbsp;using one of the WordArt side sizing handles move the WordArt in horizontally until it fits just one
 letter, and then move the bottom middle sizing handle down vertically until you get the desired effect.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there an error message when the attempt to reset IE settings fails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these procedures:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Internet Options&gt; General tab&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete&gt; uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data" then delete Temporary Internet Files. No reason, yet, to delete cookies, history,&nbsp; passwords, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Run from [Windows logo key + r] then Enter. Type in iexplore.exe -extoff then hit Enter. This will open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode. If IE opens and stays open, browse for a while. If the problem is gone troubleshoot add-ons to find the
 troublesome one.</p>

</p><p>1. Do you have the problem on *all or *most webpages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No add-ons mode made no difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. With the warning that a reset will delete AutoComplete data, such as passwords (do you have those backed up?) and you will have to re-enable browser add-ons, use the Reset IE Settings button in Internet Options&gt; Advanced. What a reset of IE settings will

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7721875d-dccb-4bb1-b0f4-e4d70b9bf8cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7721875d-dccb-4bb1-b0f4-e4d70b9bf8cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have checked the permissions to the folder and no one else has permission to it. Is there a way to just get this file back without rolling Onedrive back to that day? Also find out who the "Someone" is.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the following thread:</p>

 ? - sharepoint online new look </a></p>
<p>Since you are an OneDrive for Business user, this error's root cause is due to SharePoint online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our moderator has already made a summary: </p>
<p>This issue may happen if a user uploaded lots of files in a time, but due to some reason (e.g. network latency), some of them didn't successfully uploaded, and were in corrupt state.</p>
<p>The SharePoint online file fragments cleanup timer job will run and deletes these files, then shows the message: Someone deleted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it happens to the upload process, it won't affect the existing files and there will be no trace in Audit log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the message can cause misleading and the related team has already received corresponding feedback. You can also share your valuable feedback at

<p>Hi Ime,</p>
<p>To clarify the sitution, I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Do you need to install Office on your mobile device or a tablet? Is it an Andriod device or an iOS device? Please clarify on this.<br />
2. Please specify "on hold for 45 mins". Is it that you encounter any error messages while installing Office or is there an sign in issue? Please share a related screenshot with us.<br />
Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select tInserthe&nbsp; Image icon.<br />
3. Where did you download Office? Does this issue still exist after a factory reset?</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

    <title>RSS and Atom feed refresh issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithhamilton  say:</h3>
<h2>            RSS and Atom feed refresh issue</h2>
                    <p>I've created two dynamic feeds that are initiated through C# aspx calls&nbsp;- one creating an RSS feed and the&nbsp;other creating an&nbsp;Atom feed.&nbsp; Both display the information I would expect in the IE8 browser.&nbsp; They also display correctly in Chrome, Firefox and a
 third party Feed reader.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I'm having is that the feed is not updated consistently in IE8.&nbsp; If I run in debug mode, I hit the breakpoint at the expected 15 minute intervals.&nbsp; I see that the updated information is returned to the browser.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the browser will
 not highlight the feed like it contains new data.&nbsp; I have no indication that it's there unless I refresh the feed manually.&nbsp; At that point the information displays as I'd expect it to.&nbsp; To make matters worse - it DOES work correctly, but very sporadically,
 and without a logical explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe it's entirely a coding issue (if at all), because when I do the same thing in Firefox, I hit the breakpoint and see the Title change, though Firefox doesn't effectively indicate that there is new information.&nbsp; Chrome has its own issues and
 hasn't been a viable platform for development debugging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to know is if there's some magic bullet that makes IE8 update an RSS and/or Atom feed consistently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            I E 11 seems to freeze intermittently</h2>
                    I have windows 7 and IE 11 and there is a problem I cannot resolve.&nbsp; It seems to freeze intermittently on some web sites I visit throughout the day.&nbsp; No specific ones that I have noticed.&nbsp; I have tried everything except resetting IE 11, which I sincerely
 do not want to do.&nbsp; Is this a problem with Java or another installed program?

<h2>            IE 11 messed up my entire computer. What to do&#63;</h2>
                    I updated to internet explorer 11 yesterday and now my computer will barely do anything. I can't get on the internet. It tries to open, freezes after several minutes and then crashes. The other programs on my computer open very slowly. For example, it
 took at least 5 minutes to get the control panel to load. Sometimes it's longer. When I click on options there, they are either slow to load or just freeze. I tried uninstalling IE 11 but nothing has changed. It's like I have a virus on my computer. The only
 posts I see are from people who have problems with the internet itself after this update and not their whole computer, so I'm sorry if this has been addressed elsewhere. I'm running windows 7 if that makes a difference. The only thing I've done is update internet
 explorer. I've made no other changes.

<p>It's terrible, isn't it? I hope someone has an answer asap because I can't really do anything on my computer. At all. The only reason I updated was because websites that I always go to had messages up saying if I didn't upgrade by a certain time, I wouldn't
 be able to access their sites because my browser wasn't as secure as IE 11. Well yeah it's secure. I can't do anything online or off.</p>

            <p>If still an issue I had exactly same problem and eventually went into system restore and took everything off that I had changed to update to explorer 11.</p>
<p>Thankfully it seems to have sorted it but can not use outlook to read emails. &nbsp;We will see.</p>

            <p>I just found a solution for the problem:</p>
<p>First start a new email or message and do the delay delivery option to whichever future date or time, let called this message or email Test<br />
</p>
<p>Once you hit send with the delay delivery option, the message will go to your Outbox folder, and if you go to your Outbox folder, in the sent column it should read the "None." DO NOT ERASE "Test " email or message - - the next techniques are the solution</p>
<p>Now, without erasing "Test" go back and start another&nbsp;message&nbsp;or email, this time called it Test-2, and for this email, do the delay delivery option to a future time, say 2 minutes pass your current time, which should be&nbsp;enough&nbsp;time to hit send. &nbsp;Here is
 the tricky part, when you hit the send button for Test-2, go back to the outbox, and do not touch, preview, select or point to open Test-2 message. &nbsp;Because&nbsp;if you do, Test-2 will go to None in the sent column. &nbsp;Wait for the two minutes, and the delay delivery
 will work, also you could see the Test-2 sent column with the date and time when you hit the send button. &nbsp;Other points, if you should need to revise or edit Test-2 email, since it will go back to None in the sent Column or you will lose the&nbsp;delay&nbsp;delivery&nbsp;option,
 you will need to start over again. &nbsp;You can try with real emails or message and it should work, now keep in mind you will need always the Test email in the outbox.</p>
<p>Hope it works for any of you, it was very tricky and frustrating the issue. &nbsp;Good luck</p>

<p>Everything wrong with the proprietor of Nokia <strong>and</strong> Skype.&nbsp; Why a working product was removed from a platform and system both controlled by Microsoft beats me.&nbsp; I was seriously considering buying a Lumia phone, but if major applications are
 just going to be switched off on a whim (while still&nbsp;continued on competitors' platforms!) I will be looking elsewhere.</p>

<p>I guess the product was removed from the platform as the platform is effectively dead. Given the way in which Skype is embedded in the WP OS, I don't expect this to happen in the same way.</p>
