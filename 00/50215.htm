<p>Hi Lan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Skype for Business for Mac, as far as I know we cannot directly update the profile picture in the Skype for Business for Mac. However, you can try to update your profile picture in the Office 365 Portal page. Please note,
 this function requires Exchange license and your profile picture will be synced to the skype for business for mac after some time, thanks. For more details, please refer to

<h2>            Windows 10 update files is already fully downloaded on laptop by Windows Update. But it won&#39;t let me install it&#47;setup cannot be triggered&#47;started to download again</h2>
                    <p>I reserve Windows 10 before July 29. &nbsp;But since I stopped all updates to installed before 27 and I saw in the news that on that few days before 29 devices already started to download the upgrade. But I noticed that that isn't what's happening in my device.
 So decided to install all available updates even the optional ones. And after that restart on that day 29, Windows 10 is now downloading on my device, I first think that i'm late not for the upgrade but now, I also notice the View download progress button
 on the Get Windows 10 program that will appear when you click the icon on the tray. I guess it also updates the Get Windows 10 program,
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35075329-f364-49a6-bb88-ce2a11914993" /></p>
<p><strong>OLD (Notice the date)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/baef03e9-2092-41fb-8423-9a3c3eeb9b7b" /><strong>NEW (Also notice the date)</strong></p>
<p>I let the device download it. But since I have a a bit slow connection at that time. I hibernated it and try again on morning. I tried that for about 2 times but since I got a loss thread ac port Windows 8.1 boot got interrupted since power is out (I don't
 have battery at the back) When I booted again the OS, the thing that is always I fear happened, The download 68% download that I have is now back to 0. I had nothing to do so I downloaded it again, hibernated it when I'm about to power off the laptop, do it
 again, and again, it always resume, and then that thing on the first one happened again on the boot up. Hibernation file is lost. I freshly booted up it again this morning but luckily this time the download survives. At exaclty on what i left it a t 86% it
 resumes. Then I finished 9:00 July 31 I think. And it says preparing installation files on Windows Update on Control Panel. I leave it minimized. And then something pops up. The EULA. I don't want to upgrade yet because I'm still having fun watching Youtube
 videos so I click the red x knowingly that it will just close the setup and can be rerun again if I'm ready for the upgrade. And then it's says that it will clean up the files, it may take a while. So I panicked that my downloaded upgrade might be deleted
 so I forced shutdown my laptop (5 seconds hold on power button) And booted it again. And then that popup opens again and now this time I accepted it. &nbsp;and it says that they're readying the update. Then that was finsihed. It closed by itself. And then I opened
 Get Windows 10 and it says that it's still downloading in the background, I'm confused so I fired up WU, and it says that I need to restart to update.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba35fa99-7e60-4f9b-b9cd-14ee0270a79b" />&nbsp;I restarted it guessing that might trigger the upgrade process, the the restart bring me back to 8.1 Nothing happend. I fired
 up Get Windows 10 and it sill says that It's still downloading.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e297eeea-ad68-446c-9956-748281bc20a6" />I don't know how to trigger the upgrade process. News says that
 notification will be showed when you are ready for the upgrade. But nothing showed up on mine. In hopes that I will get it starting the setup I installed all available updates for 8.1 on WU. Even the optional ones. It restarted. I came into the desktop WU
 popups checks for updates by itself and it downloaded the Windows 10 back again to 0%. I'm really confused right now. I have this folder on my Local Disk C names $Windows.~BT and I'm pretty sure that is the installation files.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e49824ec-6c33-42a3-82cc-98c286a1c8ae" /></p>
<p>So I have the installation files on my devices. I guess it already completed but one thing that I noticed is it doesn't have the folder named DUDownload inside together with Sources. It just Sources.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c320fd8d-c2ee-48f1-8e1c-b736690256cc" /></p>
<p><strong>COMPLETED</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20630e78-aa68-4d99-8235-6cde92994e6b" /><strong>A INSTALLATION FILES BACKUP BACK AT THE 86% MARK (Notice the WUDownload)</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Also I checked out the log for WU and it says that the last try was Failed, and normally it should be available on the welcome screen on WU to retry the install again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d79fc7ac-3f60-4e66-a557-869daf63b6d6" /><br />
</p>
<p><em>Please help me with this. And I'm sorry for a long story, I guess one spot on that story might be the factor on what I'm experiencing right now. Am I not eligible for the upgrade now because I'm 2 days late on the date (Upgrade to Windows 10 link on
 Microsoft.com is now not availble. Is MS not accepting any upgrdaes from now), is it corruption of installation files, or just missing files, registry, conflicts on Windows Updates? Please help me I don't want to use again my full 2 days of internet bandwith
 for redownloading this. I know I have the files inside. Please help me trigger the update. I also don't want a clean install so don't tell me to download the ISO files.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Please help me. Please don't tire of helping me with this one like what others did on my past questions. This is so crucial to me. ASAP</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> I also saw this when I submitted this and I already know about this isuue. That upgrade might be already downloaded to you but you wont see a notif. And they say that upgrades are coming in waves. If you will sat that is my problem,
 I don't think so. Because it still says In progress of downloading. And when you fired up WU it will show you a 0% percent mark. But if you will still insist that this is my problem, please explain it to me, I'm still a bit confused on what they pointing out
 there actually, that will come on some users on days, weeks or even months. And they says that it will come on waves. Is it the notif or the installation files?<br />

</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; PSS</strong>: I'm also a Windows Inder right from the start. I even have the Insider RTM on my second partition. So I pressume that I am on the priority right?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PPS:</strong> Also I forgot on that point where I said I'm still enjoying watching YouTube videos so I still not want setup to be restarted me automatically. I installed<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://bit.ly/1IabBiC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a><strong>&nbsp;registry
 hack from Vishal Gupta's blog AskVG.&nbsp;</strong>So updates won't restart me automatically and setup will not popup everytime to reschedule me<br />
<br />
<strong>PPSS:</strong> They said upgrade process from 8.1 is so painless. But why this is happening to me?! What if this is happening to people who isn't not a tech-savy like me, I guess they will have a very bad upgrade experience or just give up on upgrading
 their PCs and stay on where they are. If this is a bug, please report this on the team.<br />
<br />
<strong>PPSSS</strong>: Also they said if the setup fails, WU will appear on startup and will display&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAAahUKEwjW8oXRqoXHAhWk4aYKHSHZAFg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwindows.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows-10%2Fupgrade-install-errors-windows-10&amp;ei=BGW7VdbgBKTDmwWhsoPABQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEb_eT99NILz3xCfIquY2cG-C-9SQ&amp;sig2=tpeFf-sNvSAE-zosn2sm8g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">error
 codes</a>&nbsp;will appear. But both that things doesn't show up on restart of 8.1 and doesn't tell me that the setup fails unless I go to see the

<h2>            &#91;W10&#93; Delete executed programs list from registry.</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I would like to delete the list of programs my PC has executed. Not the start menu recent program list, but the complete one. I'm using a program called "Executed programs list", from Nirsoft, that tells me which programs have been executed and when, but doesn't
 allow me to delete the registry entry associated. CCleaner hasn't been completely helpful (only deleted half of the list). The program searches data from the following registry keys:<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\MuiCache</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Persisted</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store</li><li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\ShellNoRoam\MUICache</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
I've also deleted those keys manually, except the ShellNoRoam one, because apparently doesn't exist in my registry, to no avail. What am I missing? Is the ShellNoRoam key elsewhere? Is there any program I can use to completely wipe this information?

            Hi Chloe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When did this start?     If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise:
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  choose Display device, then Driver tab.  See if Roll back button is available; if not choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinsall Display driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />Did you check Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors for any filters?  Also click the link there for High Contrast Settings, then the tab for Color Filters to check there too.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <div>Hi everyone,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Bit of a newby, but everytime I try a backup or to create a system image I'm getting the following error:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Check your backup</div>
<div>Backup failed as shadow copy on source volume got deleted. This might caused by high write activity on the volume. Please retry the backup. If the issue persists consider increasing shadow copy storage using 'VSSADMIN Resize ShadowStorage' command.</div>
<div>Error code: 0x80780169</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Strangely enough, I'm was also trying to partition my drive (300gb) and it will only let me make a new drive of just over 6gb (which is no where near big enough). I could be wrong, but I assume that it all connected? Any one have any ideas of how to fix
 this?</div>

    <title>Bluetooth and Widi stopped working after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert hyman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth and Widi stopped working after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion dv7-6c80us Entertainment laptop. It is a quad core, 64 bit system. After I upgraded it from Windows 7 to Windows 10, both my Bluetooth and Widi&nbsp; became unavailable. I can't even find any Windows 10 settings to turn them on. They are
 not listed in Device Manager. It's as though they never existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked HP's driver site and it looks like HP is not distributing Windows 10 drivers at all for this model. Help for the site refers me back to Microsoft Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get Widi and Bluetooth working on the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between this and ongoing problems using my HP 6500-e709a 3 in 1 software with Windows 10, I am seriously considering backing out Windows 10 and going back to Windows 7. Windows 10 just lost too many features on this laptop. I am coming to the conclusion
 that Windows 10 is just not right for my Windows 7 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also compared my computer with my wife's new laptop which upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8. Blue tooth works just fine on her newer hardware. My conclusion is that Intel is not supporting windows 10 drivers for Bluetooth and Widi on my older network

    <title>My Surface Pro Type Cover saga - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joanie722  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface Pro Type Cover saga</h2>
                    <p>After 1-1/2 years my type cover&nbsp;stopped working; however the backlight keys&nbsp;were still on. I researched the web and tried all the various suggestions. None of which helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have not found a solution, but one work around now lets me use my type cover again using someone else idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleaned the contacts and&nbsp; if I hold the tablet &amp; type cover at a 90 degree angle I can use the type cover. If I lean the tablet back on the stand my typing doesn't appear on the screen; however if I prop up the tablet again to 90 degree angle all the letters
 I typed appear on the screen. For some reason the cot acts are no longer making a good connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why this has happened and was very frustrated, but at least I can use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to resolve this issue I would like to know.</p>

            Hi Joanie722,<br />
<br />
Thank you for reaching out. Are you still unable to use your Type Cover? Is the touchpad still responding? Aside from cleaning the contacts, what other troubleshooting steps you have tried so far? Have you tried checking it on your friend's or family member's
 Surface? Does it still have the same effect?<br />
<br />
Please make sure you have the latest updates are installed for your device. <br />
<br />
Also, we want to know if you tried troubleshooting steps for Surface cover/keyboard on this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-keyboards?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the latest updates and I have tried the troubleshooting steps listed on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cover/keyboard works fine ONLY if I make certain that&nbsp;both the cover and tablet are&nbsp;at a 90 degree angle (I cannot lean it back on tilt support) or I press up from the bottom-middle of the cover so that it has a good connection with the contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact I can be typing away without it showing in display and then when I tilt it up to 90 degree angle all the letters will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the type cover has just became "saggy" or weak and will not make good connection with contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have surfed the web and have seen others complaining of the same situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had it 1 1/2 years and it just began doing this so it is out of warranty and I don't know see and repair that would fix it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Xbox One S Wireless Controller issue with Dark Souls Series - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajhakra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Xbox One S Wireless Controller issue with Dark Souls Series</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)">Posted&nbsp;<abbr>Yesterday, 03:14 AM</abbr></p>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am currently trying to play the Dark Souls series(1, 2 and 3) but none of them appear to be working at all when using a controller. I am using the Xbox One S wireless controller with a bluetooth dongle(Issue still occurs when the controller is connected
 through USB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when I open each of the games, they will try to load up, hang for a while and then in the task manager, their process usage will drop to ~1%. The issue only happens with the Dark Souls games and nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Process Monitor, I reckon that I have found the issue but have no idea on how I would go about fixing it. From what I can see, each of the games are trying to find registry entries that simply dont exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reasoning behind thinking that this is the issue is because if I boot up the game before connecting my controller, the game will load up perfectly fine, but as soon as I connect my controller, it will crash. Once the controller has been connected while
 Dark Souls in open, a variety of games wont work until I restart my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I go about fixing this? I have already tried re-installing the XInput drivers for the controller as well as the bluetooth drivers that the controller is using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are a few screenshots from Process Monitor showing what registry entry each game is trying to find, I have checked the registry and these entries do not exist.</p>

<p>Hi ajhakra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Incorrect configuration setting is one of the potential reasons why your controller keeps on crashing when playing the game Dark Souls. To help you resolve this concern, I need to collect more information. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to play the game Dark Souls using the Xbox One S wireless controller before?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the affected game?</li><li>Have you tried updating your Xbox One S controller?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you perform the troubleshooting steps provide on the link below:</p>

<p>Hi Wilfried,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to play Dark Souls using the Xbox One S wireless controller before. The issue may relate to one of my hard drives failing and being replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling all of the games fully and reinstalling them but it hasn't fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to update my controller but the Xbox Accessories app is telling me that it is already up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also performed the troubleshooting steps in that link already, to no avail.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Troubleshoot activation errors in Windows 10 after a motherboard replacement or entering a Volume License key</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic

<br /><b>Details</b><br /></p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Activation errors after motherboard replacement</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Starting with Windows 8 and continuing with Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, most PC manufactures are injecting their Windows product key into the motherboard of the PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This allows the PC to activate automatically when you first boot up the PC and to re-activate if the PC is ever reset or needs a clean install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The product key in the motherboard is edition-specific and will only activate that edition of Windows (Home, Pro, etc.).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When the motherboard is replaced under warranty, Windows will detect a hardware change and look for the new product key that was included in the replaced motherboard.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes the new product key is not retrieved by Windows, and you get <em>
Activation Error 0x803F7001</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The troubleshooter will ask Windows to re- try retrieving the product key from the new motherboard and activated it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Correcting the mistake of entering a Global Volume License key</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The troubleshooter also corrects a second, less common issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>
If you searched the web, you might have found and entered a Global Volume License (GVL) Key.<span>&nbsp;
</span>GVL Keys only work for PCs in an Enterprise environment where the administrator has setup this system of licensing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you mistakenly entered a GVL Key, you PC will no longer accept regular product keys, and will give the activation error 0x8007007B (or even 0xC004E016, 0x8007232B, 0xC004F074, 0xC004F038).<span>&nbsp;
</span>This troubleshooter will identify the GVL Key and replace it with a regular retail default key.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Your PC will not activate yet, but now will accept normal retail and OEM product keys.</span></p>

I purchased the computer with Windows on it already (OEM).</p><p /><p>What happens to my product license when the motherboard fails and I need to replace it? It's completely not usable. Also, I believe Windows was running fine for several&nbsp;days after the motherboard replacement but before I updated Windows (after not updating it for years).</p><p /><p>My Windows license should be linked to my Microsoft account, but the activation tool lists this computer under "These devices were registered with a version of Windows 10 that does not support this feature".

<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator X Installation</h2>
                    I inserted the CD and followed the instructions to install the game. However, after clicking 'install', the installshield wizard gives me a black screen and with another progress bar. The progress bar is forever stuck on 'removing applications'. I have
 tried waiting for it to progress but to no avail. Can anyone help to fix the problem?

<p>Hi NunoDias2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask if you are using Skype app or Skype for Business app? They are two different apps and it's a normal behavior that Skype emoticons don't show up in Skype for Business (the link you provided
 is for Skype). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you'd like us to bring more emoticons into Skype for Business, you may submit us a feedback via:
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com/</a> Many features of current programs might be designed and upgraded based on customersâ€™ feedback. Your voice is important for us to improve our products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Were you able to boot into safe mode?</p>
<p>Were you able to run the system restore?</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of the thunderbird email client&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Can't get rid of Thunderbird e-mail client</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sick &amp; tired of Mozilla Thunderbird's design flaws, and located another&nbsp; freeware client to replace it. Now when I try to get rid of Thuderbord, I get an error message to the effect that I haven't got the right privileges. Since I OWN and paid for the PC,
 this kind of behavior is more than a tad irritating. How do I get the right privileges?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I was assuming a shortcut to the uninstaller app in the Thunderbird Program folder. I didn't know you were drilling down to the app itself :-)</p>
<p>I concur with Cameron- use Revo.</p>

<br />
I've resorted to the brute force method, by deleting all the Tbird files I could find, then the folders, and then all refenrences to Tbird in the registry, I've downloaded Revo Uninstaller, but haven't used it yet.
