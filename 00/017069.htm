<h2>            Microsoft Publisher &#40;Office 365&#41; will not save to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I have read all of the older posts on this subject yet, I am still having problems. This is happening on my old laptop as well as my brand new one.</p>
<p>I have tried to save to PDF in a normal "save as" routine, I tried to "export as a PDF", I tried the to file and I have changed the Default printer.
</p>
<p>Nothing I tried has worked. </p>
<p>At this point I will have to save each page as a JPEG and take it to the printer like that.&nbsp; Last year, even with using Windows 10, I had no problems.

<p>I would then ask, is this problem unique to this particular file? If so you might want to run the Design Checker to see if that flags any issue. You also might delete the pictures and try creating your PDF without them. Speaking of pictures, did you compress
 them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have this problem with all Publisher files then I would suggest repairing Publisher.

            Hi, 

My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.

Is important to know that Windows Media Player supports the most common media file formats. However, it does not support every media file format that is currently available. In step 1, make sure that Windows Media Player supports the format of the file that you are trying to play. If Windows Media Player does not support that format, do not perform the steps after step 1. Instead, contact the distributor of that file to see whether a viewer for the file is available.

Note Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
1.Verify that Windows Media Player supports the file format that you are trying to play. Windows Media Player supports the following file formats:
Windows Media formats: .asf, .asx, .avi, .wav, .wax, .wma, .wm, .wmv
Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG)

            Hi Rich,
<br />If you don't log in at least once a year, the account is inactive and purged and the only way to recover it is if you have the password - resetting the password wont work.  Logging into outlook.com will reopen the mailbox, although it will be empty. (The same applies to onedrive). 
<br />
<br />If you haven't accessed the account in 5 years it will be deleted (closed for good). Once an account is deleted you cannot recreate it using the same address as addresses cannot be reused. 
<br />
<br />
<br />The following is from the services agreement
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement</a> 
<br />
<br />ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.

    <title>Word 2016 - Right clicking on highlighted text deselects it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathiebr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016 - Right clicking on highlighted text deselects it</h2>
                    To put it lightly, this is driving me insane!!! &nbsp;I just installed Office 2016, so I'm still getting used to it, but when I highlight a word or block of text, then right click to get the copy option, instead of giving me that drop down menu, it just deselects
 the text I just selected. &nbsp;There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to what does eventually cause the right click menu to appear and I have to either just keep selecting the text and right clicking until it eventually gives me the right click menu or I
 have to select the text and hit the copy icon on the top toolbar - which is a huge hassle when I'm doing this a lot and I have to move my mouse from the text all the way up to the toolbar instead of being able to leave my mouse in position and right click
 and get that right click menu. &nbsp;This is such a hassle to me, that I'm seriously considering uninstalling Office 2016 and going back to Office 2010. &nbsp;Please help someone! &nbsp;I love the cloud feature to store

<p>Had this issue myself.&nbsp; Found a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To fix this</span>:</span></strong>&nbsp;Hit the File tab, go down to Options, and in the General section right at the top, there's a box that reads: "Show mini toolbar on selection".&nbsp; Un-check this box, then
 hit okay, and the problem should be solved.&nbsp; Right click should work properly again with no more text deselect.&nbsp; Worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What people are saying is accurate in that it has to do with tiny mouse movements, BUT this is caused by a feature that was added recently.&nbsp; It's that mini formatting toolbar that pops up automatically whenever you highlight something that's causing the
 problem.&nbsp; This added feature creates an overlap of systems where Word thinks you're trying to select new text and interact with the new toolbar instead of just right clicking on the text that's already been highlighted.&nbsp; Best way I can explain why I think
 the problem happens.&nbsp; Turning off the mini formatting toolbar avoids this confusion, and the right click option is freed up again.&nbsp; Not sure why this is even a feature since the mini formatting toolbar shows up just above or below the right click pop up window
 anyway.&nbsp; I guess it was added to erase the need to right click at all?&nbsp; This idea sounds like it would add greater efficiency, but in reality it seems to have just made things less efficient.&nbsp; Poor design, in other words, but not necessarily a bug.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp;
 Anyway,&nbsp;that's the fix everybody.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 HTML formatted calendar invites lose formatting when received by older clients</h2>
                    <p>When a user on Outlook 2016 sends calendar invites that contain HTML formatted content to users on older (Outlook 2010 and 2013) clients, the HTML formatting is stripped and replaced with plain text. This only seems to be the case when using the Outlook
 2016 client and cannot be reproduced using 2010 or 2013.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here are the details you've requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is not related to sending to specific recipients, rather, its specific to the version of the client the recipient is using. The results are the same across all Outlook 2010 and 2013 users that we've tested with so far. The HTML content comes
 from an Outlook plugin, but we've performed testing of creating HTML formatted content from scratch and the same issues persist across the recipients that are on older clients, so the issue is not related to the plugin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the sender is using Outlook 2016 (16.0.7030.1018) 32-bit, below is what the invite looks like on other 2016 recipients. Not the content circled in red is in HTML format. There are no pictures, so its purely formatting and hyperlinks. The black boxes
 are just personal information that has been obscured for privacy reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ddd36b4-b22c-4dd5-a963-027173098b99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ddd36b4-b22c-4dd5-a963-027173098b99" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When the invite is received by an Office 2013 (15.0.4833.1000) client, this is how it is rendered both in the preview pane and in the calendar view. Note that the content circled in red has been converted to plain text.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ee54f3f-4133-44ba-a096-f8ceac6db4a6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ee54f3f-4133-44ba-a096-f8ceac6db4a6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The same is true for 2010 (14.0.7166.5000) clients that receive the invite:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2be99361-6d9e-4f6d-9866-6126d820da4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2be99361-6d9e-4f6d-9866-6126d820da4c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, we also tested creating meeting invites with HTML based content on the older clients and sending it out. Content sent from Outlook 2010 and 2013 is preserved across all three versions when received, so this issue really appears to be
 related to content sent from Outlook 2016 only.</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the browser history is deleted from the web browser, we won't be able to recover the deleted browser history. However, we can check for the search history and see if it is helpful to you. The search history is dependent on the search engine that you
 use and the browser itself. For example, if you are using Internet Explorer with Bing or Google as your search engine, you can access the search history by following the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access Bing search history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>IE</strong>, type <strong>www.bing.com</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>3 lines icon</strong> on the top right corner of the screen, next to the
<strong>sign in icon</strong>.</p>
<p>3. From the drop down menu, click on <strong>Search history</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll get the list of all the searches you've made using Bing search engine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access Google search history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>IE</strong>, type <strong>www.google.com</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>Settings</strong> from the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Search settings</strong> and select <strong>Search results</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure you sign in to Google account before checking for search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Weird conversion when using &#34;number-format&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to make a worksheet of my scheduled working hours. It can be done smarter, but it's just a temporary solution so what I'm trying to do is to type in my hours, e.g. 6-14 (6 am to 2 pm). This will change to a date if I'm using the "Standard"-format,
 so I tried changing to "Numbers", but this format automatically changes "6-14" to "41791".</p>
<p>In what world does 6-14 translate into 41791?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm using "Text"-format, but I'm a bit concerned that I can't use Excel for calculations without worry in the future.</p>

<p>In Excel, Dates are stored as <em>serial values</em> offset from Jan. 1, 1900, but [usually] are displayed based on Date Formatting. IOW, your "6-14" is interpreted as June 1, 2014 which is 41,791 days from the starting date of January 1, 1900.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to display "6-14" in that way you need to either do as you're doing or precede the entry with an apostrophe ['6-14]. Which you use makes no difference with regard to calculations because "6-14" is not a numerical value, so neither are usable for
 calculation purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you intend to use the start/end times as precedents for calculations each needs to be stored in a separate cell as a time or number of hours. These references will provide details for working with Dates &amp; Times:</p>

                    <p>I have recently switched to the new sync client and it is working fine. The problem now is that the tab for the old Onedrive client is still there and I cannot unpin it. How do I get rid of it?</p>

<p>Hi MichaelWalker125,<br />
<br />
Please try the steps below to remove it:</p>
<p>1. Exit&nbsp;<span>OneDrive&nbsp;</span>by right clicking on the&nbsp;<span>OneDrive - Company name</span>&nbsp;system tray icon &gt;&nbsp;<span>Exit</span>.</p>
<p>2. Open the&nbsp;<span>Registry Editor</span>&nbsp;by clicking the&nbsp;<span>Windows + R</span>&nbsp;button and enter&nbsp;<span><strong>regedit&nbsp;</strong></span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to&nbsp;<span><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Software&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Microsoft&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>OneDrive&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Accounts&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>BusinessX</strong></span>.</p>
<p>4. There will be X amount of Business accounts depending on how many you have logged into previously. Find the specific one by looking at the&nbsp;<span>UserEmail&nbsp;</span>value. After you found the correct one,
<strong>delete</strong> the entire folder containing that key.</p>
<p>5.Please navigate to&nbsp;<span><strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>CLSID</strong></span>. Inside the folder, please search (<span>CTRL + F</span>) for keyword:&nbsp;<span>OneDrive</span>.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<span>Find next&nbsp;</span>until you find one that has the&nbsp;<span>OneDrive - Company name</span>&nbsp;as the&nbsp;<span>Default&nbsp;</span>value and looks something like the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d12070e4-7222-4d5e-8cec-6a5a803de3c2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d12070e4-7222-4d5e-8cec-6a5a803de3c2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>7. Modify the<span><strong>&nbsp;System.IsPinnedToNameSpaceTree</strong></span>&nbsp;value to
<strong>0</strong> &gt; OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the icon is still visiable, r<span>estart your computer and check the outcome.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>The button for link to previous is telling Word that you want the header in this section to be the same as in the previous section (or not). The property to restart page numbering is only tangentially related to the header/footer. The link to previous setting
 is for each header and footer in a section. The page number continuation setting is for each section. This property is controlled in the format page numbers dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default setting is to continue numbering from the previous section. Once you change this, any new section started from a section that restarts numbering, will, itself, restart numbering.</p>

<h2>            Excel VBA code to update data in multiple sheets based on those in one sheet</h2>
                    
<p>Dear all,&nbsp;I need help with the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an excel file (called "patients") that contains patient lab results . Each individual patient lab results are placed on a separate sheet (have about 100 patients, each sheet name is an individual patient’s
 ID which is a 9-digit number).</p>
<p>A typical patient sheet is as follows (for instance, patient sheet name is 123456789):</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lab<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jan<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Feb<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>…..Nov …Dec</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wbc<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span> 10<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>12<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>….<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sodium<span> </span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>135<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>135<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>140<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>….</p>
<p>Potassium<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>4.0<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3.9<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>…..</p>
<p>&nbsp;....</p>
<p>&nbsp;....</p>
<p>Note: <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Lab” is in cell A1; “Jan” is in B1;….,”Dec” is in cell M1; wbc values would get placed in row 2; sodium values in row 3,.</p>
<p>Note: in addition to wbc, sodium, potassium, I have about 30 additional labs for each patient, each lab is on a row on the patient’s sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each month, I get an excel spreadsheet that has actual lab data for patients who had their labs drawn (number of patients on this sheet are variable- could be up to 100 patients). I import the results into
 an excel sheet in the same file (sheet named “report”). The sheet has the following in it as an example for month of Dec:</p>
<p>Month:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dec<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PatientID<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>WBC<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sodium<span>&nbsp; </span>potassium</p>
<p>123456789<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>10.1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>140<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>4.9</p>
<p>223456789<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>8.2<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>135<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>6.0</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>....&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: month value (Dec in this example) would be in cell B1; “patientID” would be in cell A2 with actual patientID values in column A, “wbc” in cell B2 with actual wbc values present in column B;… …….I would
 have additional 32 more labs, each is on a separate column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a program that would do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lookup month value (in cell B1 on “report” sheet; it is Dec in this example).</p>
<p>For patient 123456789, take wbc value that is in the report sheet (in cell B3 in this example) and put it in the appropriate cell on the sheet for the patient (patient sheet name is 123456789; wbc would be
 placed in cell M (month of Dec) since this report is for month of Dec. Do the same for all other lab values for this patient.</p>
<p>Do the same of all the other patients.</p>
<p>Note: I need to put the lab results in the column of Dec on individual patient sheets. Previous months (Jan through Nov) for each patient would already have data in them that I do not want to get changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any help with the code would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Wissam</p>

<p>I need a way to ensure that the above code would continue to work if someone changes the name of the sheets that the code is dependent on ("Report", "Template","PatientList").</p>

<p>There are many ways to make the code unusable and we can not prevent all possibilities that exist in Excel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Prevent them from being able to change the name of the sheet (if that is possible)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2)Refer to the sheets in VBA with names that do not change with the change of name on the tab (? VBA name which is Sheet1 for Report, Sheet2 for Template, Sheet3 for PatientList in the VBA project).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is possible, but not solution.</p>
<p>Someone can add a new sheet, deletes the old and rename the new sheet as "Report".</p>
<p>If you use the code as is, it works. If you refers to the codename of that sheet, it did not work.</p>
<p>Excel enables high Flexiblilität in dealing with data, but there are many circumstances possible that a code or formula no longer works.</p>
<p>If you want to ensure that it works under all circumstances, then you should take an other program, such as Access.</p>

<br />
<p>IMO we should do many more tests to be sure that the values are stored at the correct position&nbsp;and be sure that we did not overwrite any other data.</p>

    <title>Office 365 offer on Lumia 640 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruleofthebrave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 offer on Lumia 640</h2>
                    
<p>As was promised, the lumia 640 came with an offer of 1 year of office 365. The activation process is through an app called "office 365 gift". The app is supposed to recognize your phone and then send an e-mail with instructions as to how to activate the
 1 year offer. However, the app either claims that it does not recognize the microsoft account or it does not recognize the phone...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else with this problem?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span><strong>Why do I get an error when trying to activate Office 365 in the Office app on my phone?</strong>&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>The error message that you are getting is related to the fact that the
<strong>Office 365</strong> button in the Office App on the phone is related to syncing your Enterprise Office 365 license to your phone to access internal shares. Your Windows Phone already comes preloaded with the Office Applications, and you connect your
 phone to your OneDrive and email via the <strong>Settings &gt; Email+accounts</strong> path. There is no additional action required on your phone to activate the Office 365 Personal subscription included with the device purchase. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure as well that your internet connection is stable to avoid such issue. To verify its stability, you may try accessing any website using the phone's browser. We look forward to your reply.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bing Search Issue &#124; Support Ticket Not Acknowledged</h2>
                    <p>Glad I printed out my support ticket.&nbsp; So, is Microsoft in the habit of ignoring tickets?&nbsp; I created one on 4/6/17 and haven't seen anything from them!&nbsp; What does one have to do these days?&nbsp; I see there is no trail for my request and it is more and more
 difficult to even find a way to chat with anybody from Microsoft.&nbsp; UGH</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is that Bing Search is producing something, given 2 keywords, and I need the results changed.&nbsp; When searching help, although Microsoft says it has no control over what is displayed, evidently they do and I can't even see who is controlling the content
 I'm seeing.&nbsp; The information is displayed to the right of links that are on the left.&nbsp; Bing says it is getting its information from Wikipedia, but Wikipedia has been changed a while ago.&nbsp; So, where are the results REALLY coming from?</p>

            My primary browser is the latest Firefox; I've used older versions of that browser looking at this as well.&nbsp; I also use Chrome from time-to-time.&nbsp; I've cleared cache on both browsers.&nbsp; Same results.&nbsp; I really don't want to put a screen shot in here, because
 of the sensitive nature of who is in the results.&nbsp; My father, my siblings, my father's wives, etc.&nbsp; That wouldn't be appropriate for this forum.&nbsp; Let me just say that my name has changed, is changed on Wikipedia, and remains the other name in the search.<br />

<p>Mr. Del, I had already looked through the first link, which is why I submitted a ticket and this post.&nbsp; The other link also exposes information I do not wish the world to see.&nbsp; But, you know something?&nbsp; If you can truly resolve this, I will deal with the
 fallout of what I'm seeing with a screen print, and you can tell ME why Bing says it is pulling information from Wikipedia when it's not.&nbsp; I can only conclude that the link pointing at Wikipedia is not where the information is coming from.&nbsp; I am Bob Gibson's
 eldest son, Ray Gibson.&nbsp; The information states that I am Renee Gibson (daughter) underlined in red.&nbsp; Look at the Wikipedia link, and there is no mention of my old name or (daughter) on their page.</p>

 I wouldn't have come to this Forum if Microsoft acknowledged and addressed the ticket I submitted!<br />

            I submitted a ticket for this issue already, AND feedback.&nbsp; I'm just being ignored.&nbsp; The discrepancy is not coming from Wikipedia ... that site has been corrected long ago and I've corresponded with them.&nbsp; They said Bing may be pulling information from
 somewhere else and just saying it's coming from Wikipedia.&nbsp; Cash has been cleared on both browsers I use.&nbsp; NOPE ... I was a computer professional, since 1978.&nbsp; I know when someone's server contains the wrong information (or misinformation) in their database
 or not properly displaying where my name is coming from, and this is what is happening!&nbsp; Microsoft just doesn't care enough about this issue to address/solve it.<br />

            Who are you talking to?&nbsp; Me or Xylee?&nbsp; None of any links on Microsoft OR Bing are explaining where MY information is coming from.&nbsp; It says one thing in the item found (Wikipedia) when that is
<strong>not</strong> where the information is coming from.&nbsp; Wikipedia was changed long ago ...
 can tell me why Microsoft ignored my support ticket to get this resolved by people who know what they're talking about ...

    <title>Installation gets stuck at 70&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyrusnima  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation gets stuck at 70&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I am installing Windows Technical Preview (win10)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>build 10041 from ISO
</strong></span></p>
<p>on a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DELL XPS M1710 running&nbsp;Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything goes OK (except very slow), until it gets to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>70% on the Big Circle </strong></span>(at the bottom it has "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Applying PC Settings at 88%</strong></span>").</p>
<p>At&nbsp; which time it just sits there with no disk activity.&nbsp; As of now, it's been sitting at 70% for 4 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure would like to know what it is doing at "88% applying PC Settings"? - If this is important for win10 rollout someone at Microsoft should look at the code and let me know. I don't think my PC is that much different than a typical PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my main question&nbsp;is:</p>
<ol>
<li>- Should I wait some more? (it has been 4 hours at 70% as of now - I will wait until tomorrow anyway).</li><li>- Should I restart installation with a change in something before I install?</li><li>- Should I forget about this project?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>CPU-Z Verified dump
</strong></span>at this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://valid.canardpc.com/ap7q41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(17, 85, 204, 1)">http://valid.canardpc.com/</span>ap7q41</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note in order&nbsp;to restart and change something before I can try again, I would need to&nbsp;restore the entire PC from a an External Image backup, which is a full day job. This is already my 3rd try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any help would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p><span>b. Go to <strong>FILE</strong> &gt;
<strong>Info</strong> &gt; <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Copy the content in the Internet header.</span></p>
<p><span>If the recipient is using Office 365, go to Outlook Web App (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/owa</a>),
</span><span>double click the email to open it, click the down arrow near the right-side

    <title>Nokia 9500 - Hinge Assembly Cracks Frequently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia 9500 - Hinge Assembly Cracks Frequently</h2>
                    02nd June'08<br />
<br />
NOKIA CUSTOMER CARE<br />
<br />
Dear Sir,<br />
<br />
Please note that I have been forced to replace the hinge assembly of my Nokia 9500 Communicator repeatedly as it cracks quite frequently. Please note details of purchase and changes done as given below.<br />
<br />
Model - Nokia 9500 Communicator.<br />
Date of Purchase: 18th Jan'07<br />
Seller: M/s. Studio Cell - TTK Road, Alwarpet, Madras - 600018. India.<br />
<br />
Replacements of HINGE ASSEMBLY (Casing of Inner LCD).<br />
<br />
Date: 22nd Aug'07: Service Centre - M/s. Quantum Telesys - 32 Thiru Vi Ka Road, Opposite to Satyam Theatre, Royapettah, Madras - 600014. Bill No: 340; Amount Charged: Rs.1800<br />
<br />
Date: 03rd April'08: Service Centre - M/s. Rocky Agencies (Formerly M/s. Quantum Telesys) - 32 Thiru Vi Ka Road, Opposite to Satyam Theatre, Royapettah, Madras - 600014. Bill No: 2771; Amount Charged: Rs.1800<br />
<br />
Now I have noticed that the same Hinge Assembly has developed crack and needs to be replaced !!!!!!<br />
<br />
I would like to ask Nokia, how come the mobile needs frequent replacement of Hinge Assembly which cost Rs.1800 every few months and over a period of 1 Year 4 months after purchase, I have to shell out Rs.5400 just to replace the same part every time !!! This
 is ridiculous to make expensive mobile which I have bought for over Rs.24,000/- and needs a service cost of Rs.1800 every 2 months !!!<br />
<br />
I request your reply and replacement of the Hinge Assembly part FREE of cost now.<br />
<br />
Thanking you<br />
D. Mohandas<br />

            I've dealt with the Communicators in the past, the hinges were pretty sturdy - your must have been subjected to some poor treatment or extreme conditions to have just 'cracked'. I assume that the repair centres you have used have marked it as "accidental
 damage" which is not covered by the warranty.<br />
<br />
In any case, you are currently out of warranty, so it is difficult to see what you expect Nokia to do now.

            Hai, May be your communicator was sturdy !! But mine seems to be pretty weak with the hinge cracking at same point 3 times !! This time it has cracked in 3 places !! I would never ever buy Nokia again. It was just for the office phone 9500 which I have
 purchased last year. I don't think of buying any other phone with a open type / hinge assembly. Slide type phones or Blackberry is better. BIG MNC COMPANY NOKIA... **bleep** PRODUCT / COMPONENT / SERVICE..

<p>Have you too been facing the same issue? How do you know the Insider Program will start again?</p>
<p>Do I have to continue with Insider build or stop them? Will I get notifications for the next insider?</p>

            That watermark appears if you did a clean install and did not upgrade a valid qualifying version of windows 7 or 8.1 first. You can do a clean install later after the upgrade but first you must upgrade your windows 8.1 or 7. This is to prevent non qualified
 devices from obtaining a free upgrade. Everyone can install it, but if they didn't upgrade a qualifying windows device, they will have to buy a license.

<p>you can start with build 10130 .iso and prior, use the keys found in the forums for when it that build was released, clean install, validate it, and then do the updates through win10 updates to 10240. or use the setup.exe through win10 for higher build updates</p>

    <title>Word and Excel 2010 continually freeze up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosesspins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word and Excel 2010 continually freeze up</h2>
                    
<p>I have an employee who was experiencing a problem with Word and Excel 2007.&nbsp; She was using Windows 7 and Office 2007.&nbsp; She could open a document in either program, but as soon as she tries to actually do anything to it (save, print, any command) the program
 freezes up.&nbsp; She doesn't really use the other programs in the suite, but it apparently applies to them too, because I was able to recreate the problem in One Note.&nbsp; At a loss, I decided to simply uninstall the whole thing and start over.&nbsp; The One note was
 so locked up that I couldn't repair the install or complete an uinstall so I had a horrible time trying to get it off the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have new Volume licensing for the 2010 version of office, I uninstalled every aspect of her old 2007 programs even using Revo Uninstall to make sure I got everything.&nbsp; I then reinstalled Office, this time the new 2010 version, got all of the updates
 and left the machine in what seemed to be good working order.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday morning same problem all over again!&nbsp; Help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I upgraded to Windows 10&nbsp; and now am unable to execute an email merge via Word and Outlook in office 2010.&nbsp; It runs the merge but nothing sends.&nbsp; I've read a bunch of posts about this issue and looks like the only solution is to sent via plain text but i
 want to send a picture.&nbsp; An older post linked to a hotfix that is no longer available. Any assistance would be most appreciated</p>

</span></span><span><span>Setting up and using the Merge Tools Add-in</span></span><span><span>.docx
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Locating first blank cell in column - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wlmpilot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locating first blank cell in column</h2>
                    
<p>I have a spreadsheet that uses rows 16 - 100 for questions.&nbsp; Example, C16:C100 are set aside for questions and each question has a Yes and No optionbutton.</p>
<p>I alotted C16:C100 for the question, but may never use all the available cells in that range.&nbsp; Each cell in that range has a formula that pulls in the question.&nbsp; The actual question is on Worksheet("Data").Range(C16:C100).&nbsp; The formula for Worksheets("2010"),
 C16:C100 are =DATA!C16 with the cell reference changing accordingly.</p>
<p>With that said, I need to locate that last cell used, ie has the actual question in it, not including the formula.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Les</p>

Try if this works. Assuming your data start from A2 to C13. In B14 =SUMPRODUCT(--($A$2:$A$13&lt;=EOMONTH(TODAY(),-1)),B2:B13) In C14 =SUMPRODUCT(--($A$2:$A$13&lt;=EOMONTH(TODAY(),-1)),C2:C13)
