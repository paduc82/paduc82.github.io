<h2>            Is it advisable to make micro sd the default storage location for surface pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm running out of space on my surface pro 3.</p>
<p>I have a 128GB micro sd card and would prefer to use it as my default location for My Documents.</p>
<p>My only concern is that I work with large files that also autosave at intervals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.1 Is it advisable to do this or&nbsp;would I run through the read/write cycle of the microsd card quickly and get it damaged?</p>
<p>.2 Do I get a slower performance from working directly off the microsd?</p>

<div>&nbsp;not the best solution and alot depends on brand, etc. etc. you should consider</div>
<div>using OneDrive as the default save location (if you aren't already). </div>
<div>&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;.2 Do I get a slower performance from working directly off the microsd? </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; probably. especially with larger files. </div>

                    When I play compilation cd tracks the player only shows track title but lists artists as 'various artists'.&nbsp; I've tried changing the album details in Properties but to no avail. Does anyone have a solution?

            <p>Did you save the changes you made ?</p>
<p>Use rather mp3Tag (you can add album art downloaded from the net and also batch tag) to manually change the tags, its the only safe and reliable way to do it.
</p>
<p>That way you get what you want. Once you've saved the tags WMP won't change them.</p>

<h2>            Blue Stop Error at Startup</h2>
                    <div>Good day.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop with Windows Vista Home Basic. My problem is, whenever I start my laptop, I always experienced a blue stop error. Some relevant information displayed goes this way:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Technical information:</div>
<div>STOP: 0x0000009C (0x00000005, 0x85ED3120, 0xB2000030, 0x0C000E0F)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't installed any new hardware. I only have installed some updates from Microsoft as recommended. I don't know if Audacity (which I downloaded and installed last October) made an effect. I don't know about the BIOS either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Afterwards, my laptop performs a Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool tests. Then it restarts and starts my laptop, and I can use it again normally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These are the information I obtained through the Problem Reports and Solutions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Problem signature</div>
<div>Problem Event Name:<span> </span>

</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have managed to research a little about this, and stumbled upon BlueScreenView. I ran it and found out that the MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION is caused by driver hal.dll, and by address hal.dll+7021.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know much about computers, but I'm willing to learn. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!</div>

<div><strong>&nbsp;We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers
 were loaded, and what was responsible.</strong><br />
<em>You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.</em><br />
<strong><br />
The procedure:</strong><br />
<em>* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.</em><br />
<strong><br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:</strong><br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<strong><br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />
To run MSinfo32 please go to start&gt;run&gt;MSinfo32<br />
Go to "file" "save" and upload the saved file with the DMPS<br />

            <b>GenrevTN<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the 3 that occurred in December were inconclusive.&nbsp; Obviously related to a driver but not as yet named.&nbsp; I suggest these two tests.<br />
</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<div><strong>&nbsp;These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</span></em><br />
<br />
<span>*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest.</strong><br />
<span>*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span>*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.</span><br />
<span>*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.</span><br />
<span>*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.</span><br />
<span>If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
2-Driver verifier</strong><br />
<span>Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.</span><br />
<br />
<span>*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.</span><br />
<span>*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.</span><br />
<span>*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.</span><br />
<span>*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).</span><br />
<br />
<span>*In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the
 Safe Mode menu .</span><br />
<br />
<span>Then, here's the procedure:</span><br />
<span>- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter</span><br />
<span>- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Finish" on the next page.</span><br />
<span>*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</span><br />
<span>*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it
 run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</span><br />
<span>*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.</span><br />
<span>*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</span><br />
<br />

<h2>            Question about Microsoft Support.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just been on a live chat with a Microsoft customer support member and I'd like to make sure it's 100% verified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to "https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus" and after going through the Virtual agent, which did not solve my issue, clicked on "Live Chat" so I could get immediate support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was that I couldn't activate windows, and when I was redirected to the live chat, the URL was "https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked multiple times if they could remote into my computer to verify my hardware change that was causing the issue and after denying it multiple times, I was eventually given a new key after showing proof of purchase I was given a link to "http://keydelivery.one.microsoft.com"
 where I was given a special code to use to access a new key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key activated fine, but I was wondering if there was anything wrong with this transaction as I was worried that it wasn't a real support technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Why doesnt MS take advantage of the Live Event player and give us something like,I don't know,maybe a Live event?&nbsp;It would&nbsp;help set them above Sony if maybe they hosted free weekly concerts or MMA fights.As it stands now&nbsp; they only use this app twice a year-at
 E3 and COD Championship Tournaments.Its about time they stepped up their game and start delivering some awesome content.Dont wait for the competition MS.Raise the bar before they do.</p>

    <title>Media Feature Pack for Windows 10N Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Feature Pack for Windows 10N Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>My install of Windows 10N was working fine until the Creators Update on Christmas Eve blew out the Media Pack and ruined my holidays.</p>
<p>Video editing (Prmeiere Pro) no longer works - the irony of "Creator Update" stopping me &amp; the boy editing our latest video isn't lost on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now come to the conclusion that although I have installed the correct Media Feature Pack for build 1709, it isn't working correctly.</p>
<p>If I try to re-install I get a message saying "It's already there!"</p>
<p>I have seen people on here advised to uninstall then re-install, but I don't think this is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous years, it seems this problem has been fixed by a new version of the Media Pack coming out, but has anyone got any solution that might work sooner than that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The other unwanted effect of this update was to knock out access to my NAS drive - that took a lot of searching to find that this had been done deliberately. Thanks guys - I fixed that one in "only" three hours!)</p>

            If you upgraded on Christmas eve, you should be able to rollback:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<h2>            Getting VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL error</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Extremely Weird and Annoying Crashes; Most Likely GPU Related</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heya,<br />
<br />
For a while now I keep getting extremely weird crashes. There is no blue screen, the PC just restarts. The symptoms are as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. It can happen during gaming, or, as was the case earlier tonight, right after rebooting from crashing.<br />
2. It's not a heating issue (neither the CPU nor GPU go over 60 degrees celsius)<br />
3. It happened on Win 8.1 and is now happening on Win 10. I solved it a few months ago with what I thought was a BIOS update, but it returned after I did a fresh windows install (this is why I believe it's software related)<br />
4. I did 6 passes with memtest86+ booted from USB, it came back clean. I did furmark for 4 hours with no issues. I scanned for malware with both the windows tool and bitdefender, at startup and in safe mode, all is clean.<br />
5. https://www.dropbox.com/s/lr1e2xjqqbpaq99/061415-8531-01.dmp?dl=0 &lt;----Memory dump<br />
6. Windows as well as all drivers, are up-to-date.<br />
7. Most of the time event log shows an error 41, unexpected power loss. A few times it gave an VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL error. Microsoft's BugCheckCode reference site lists possible error parameters, but this one (2e) is nowhere to be found for this
 particular error.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Damir H. </p>

            <p>Hi Ethan,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, we're suspecting that part of your laptop keys does not work properly. The quick solution for this is to use an external keyboard (USB type). It should work even without installing the driver.<br />
<br />
Let us know about the result.</p>

            I don't think its the keyboard because it works perfectly. I have tested all the keys and they are ok that is when the pc has booted. I think you haven't understood my issue clearly. Theres is a section when i hit F2 "security", i am able to access it.
 The text turns white but only two of them at that section of security i am able to navigate but the other parts like advance, boot and others i can't access their settings. &nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for the update and clarification. Yes, I was thinking that you are already in the
<strong>UEFI BIOS</strong> and could not navigate using arrow keys. Going back to the scenario and to set an expectation,
<em>there is a unique way</em> on how you can navigate to the UEFI of Dell computers.<br />
<br />
The regular method (and for most Windows 10 PCs) is to<strong> press or hold ESC</strong> key the moment you switch-ON the PC. If F2 is for
<em>Security</em>, you're correct that this will not lead to the UEFI BIOS.<br />
<br />
In case that the ESC key did not help, you may contact the manufacturer in order for you to get the accurate steps for their unique system.</p>

            Ok, i think i asked it in a wrong way. I need to change some settings in my UEFI/BIOS but it is stuck in read mode. All options are blanked out expect for "exit". How can i get it to let me edit the settings?&nbsp;

    <title>Win 8.1 - McAfee incompatibility. McAfee will not uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 8.1 - McAfee incompatibility. McAfee will not uninstall</h2>
                    Having recently upgraded to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8, I've discovered that my McAfee software is no longer functioning correctly. &nbsp;Research indicates it's not compatible with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I've gone through the troubleshooting steps from both Microsoft
 and McAfee. &nbsp;Finally, tried to uninstall completely but that failed. &nbsp;After selecting the McAfee Security Center in the list of Programs and clicking "Uninstall", the computer attempts to connect to a McAfee webpage apparently, but nothing happens. &nbsp;I receive
 this message "Navigation to webpage was canceled." &nbsp;

<div>Is there an alternative method for uninstalling this application successfully? &nbsp;Or is there a known upgrade for McAfee Security? &nbsp;I'd prefer to uninstall and start clean with Windows Defender. &nbsp;Any help is MUCH appreciated.</div>

<h2>            Songs do not appear in the Windows Media Player library</h2>
                    
<p>WIndows Media Player 12 not adding songs</p>
<p>I got my new PC with Windows 7 this afternoon, and&nbsp;copied over 10,000 songs into&nbsp;My Music folder.&nbsp; None of these songs will show up in Windows Media Player 12 song library. My Music folder is one of the default save location in WMP Libraries.&nbsp; Only 3 songs
 are showing up in the Library, and these are the three on the Public Music folder.&nbsp; Yet when I add a song to the Public Music folder, it gets added to the Library. Then when I close WMP and re-open it, we're back to the original 3 songs!&nbsp; I spent an hour with
 HP support this evening and did not get any where.&nbsp; I have tried system restore.&nbsp; I have tried restoring media library.&nbsp; I think my WMP may be corrupt.&nbsp; Any thoughts on what I'm missing here?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>This problem occurs because the Windows Media Player library database has become corrupted.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
To resolve this problem, clear the Windows Media Player database. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
2. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player, and then click OK.<br />
3. Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
&nbsp;4. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Exit Windows Media Player.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Start, click Run, type %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Select the Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Restart Windows Media Player.</div>

<blockquote>
<p>I had same&nbsp;symptoms as cturner003 in a 64 bit Win 7 environment.&nbsp; But the problem was entirely different from everythin I read up to Nov 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I started looking into the file properties under the details tab, I noticed that all of these files had file
 attributes 'R' and 'S' set.&nbsp; Turns out that somehow&nbsp;all of my music got marked as 'Read Only'&nbsp;\ 'System' files when I restored them.&nbsp; My fault I'm sure.&nbsp; Tried all of the solutions up to the Nov 2010 entries to no avail.&nbsp; Finally discovered the issue.&nbsp; Once
 I changed the file attributes, all of the music started showing up in WMP.&nbsp; Should have picked that up sooner.</p>
<p>For these files, I couldn't find any way to change the attributes except through the command prompt.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>, Click <strong>All Programs</strong>, Click<strong>Accessories</strong>.&nbsp; Then<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">right click</span><strong>Command Prompt</strong> and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Type <strong>Attrib /?</strong> to get familiar with the attributes command.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; My music is stored in the path c:\users\glym\music.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I fixed the&nbsp;problem with the following command string:<strong>attrib -r -s c:\users\glym\music\*.* /s /d</strong></p>
<p>4. Once the file attributes&nbsp;are cleaned up, make sure Media Player is closed.&nbsp; Click<strong>Start</strong> , Click<strong>Run</strong>, Copy and paste in:&nbsp;<strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong>, Click<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>5. Delete the <strong>'Media Player'</strong> folder completely.&nbsp; That gets rid of the database and the cached entries.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Restart Media Player . . .&nbsp; Bingo!</p>
<p>Thanks Microsoft for several useful Knowldege Base articles that I plagiarized here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I was having an issue like this. No new tv shows I was recording and adding to my videos folder would show on one pc, but showed fine on two others, all win 7 64bit home prem.</p>

How to obtain 64 bit Windows 8 installation files.</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>For Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 users</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free tool called CPU-Z</a>. You can download it here. Once you have it installed, double click it and it will scan your system. Click the CPU tab and look in the
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable.</p>
<p>If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application
 compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems. </p>
<p>Does your system meet all the requirements? Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are
 using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider upgrading and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.
</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows 8 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which should work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt
 try fixing it might just apply in this case. </p>
<p><strong>Backup, Backup, Backup</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 8 64 bit. Yes,
 that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.
</p>
<p>The best way to handle some of the migration chores is by using the built in Windows Easy Transfer utility (specifically) for Windows 7 users. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows XP, make sure you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the free Windows Easy Transfer utility</a>, install it and create a backup of your personal files and settings. Lets take a look at doing that.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d437%26amp%3bh%3d345%26amp%3bh%3d345" /></a>

</p>
<p>You have a few options to choose from, the best one would be an external hard disk which is excellent for storing large amounts of information. If you don‚Äôt have an external hard disk, you can save your backup to a network share if one is available.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d344%26amp%3bh%3d344" /></a>
</p>
<p>Select this is my old PC. </p>

</p>
<p>Wait while your personal files are scanned. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb8.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d344%26amp%3bh%3d344" /></a>
</p>
<p>Check off the accounts you would like to have backed up. </p>

</p>
<p>You can create a password if you want to protect your Windows Easy Transfer backup. If don‚Äôt want to, no problem skipping this step. Click Save.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb10.png%3fw%3d429%26amp%3bh%3d314%26amp%3bh%3d314" /></a>
</p>
<p>Open the external hard disk and save the file there, you can give a unique file name if you wish.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb11.png%3fw%3d427%26amp%3bh%3d337%26amp%3bh%3d337" /></a>
</p>
<p>Wait while your items are backed up and saved. This can take some time depending on the amount of information you have stored.
</p>
<p>Once your files are backed up, its time to start the migration.</p>
<p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d444%26amp%3bh%3d142" /></a></p>
<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>
<p><strong>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These type of issues may emerge when some of the Windows components gets corrupted. Let's resolve this by performing the steps given by Krishna Prasobh V on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/surface-pro-4-taskbar-not-appearing-after-sleep/75865a40-47bf-4c68-8751-c0ecf1b1803b">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, if you've created restore points when the Surface was working properly, you can do a system restore. Pick a date when the tablet was working fine as your restore point. Learn more about it
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. See steps under <strong>Restore from a system restore point.</strong></p>

<h2>            Trojan horse quarantine leads to &#34;Bad Image&#34; error messages</h2>
                    <p>Norton Security Suite recently detected and quarantined the following trojan horse from my Windows 7 laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">C:\ProgramData\{9A88E103-A20A-4EA5-8636-C73B709A5BF8}\ListSvc.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since then, Windows has been displaying the following warnings:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">SynTPEnh.exe - Bad Image<br />
C:\ProgramData\{9A88E103-A20A-4EA5-8636-C73B709A5BF8}\ListSvc.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor
 for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Different executables have displayed this warning, including: SynTPEnh.exe, notepad,exe, pcdrcui.exe, and pcdrsysinfosoftware.p5x.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently ListSvc.dll is a valid program that runs on startup. The registry provides the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Value name:<br />
@%SystemRoot%\System32\ListSvc.dll,-101</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Value data:<br />
Makes local computer changes associated with configuration and maintenance of the homegroup-joined computer. If this service is stopped or disabled, your computer will not work properly in a homegroup and your homegroup might not work properly. It is recommended
 that you keep this service running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea from where Norton quarantined ListSvc.dll, but other copies do exist on my laptop's hard drive. However, the system seems to be pointing to the trojan horse for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen all sorts of complicated responses to similar errors. What can I do about this that won't put my laptop or me out of commission for the next six months?</p>

            <p>Amit, I wound up fixing this issue myself as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted that the Norton Security History showed that Download Insight had analyzed C:\ProgramData\{9A88E103-A20A-4EA5-8636-C73B709A5BF8}\ListSvc.dll on 12/25/2014 and found it "Good".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then opened Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features and found that I had installed the following on that date:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realtec Ethernet Controller Driver For Windows 7</li><li>WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software</li></ul>
<p>I had installed them via Device Manager, not from any website downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also searched my hard drive for files modified on that date and found a BUNCH of game-related NVIDIA files under C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\NVIDIA\NvBackend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a couple issues with the NVIDIA drivers and reinstalled them a couple days later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then compared my personal laptop (where the issue exists) with my work laptop. I searched the registries on both laptops and determined the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>My work laptop's registry consistently pointed to %SystemRoot%\System32\ListSvc.dll.</li><li>Most of the relevant entries in my personal laptop's registry pointed to %SystemRoot%\System32\ListSvc.dll, but some of them pointed to C:\ProgramData\{9A88E103-A20A-4EA5-8636-C73B709A5BF8}\ListSvc.dll.</li></ul>
<p>I have no way of knowing whether anything I installed on 12/25/2014 also installed C:\ProgramData\{9A88E103-A20A-4EA5-8636-C73B709A5BF8}\ListSvc.dll and modified the registry to point there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have no idea why Norton did not raise an alarm until 02/03/2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I edited the suspect registry entries to point to %SystemRoot%\System32\ListSvc.dll and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so good, no error messages popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about re-reading all of this and asking yourself how effective you were slapping an ill thought,&nbsp;boiler-plate answer on me?</p>

<h2>            No operating system found Windows 7 ultimate.</h2>
                    Now I have solved one computer I still have my desktop, Windows 7 ultimate with the following message-if it ever gets to a post-"No operating system found.".&nbsp;The original hard drive is a 320gb SATA, The motherboard has numerious SATA ports but it also
 has an IDE. is it feasable to instal either another copy of Windows 7 or Windows XP Proff.an&nbsp;IDE hard drive,again preserving my files on the SATA one , getting it started whilst still searching for the solution to Windows 7 problem and will I be able to access
 the programs which are still&nbsp;on the SATA device. Welcome any ideas-and why has this happened in ythe first place,surely not another Microsoft issue!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Dave. ps (actually unsure whether is still has any security&nbsp;still installed,&nbsp;it could be a virus
 situation)&nbsp;?

            <p>&nbsp;Something has altered or deleted your boot files.&nbsp; Installing another copy of Windows 7 on a separate hard drive (IDE or SATA) or partition&nbsp;should get you going again.&nbsp; When you do get going, you should run chkdsk on that SATA drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

    <title>silverlight not working in browser - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            silverlight not working in browser</h2>
                    <p>Help! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Silverlight is not working on my computer. &nbsp;Works fine on my other systems. &nbsp;Basically, anywhere there is a Silverlight object, my system simply shows a blank white space in the browser... doesn't matter which browser I use. &nbsp;I've done as much troubleshooting
 and web searching as I can. &nbsp;Here's what I've discovered:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://bubblemark.com/silverlight2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bubblemark.com/silverlight2.html</a> -&nbsp;shows this error: Line: 60, Error: Unhandled Error in Silverlight 2 Application,&nbsp;Code: 1001,&nbsp;Category: RuntimeError,&nbsp;Message: 1001 An error
 has occurred. MethodName: (blank) &nbsp;If I look in the network tab of Internet Explorer's F12 tools shows the xap download as (Aborted).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/</a> - oddly enough and it reports it is correctly installed and the latest version (5.1.30514.0), so the browser plugin is not the problem.
 &nbsp;But the browser plugin just renders a blank space.<br />
<br />
I've tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- tinkering with compatibility view and F12 older browser emulation in Internet Explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;- clearing my browser cache<br />
&nbsp;- clearing Silverlight application storage<br />
&nbsp;- reinstalling my system's graphic drivers (Nvidia GeForce 310, updated to driver 340.52, the latest stable version available)<br />
&nbsp;- tinkering with the Silverlight "hardware acceleration" checkbox<br />
&nbsp;- tinkering with the IE's "Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering" (yes, I rebooted)<br />
&nbsp;- I've even done an "sfc /scannow" which comes up clear.<br />
&nbsp;- I found this KB and followed it too: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2608523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2608523</a> .. all to no avail.<br />
<br />
Any hints?? I'm all ears... :-)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows Updates - I always keep my system up to date. &nbsp;I have no pending updates. &nbsp;I tried using the video driver from Windows Update vs the driver from Nvidia (reboot after each install), but that did not help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Already tried this (shoulda listed it in my troubleshooting steps... I used DISM to successfully resolve sfc /scannow issues. &nbsp;I can now run "sfc /scannow" without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I tried creating a new user account. &nbsp;This is not a problem with a corrupt profile. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the same behavior as I always have. &nbsp;Thanks for trying though. &nbsp;If you have any other thoughts, please let me know...</p>

            Also, let me clarify: <strong>I am able to install. &nbsp;</strong>That has never been the issue. &nbsp;I can even bring up the Silverlight "control panel." &nbsp;I just can't view most embedded Silverlight content in the browser.
