<h2>            Install Outlook Office 365 on upgraded MacOs to Mojave 10.14.1</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded my Mac OS to the Mojave 10.14.1 and have been unable to access my office outlook. I purchased a later version of the 365 however I could not download to install although my product key was accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted a Mac support group who told me that I could not use Outlook until I had updated my security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I allowed the support group top remotely access my system to make it good. When they had finished they told me that all was good but I needed to install an updated version of my AVG or use one they recommended to enable Outlook to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems a bit fishy as surely security decisions are mine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to what sort of mess I have gotten myself into?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a fix if Outlook from Office 365 is on offer as an application to run under Mojave?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to some advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In anticipation... etc.</p>

<p>Hi Hugh Lester Mitchell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Office 365 is fully supported in Mojave with Office application version build 16.17.0 or later. For your reference, see the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/microsoft-office-support-for-macos-10-14-mojave-3593253c-95dc-4522-a8f7-8fb4fd16aff3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/microsoft-office-support-for-macos-10-14-mojave-3593253c-95dc-4522-a8f7-8fb4fd16aff3</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And since there might be conflicts between Office apps and antivirus software, it's a good idea to keep your software updated. Besides, if you haven't contacted Outlook for Mac in-app support team, you can try to get the further
 assistance from them via <strong>Help </strong>&gt; <strong>
Contact Support</strong>. The team focused on Outlook for Mac issues will provide dedicated suggestions for you. We kindly appreciate for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

                    <p>Finally after 2 hours of hunting the LETS HIDE IT SO NO-ONE'LL FIND IT "ASK A QUESTION" has finally been found.</p>
<p>Thanks a bundle Microsoft EPICALLY-FAILED-MY-DESIGN PHD kids &gt;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I getting the above error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only think of one possible reason but not sure how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently changed the (Microsoft) account that I use as I accidently made the wrong decision as I needed to disconnect my old account from an external email it was associated with, so I wrote it off as a lost cause and set up a new one (that I am using
 here/now). I assumed that everything associated with my old account would be updated to my new account but this has not been the case is my guess. As I seem to have access to everything else without any problems that I can detect (so far) it would appear that
 for the most part I am correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that the problem lies with my Office 2013 Home and Student edition but am not sure how I am supposed to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assist would be brilliant and appreciated greatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

</p><p>Sorry it took so long to respond. I worked all day yesterday into the wee hours of the night implementing your suggestions. I decided to work the bad CD drive angle first and clear the CMOS as a last resort. I pulled the CD drive out of my Win7 machine and
 put it into the XP machine. No joy; got the same error message. So then I decided to work the possibility that the BIOS was trying to boot from the blank drive on which I was going to install Win10. I unplugged the blank drive and rebooted. I didn't get the
 error message, but it booted into the WinXP drive. Well that was confusing, so I unplugged the WinXP drive and rebooted. This time I got a message saying something like "there are no bootable disk drives". Then I realized that all of the error messages that
 I have been getting&nbsp;related to the blank&nbsp;hard drive and not the DVD. And then I remembered a comment in another forum, ages ago, that a USB keyboard won't be recognized by the BIOS. Well, my keyboard is a PS/2 keyboard&nbsp;with a USB to PS/2 converter, but it
 had worked perfectly throughout the BIOS,&nbsp;EXCEPT for the "Press any key" dialog apparently, which was timeing out, sending the BIOS lurching around looking for a hard disk to boot from. I plugged the keyboard&nbsp;into the PS/2 port, and the DVD booted up perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone for the excellent suggestions.</p>

<h2>            microphone options not showing after connecting the mic</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I tried to connect the external microphone to my laptop. First it was showing the options as whether it was mic or headphone. After connecting the mic sound quality was not good, So uninstalled the audio drivers and after that I reinstalled the drivers.
 But later when I try to connect the mic it stopped popping the options. When I connect the external microphone and even headphone both are&nbsp; not working and no options showing on my window&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>please help me to fix this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            When you select that particular music are there any other option such as set as ringtone or when it is playing? Any music that could be played by your phone can be set as ringtone, but only the first 60secs more or less are played.<br />

            I had the same problem, I could NOT find a way to set a mp3 as a ringtone by directly loading the mp3 to the phone from my cpu. I was however able to set a mp3 as a ringtone by emailing it to my phone. For some reason, when you do this,the email message
 gives you the option to set the MP3 you just emailed yourself as a ringtone. You do have to pay data charges so be careful not to email a whole song to yourself. I used Audacity to clip out a 20 second piece of a song, save it as an MP3, then emailed it to
 me.

            There are two ways that I know of. One is to buy the cable so that you can plug your phone into your PC I think this options runs about $30.<br />
<br />
The second (which is what I did) is to buy the memory card (Micro SD. I bought a microSD/microSDHC card bundled with an ultra-compact USB reader (from tiger direct). I copied files to the SD card (onto the my music folder) from my PC then plugged the sd card
 into the 6205. Then you go to menu-vcast music-my music-my songs and they should appear there, and you can play them.<br />
<br />
This card is cool cause you can use it to transfer you pics from your phone to you cpu as well. Although the phone on this model is a bit weak.

            So I got a sd memory card and I can save stuff on it on the phone, but when i plug it into my computer it will let me save music on it but when I put it back into my phone the music doesn't show up at all. Just the song that I purchased over vcast to test
 my phone will. I don't know why, i'm transferring them with rhapsody so they should work. Please let me know what you do?

            I was WRONG! The only music under Vcast was the clips I had emailed to myself. I tried to get it to play songs from my card and I ran into the same problem. I am sorry to have told you wrong.<br />
<br />
There is a sync option under vcast but I think that requires the cable the want to sell you.

                    I prompted an updated to my Lumia 535 dual sim today and all went well till my phone rebooted itself. After the reboot it restarted 3 times and now seems like ultimately it's been stuck on the blue windows logo. Its been quite a while (an hour or so) but
 the blue windows logo is still there.&nbsp;

            <p>Simply select the items and drag and drop them from one folder to the other or use CTRL+SHIFT+V.</p>
<p>Folders can be moved in the same way of by right clicking on them and choosing Move Folder. This won't work for default folders such as the Inbox folder or Sent Items folder though. For that, you need to move the individual items (use CTRL+A to select all
 the mail items in a specific folder).</p>

            <p>Hi Walt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You for choosing Microsoft Community. I will assist you in providing steps to transfer the contacts in Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Contacts folder which is for the old e-mail account.<br />
2. Go to <b>View</b> tab -&gt; Click on the drop down below <b>Chang View</b> -&gt; Click on
<b>List view</b>.<br />
3. Highlight a contact in the list view -&gt; Select all by holding <b>Ctrl+A<br />
</b>4. Right click on the highlighted contact list -&gt; click on <b>Move</b> -&gt;
<b>Copy to folder.</b><br />
5. Scroll up the list and select the Contact folder which is set for the new e-mail account -&gt; Click
<b>OK</b>.</p>

            What account types are you using?&nbsp; Do not confuse Outlook data files (folder sets) with accounts.&nbsp; The two are only marginally related.&nbsp; You can have many accounts of certain types while having only one set of folders.&nbsp; Some account types require their
 own folders sets, but will not have any contacts or calendar folders in those folder sets.&nbsp; Give us details on ho you have confgured your accounts in Outlook for the best advice.

<h2>            Emoticons in Outlook at work on Mac, not emojis</h2>
                    Thank you for your help. I work at home on a Mac. My work uses Outlook. I somehow changed all emoticons to emojis even when I am in Outlook via Safari on my Mac. I use gmail for personal email and the mail app for my Mac that has the emoji menu. How do
 I get emoticons back for work email? I believe I did a keyboard switch but cannot seem to undo it. I would really like to know how to flip to either emoticon or emoji. Seems silly, I know, but very expressive. I like the emoticons better for work, if you will,
 they are "crisper" and seem more professional.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Outlook 2011 for Mac has no an option of "Emoticons" but it has only "emojis". &nbsp;Which you can read&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-for-Outlook-for-Mac-07ae68c8-b7af-4010-b225-324c04ac7335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-for-Outlook-for-Mac-07ae68c8-b7af-4010-b225-324c04ac7335</a>&nbsp;(you
 can filter jey word "emo" to find it only states "emoji" but no "emoticon".&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Greetings Brooke!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!<br />
<br />
Could you please provide the verbage used in the error?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, when posting your questions/issues related to Windows Phone please&nbsp;include the following baseline information.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Phone Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Check!)<br />
2. Phone Model&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Check!)<br />
3. Mobile Operator<br />
4. Phone Operating System version<br />
5. Zune software version<br />
6. Computer Operating System version<br />
7. Fix-It solutions applied already<br />
<br />
Regardless of the above, a good set of steps to try is before you try anything else is to restart your PC and Lumia 900 to ensure they have a fresh operating session going, then retry...</p>

            <p>Hi David</p>
<p>My phone has the same trouble and I feel very bad on that. Information about my phone is listed as you required.</p>
<p>1. Nokia</p>
<p>2. Lumia 900</p>
<p>3. MCC</p>
<p>4. WP 7.5</p>
<p>5. zune 4.8.2345.0</p>
<p>6. windows 7 64 bits</p>
<p>7. already tried fix-it tools and no breakthrough for this problem.</p>
<p>Before Zune worked well with my phone but now I can't connect the phone. </p>
<p>When I plug in the micro usb cable, the power charging will start and I can hear the sound for connection. The charging icon will appear on the top of the phone.
</p>
<p>I tried to fix with the tools provided by others but no effect. </p>
<p>I'd address that i cann't find " zune-tuner://windowsphone/ " as discribed in <a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/troubleshooting/?action=singleFAQ&amp;caseid=MS894_en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/troubleshooting/?action=singleFAQ&amp;caseid=MS894_en_US</a></p>
<p>I also tried to connect the lumia 900 with my macbook pro via the software of windows phone connector from the official website but still failt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel crazy for this problem and it stop me to update the software also. Very bad preformance for Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think lots of people have this problem but I didn't see the the right solution till now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you can help me, David, thanks.</p>

            Hi&nbsp;BrookeFlowers &amp;&nbsp;XFANDREW,
<div><br />
<div>I've seen similar issues before. Here's a few things to try which has resolved the syncing issue for me on several occasions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>If at all possible, insure you are using the OEM cable received from Nokia with your phone. Sometimes secondhand cables are problematic.</li><li>First, try restarting your by pressing and holding the power button for 10-12 seconds. Do not release the power button until you see the 1st&nbsp;splash&nbsp;screen after it reboots. Now see if it will work. This will let your hardware, as well as your software,
 reset.</li><li>Next, turn off your computer and unplug it from the wall for 10-20 seconds. Replug and boot up. See if it works now. This will allow the computers hardware (like the USB port) to reset.</li><li>If still not working, move the USB sync cable to a different USB port on your computer. Wait 2-3 minutes to see if your computer detects a new device and loads new drivers. Try this with each USB port on the computer until one works.</li><li>If all else fails, I would suggest this excellent&nbsp;<a href="http://ambassadors.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-live/troubleshoot/wp-sync-devices-wizard.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Phone "can't Sync" Wizard</a>&nbsp;to perform additional troubleshooting and/or fixes.</li></ol>
<div><br />
I hope this helps!<br />
David</div>

            <p>I'm not familiar with the Apple eco-system, so I can't say what plugging into your Mac definitely proved or not, but if I compare to a PC, you're having the same problem on different computers, so the most likely cause is the phone itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I understand this next request is highly unlikely, but worth talking about: Do you have another Lumia 900 that you could plug into the PC or Mac?&nbsp; Or could you take the PC or Mac (if laptops) to a retail store to see if you could plug in one of their floor
 models?&nbsp; &nbsp;If you could plug in another Lumia 900 and it works, then I would say that is proof that the Lumia you are having problems with may need to be Hard Reset, or maybe even returned for an exchange or replacement unit.</p>
<p>Let us know!</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good logic and your analysis is nice. But basicly, I am a common user of Nokia Lumia phone (so called flagship model) and also of windows wp 7.5 system.&nbsp; The reason of using this phone with wp 7.5 system is for a better utilization experience and wonderful
 applications. I am not&nbsp;sponsored by Nokia or Microsoft and I just can get what I have on hand to try to fix bug(s) if there are some both from the phone itself or wp system or between wp&nbsp;and pc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two computers (windows 7 system and mac system) so I tried, and I don't want to get another lumia or 64 bit windows system pc from others to do this test. I am already very disappointed for my story. So till now, I can't get any result to share with
 you for this. Sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before this trouble, I have another trouble for power- charging issue for my phone (luckly it is fixed). The smart battery protecton technology made me crazy after I drained 100% power off and it turned off automaticlly. The phone tried to turn on when it
 got little power after charging. But it turned off again soon for the power&nbsp;went off due to switching on operation. The phone can't switch on and no power can be charged further, very simple but stupid logic. My phone can go into this deadly circle for a whole
 day charging with no power at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After many times trying, I followed procedure of </p>
<p>1. pushing&nbsp;power button till the screen going white, </p>
<p>2. then pushing photo shooting button till the pc connection image appearing.</p>
<p>3. then charging by pc to power on/ charging by power plug to power on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works and I did this for several times. Now, I avoid to drain off all the power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I think, maybe this procedure lead to some setting of USB connection for I just did this before my trouble coming out.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David, or someone else, can you give me a comment on this?</p>

            <p>David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your steps but no change. The windows phone "cn't sync" wizard told me "not fixed".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the cable line, I took the line from the package box with my phone sealed by original stick. Sure, also, I tried other lines, the same result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope maybe wp 7.8 update will make things better before, but it needs zune to do update via usb cable connection. Also wireless sync needs usb connection at the first time to do setting!!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So bad and I feel really really bad. Why Nokia and Microsoft made such a design???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think Brookflowers wold have the same feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever, thanks again, David, and hope we can see successful fix.</p>

            I did the same thing and its still not fixed as well. I feel like I've wasted a bunch of money on a phone that can't even perform one of its key features...this is ridiculous.

<p>Hi Davia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Visio Online, files can't be saved or exported as PDF file. Thanks for your understanding. You may vote

If we download the Visio file and open it with the Visio client, we can exported as a PDF file.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Music is not playing via Bluetooth, &#38; is using mobile speaker, why &#63;</h2>
                    <div><span>Hi,</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>I am able to pair Samsung HM1100 to my new Nokia 720 RED.<br />
Please refer to <br />
<a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/mobile-phone/mobile-phone/mobile-phone-accessories/BHM1100NBEGINU?subsubtype=mono-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/in/consumer/mobile-phone/mobile-phone/mobile-phone-accessories/BHM1100NBEGINU?subsubtype=mono-bluetooth</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp;I am able to attend calls, including Skype calls via this Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nokia music is not playing via Bluetooth, &amp; is using the mobile speaker in Nokia Lumia 720, why ?<br />
<br />
The point here is, I am not able to listen via Bluetooth not only in Nokia Music, But also in any Music Applications that are available in Market Store.&nbsp;
<br />
Inablility to listen to music via Bluetooth,&nbsp; is extended to Youtube videos, or for that matter any Videos in Nokia Lumia 720.<br />
I suggest, if you could help me with any application, similar to BTMONO in Android OS, that allows/enables to listen music via Bluetooth.<br />

<p>
</p><p>In the last few weeks multiple users have been getting the&nbsp;"Can't find Project or library" error message with multiple different spreadsheets.&nbsp; When I try to open the VBA window it just hangs and does nothing.&nbsp; If I close the window and reopen it it's blank.&nbsp;
 I click on Tools --&gt; References and the usual window with available references does not appear (in fact clicking on References does nothing).&nbsp; The workaround has been to restore to a previous version.&nbsp; According to our IT department we haven't had a windows
 update since this started happening.&nbsp; Users are running the same version. Is anyone having this same issue or know why it's happening?</p>

    <title>Creating a rule for sent messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nigel blanchard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a rule for sent messages</h2>
                    &nbsp;I understand that I have two options for sorting out “sent messages" and that is to either push the manually into the required subdirectories under “inbox" or alternatively create a rule. I have looked on the help site for creating rules but it applies
 for messages received otherwise I think it would imply that I would need to create a custom rule in Outlook.<br />
<br />
I don't suppose anybody can give me some assistance. What I would like to happen if it is feasible is either to create an automatic rule which takes the “sent e-mail" according to the subject line and places this in the relevant subdirectory under inbox. At
 present e-mails received in my inbox have to be manually moved but at least there is the “move" facility which makes life slightly easier. In other words once I have replied to a message use the move button to place the original message into my “subdirectory
 for the relevant subject/project/job under “inbox". The actual e-mail generally that I have sent or created if it is not in response simply goes into the sent box and I would like to create a rule that either takes a copy of the sent mail and pushes it into
 the relevant subdirectory alternatively pushes the original from sent directly into the relevant subject subdirectory if that makes sense?<br />

            From the "Tools" menu, the Ribbon or the Preferences, open the "Rules" pane. There, on the left, you'll see different tabs: at bottom you'll find "Outgoing". If you clic on it, you'll be able to create Outgoing rules according to your needs.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>I do not think this is an actual Outlook problem. I did however find this Microsoft article:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500306" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2500306</a></p>
<p>But you mention that you already tried setting the message to always allow.</p>
<p>What kind of email account is setup? Not sure it matters, but since you get it when trying to get emails, it might be worth removing the account and re-adding it (overwriting the username/password in the keychain - just go in there and delete the info manually
 and re-add into Outlook making sure it is saved to Keychain).</p>
<p>I did find an older <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3063713?start=0&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apple forum discussion</a> on the same error, you might check it for some others solutions/ideas.</p>
<p>I did find another older thread that was about Entourage and that same error. The following is copied from it about doing a Keychain Firstaid:</p>
<p>Run Keychain FirstAid:<br />
<br />
Open Keychain Access located in Applications/Utilities, then choose Keychain<br />
Access &gt; Keychain First Aid.<br />
Enter your user name and password.<br />
Select, Verify and click Start.<br />
Any problems found will be displayed.<br />
If there are problems, select Repair and then click Start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully some of that helps.</p>
<p>Thanks...<br />

<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the outlook app but badges are not showing up when I get new mail which makes it kind of useless. I have checked notification settings and turned off focused inbox and reainstalled app. Any chance of it getting fixed?</p>

<h2>            Predecessor lag time not calculating months correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used Project a few years back and I'm just getting reacquanted with it, so please bear with me on this one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a project that runs for 5 years and I have specific tasks that need to occur on anniversary dates yearly. From those annual tasks a number of predecssor tasks need to occur a couple of months prior. The issue I'm having it that the predecessor calculation
 for a start to finish dependancy + 6 months is not calculating the date correctly. Essentially I just want it to schedule the task 6 months to the day from the completion of the dependant task, essentially ignoring whether it is a work day or not.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Project is not very sophisticated when you use the term "month"</p>
<p>A "month" when shown in duration is simply the number of working days shown in the Calendar options (default is 20) regardless of the "real" month</p>
<p>When you don't care about working days you can use "emonths" which calculate in calendar days but again, a fixed number of days (default is 30)</p>
<p>Conclusion: you are absolutely right, month is not the appropriate unit for you. I would use 26 eweeks - you then might be wrong one or two days but that may be close enough I hope.
</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
        </p>

    <title>How do I get Outlook for Mac 2011 to display the email address to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyblb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Outlook for Mac 2011 to display the email address to which my contacts are sending me emails&#63;</h2>
                    I have multiple email addresses associated with my outlook for Mac account and when I receive an email from someone there is no way for me to know which email address they've sent it to. The "To" display is just my generic contact name. When I click on
 the contact card it shows every single email address I have associated with my contact card and doesn't distinguish which email account they contacted me through. I'm receiving spam now too, all of a sudden, and would like to eliminate the email address that
 has become the problem but can't do that without being able to see that email address displayed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise on how I can change my display to indicate the email address they sent to rather than my generic contact name. I'm using Outlook for Mac 2011, v 14.3.2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks...</div>

            It’s tricky and it’s inconvenient but it’s there.
<div><br />
<div>Hover over the sender's name in the header of the message and then hover over the name of the sender in the contact information balloon that appears. The yellow tooltip will show you the email address.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also:</div>
<div><br />
