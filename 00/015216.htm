<h2>            Latest  Build not working as should.</h2>
                    <p>Well last night i looked for the download of the latest Build 10240 and was asked to sign-in to my M.S. account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning the Build was installed, BUT i cannot enter SETTINGS (or PC SETTINGS), so cannot enter Windows UPDATE either and PEOPLE or NEWS etc. nothing can be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never had that before, cannot sign-off from my MS account.....to get back to my local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when sign-off and sign-in with a second account, all is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that account is only for emergency problems, if ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeff</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What happens when you click Settings? Is it greyed out? Do you get any error message?
</p>
<p>2. What happens when you try to sign off from Microsoft Account? </p>
<p>3. Is the account which is not working a administrator account? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply to the questions in order to assist you in a better way. </p>

            This is much more complex than it appears, because you have to work with the individual parts of the date.
<div><br />
<div>It is MUCH simpler to do this in Excel and embed the Excel cells in your document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you insist on doing it in Word, MVP Graham Mayor has the code here:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.gmayor.com/insert_a_date_other_than_today.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/insert_a_date_other_than_today.htm</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>If you really wish to know how it works, download the DateCalc.zip tutorial from MVP Paul Edstein, here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/downloads.htm</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Calculating an age is similarly a chore, because again you have to devolve the date into a number, then subtract it from today's date as a number, then re-express it as a date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, doing it in Excel is easy, and embedding a little bit of Excel in your document is a copy and paste...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<p>Hi Jenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, we will have to wait until the Excel app has the option to change the text orientation of a cell, just like the Excel desktop app. This is an excellent idea that would definitely be a great addition to the Excel app. We encourage to to
 submit it to our <a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304936-excel-for-ipad-iphone-ios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Excel UserVoice forums</a>, so that our developers can see it and consider adding it in future updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns about Excel.</p>

<h2>            Meeting Invites - When someone responds to my meeting invite &#40;accept&#47;decline&#41; the response in my Inbox shows as From my own email, instead of the person responding</h2>
                    
<p>I have scheduled meetings in my Outlook Calendar, and sent the invite to several attendees.&nbsp; However, when they respond to my meeting invite, and their response is sent back to me, the "From" field in my Inbox shows my own email address, rather than the
 email address of the person responding.&nbsp; Therefore, I can't tell who is responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at the meeting invite&nbsp;(under Tracking), I see the list of attendees to whom I sent the invite, but they all appear as not responded.</p>
<p>If anyone could offer assistance why this is happening, and how to fix, that'd be much appreciated!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

No, its not how outlook works. The meeting response should be from the person responding.</p>

<h2>            My main e-mail is an old bellsouth.net account which is user ID for Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Research up to now has revealed following, I am aware that many linked account are being disabled in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>My bellsouth.net POP3 email address is used as my id for Microsoft Account, but I have a different password on Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>Received message when checking setting on email that the bellsouth.net address password was incorrect on link to email. Outlook.com keeps rejecting change when I try to correct and save. This problem only affects incoming mail on bellsouth.net account which
 is main email address.</p>
<p>Outlook list the bellsouth.net account as an alias but I believe it was set up as linked account. bellsouth,net account used as Microsoft Account Id say it can receive and send but as that has different password it is not retrieving my email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Microsoft Account was opened bellsouth.net address and yahoo,com password was used to divert mail to Microsoft Servers. This address is also what is called a legacy account address and is supported on non ATT servers unless supported by yahoo.&nbsp; Is it
 possible with all the changes being made that Outlook is try to import that email using Microsoft Account password?&nbsp; What is best way to restore service and maintain access to the bellsouth.net account using Outlook.com as email service?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this is enough info</p>

</p><p>Since I work in an IT department with ready access to spare Macs, I grabbed one, wiped the hard drive, and did a fresh install of OS X 10.11.4 and Office 2016 15.21.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Text replacement worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran Microsoft AutoUpdate, and updated to 15.22.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Text replacement no longer worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone discovered a workaround? &nbsp;I've taken to writing all my emails in TextEdit, then copying them into a new Outlook message, but that's hardly convenient.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes - exactly - you can only role back, when you export and then import your e-mail archive!<br />
That's a too big cannon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the moment, I got TextExpander working for me - but this is a monthly subscription model.&nbsp;<br />
I got a yearly one with the latest Parallels upgrade bundle - which was pretty cheap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But - to be honest could not be sooooooooooo difficult to fix it!</p>
<p>Come on MS - do you job or revert to the old editor which we all been happy enough with! ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Markus.</p>

            By change-log you mean a list of the changes made in the firmware, I assume?<br />
<br />
If so you're fresh out of luck: Nokia do not release this information.<br />
<br />
No, I don't know why not either. Makes zero sense to everybody except some jobsworth in Nokia. Probably some jobsworth in the legal department.<br />
<br />
Best you can hope for is that, as the more technically able types install it, they post something about what it appears to have fixed somewhere on t'interweb.

            yeah, thats exactly what I mean... the list of changes fot the new firware... I was under the impression that the changelogs WERE avaialable... as Ive seen them floating around on the net before... but you could be right... they are ones written by people
 that arent Nokia employees.<br />
<br />
So, I'll keep looking. Im assuming that the .7 version is more a bug fix than anything outstanding.... and at the moment Im not having any probs with my version.

<p><span>Thank you for asking. As I understand the shortcut to enter current date do not work whereas the shortcuts to copy and paste work fine.
 Before starting the troubleshooting steps just a quick question:</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using a laptop or a desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Turn on the on-screen keyboard and check if you are able to enter the current date by using the shortcut:</span></p>
<p><span>Click on
<b>Start</b>&lt; in the search bar type <b>On</b>-<b>Screen</b>
<b>Keyboard</b> and select the onscreen keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the on screen keyboard is open, type using the on screen keyboard and check if you are able to able to use the shortcut to enter
 the current date (ctrl+;)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also check if the other shortcuts work fine:</span></p>

<h2>            E7 SMS character count bug</h2>
                    
<p>belle introduced, amongst painful others, an SMS character count bug, where, when you type an SMS with the hardware keyboard, the SMS character count is not displayed. it is displayed only when you type using the onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently e7 received a calendar fix. any idea whether the SMS character count bug fix has been issued?</p>

<p><span>Have you tried to re-install the software of your devices using Nokia Suite? If not yet, maybe worth trying. Go to

<p>Hi emilygreen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have. In fact I have tried several methods of hard reset, soft reset as well as re-install using Nokia Suite from PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem Not Solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually this bug is mentioned in the known issues list long back in&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/4E956231-5272-4D51-8FEF-562AA90BB2C0">http://discussions.nokia.com/t5/Software-Updates/Nokia-Belle-Refresh-FAQ-Please-read-before-posting/m-p/1539052#M120879</a>
 by Kosh on 31-08-2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No update on that yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would appreciate if this bug is resolved ASAP.</p>

            <p>What application or process is eating that CPU time? Look through the list of processes on the [Processes] tab - be sure you choose Processes from all users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose you could start with a REPAIR installation of Office 2010:&nbsp; Find it in the Control Panel, Programs and Features, highlight it and choose "CHANGE".&nbsp; That will start the installation dialog for office, and I believe the 2nd option in the list is
 a Repair of Office.</p>

    <title>Connection issues with Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jzwaan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection issues with Skype</h2>
                    <p>Goodday,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've been experiencing problems with Skype. Some people are able to reach us on our linked phone number, others are instantly getting error messages (number not in use, number doesn't exist). The error message also varies, which is strange. We are however
 able to call other people. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems have persisted for about a week now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other problems we have are not being able to call with our number displayed (hidden number), and we can't record our own voicemail message. But I believe that's because that function isn't activated for the Netherlands (and a Dutch phone number).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the most pressing issue is the connection which isn't really functioning properly. We're simply not reachable for a lot of people. We have a subscription (120 minutes a month) and we automatically get extra credit when we pass our subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this can be solved for our skype account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, looking forward to a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>J. Zwaan</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have an email list of approximately 350 men in my church that I need to send emails to. Never had a problem with Outlook 2007. Now with Outlook 2013 I can't even create an email address group and I appear to be limited to the number I can send any one
 day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to divide the group into 3 smaller groups and create an email template with Bc filled in and then send the emails out over a three day period.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to ask if this is progress, better or an upgrade to system capability. The answer is NO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a plan to allow email groups in Outlook 2013?&nbsp; Can the limit of emails sent per day be adjusted?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Searching for calendar wizard substitute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parrothead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching for calendar wizard substitute</h2>
                    
<p>Publisher 2003 had a great calendar wizard feature that we used to create calendars for our organization. The great thing about the wizard was that it made it really easy to update the calendars in the future--just change the year, and the wizard would update
 the month(s) automatically without them losing their formatting.</p>
<p>This feature went away in Publisher 2007, and Publisher 2010 doesn't seem to have it, either. Or am I just looking in the wrong place?</p>

<p>From the Ribbon, Page Design, Change Template, type Calendar in the search. All the options are on the right after you select the template. If you need to edit the calendar, click Change Template again, the calendar with its options will re-open. 2007 was
 about the same. The Change Template was on the Task Pane.</p>
<p>You need to tell Publisher to create a new calendar using your text and graphics.</p>

<p>I'm afraid this isn't what I'm looking for. This might work if my file consisted of one calendar, but it doesn't. What I have is a page with 12 small calendars on it--one for each month, each one designed with the calendar wizard in Publisher 2003.</p>
<p>With Publisher 2003, I could edit each of the 12 small calendars to change the year, and Publisher would automatically do the rest. I don't see a way to do this with 2007 or 2010.</p>

<p>Are you sure you aren't asking about a Design Gallery element? You could change each calendar month&nbsp;with the wizard. This option was not available in 2007 or 2010.</p>
<p>You can use the calendars on the Insert tab in 2010, there are different options. You can resize, change the font. But it is all manually done, the only automatic calendars are the templates.</p>

    <title>Mail merge with different length letters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinam81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail merge with different length letters</h2>
                    Doing a large mail merge of letters. Depending on the number of products someone has, the letter can stretch out to two pages. Trying to figure out how when it's printing I can make sure the letters that do have multiple pages, the 2nd page prints on blank
 paper not letterhead. This might be a print question or is there a way to sort the single pages from the multiple? We don't really know&nbsp;what will end up being 2 pages until we complete the merge and we are talking thousands of letters.

<p>For N97 users it just came up the V22 for N97 (unbranded) RM-505</p>
<p>Sow if you have one go and update!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IMPORTANT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the nokia website when i heck it don't appears,not even after i connect my phone to pc via SW update program</p>
<p>It only detects(untill now) after you go and tap *#0000# on the phone go to "options" and "check for updates" only then it pop up a window and tell that V22 is available and then download.</p>
<p>That was in my case maybe for you is available (check first the old methods)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excellent Suggestion Dave.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have so many tools from many years of doing this; what tool do you recommend&nbsp;for backup,&nbsp;and how would you use the backup to recover the install, or do you mean to&nbsp;grab files as needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a good article on how to create a ISO from the files Windows Update downloads for the upgrade...
<a href="https://thewincentral.com/how-to-create-convert-windows-10-iso-from-esd-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://thewincentral.com/how-to-create-convert-windows-10-iso-from-esd-files/</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to do this before you restart the machine or the files will be gone...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a imaging tool that will create an image of everything related to your OS, but doesn't work on UEFI machines...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet would be a 3rd party bootable imaging tool... I personally use Acronis TrueImage, but Macrium Reflect and Aomei are two free versions... I think Easeus also has a free one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The retail boxed version of Acronis comes on a bootable CD... It is on special a lot.</p>
<p>I got mine free after rebate..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the free ones need to be installed to create the bootable media (usually), but bootable media created by someone else and made available for download may also exist...</p>

<p>I seem to have a corrupted install of 17074,&nbsp; I need to search for what the problem was that prevented mounting the ISO as a download.&nbsp; I fear this is leaving me with no choices...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just read about the new update method, which makes sense, but certainly complicates my ability to DISM&nbsp; &nbsp;SFC the build back into working order.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am not even sure how to go about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to create a VM add it to the preview program and update, HOPEFULLY to this build, stop the process after the files are downloaded, to create an ISO.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to know the problem with it before continuing with any of this, but if it is possible
 - then what?&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried to run some mock tests with DISM and it can't be run from PE.&nbsp; I would have to mount the image, but the image is my broken install..&nbsp; Maybe I am making this too complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some direction or maybe encouragement since so much has changed over the last few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no VM needed... A virtual CD\DVD drive might be helpful though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I mentioned previously are specifically to create a ISO from the downloaded Windows Update UUP Files... That is the only way to get a current ISO, other than to download one from a 3rd party source...</p>
<p>And it needs to be done before you Restart the machine after the download from Windows Update completes... Otherwise they will be deleted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment the latest one available from Microsoft is 17025 at this link..</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the DISM commands should be available from within windows, but some require files from the installation media... For cases like that I mount the ISO to a Virtual CD\DVD drive and direct the DISM Process to that... The steps to do that vary by what
 you are trying to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a for instance... to use DISM to add .Network 3.5... I would do this...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /All /Source:D:\sources\sxs /LimitAccess</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change D: to drive installation media is on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are basically running into one of the problems with preview builds... If you were using a RTM version, a ISO would be available... You wouldn't be hindered by the UUP to ISO process and it's drawbacks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the best I can do for a 17074.1002 ISO at the moment... It should be available through the Insider Updates site, but never made it due to some of the issues you have noticed...

<p>hi support. &nbsp;for what it's worth, i'm wondering if the issue that we're experiencing is related to the lack of sharing options visible in the office 365 sharepoint admin centre. &nbsp;on the left is a screenshot from the onedrive for business blog &amp; on the right
 is a screenshot from our office 365 admin console. &nbsp;the "external sharing" link is not visible on our instance.</p>
<p>thanks - sam.</p>

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>The issue we are experiencing is not related to the lack of Sharing options visible in the Office 365 SharePoint admin center. And our team are still working on this issue to fix it.
<br />
<br />
About the new<strong> external sharing</strong> options in the SharePoint admin center, it will be rolled out in the coming weeks, you may continue following up on the blogs for the latest updates. For more details about this new feature, please refer to this

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview is much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
I understand that you are unable to update latest build 10158. </div>
<div>Before going to troubleshooting methods, please make sure that you have enough space on computer to download latest build.
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Verify that BITS is correctly configured.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong> (BITS) transfers files (downloads or uploads) between a client and server and provides progress information related to the transfers.
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>&nbsp; BITS is most commonly used by Windows to download updates to your local system.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
To verify that BITS is correctly configured and then start BITS, follow these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>services</strong>.<strong>msc</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click <strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the Startup type box, click <strong>Manual</strong>, and then click <strong>
Apply</strong>.<br />
5.&nbsp;Click the General tab, and then click <strong>Start</strong>. </div>
<div>
<p>If BITS starts successfully, run Windows Update or Microsoft Update to obtain updates. If you successfully obtain updates, follow steps 1 to 3 again. However, in step 3, click
<strong>Automatic </strong>instead of <strong>Manual</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>Check the Proxy setting.</p>
<div>
<p>a) Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on Tools icon option on the top right corner.<br />
c) Select <strong>Internet Option </strong>from the list.<br />
d) Click on <strong>Connection</strong> tab.<br />
e) Click on <strong>LAN Settings</strong>.<br />
f) Uncheck the box <strong>Use a Proxy Server for your LAN</strong>.<br />
g) Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>Login using clean boot and try to update the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “How to perform a clean boot” and follow
 the instructions for “Windows 8.1 and Windows 8” from this link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8” given in the section<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong> from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><strong>Important</strong>: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after
 clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span>

            I tried the same thing and tried reinstalling at least 4 times now, once after having uninstalled kb3070677 to no avail.

            <p>Tried uninstalling KB 3070677 multiple times to no avail. Each time after I uninstall it, Windows Update picks it up again and installs it. After that there is still no sign of b10158.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried resetting Windows several times as well(each time without preserving any of my settings or data). Even a clean install doesn't seem to help.</p>
