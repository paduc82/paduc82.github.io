<h2>            windows 10 error Microsoft Windows update Client error id 20 failed to install</h2>
                    this error happens every morning and it logs it at least four times in event viewer, but if I check Windows update manually it states it's is up to date and if I check installed Windows updates it shows no install failures, not sure why this error started
 all of a sudden ??????????????????????????, I think this is the result of a Windows 10 update because this is a recent problem that appeared after some recent Windows 10 updates.

                    <p>I have 6 family members with computers...I upgraded&nbsp;<strong>ALL 6 &nbsp;computers.</strong>....</p>
<p>Only mine has the shut down problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion "NEW" computer with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>I upgraded &nbsp;to Windows 10 and love it, except for the ONE Problem....</p>
<p>It will not shut down. I go to shut down, it appears to shut down with a</p>
<p>blank screen.....but the power button remains lit. &nbsp;The ONLY way to&nbsp;</p>
<p>fully shut down is to press the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent countless hours looking and trying various suggestions</p>
<p>from this Microsoft Community......and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that Microsoft is aware of this problem and have not</p>
<p>found a fix, or update to fix, or have not employed someone to develop</p>
<p>a fix before we all return to Windows 8.1 !!</p>

</p><blockquote>I was able to install driver version 10 (10.0.30.1054) of theIME Interface and then checked the driver version as you outlined and confirmed the change. I set the fast startup to ON (enabled) and then shut down and it worked!
 The restart worked as it should too. Thanks for all your help. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>You're welcome. On the other hand, in hindsight I had forgotten to check IME version 10's (for Win 7/8.1) ability to turn the display off and time out. I fell asleep not long after I wrote my last post and woke up, only to find my laptop still running. :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Intel Management Engine driver was the only thing I had been messing with recently, I rolled back to version
<strong><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/23276/Intel-ME-Management-Engine-Driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Most stable version for Windows 10">9.5.14.724</a></strong>, which was already in my laptop. All's fine now and the computer
 goes into sleep mode (timed out) and turns off the display as it should. I guess IME version 10 isn't stable either for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check your computer's sleep/screen time out issues (not forced sleep via pressing keyboard buttons or the Power Off menu) and confirm whether your device display turns off after 1 minute. If it doesn't, overwrite the Intel ME driver to any driver
 below version 10 (version 11 is <em>even worse</em> still).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this juncture there's a good possibility that Windows 10 doesn't play nicely with IME driver version 10, which is oddly meant for Windows OSes earlier than Windows 10. I have another Asus laptop running Windows 8.1 (and prefer to keep it that way for
 obvious reasons) and will test Intel ME version 10 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all is well with my second notebook (installed with IME version 10 on Win 8.1), then I would probably put the blame on Microsoft instead of Intel for Win 10's sleep/shutdown/hibernation issues. In this matter, despite what the Microsoft Support Engineers
 tell you to update to the <em>latest drivers</em>, it's not always the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ironically, the word is that the advice to downgrade the IME driver to version 9 originally did NOT come from a Microsoft Support Engineer (MSE) in this community, but from a group of Win 10 HP Pavilion notebook users who discovered that Intel ME drivers
 version 9.x worked best. This temporary solution spread through this Microsoft Community and I think that's how Mary AnnCourville (the OP of this thread) also found out about it, just like I did. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>MSEs seem to like resorting to copy &amp; paste standard, canned responses to every new Windows 10 related problem topic and I wonder if they ever bothered to try finding solutions by themselves.

            <p>Dear JustSomeAtoms</p>
<p>Do you really think, that only because a file has the same name like an original Windows System file, it is safe?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is an original Windows system file, why is it then not already in the whitelist of the Windows Firewall? That is&nbsp;suspicious for me. Therefore I would not say that it can be allowed without any further thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I'm also not a security expert, I would say we need the advice of a so called.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

<h2>            Lost Sent Emails in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I have WLM at work. All of a sudden only recently sent emails are in my sent folder. All of my others are gone and I am going to be in a world of trouble as these are VERY important emails. &nbsp;However, I went to Start, Search and put in WLM and some mail
 was there. &nbsp;I don't understand where my old emails are or why they are no long in the Sent folder. &nbsp;Does anyone have a clue how to fix this. &nbsp;It is an IMAP account.

    <title>My new computer started showing blinking windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guggas  say:</h3>
<h2>            My new computer started showing blinking windows</h2>
                    My new computer, assembled, running windows 7 professional 64, today started showing "blinking windows" (the title bar and the border of the active window seems to change from active to inactive for a second every five seconds or so). For the time that
 the window seems inactive it's impossible to write, modify, etc in the window. The same happens in the windows menu or any other menu, if i take more than four seconds to select something the menu disappears.<br />
This completly makes my computer unusable.<br />
Yesterday it was working fine. No programs were installed or other modifications were made in the meantime.<br />
Anyone has a clue? Help please!

<p>Hi guggas,</p>
<p>First, I suggest you to download and install the latest updated drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Method 2: Perform a Clean boot and check.</p>
<p>Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click StartCollapse this imageExpand this image, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.Collapse this imageExpand this image If you are prompted for an administrator password or for
 confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</p>
<p>Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do
 this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>Note: Reset the computer to start as usual</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click StartCollapse this imageExpand this image, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.Collapse this imageExpand this imageIf you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
 Continue.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Method 3: Perform a System Restore if the above methods do not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore</p>
<p>1) Before we start, please close all open files and close all open programs.</p>
<p>2) Click Start; click All Programs; click Accessories; click System Tools; and click System Restore. The System Restore user interface should appear.</p>
<p>3) Click Next.</p>
<p>4) From the restore points available, select an appropriate restore point before problem occurs and click Next.</p>
<p>5) Click Next again. The restore process will run and your system will restart automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your answer. It was very helpfull.<br />
However, the problem is recurrent but intermittent, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. I'm still trying to find if there is a program causing this effect.<br />

Thanks in advance,<br />

<p>Hi Christopher,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the time zone settings is one of the possible reasons why you are having an error code, 0xc0000142, when opening a program. To change the time zone on your computer, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Settings </strong>app, and click on the <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> icon.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>, and turn off <strong>Set time zone automatically.</strong>
</li><li>Select the <strong>time zone </strong>that you want to use in the drop down menu, and turn on (default) or off to Adjust for daylight saving time automatically.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.<br />

<h2>            NVidia GeForce 840M code 43, Intel HD Graphics 4600 driver problem with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
Hi.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Initially I had problem only with NVidia driver on Windows 10. It didn't work with code 43 message. I tried to reinstall driver several times but without success.</p>
<p>
After upgrading Windows 10 on 14th of November I faced another problem - driver for integrated graphic chip didn't not work too. Furthermore this driver is not installed even. After try to install it OS didn't&nbsp;not start at all and showed only black screen.
 I had to enter to safe mode and delete this driver to have working OS, working without all video drivers. Eventually I had to revert upgrade and currently&nbsp;I have only integrated video chip only again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I try else to troubleshoot and solve problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great thanks for your reply. Unfortunately these advices didn't help. In safe mode there is no Code 43 of course because Device Manager writes something like "can't show status of device in Safe mode". When I had done Clean Boot I faced the same Code 43
 as before. Updating of driver didn't help as well. I tried to install as drivers downloaded directly from NVidia as drivers produced by manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which are next steps?</p>

</p><p>Previous OS was Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to install driver in compatibility mode but it said something like "this version of driver is not compatible with this version of Windows" and installing was interrupted. Also earlier I tried to install older version of drivers in compatibility
 mode and it was installed but with the same Code 43 too.</p>

    <title>Install Norton for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emptysighsandwine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Norton for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I signed up for my Windows update, I received a notification that the version of Norton that was on my computer was not compatible with Windows 10. I thought nothing of it and updated it. After upgrading, I received the notification once again and again,
 downloaded the software. Unlike the time I downloaded it with Windows 8.1, I received a window telling me that my Norton had expired and I needed to renew it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a high school student with no job so I cannot afford to renew&nbsp;my Norton supscription. I shrugged it off, but left the software on my computer and didn't uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every thirty minutes, I receive an identical update that tells me that my version of Norton is not compatible with Windows 10. Sometimes I click "Remind Me Later" other times I click the download button. When I attempt to download it, a box will show up,
 acting as if it is installing the software, but will soon disappear and do nothing. Thirty minutes pass and the update comes up once again... It's an endless cycle that is getting quite annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program does not show up in my control panel at all even though it was there after I installed it after my update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5320 and it's about two years old. It handled the upgrade very well, but this bug is being persistent. Is there any way to ge these constant notifications to go away?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>

<h2>            Have to keep re-pairing bluetooth headphones.</h2>
                    <p>EVERY. SINGLE. TIME I want to use my bluetooth headphones, I have to forget them, put them in pairing mode, and re-pair them. I have had this problem for months now, and have already tried updating the drivers, downloading the drivers from the manufacturer's
 website, all to no avail. They work just fine with any other device, but not Windows 10. The headphones are Skullcandy Uproar Wireless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot from earlier today showing that, after I turned my headphones off, when I went to use them not even two hours later, I had to forget them, then re-add them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Not a single device in the entire device manager has a yellow exclamation mark on it. I've also already checked for Bluetooth drivers. And as for his questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>The make and model of your computer</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The type of Bluetooth device, and it‚Äôs driver, version, and date of the driver version</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Any details you have regarding the symptoms, such as the error code or message you encounter</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1: There is no make or model, I built it myself. I'm using an Insignia USB Bluetooth dongle. That's not the problem though, as I've had this problem with another computer as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: The device is my Skullcandy Uproar Wireless headphones. Driver date is 6/21/2006, version is 10.0.10586.494, and it's provided by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: No error codes or anything. Windows 10 refuses to connect to the headphones until I forget them, put them in pairing mode, then make them connect.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I am attaching a picture of my Events for my headset.&nbsp; Different headsets may work better with Win 10 than others.&nbsp; But after I paired mine, all I do to connect is hold the power button down until I hear the ascending tones.&nbsp; To disconnect I hold the power
 button until I hear the descending tones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also check the playback default device listing to make sure the device is selected and not set as a Default communications device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the headset with iTunes I have to connect it before I open iTunes or it won't pick it up as playback device.</p>

<h2>            Playing games on another profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>So I have a xbox live gold profile where I download free games and deals with gold. I wanted to try to play some of these games on a different account, mainly for gamerscore, and it said that is couldnt launch it. Is it like a copyright restriction, or is
 there some way around it? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you</p>

<p>It may be a license issue. If you're using the same console that the content was originally downloaded you should have no issues. If you've switched consoles since you first purchased the content, you would need to do a license transfer.</p>

<p>Well, I have only had one console for Xbox 360 ever. Let's take Dishonored for example, I can play it on my gold account, but when I switch profiles it can't launch it. I asked some of my fellow buddies and they said that they can play any game on any account.
 I also know that my buddy has the newest Xbox 360 console, while I have an Xbox 360 arcade. Could it be because of the different generations of Xbox, or is it because my "Gamerscore" account doesn't have a gold membership? I am considering calling Xbox Support
 and discussing the problem, but I'm not sure that will fix anything.</p>

<p>It wouldn't have anything to do with the console, gamerscore, or gold subscription. Have you ever had to send the console in for repair? Usually when you send it in, it requires a license transfer afterwards. Microsoft is supposed to manually do one, but
 I know sometimes it doesn't get done.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with other games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Saints Row 3, Hitman: Absolution, Spartacus: Legends, Bully: Scholarship Edition, and Syndicate. I don't know what the problem is. Also, I have been recently having download problems
 when trying to re install a digital game. It doesn't even hit 1% when it gives me the message: "Can't download ____" I have been searching on the Xbox forums and people have said that it might be a regional issue. I have my console setting turned to United
 States, and that is where I purchased my content. I apologize for all the questions but these are the issues I have been having and I wanted to share them in hopes of finding a valid solution. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Game DVR issues - Fast&#47;Jittery recording</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having an issue with my Game DVR, whenever I watch my clips on my xbox or phone smartglass app, the footage is extremely fast then stops and trys to catch up with itself. All the time, the sound is staying at a steady pace. Does anyone else have this
 issue, and if so, do you know how to fix it?</p>
<p>Would be much appreciated as I want to start making vids I can record and put on YouTube.</p>

<p>I would say it's probably your internet connection as the symptoms would suggest to me it is a streaming issue. I have the same problem when everyone in the house is on their laptops/consoles. However when they're all out or asleep everything streams just
 fine.</p>

<p>Seems to have fixed itself on my xbox now, but won't stop on my xbox smart glass. Really frustrating when I want to show off to my friends. I have a Galaxy S3, it worked fine to being with. Now won't stop, I uninstalled the app and reinstalled, that didnt
 fix it. I don't think its internet as I usually get speeds of around 8-10mb on my wireless connection when connected to my house wifi... but it still happens.</p>

 and my camera has 6-bit color. I can't do anything and it takes 30 exact minutes to start, every TIME I move the mouse, it plays the Longhorn Fake Critical Stop. So that's why I prefer to hibernate and delete the shutdown command. Help my PC Login faster.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to later repair.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn‚Äôt applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

    <title>Can I choose between Cloud Saves or Local Saves for my games&#63; Can - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thewetwood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I choose between Cloud Saves or Local Saves for my games&#63; Can I access these files&#63;</h2>
                    If so is there any documentation on how to go about finding and selecting those files and placing them in the game files? Metro Exodus can be an example. I've seen a window pop up before asking what save files to choose from but I don't know how to prompt
 it again. Why I'm asking is because my game is currently bugged and I can no longer continue the story or go back. If I can load a older save point it would save me hours of replaying the story I've already progressed through.

</p><p>Hey there </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you play the game will save too your device (ie pc or console) and the clould at the same time. If for some reason your not connected too the internet or there is a xbox service issue or any other issue that prevents the save been uploaded&nbsp; then the
 game will only save too the local device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you start the game the next time then the save is out of sync so it will ask you what save you want too use the newer one on the local device or the older one in the clould ( it will also show what one is newer or older) When you choose the one you
 want proberly going too be the newer one then that will upload too xbox live and you use that save going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose the older save then the newer save will no longer exist. So you only see the option when the saves are out of sync it isnt made too be choosen each time

Thank you for the overview of the cloud saves. Regarding the second question, am I able to access these files myself? I'm assuming not for the cloud saves as the Xbox(Beta) app is still rough around the edges and obscure but how about the local game files?&nbsp;

            I suspect there isn't any way to do so either. If the save files are saved locally to the games folder though that would be helpful to help in manually recovering your game from a story progression bug per say. Oh well.

            Hi Cheryl, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support SCAM 
<br />
<br />Your IP address is fine, you have nothing to worry about !
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!
<br />
<br />Do not give them Remote Access to your PC 
<br />Do not give them any personal details 
<br />Do not pay them       
        </p>

            Hello CherylMason1  
<br />this is scam, Microsoft will never call you unless you have a support.
<br />This is a new method where they say they are companies like Microsoft, Apple, etc. to scam people
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

            Microsoft never calls you unless you make arranegments.
<br />It's a scam that has been going on for years. Microsoft never makes unsolicited phone calls.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is that call from Microsoft a scam?
