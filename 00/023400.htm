<h2>            Windows10 Tp 9926 comes with Malware</h2>
                    <p>Windows10 Tp 9926 comes with Malware, specifically spyware</p>
<p>the start menu search in 9926 sends all searches back to a bing server, this happens when searching for local content which presents a severe information security problem, there is no way to disable this spying behavior, therefor
<strong>the Windows OS now includes Malware</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the option to disable or remove the malware is not presented in future builds or the finished product then malware vendors will have to add the ability for detection and removal of this threat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>these are indeed dark days for Microsoft.</p>
<p>including malware in their own product.</p>

            <p>Sorry, no, there is no malware in Windows 10 TP. However you should read the Terms of the Agreement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information being sent back has been widely discussed on the internet and is pretty typical of any Microsoft Operating System Technical Preview. It is clearly defined in the terms as to what is going on. If you are not ok with what is happening then
 please feel free to not use preview software. The goal here is to make Windows 10 work correctly, be stable and for Cortana to have some clue as to how it will be used when the product is finally launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is infintessimally hard to teach a child how to listen to different voices if none of them ever actually speak to her. Do you expect an advanced AI, cloud powered software platform to be much easier? Now let's add on the drivers for all the sound cards
 for all the microphones and the applications that are so diverse on a desktop or laptop computer .. none of this occurs in the mobile environment of cell phones and tablets where everything is locked down and strictly controlled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How else do you expect Microsoft to get real world feedback in order to improve actual functionality of the product? The feedback they need is real time so that the server-side functionality in their cloud that is necessary for the features to work .. can
 actually be improved and become useful. It is all part of the process of teaching Windows 10 and Cortana how to communicate with people and to report back on what works, what doesn't work, what sort of works, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also quite a bit of the software you use on Windows 8.x and 10 connects to a server somewhere and sends data. Right now we need to see valuable data coming through so that those applications can also work properly upon release. The more feedback the applications
 can give to their developers the more accurate of a picture Microsoft will have of how they will be used in a real world scenario. The fewer problems will become critical failures from a software point of view. I kind of like software that actually does what
 it says it will on the package/app store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these submissions to the servers in the Microsoft cloud that are for test of voice input or keystrokes, file information, etc. Will be in the final product. Microsoft has openly stated this as well. Instead it will be more akin to what you see happening
 with Windows 8.x on a PC, Tablet, or Phone at the present time. However until the product is finished, this is what happens in a technical preview.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Technical Preview is not designed for production use on computers and systems that you might need to be dependent on to get work done. It is not designed to keep sensitive information secure. It is meant to be a test platform for those of us that work
 in the IT Industry and want to try out an earlier than release build and ascertain compatibility and ability to create deployment strategies for computers in a enterprise, education, military/government, or other environments. It is a very large test bed based
 on real world data that is needed to get an idea on how we (IT Industry folks) will accomplish market acceptability and interest in actually using it as an every day computing platform for home, school, business, military/government, etc. This way feedback
 can be provided to Microsoft as they build the product so that it will actually be useful when it is released not just to a consumer every-day home user or hobby, but also to those of us that depend on these tools to get work done. There is a reason why IT
 people in a work environment will often say to you.. Please don't install Internet Explorer 11, Windows 8, OS X 10.10.2 or (insert application name and version of your choice here).. it's not ready yet in our environment. Many times there are problems that
 keep the latest and greatest from being the ideal thing to have running on a system you must depend on. Eventually everything gets patched to be more compatible, however this is not instantaneous and can take a great deal of work by many different companies.
 Sometimes it also involves a lot of money of buying new licenses or versions of things when deploying and integrating software that is needed to maintain security, etc. Those companies.. the ones that write the antivirus, firewall, VPN, remote access, and
 other utilities and tools, they need things like this Technical Preview and other Developer Previews to make their products actually work and be released in a reasonable time frame from when Windows 10 or whatever the thing that is being updated to be upgraded
 so it can be released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your environment Windows 10 TP .. is not a finished product.. and it may not be what you need to be using if you are worried about sensitive data or worried about application and system stability. However if you are ok with Microsoft knowing what is
 going on, and if you are ok with things that might crash and burn and take all of your files and data with it.. then feel free.. put Windows 10 TP on a test system or into a virtual machine and use it and see what is happening with the future of Windows.</p>

            <p>I think we all know that there's telemetry and keylogging by design <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
during the technical preview,</span> but it's a separate issue if all local searches get sent to bing by design, which can remain even after it's final. &nbsp;Bing is not the same as Microsoft, even though Microsoft owns it. &nbsp;<strong>If searches were sent to Microsoft
 I think it would be normal for the preview, but Bing?</strong></p>

            <p>Do you think they may send back to the Bing servers for the very same reason you can't use voice in android without connecting to google? Cortana, the new search, is powered by Bing. Everytime I use the search, I assume Cortana is active. In fact, haven't
 you noticed the results being displayed from the internet? If there is going to be greater integration of these items, then, yes, that will be the case. A search like Cortana, Google, or Siri all get their information from somewhere, and it isn't stored locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess I'm just surprised at your surprise...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you may want to check what you agreed to when you installed Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>

            <p>Hi, all, just to clarify, (sorry i was not as specific as i should have been)</p>
<p>i understand that we are tracked during the tech preview, that im fine with, they need the info and thats what we signed up to test, and agreed to, im not talking about the telemetry/data during the tech preview</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i am talking about is a "feature" it appears they intend to keep when final</p>
<p>In 9926 when you search the start menu for ANYTHING (local, files programs etc) windows searches locally but it also searches BING online and gives web results in the start menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that,<strong> there IS NO SETTING to turn the internet search part OFF.</strong></p>
<p>i was running on a local (not connected) account</p>
<p>onedrive OFF, </p>
<p>cortana OFF, </p>
<p>
</p><p>but<strong> i still i got internet search results mixed with local results in the start menu</strong></p>
<p>Im fine with an opt in situation, that the user willingly chooses to turn on,&nbsp; and i get cortana needs to query the web to do what it does, but she can be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my problem is windows not having the option to disable the stream of everything you ever type into the start search hitting a bing server, i NEVER want to search the web when i search start, therefor there should be a setting to turn the internet search
 part off</p>
<p>
</p><p>if there is no way to disable the web results from the start menu search, this means there is no way to prevent local search data from flowing off to bing even when the feature is not wanted</p>
<p>
</p><p>all start menu searches hitting a bing server means we are FORCED to have everything we search for from start be tracked by bing, even if we dont want it to be, or are only searching local files<br />
</p>
<p><strong>its the lack of any option to disable this behavior that makes it spyware</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and i do not know at this time weather it is clear text or encrypted</p>

            So you'd want "bing" to know you are associated in some way to a sexually transmitted disease (not you personally of course) when searching through locally stored medical records? &nbsp;Or that your company is developing a world changing idea that is stored
 in a document somewhere on your hard drive?

If all you're interested in is a dropdown list, use the combo box control on the userform (or you can use a list box, which does the same job except that it doesn't drop down). You can ignore Greg's instructions about installing the Common Controls resource,
 since you won't need it for this.<br />

            I can help you with that, but I need some more information about how you constructed your form and the userform.<br />
<br />
About the "text box on the form" that you mentioned: is that a legacy text form field? If so, what is its name (the "bookmark" entry in the field's Properties dialog)? If it's something else, what is it, and how do you refer to it in code?<br />
<br />
About the userform: did you follow Greg Maxey's example and create a document variable to hold the selected value, or not? (It isn't really necessary to use document variables, but if you've already set that up, I can work with it.) If not, what is the name
 of the control (combo box or list box) that contains the list?<br />

            You're getting close! Try these fix-ups to see if it gets the form working.<br />
<br />
First, I'm assuming that the form is a "protected form" using legacy form fields, and that the field you want to fill from the combo box selection is named "text28". If that isn't true, let me know.<br />
<br />
Going with that assumption, the Sub openmyform() macro needs to go in a regular module in the form document (or template). The rest of the code needs to go in the userform, which is also in the form document.<br />
<br />
The Sub openmyform() macro should be set as the "on entry" macro for the text28 form field.<br />
<br />
On the userform surface, you should have the combo box and a command button. It's a good idea to change the caption of the command button to "OK". (It's also a good idea to add a second command button, and give it the caption "Cancel", in case the user decides
 not to make a choice right away. But that's an issue for later.)<br />
<br />
Replace the Sub insertdata() code with this:<br />
<br />
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
ActiveDocument.FormFields("text28").Result = Me.ComboBox1.Value<br />
Unload Me<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
There are several ideas here that need explaining:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Your insertdata() was never getting run, because Word doesn't have any idea what it is or how to run it -- it just sits there. Instead, the name CommandButton1_Click() is special: when the user clicks the CommandButton1 button, Word automatically looks
 for and runs a procedure named CommandButton1_Click() if it exists.</li><li>If the CommandButton1_Click() procedure contained your original statement about ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("text28").Range.Text, it would have given you an error when it ran. The problem is that the range of the bookmark "text28" extends into the protected
 part of the form to the left and right of the form field, and you (and VBA) aren't allowed to modify its .Text. Instead, the statement needs to set ActiveDocument.FormFields("text28").Result, which is the part inside the form field.</li><li>Also, your code mentions Me.textbox1.Value. If your userform contains a text box named textbox1, then you haven't done anything to copy the value of the combo box into the text box; and if there is no control on the userform named textbox1, then you'd get
 an error when the code tries to get its value. I avoided the whole issue by using Me.ComboBox1.Value instead.</li><li>You need the Unload Me statement to make the userform disappear when the button is clicked.</li></ul>
<p><br />

<p>If you make these changes and the form still doesn't work, email a copy of the file to me and I'll fix it. You can get my address from

            Jay you are a genius. It works perfectly. Now, I need to have eight of those text boxes that are fed info individually, since each box will represent a separate task performed or a piece of equipment used. Does that mean I need 8 separately named userforms
 with the same type code referring to each successive text box?

            You only need one userform for all the text boxes. The trick is to change the openmyform macro so it can tell the userform the name of the field that needs to be filled in. There are a few parts to change:<br />
<br />
First, in the code of the userform, add this line at the very top:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Public fieldname As String<br />
<br />
Then change the CommandButton1_Click code to this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.FormFields(fieldname).Result = Me.ComboBox1.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unload Me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<br />
<br />
Now the openmyform macro needs to be replaced with this version:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sub openmyform()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim UF As UserForm1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set UF = New UserForm1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With UF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .fieldname = Selection.Bookmarks(1).Name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Show<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set UF = Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub<br />
<br />
The last task is to go into the Properties dialog of each form field (text box) and select openmyform as the entry macro. Also, make sure there is some unique name in the Bookmark box of each Properties dialog -- it must not be blank for any of them.<br />

    <title>&#34;Complex Rules&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_619  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Complex Rules&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Since we are limited in space that rules can be stored, I want to put together, what I will coin as a "complex Rule".</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I am assuming this will save storage space, if it is not a significant savings in space pls tell me that. &nbsp;On the other hand, what I want to do will eliminate making twelve rules to do the work of one complex rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explained: I want to set a rule that looks at an incoming email and places the qualified email in a certain folder, one of 12&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The catch is I receive from the same vendor, emails each month. Instead of writing twelve rules I prefer to make one rule, with one condition used twelve times. The action/script that I want to reuse is the check box that looks at the date of the incoming
 email and move them into monthly files. Thus this condition would be used twelve times, however, using the space in this condition to enter each month would provide one rule with twelve conditions of which only one condition will be satisfied then place the
 email in the correct monthly folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>you've tried wrong. The official app has been released this month and that is what I've linked up there. Why do you ask for help and then refuse it when provided? How ungrateful.</p>

<h2>            Printing in Full Bleed and Shifting Elements</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've designed a letterhead for a company I'm interning at and I'm in the process of converting the design to a Word document. I inserted the png of the design into the header/footer and set the margins to 0 to get a full bleed. I've also checked the option
 for boarderless printing. It looks fine in print preview (see first picture). But when I print the document shifts up leaving a white space on the bottom. (See second picture) I've tried playing around with different settings but can't find a solution. Any
 suggestions?<br />

<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, your printer driver's settings (in the Printer Properties dialog, which is provided by the driver) may need further tweaking, or the driver may need an update. Any printer that supports borderless photo printing should be able to do
 a bleed.</p>

            I don't think I have a printer that supports borderless printing, but I get the impression that those that do restrict the option to paper sizes smaller than Letter (8" x 10" photos, for example) or require a special carrier.

<p>That may have been true at one time, but I've used various Canon "photo" printers as general-purpose printers over the last 10 years, and most (maybe all) have allowed borderless printing of letter-size documents. They do generally insist on being set to
 glossy photo paper in the driver dialog when borderless printing is selected, but the printer doesn't "know" that the drawer is loaded with plain copy paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be surprised if Epson printers didn't have the same feature. I don't know about HP.</p>

<p>Yes, you could expect a "photo" printer to have borderless printing. But any general business printer is not likely to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Emiliy, exactly what make and model of printer are you using?</p>

Hi ChgoChris,</p>
<p>Once you have the property sheet up and click BUILD on the ODBC Connect Str, select "Machine Data Source" and you should then see the name of the System DSN you created from the ODBC Administrator. Once you select your DSN name and click ok, you should then
 see your connection string listed in the ODBC Connect Str property similar to this:</p>
<p>ODBC;DSN=Test;UID=userkathy;DATABASE=Northwind;Trusted_Connection=Yes</p>

<h2>            Multiple group  boxes of option controls are now all members of same...</h2>
                    I had 9 or 10 Group Boxes, each with 5 option buttons--no UserForms are involved here, everything is on a regular worksheet. They all worked as expected (each group acts as a group, each group is independent). To add ten more identical Group Boxes I grabbed
 one and did a copy and paste. Shame on me.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I have 11 group boxes, all mirroring one another (select an option button in one group box, the corresponding button in all groups is also selected).</div>
<div>I know I need to find some properties for these groups change each of them so they're independent, but I
<i>cannot find any way to reveal their properties.</i></div>
<div>These are Form controls, as far as I know, with the non-removable line border around the group box control.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter what I select, whether it's a group box or an option button, if I then select Properties from the Controls section of the ribbon, or right-click and select Properties there, I simply get properties for the worksheet that these control boxes are
 all on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm losing it.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I understand&nbsp;that Windows 10 is supposed to have its own antivirus software built in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I be "turning off" or otherwise tweaking my McAfee software, or&nbsp;should I be "turning off" or otherwise tweaking my Windows 10 anti virus software&nbsp;to prevent conflicts and other performance issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I should be "turning off" or tweaking the Windows 10 antivirus software, how do I do that?</p>

</p><p>If you want to go with McAfee you should perhaps first ask in their forum (<a href="https://community.mcafee.com/community/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.mcafee.com/community/home</a>) and/or their support (<a href="http://service.mcafee.com/ProductSelect.aspx?lc=1033&amp;sg=TS&amp;pt=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/ProductSelect.aspx?lc=1033&amp;sg=TS&amp;pt=1</a>)

Header &amp; Footer</strong> under <strong>View menu </strong>to edit them.

</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s a scam – you’ve got some adware installed on your computer generating the popups. &nbsp;Do not call the number. &nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Empty temporary internet files, reboot, manually update your antimalware program to the latest definitions and run a Quick Scan.</p>

http://malwaretips.com/blogs/remove-debug-malware-error-895-system-32-exe-failure/</a>&nbsp; Scanning with AdwCleaner, JRT, Malwarebytes Free and if necessary resetting your browsers should eliminate this problem. &nbsp;You may also need to run Hitman Pro.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Also, try to download the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website and update it manually and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer: <strong><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a></strong></p>

                    Same website but different system.&nbsp; Do I just need to get rid of vista?&nbsp; It was on my HP Laptop when I bought it new in 2008.&nbsp; I am always getting certificate expired errors but I don't get them here at work, so it has to be vista right?<br />

Also, tried to down load new version of adobe but it says it couldn't find internet connection even when I am on the internet!<br />

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the exact error message do you receive on Websites? </li><li>What were the changes made before the issue occured? </li><li>Which Internet Explorer version are you using?</li></ul>
<p><strong>First issue:</strong></p>
<p><span>Certificate errors occur when there is a problem with a certificate or the server's use of the certificate. Internet Explorer can help keep your information more secure by warning you about certificate errors.</span></p>
<div><span>If you encounter a certificate error at a website you have visited before without errors, it's possible the website is not configured correctly. Try retyping the address you are using. For example, if you are typing the address as https://example.com,
 try changing it to <a href="https://www.example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://www.example.com</span></a>.</span></div>
<div><span>It is also possible that the website's certificate has expired and the owner or operator needs to contact the certification authority to renew the certificate in order to continue using it. This is a website-related problem, and cannot be corrected
 in Internet Explorer. If you are getting errors on a website you have previously visited successfully, contact the website or webmaster to report the problem.</span></div>
<div><span><span>Hotfix: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950067</span></a></span></div>

<p>
</p><p>I did not delete the entire registry settings but focused on the ClickToRun and AppVISV stuff since I was told the C2R and MSDN installs were not compatible.

<p>
</p><p>I then downloaded Office, Visio and Project ALL from my MSDN subscription and installed from those ISO.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st Office then run word and make sure it asks for and you enter your MSDN key</p>

<p>I had a problem installing MS Visio 2016 from .ISO file. I had it downloaded to the second HDD on my computer. Mounting .iso with Explorer. But running setup.exe from the iso file, did not display any message or error. Just "did nothing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I moved .iso file to my Desktop, and opening .iso from my desktop and running &nbsp;setup.exe solved the problem - Visio installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Notice: when .iso was mounted fro my desktop, running setup.exe automatically asked me for Administrative privileges. Running setup.exe from the .iso, when it was mounted from secondary HDD, did not display any message at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be permission problem, but for the installations - try to mount .iso from your Desktop e.g.</p>

<p>Thank you all for you information but I tried all the variants and nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Office runs fine but Project and Visio crash with the same error. (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It struck me that the DLL version number was 0.0.0.0 so I checked and the module path is wrong - there are no files at that location.&nbsp; Seems to me it should be pointing to the vfs folder but I cannot verify.</p>

 is a Click-to-run (c2r) I updated my Office 2016 version for example in the Word &gt; Account &gt; Updates &gt; Update now. After updating it, Visio also works without crashing. :D&nbsp;</span>

                    Hi guys, I've had my 925 for about a month and love it. Recently tho I shot some video and on playback there was a problem with the sound is it was just static noise, no distinguishable sounds. This happens when I try to record audio as well. Is this likely
 a hardware malfunction? Has anyone else experienced this?<br />
Any help would be appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds like the secondary microphone in your phone is broken. It's placed on top of the phone, there's a small hole next to Audio connector. Hope you havent tried to push any needle there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, you should visit Nokia Care to get the secondary mic replaced.</p>

            <p>Hello. I've used NetQin before and it is the only one that I know of that is freeware. I don't know if they are supporting it anymore with virus def updates. You can try it and see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pocketpc-freeware.net/i-mate-k-jam-device-283/antivirus-tag/netqin-mobile-antivirus-pocket-pc-download-12106.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpc-freeware.net/i-mate-k-jam-device-283/antivirus-tag/netqin-mobile-antivirus-pocket-pc-download-12106.html</a></p>
<p>The other that might be more "trustable" is Kapersky but it is not free:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/mobile_downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kaspersky.com/mobile_downloads</a></p>
<p>But really, I don't think you need to worry about Windows Mobile viruses. I've not ever heard of one and the platform is not that popular anymore for hackers to bother with.</p>
