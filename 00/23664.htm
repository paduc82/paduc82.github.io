            <p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you may have an infection that was not completely removed -&nbsp;or the problems it caused resolved. Before addressing the update problem, let's make sure your system is clear of this and any other infections.&nbsp; It would help if you provided
 the ENTIRE and EXACT message word-for-word including all the codes completely written out - this can often help us pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you used <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968002</a> for the fix, then look for Windows Updates instead of Automatic Updates and make sure that is automatic and started. But again, I suspect
 the problem is that you are still infected and we need to fix that first (and then we should look at update problem troubleshooting and resolution for MSE).&nbsp; When checking services, also check Task Scheduler.&nbsp; Are you only having the problem with MSE definition
 updates or does it include all types of Windows updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is only MSE Updates, skip the next section as that is mostly for updates in general and if other updates are working fine, then those fixes aren't likely to be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**********************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is all Windows Updates, then try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution, find and delete the contents (but not the folders themselves) of
<b>ONLY</b> the following two folders: Downloads and DataStore.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
And this MAY help resolve the problem if it is caused by an incomplete or stuck update - but it is not guaranteed to fix the update problem because at this point we don't really know the cause. This is one cause and there are many others that this procedure
 won't resolve.&nbsp; When done, reboot and try updates again and see if they now work.&nbsp; This could do the trick.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the above doesn't help, then I recommend the following in the order presented (and then reboot and try to do updates after each step so you don't do more than is necessary):</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><br />
<br />
Try resetting the WU components:</p></span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></a></span></span>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
Try the System Update Readiness Tool:</p></span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows Server
 2008 R2</span></a></span>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Try the Fix WU Utility:<br />
</span><span><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/repair-fix-windows-updates-with-fix-wu-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Repair &amp; Fix Windows Updates with Fix WU Utility | The Windows Club</span></a></span></p>
<p>If none of that works, the problem may be caused by a more serious update problem or some system file corruption, or perhaps by the infection I believe exists.&nbsp; For now, we'll concentrate on making sure your system is clean and MSE is installed properly
 and if necessary, address the update issue once that has been ruled out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****************************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> (sound like you
 did it but sometimes running it a couple of times will do the trick when once somehow isn't enough) and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full Safety
 Scan from Microsoft:</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx</span></a><span>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused
 by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over
 all of this and get the expert help you really need (which is what I actually suggest in your case) as described below in bold in the Start here link if you use MSE or use the telephone number if in North America or use one of the other contact options if
 neither using MSE nor in North America).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer is confirmed clean by an expert but you still have the update problem, proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.You
 MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span>
<p><span>Remove Zone Alarm if you have it and use the Windows Firewall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify that the Windows Firewall is on, and set to defaults.<span> </span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify that you are not using a proxy server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify that you have “install updates automatically” selected in Windows Update (even though the MSE definition updates are optional).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In IE, reset all security zones to default level.</span></p></span></strong><strong><span>Verify that you are using version 2.0.657.0 of MSE.</span></strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>******************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try a clean boot </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span><span>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing
 the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system
 to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also consider the following compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*******************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and re-installing MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows: </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To re-install, check out this article and follow the procedures: </span>
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span> and click on languages and locales at the bottom
 of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system.When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it).<span>
</span>When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then configure the settings to your liking, update MSE (hopefully it will now work), and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time) to get it started and reporting properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>********************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the options presented don't solve the problem, you will have exhausted pretty much all of our tricks for resolving such problems and if it involves only MSE updates, you should submit a support case for free assistance from Microsoft with your problem
 starting here:<span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></b></a>.&nbsp; If you already opened a case about infections but this wasn't resolved at the time, then
 either try to re-open that case or start a whole new case - whichever seems easier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If the problem persists and includes all updates and not just MSE updates, please repost your question to
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_update?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1300700638376">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_update?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1300700638376</a>&nbsp;and near the top where it says Windows Version, use the dropbox to select the version of Windows you are using so you get to the proper forum.&nbsp; There, experts
 in updates will be happy to assist you further.&nbsp; Be sure to tell them what you've already tried so you don't get the same suggestions until they understand - perhaps a link to this thread would help in your initial post there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Kimi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not Jane, but having the same problem, I can answer for my business:</p>
<ol>
<li>the message prompts during the import process. Exactly the one in the previous screenshot here. It stops after 3 or 10 or 20 max files,</li><li>I takes automaticaly the files from Evernot for Mac. </li><li>The enex file is very small. I even tryed one enex which contains only 19 very small files, one page each, without images. It stopped again,</li><li>I run a 10.11.6 mac</li></ol>
<p>Note: I see during the import, it sends also the files to the onenote web app. I wonder if it's a good idea to manage those different tasks in the same time...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note bis: I checked my filevault to make Onenote and Onenote importer available to access my Mac. It doesn't change the problem.</p>

<h2>            Word makes duplicate files</h2>
                    <p>I use Word on my Mac. It randomly creates duplicates by itself.&nbsp; Let's say, I have "Document". Several days later, a "Document-Joshua's Macbook Air. docx" may pop up, and then&nbsp; "Document-Joshua's Macbook Air-2. docx" may show up as well.&nbsp; I use Onedrive
 as well but it is not syncing properly. It syncs occasionally and randomly.&nbsp; So I basically use Onedrive as a local folder. I think these two problems might be related. Any suggestions? Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the info. I have updated the Word. Microsoft is set for auto update.&nbsp; Hopefully, it will solve the duplicate issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just opened my Onedrive online.&nbsp; The most recent activity is a 11/21/2018 doc.,&nbsp; several are from mid this year and the rest are from 2017 earlier.&nbsp; Any suggestions? Thanks.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Leads to the same dialog box either way.</p>

                    <div style="text-align: left">
<p>I would like to be able to sort email&nbsp;recipients alphabetically - it is easier to see whether anyone was missed/duplicated and also nobody will have reason to "read" anything into the order they are listed on the email! I might be mistaken, but I thought
 we could do this in earlier versions of Outlook but I don't see any way of doing it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correction - I have managed to do it by copying the list to a Word doc, converting it to a table, sorting, converting back to text, replacing paragraph marks with semi colons, then copying it back to Outlook! But is there a simpler way?</p>

            You can't sort within Outlook itself. Earlier versions could not, either. Add the recipients in the order you want to see them.

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that emails marked as Phishing scam would be deleted in the folder and would be reported to the Online Safety Team. They&nbsp;will check if the email sender is really sending phishing emails and appropriate action will be&nbsp;taken&nbsp;once it has
 been proven that the account is involved in activities violating the Terms of Use. If no suspicious activity was found, then the Online Safety Team wouldn't do anything to the account you have reported. It would have no effect to the emails you receive in
 the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to recover the emails that you&nbsp;were accidentally&nbsp;deleted by&nbsp;marking them&nbsp;as Phishing scam, you can recover them by<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> doing the self-recovery process.
</span></p>
However, when <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outlook.com </span>recovers missing / deleted emails, our system restores as many emails as it could regardless of its dates.
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We do not have the option to choose the range of dates of the messages. There is&nbsp; also no guarantee that the messages that you are looking for will all be recovered. Y</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ou can refer to the article below for more information
 on how to do this:</span></p>

    <title>Checkboxes duplicate when the sheet is copied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xipha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Checkboxes duplicate when the sheet is copied</h2>
                    I have a template sheet that needs to be copied for each use. It has about 50 check boxes. Every time I copy the work sheet the check boxes duplicate (and say "Check Box 114" etc. next to them). It is time consuming to delete the duplicate check boxes
 every time this sheet needs to be used. Please tell me how to stop this from happening! I have been having issues with check boxes since Office 95!

            Which would be fine, if I didn't need all the other special objects (the original check boxes, as well as some text boxes) the original author built into the sheet (they asked me to write some macros for it). When I design sheets I avoid form controls
 cause they just cause problems in my experience, unfortunately in this case I can't avoid them, so deleting all special objects is not a good solution for me.

<p>If the combo boxes have been created using Developer &gt; Insert &gt; Combo Box (Form Control), then the following code will delete all combo boxes on the active sheet</p>

<p>Vicky, just as an FYI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors provide the upgrades for devices.&nbsp; Some of them roll out upgrades quickly and other seem to let it happen slowly.&nbsp; Soome devices won't get an upgrade either because it is at its EOL or because it can't handle the new functionality of
 the new OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to find out about a device is, as Linley said,&nbsp;to check the vendors website</p>

    <title>Automatically performing spell checking of appointments in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arielrogson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically performing spell checking of appointments in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I use calendar appointments in Outlook quite heavily, and I occasionally misspell information in the subject of the appointment.&nbsp; Since this information gets exported from Outlook and imported into other programs, a misspelling in the Outlook appointment
 can affect other programs downstream.&nbsp; I would like to set Outlook up to automatically spell check at least the subject line of an appointment when the appointment is closed--similar to how Outlook can automatically spell check a message before it is sent.&nbsp;
 Is there any way to accomplish this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer some setting within Outlook that can do this, if one exists.&nbsp; But if need be, I would accept a Visual Basic solution (I would expect that there is some event triggered when an appointment is closed that I can hook into and perform a spell
 check on the text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Outlook 2013 (part of Office 2013) on a Dell computer running Windows 10 Home as the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi, CourageDog.&nbsp; Thanks for the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's useful, but doesn't solve my problem.&nbsp; I have Word installed, and spell check works exactly as it is supposed to for messages.&nbsp; My problem is that I want to use spell check on appointments as well, and I haven't found how to turn on automatic spell
 check for appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't say you're a nobody.&nbsp; Any information is useful, even if it just reminds someone of something they already knew.&nbsp; A different viewpoint might lead someone in a useful direction.</p>

            From either Outlook.com on the web or outlook installed on your desktop, delete the folders. You might not be able to delete the RSS folder, but can delete the folders under it. 
<br />
<br />If you have outlook on your desktop, you can delete the RSS feeds and if you aren't using RSS at all, there are ways to get rid of it, but you need to open the account in outlook on your desktop.

<li>Created a new database</li><li>created a new table</li><li>created a new form based on that table</li><li>added a command button control to the form</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>There is no code anywhere - this is just a new everything. The same happens with a list and combo control - I haven't gone beyond that.</p>

<p>If there is nothing in the event for the button, that could cause the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each version of Access is less and less forgiving of syntax errors. So code that might have worked in 2010 may error out in 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if your code was written for 32 bit and you have any DECLARE statements, they have to be rewritten for 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there is nothing in the event for the button, that could cause the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each version of Access is less and less forgiving of syntax errors. So code that might have worked in 2010 may error out in 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if your code was written for 32 bit and you have any DECLARE statements, they have to be rewritten for 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said in the post there is no code. &nbsp;This is just a command button inserted on a form. The whole product is fresh out of the box with a new db, new table, new form and no code.</p>

            <p>There is no on click even. I have only added the button onto the form. Normally that is the point when one would add an event but it doesn't get that far. I'm sorry if my description isn't clear butI have simply created the form and added a button - no more
 than that.</p>

            <p>Frankly I'm at a loss. I've never experienced this behavior and have had no problems running apps developed in various versions under 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the only effective enhancements to 2013 over 2010 was the way WEB apps are created. If you are not doing WEB apps, there is little reason to go to 2013 for Access.</p>

<p>I also have this issue. I run Windows as a non-admin user, and&nbsp;I am asked for Admin-credentials multiple times each time I try to check for updates, and also&nbsp;at random times (probably when automatic updates run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The details in the differnet&nbsp;UAC windows says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe SetFlightsThresholdInternal ##DELETE## 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe SetFlightsDetectionFrequency ##DELETE## 0</p>

            <p>Without delving into it deeply I get this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows as a non-admin user, and&nbsp;I am asked for Admin-credentials multiple times at random times. &nbsp;I am not sure if it is due to Automatic Updates or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do go to Settings/Update And Recover/Check for updates It prompts me for a password multiple times also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe SetFlightsThresholdInternal ##DELETE## 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>more.. It does prompt me 6 times...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it must be each of these reported prior post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe SetFlightsThresholdInternal ##DELETE## 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsAdminFlows.exe SetFlightsDetectionFrequency ##DELETE## 0</p>

            I have had this too.&nbsp; I used BeyondTrust PowerBroker for Windows.&nbsp; I created a rule for each.&nbsp; With PolMon I can see when it is called and monitor what I am doing.&nbsp; This quieted the notices.&nbsp; The only other solution that I have found is to be an admin.&nbsp;
 Love UAC.&nbsp; I also have found that it occurs when Windows Update is invoked either manually or automatically.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; done a full reset to see if it was something that happened after a couple of updates of the Technical Preview

<p>
</p><p>Same thing is happening to me when a non-admin account is logged into.&nbsp; Clicking "No" or "X"ing out of the UAC popup doesn't stop the issue unless you click "No" about 20 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On occasion, non-admin accounts are confronted with an AMD Catalyst Control Panel warning (and others) that require admin credentials as well, and I would honestly prefer that ZERO credential requests ever appear for non-admin users (unless invoked by an
 admin while logged into a standard account), as this is not for them to know or worry about.&nbsp; These issues should instead be turned into a notification that an actual Admin account can deal with once an admin account is actually logged into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for considering the negative impact this has on any non-technical users in our households or businesses.</p>

<h2>            Synchronizace telefonu</h2>
                    Dobrý den,&nbsp;
<div>pokouším se již měsíc o synchronizaci telefonu HTC Touch 2 a Windows 8 (kalendář, kontakty ...) Bohužel program který jsem se mi nainstalova a který na windows XP fungoval zde nefunguje. Mohu poprosit o radu jak provedu uložení kontaktů a synchronizaci
 úkolů.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Předem moc děkuji za radu</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Testoval jsem to se službou my phone a ta napíše nelze připojit ke službě my phone.
<div>Pak jsem to testoval pomocí Windows live. Kontakty se asi někam načtou, ale netuším kam. Kalendář ani neni uvedený v synchronizačním nastavení v telefonu.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Můžete tedy prosím poradit jak na to?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Výrobce jsem kontaktoval a byl mi řečeno že to je problém Windows 8 a proto to se mám obrátit na podporu Microsoft.</div>

    <title>ATT Visual Voicemail Lumia 950XL Dual SIM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rustymineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATT Visual Voicemail Lumia 950XL Dual SIM</h2>
                    <p>OS Build 10.0.10586.318</p>
<p>Firmware ends with 36005</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked with ATT for about an hour.&nbsp; They deleted my voicemail settings and we started from scratch.&nbsp; When I called my VM it asked for a password and I put one in.&nbsp; I have read that there should be a second prompt that asks for a visual voicemail password,
 but this has never happened.&nbsp; I changed my VM password a couple of times hoping it would ask me for a VVM password with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this with ATT SIM in slot one and a blank SIM in 2.&nbsp; I removed the blank SIM, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATT tech support called and left me a message.&nbsp; VM icon moved from bottom center to top right of screen, but phone says can't connect in top left.&nbsp; I have not read about this on any posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I am embarrassed, but maybe this will help someone.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>If your VVM doesn’t work on ATT and they say everything is setup correctly, check to see if your phone shows LTE/4G/E in the top left where the signal strength indicator is.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it doesn’t do the following.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Swipe from the top and click All Settings.</span></p>

<p><span>Click Network and wireless.</span></p>

<p><span>Click Cellular and SIM.</span></p>

<p><span>Change Data Connection from Off to On.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>It is off by default.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I should have seen that, but I didn’t.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hope it helps someone.</span></p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately it is not possible as the old versions of Skype have been disabled on Skype servers.
<br />
<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it. If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p>Hi Margarida</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for giving me the bad news - I was hoping that there would be a way for me to go back to the facility of having my computer screen showing equal size of video of myself and the person I would be calling. This facility was most useful to me as I often
 am showing an object or something with small writing to the person I would be calling and now with the new version of Skype I only have a small video box of myself in one corner making it difficult to see what I am showing hence me asking how to go back to
 the previous version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it seems I will not be able to have the halve and half images on my computer I think I will have to join the many others of my contacts who have given up with Skype and have already left.</p>

<h3> vildantursi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons for Windows 10  &#40;Flat design&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering why Microsoft don't change icons with Windows 10. I think they should be flat, like everything else is in something like flat design.</p>
<p>I would like to see new icons, because this one are used till Windows Vista. Everything around is changed except icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it would bring refresh to windows design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know your opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I like the FLAT Design. But it´s more important to create a consistent surface. I don´t like a mixture of Metro-Apps, Win7-Icons and &nbsp;new Icons (e.g. File Explorer).</p>
<p>Annoying and conspicuously particularly in the new Start Menu.</p>

            <p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be any design just it should fit with widows metro style.</p>
<p>I have no idea why they are keeping those icons and not changing them, to any design pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is not a big deal, but it can bring a better UI for windows 10.</p>

            They should just replace the icon DLLs with Win10 version, that way apps should just automatically use the new icon set. I have no idea why this hasn't been done.

            during the initial set up stages. Windows should ask what "theme" a user wants, for example after setting up a user account and password, It should then ask what they want desktop to look like. eg flat, or aero style and maybe a few other options like
 colour schemes/ retro/ futuristic etc. Then people will have the Choice. Who can argue with choice?

            <p>For me, everything is already much to flat in comparison with W7. The icons are one of the few things (visually wise) that I use a windows versions from this century . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best solution, give people a choise between a modern (aero) interface with transparancy and 3d or a flat and no-nonsens interface like W8.

            <p>It's a year after iOS went 'flat', and I'm still completely dumbfounded by it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our eyes use more than just colour and internal shape to distinguish things.&nbsp; Depth/dimension and external shape are hugely important, and taking those away means slower processing time when trying to distinguish icons.&nbsp; Design experts should understand
 how the human brain processes things visually, surely?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I do think it's unattractive, aesthetically too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if some people like the flat design (which would purely be for appearance's sake - not navigability), well, people are different.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, OPTIONS, PLEASE!</p>

            <p>I think the icons are too bright and shiny in Explorer. They look very cartoonish. These icons would really bother me if I had to use them everyday. I also don't like that the icons change to the "Metro" look in control panel. Keep the icons consistent throughout
 the operating system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Or have Microsoft just offer up a basic interface, and if that isn't enough a 3rd party developer can step in and fill the void.</p>
<p>I'd much rather Microsoft focus their efforts on making a stable version of the O/S instead of wasting time with "visuals." Let some innovative 3rd party come forward and make a bundle, that is if there really are that many people who care.</p>

<p>Might want to look in Task Manager &amp; click the details tab and see exact what is consuming the bulk of the cpu %.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had what sounds similar here recently on my ThinkPad after I think the 16299.15 upgrade &amp; it was Edge browser.&nbsp; Uninstalling plug-ins &amp; Resetting and reregistering Edge, and running the&nbsp; windows apps trouble shooter apparently fixed it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>How about going to Task Manager and see what is running.&nbsp; I&nbsp; run Norton and Malwarebytes and these babies can get into background scans and the PC can even become non-responsive since it is&nbsp; running at max for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the PC never settles down to
 show little activity, you may indeed have an issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just monitor your system and get back with some info to assist this site.</p>

    <title>Weird Activation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fjk61011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird Activation.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to clean install Windows 10 Build 10162 x64 EN_GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the first Activation screen entering the Key&nbsp;gave a weird result. Pressing a keyboard key resulted in a different letter showing up&nbsp;on the screen?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually skipped the two Activation screens and when Windows installed I used the Product Key from the Windows Insider on the System screen. All running now.</p>
