            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought it online from microsoft roughly two years ago.&nbsp; I had previously had a similar problem where i sent a mail to microsoft.com and they assisted by checking that i had purchased this package - i think it was the home and business package.&nbsp; Other problem
 is that my mail address was cancelled and changed in the meantime too so i am totally in the dark as everything i had on my laptop is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that helps?&nbsp; do not want to list old mail address on open forum</p>

<h2>            Error&#58;  &#34;Personal folder not closed properly&#34;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Office 2007.&nbsp; Every time I open Outlook now, I get the error message "The datafile 'Personal Folders' was not closed properly."&nbsp; Then, I get a popup below that says "A datafile did not close properly the last time it was used and
 is being checked for problems."&nbsp; Then it warns me that performance may be impacted while it is checked.&nbsp; What is going on and what is the problem?&nbsp; How can I fix this once and for all.&nbsp; (I also just upgraded to Norton 360 so perhaps the problem is there?)

<h2>            Where to change ACTUAL preferences, like &#34;Enter&#34; key behavior</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, for the past hour or so I've been attempting to change what I thought would be a very simple setting; switching the "enter" and "***+enter" key behaviors, from what I understand this used to be possible*, but whenever I try to get to a screen where I
 can change that setting I find no menu that does any more than change my profile settings.<br />
<br />
Where can I find the menu to change actual preferences in how the text editing interface or other preferences regarding the actual functions of Yammer? Please don't tell me it's something someone would have to change through PowerShell now.<br />

            That might work for a thumb drive but not for your Zune.&nbsp; You've got a couple of options for your Zune HD.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Y-Audio-Cable-12-Foot/dp/B000067RBT/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1337541617&amp;sr=1-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You can plug the zune directly into the receiver, but you'll need to use a Stereo cable like the one here</a>.&nbsp;
 You'll plug one end into the headset jack on the Zune and the other ends into your receiver.<br />
<br />
You can use a <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/pd/productID.216692500?WT.mc_id=mercent&amp;mr:referralID=f199d6bf-293f-11e1-8a48-001b2166becc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sync dock for the Zune HD </a>and then you can plug the sync dock into your receiver several different ways:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Stereo cable like the one I linked above</li><li>A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink/dp/B001TH7GSW/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pdT11_nS?ie=UTF8&amp;coliid=I2MI3W257K2MP3&amp;colid=B7SQ3GOFXXTY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> digital optical audio cable</a>.&nbsp; This is how I connect my Zune HD to my
 stereo receiver.&nbsp; There's quite a noticable difference between using an audio cable and a digital optical audio cable - the sound is great!</li><li>An HDMI cable.&nbsp; I notice your receiver has HDMI ports.&nbsp; The sync dock is also HDMI compatible - you'd have to get an HDMI cable for that. (I don't have any experience using an HDMI cable with a receiver, but this might be preferable if you've got this all
 connected to a television screen since you'll be able to view the Zune HD screen on the television screen and sync dock remote provides some great functionality that you won't get without a television screen)<br />
</li></ul>
<br />
If you go this route, you'll still plug the USB cable into your stereo receiver to power the Zune and you'll need to purchase whatever cable you want to use with the Zune sync dock.<br />

<h2>            My mail server&#39;s IP has been blacklisted by microsoft, how do I remove it&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there.<br />
<br />
Lately emails we send to microsoft (outlook/hotmail) are bouncing back with the following message:<br />
&nbsp;SMTP error from remote mail server after MAIL FROM:&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; SIZE=3649:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 550 SC-001 (COL004-MC6F24) Unfortunately, messages from 64.64.29.194 weren't sent. Please contact your Internet service provider since part of their network is on our block list. You can also refer your provider to http://mail.live.com/mail/troubleshooting.aspx#errors.<br />
<br />
I checked with my ISP as the notice said and they assured me the issue was with us being on a blacklist with microsoft. They've also checked our email logs and can confirm nothing has happened which would indicate we were hacked or sending out spam. Microsoft
 simply just didnt like the content of our emails and blocked us it seems.<br />
<br />
I googled how to delist my IP from the blacklist and I keep getting links to this eform: https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl2&amp;ct=eformts<br />
<br />
<br />
However the URL seems to have been changed because there is no form there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can someone please help? This is causing us many headaches.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

    <title>Music Added to phone splits into separate albums and artists - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thexdeucex2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music Added to phone splits into separate albums and artists</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded music and ripped music from a CD. I went into my music library via music app (using windows 8) and found albums by some bands split in two with separate songs. I managed to fix some of them somehow by changing their labels, but there are some
 albums totally screwed up in my library and won't fix themselves. I've gone to windows media player on my desktop and fixed the info and it says the songs are under one album. and sometimes I can get them to merge in the library. but when I put them on my
 lumia 920, they split again. it's really irritating me that the music app has no way of fixing these problem (or I at least can't find out how to fix them).
</p>
<p>basically, my labels are messing up, images aren't showing for the albums, and sometimes music won't play.</p>
<p>also, sometimes when I press play all on any album, the first song gets an error</p>
<p>lastly, over some time, the music I play will be really quiet... around a 5 on the volume level of my phone. when I turn the volume up, it won't go up. I then have to reboot my phone. it happens once to 2x everyday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bugs are really making me angry about my phone. I loved my old windows phone because it didn't have all these problems. and when I try to show my friends this cool new phone, it's gets a bad name because people see the bugs it has.</p>

            <p>Hi <span>
THExDEUCEx2</span>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the forum entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you experience is not a commune issue.</p>
<p>If the songs are fine on the PC and when you sync them over, then that is either an indication that there is an issue with that songs or with the device.
</p>
<p>I am using the windows Phones day in and day out. </p>
<p>That kind of behavior i have not experienced.</p>
<p>Have tried syncing day you have posted the question to reproduced. was not able to do so.
</p>
<p>my songs have appear correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the following .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Try syncing the songs over the explore of the PC.</p>
<p>2. Save the songs to a <span>
usb</span> drive or <span>
sd</span> card and try to sync them from a different PC.</p>
<p>3. On the different pc, assure that the metadata is still correct.</p>
<p>sync them over and have a look if the sam happens.</p>
<p>4. If the sam issue happens pleas back up as much as possible and reset the Phone.</p>
<p>5. Skip the sign in part on the setup and then try syncing an album over to the Phone.</p>
<p>6. If the issue still persist, then please try different songs.</p>
<p>7. If the same happens contact the <span>
nokia</span> support to verify if there is any issue in that direction know.</p>
<p>8. You might as well contact the mobile provider to have a look if the device is working as supposed to.
</p>
<p>9 if the issue happens only with the PC you are using, then the issue is related to the PC and you need to get that on fixed. ( that resolution will occur if it works over a different PC)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>theas</span> steps will most likely solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p><span>Vasile</span>
<span>M</span>.</p>

    <title>Task Scheduler - Launch Program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> --zippo--  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler - Launch Program</h2>
                    <p>Under Win7 and then 8.1 I use Task Scheduler to run an AutoHotKey exe, then use another Task to open Filezilla and when AutoHotKey sees that Filezilla is open, it actions CTRL+P to start downloading the download queue. This is done at 1am to coincide with
 my ISPs 'free download window'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Win10 Build 9926, while the process works, Filezilla opens but only as an icon on the taskbar and not as a maximized window that takes focus.</p>
<p>As a result, the AutoHotKey script fails because there is no active window for CTRL+P to work on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I suspect I could modify the script to open Filezilla as a maximized window, I think it should be easier to get Fillzilla opened as a maximized and focused window as it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hints/tips</p>
<p>Or is this a Win10 bug?</p>

<h3> verucasalt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Undisclosed &#36;12,500 Daily Maximum Spend Per Account &#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>With this posting, I'm trying to get the attention of some <strong>onshore Bing Ads employee</strong> who might know what is going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already contacted Bing Ads support, but I am pretty sure I was routed to an offshore Bing Ads representative, who didn't really have any idea what was going on, and was only able to read some stuff to us from a manual about budgets or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On November 29 at 20:00 PST, and November 30 at 14:00 PST (two of the biggest shopping days of the year), all of our campaigns suddenly
<strong>stopped serving</strong>. &nbsp;They went from thousands of clicks per hour, to zero clicks per hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The common thread between these two days was that our campaigns stopped serving&nbsp;<em>once our overall account spend reached $12,500</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our campaigns resumed serving at midnight on each following day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: We did not reach our maximum budget on any of these campaigns. The Bing Ads representative we spoke with could not find any reason why our ads would have stopped serving so suddenly for the day, and then re-started at midnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason, I am nearly certain that Bing Ads has instituted some kind of<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> secret maximum spend per account of $12,500,</span> probably as part of some anti-fraud risk management or something like that. It makes
 sense that the lower-level Bing representatives might not know about this "cap", because it is probably secret.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that we need someone up the food chain, probably an onshore employee, at Bing Ads, to approve us to to spend over this amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we have reduced all our bids and will be carefully managing our campaigns to ensure that our overall spend for any one 24 hour period does not go above $12,500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an inside contact at Bing Ads?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

            <p>I've been back and forth with Bing Ads Support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be an "undocumented" limit of $12,500 instituted on accounts where the method of payment changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us, it happened because we added a new credit card to the account. (Note, we did not have any declined charges or anything like that -- the problem was triggered simply by adding the new card.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty unfortunate and really should be documented online -- and perhaps Bing Ads reps should be aware of this also, so advertisers like us don't get misinformation. (I spoke to 2 Bing Ads reps back on 11/30, and both assured me that no limit like
 this existed. They claimed it was a 'technical problem'.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is highly annoying, I must say, to have an undocumented problem like this come up right at the moment when we have increased our spend to meet holiday demand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we had known about this, we could have easily planned for it -- by simply adding all the necessary credit cards to the account months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands, it looks like we are now stuck below the $12,500 threshold for some time. We are still trying to figure out how long that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lesson for Bing Ads customers: Be extremely careful when adding new credit cards to your account! Never do it during a high volume period!</strong></p>

    <title>Lenses not available in Windows camera app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miroslavkacer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenses not available in Windows camera app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i recently updated my Lumia 830 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the widows camera default app and click on lenses I get the message "Add more features to your camera using Lenses. You can get all kinds of Lenses from the Store".</p>
<p>When i click the find more lenses link i get redirected to the Store with a list of apps, some of which i have installed. But they do not show up in the Lenses selection.</p>
<p>This was working fine in Windows phone 8.1 but after the upgrade it seems I am not able to use any lenses (like a QR code reader, etc.).</p>
<p>I have installed all software updates to the OS and the camera app as well.</p>
<p>Is this working for everyone else? Any way to fix this? Camera app cannot be uninstalled and reinstalled and I&nbsp;do not want to do a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Pallav. The camera app is the latest version. Are the lenses working for you? Is it an issue with my phone only or do other users have the same issue? If it's broken only for me there is no use to file a feedback report.

    <title>Problem adding certain email accounts in the new Outlook 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorenmartensen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem adding certain email accounts in the new Outlook 365</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Having bought a new laptop, I've had to re-install Office 365 again of course. In this version I'm having problems setting up two email accounts one from dodo.com.au and the other my gmail account. Both of these email accounts you need to log in with a user
 name, here are the settings for Dodo<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Incoming Mail Server<br />
Type: POP3<br />
Server: pop.dodo.com.au<br />
Port: 110<br />
Authentication Required: Yes<br />
Username: Mailbox username (without @dodo.com.au)<br />
Password: Mailbox password<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Outgoing Mail Server<br />
Type: SMTP<br />
Server: smtp.dodo.com.au<br />
Port: 25<br />
Authentication Required: No<br />
<br />
<br />
In this version of Outlook however, I'm not able to put my username in, even under the advanced settings. And when I try to add the email account it just tells me something went wrong, couldn't connect to the outgoing server using the specified encryption method,
 which is set to none, as it is supposed to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Previously I've had all my three email accounts set up to use the same PST data file, which was stored on a separate data drive.&nbsp; This version seems to use OST data files that are stored on the C drive..... I've tried to force the path to the PST and OST files
 using RegEdit as suggested here&nbsp; (https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/21384/where-is-my-pst-file-and-how-can-i-move-it-somewhere-else/) but it doesn't seem to make a OST file on the data drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be very much appreciated - I'm sure there is a solution out there, I just haven't been able to find it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Soren

            The easy part first: 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Previously I've had all my three email accounts set up to use the same PST data file, which was stored on a separate data drive.  This version seems to use OST data files that are stored on the C drive..... I've tried to force the path to the PST and OST files 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />That registry setting just moves the data files - it needs set before you add the account ot the profile. 
<br />
<br />But that isn't your problem - if you want to use POP and direct all to one pst, you need to use manual setup. Click Advanced under the email field and choose the option for manual setup - then choose POP.  (Outlook will always default to IMAP if your account supports it. )
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to use the older auto-account setup dialog, you can set a registry key or using control panel mail to add it. The registry key is included in this article, along with a ready-to-use reg file. <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/disable-outlooks-account-wizard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/disable-outlo...</a>
<br />
<br />I would try manually adding the accounts using the older dialog and see if that takes care of your problems.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you wanted to know how to undo a sweep action. Using the sweep function it will delete all messages from the selected contact. Deleted messages will be viewed in your deleted folder. You can undo this action manually by going to the deleted
 folder and selecting the deleted messages and move it back to your inbox. If you are looking for an option or button that will automatically undo the sweep action,&nbsp;this option&nbsp;is not available. Also, the deleted messages will only reside in the deleted folder
 for a certain period of time. If the sweep action was done weeks ago, the option to recover the deleted messages is very slim.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I was able to clarify this matter to you. Let me know if you have more questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Meryl</p>

<p>As per the Application Overview..</p>
<p><strong>Lumia Storage Check</strong>&nbsp;beta can be used to show a detailed breakdown of the phone memory usage and do something about it. The app shows you an overview and details on the second page, including space taken by:</p>

<p>here's a <strong>BEFORE</strong> and <strong>AFTER</strong> status of my "other" folder, after i installed then ran storage check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>considering the additional fotos i took, additional programs i installed and others in the interim.. from 797.48mb, storage check was able to save me 105mb. not bad than not being able to salvage anything at all ^^</p>

    <title>Spelling errors in the printout but not in the original Word document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Spelling errors in the printout but not in the original Word document</h2>
                    <p>The past few times I've printed Word documents I have noticed several spelling mistakes, mainly the first letter of a word will be attached to the word prior to it. For example, "The dog jumped over the fox" turns into "The dog jumped overt he fox"</p>
<p>Although it appears correct on the Word document on the computer, whenever I print it out these small mistakes keep appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Your example suggests a <em>printing</em> error rather than a spelling error :-) The most likely cause is updates [or lack of same]. Make sure that;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your version of OS X is fully updated,</li><li>Your installation of Office 2016 is fully updated, &amp;</li><li>Check the mfr's web site for a newer driver for your model of printer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is that there is a font issue. Use Apple's Font Book to Validate your fonts &amp; Resolve Duplicates. Delete any older dupes then Restart your Mac after a brief shut down.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with this rewards as well. I completed all three requirements and never received the 6500 points I told I was going to get. I submitted a ticket to the rewards customer service and was told:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We would like to ask more time to thoroughly review the details of your account. We will be working with our research department to investigate this further. We understand how important this matter for you
 and we appreciate your continued patience as we endeavor to resolve this matter"</p>
<p>
</p><p>No results and after waiting a few days I submit another ticket. Same response as above. Submitted a third ticket two days ago referencing the above comment and both previous SR numbers. This time they didn't even bother to respond in the 24 hour time frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I think they don't even care to credit me my 6500 points and own up the problem. It doesn't take 10 days to review an account. Heck if this was Amazon they would have just credit me the points on the first day and moved on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What sucks is that State of Decay 2 is not even a game I would have purchased, not my style of gameplay but I couldn't pass up on the reward points. Currently, they are now offering a CupHead punchcard but after this screw up why would I ever trust MS again....</p>

<p>Jason K A thanks for replying, and yes i am in the same situation as you i have waited days for them to do something about it and haven't got a response they told me to keep checking my email for them to get in touch with me that was last week i went on
 ahead and bought the game before the&nbsp;</p>
<p>deadline and didnt get my points the game in my opinion isn't so bad i like the multiplayer but sometime it can be little buggy and feel like a chore but it would've been better if i got my points. I know one thing i won't do and that's get anything from
 a punchcard ever again!</p>

<p>Hi, to both of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I had an issue with Microsoft Rewards. It took weeks for them to "thoroughly" investigate the issue. I waited and weeks later, I received an email crediting me with points accumulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be frustrating to both of you not hearing anything in a short period of time but I advise you to be patient. The Microsoft Rewards team does listen and does act on these submissions requesting assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installing the old OneDrive for Business sync client &#40;issue syncing SharePoint Team sites&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>We have Office 365, and a Sharepoint Team Site for which company documents are stored.</p>
<p><br />
The OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync client does not sync SharePoint Team sites. Ergo, it is useless.</p>
<p>Microsoft support articles support that the old sync client that can sync team sites can be run alongside the new client. When going down the rabbit hole of links, I end up here.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2903984</a></p>
<p>For which after downloading the proper installer gives me an error of "we have detected these newer version of Office installed on your device"</p>
<p>How can I sync Team Site libraries to my Windows 10 devices? Do I really have to uninstall Office 365, install the old sync client, and reinstall Office 365 to do this?</p>

<p>hi mark,</p>
<p>generally, the legacy version onedrive for business sync client will be installed together with other office apps when you install office 365 proplus. please check whether the legacy sync client is installed or not. see the screenshot below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=2495ef4c-86d2-4add-83e4-4cf4311b73b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d2495ef4c-86d2-4add-83e4-4cf4311b73b9" /></a></p>
<p>if the legacy sync client is not installed, you may need to uninstall your office then re-install from the
<a href="https://portal.office.com/ols/mysoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 365 software page</a>.</p>

    <title>e65 security module &#38;quot&#59;General Error&#38;quot&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arnoel  say:</h3>
<h2>            e65 security module &#38;quot&#59;General Error&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    My e65 was stolen and cracked. I had password protectected it through the security module (not using the default password). I was able to recover it though the network provider after it came back onto the network. The issue is that I am not able to activate
 the security modele now.<br />
<br />
When I use the default password I get "Code Error" and when I use the old password I get "General System Error".<br />
<br />
Along with this there is square icon (made from 4 smaller squares" that is beside the bluetooth icon.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what was done to the phone and how it can be corrected?

            I solved the problem by updating the firmware.<br />
<br />
As a precaution I reinstalled the applications (Mail for Exchange) and synchronized the ocntacts instead of restoring from backup in the event I copied back some problem.<br />
<br />
The icon is gone and I have control over security.<br />
<br />
I still would like to know what that icon represents.

            Ho John, this is one of the most commonly mis-spelled words, so it is in the Autocorrect in Excel
<br />
<br />In Excel, go to File - Options
<br />
<br />Go to Proofing - Autocorrect Options
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find acn, select and delete that entry to stop this behavior
<br />
<br />That's It

            <p>Since you have Outlook 2013, you can call support free for the first 90 days... they can do more to help you than the complaints department - and it will be faster. Heck, we might be able to help you and save the phone call, but we need more details. :)

            <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I visited "Backup and Restore" and actioned it, I received your message "One of the critical volumes is not having enough free space" after a while. I tried the alternative but received that message every time after some 6 tries. This happened yesterday
 and again this afternoon.</p>
<p>My external Hard Drive has 846.46 GB free of 931.51 GB hence there should be enough space to accommodate the backup.
</p>
<p>I did not know how to proceed from here and sought your advice at the help site. I signed in and was advised that "Your callback request has been successfully received" and that a technician would ring me&nbsp;back within 2 minutes. The timing changed to 1 minute,
 0 minute, 4 minutes, 3 minutes etc etc etc during the next&nbsp;2½ (yes, two and a half!) hours when I finally gave up out of sheer frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still need your advice&nbsp;of how to complete the Backup and Restore&nbsp;procedure by overcoming "One of the critical volumes is not having enough free space".
</p>
<p>Could you please&nbsp;send me an e-mail with your solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>This forum is peer-to-peer support and specifically about Outlook 2013 that ships with Office software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I might still be able to help you. If you have a message that a drive doesn't have enough free space, you need to move or delete some stuff off of that drive to make more free space.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the start menu or on the start screen, type "free up disk space" and run the wizard. It will empty the trash and temp folders which might free up enough space.&nbsp; If they doesn't free up enough space, someone in the Windows forum would be better able to
 help. </p>

            <p>Dear Diane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply and my apology for the late response.</p>
<p>I experienced significant delays as a result of the change of my e-mail address</p>
<p>and subsequent Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the "free up disk space" several times in the beginning and it is still</p>
<p>not working. I am absolutely puzzled where my hard disk is not having sufficient</p>
<p>space as there is so much space left like there is on my ext. HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

            Is the backup writing the external drive and how much space is used on the hard drive you are backing up?&nbsp; You need more free space on the external than you are using on the drive you need to back up. Also, you really need to ask in the windows forum -
 the experts there would be better able to help -&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows</a> - they can't answer tough outlook questions and I can't answer tough windows questions. :)

            <p>Thank you Diane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C drive of my PC has 350GB free of 465GB, hence only 115GB was to be saved on my ext. HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter has 823GB free of 939GB. Its 823GB should therefore be capable of importing the 115GB</p>
<p>from my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore do not understand the meaning of the message "one of the critical volumes is not having</p>
<p>enough free space". This message was given when the back up stopped halfway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow your advise and contact the experts on the site you so kindly made available to me.</p>

            <p>I would like to know who to complain to as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had the "Outlook has stopped working message" after trying various things which did not work I booked a call to&nbsp;tech support after about 45 mins of them doing re installs etc they told me it must be a "virus or malware" which they could fix by using
 more powerful software but only if I join the support program for £65-95.&nbsp; As I could re format and re install my self I declined.&nbsp; However I did give the tech guys of my virus program (Eset) who have always been first class with support, a call and straight
 away told me it is a line from the latest Windows 7 update that's causing the trouble I watched as they removed it and bingo all back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot tell me Microsoft did not know it was their code that was at fault.&nbsp; I looks as though tech is more about sales than support now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and yes it was Microsoft on&nbsp;a known tech help number and they&nbsp;quoted my history file)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A WHOLE DAY WASTED AND MICROSOFT WOULD HAVE CHARGED ME FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS&nbsp;THEIR FAULT.</p>
