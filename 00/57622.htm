<h2>            Why cant I download Itunes, or other games on to my computer&#63;</h2>
                    So I just got this Lenovo laptop a few days ago, but it wont let me finish installing Itunes, it will say that it wasnt found, and I dont know what to do about that. And then I try to download a game from a website that I have used in the past, just not
 on this computer and it says that I have to go into the administrator account, but what do I do after that? I am so confused and I have no idea what to do and now its just starting to make me mad. If anyone can help me, it would be greatly appreciated!

<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>

<h2>            Password reset using https&#58;&#47;&#47;account.live.com&#47;acsr is BROKEN</h2>
                    <p>I am at my damn wits end. I hate Skype with a passion, but need it for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot login to my account. I have forgotten the password. I cannot reset the password using the normal "reset my password" method because the primary email address associated with my account has a typo, and therefore I cannot access it. So, I used&nbsp;https://account.live.com/acsr
 and filled out all my information (including 3 names of contacts etc) and was sent a link:<br />
<br />

<p>I clicked that link and it asks me a security question:</p>

<p>So, I entered my Skype name (as that is the ONLY thing I have access to) and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>the "next" button does absolutely nothing.</strong></span> I have tried in EVERY browser, on both Windows, Mac, iOS, and android. Nothing.<br />
I have been in contact with Skype 3 separate times and they say they cannot change my primary email or my password without this form.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Can we PLEASE fix this bug so I can access my damned account!&nbsp;</strong></em></span><br />

<p>This is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In private messages I have been told that I will receive an email from the technical team on how to fix this. Many days later I have received no email and no further discussion from anyone regarding this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, <em>I just want to change my password/my primary email.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype already has massive security problems as it is, why are you being so uptight and unwilling to change any of my information when I have provided you everything short of my damn birth certificate to confirm who I am!? Many of my friends have had security
 breaches where account information is stolen and I've been sent phishing links from their accounts when this happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is a joke service at this point and I don't understand why people continue to use it. Alas, I am stuck using it for work. My employer is also stubborn and refuses to change from Skype and refuses to let me create another account. My only option is
 to have my password reset and<strong> the damned service that allows that is non-functional.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know what to do anymore. Can someone competent
<em>please </em>just send me a WORKING password reset link or even more simply just change my primary email manually?</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Thanks for using the Community Support Forums.</p>
<p>The status for the Xbox Live services is all up and running - there's currently only a couple issues with some Apps.</p>
<p>Social and Gaming services did have a couple hiccups yesterday and the day before, however, that has all been resolved as of this moment.</p>
<p>Are you still experiencing issues?</p>

<p>Any thoughts guys? It's starting to get extremely frustrating. It's not my internet cause my laptop works just fine, has to be on console side. Can't access xbox live at all, wont sync saves, wont do anything. I would gladly try a factory reset but I have
 the MCC and dont wanna lose it. If its erased then my code to download it wont work again thus leaving me up *** creek correct? Please help....

<p>Yea, I'm getting 100% packet loss. Test internet connection says connected to internet and everything is good. Test MP connection says can't finish multiplier test. The advanced test says 100% packet loss. Surely not my network. Tried hard wired, wireless
 and the hotspot from my phone. All internet test via xbox work, but MP fails.. This is getting old.. Idc what the "service status says" they're always slow updating that.

<p>I can't even finish a test lol. All I get is 'DNS isnt resolving xbox server names'. I've tried everything besides taking the console back to gamestop.. I had a buddy try his and he says its functional. Maybe a bad batch was released?I dunno.. I'm wasting
 days that I paid for by purchasing xbox live tho, I know that much lol.</p>

            <p>I'm currently experiencing this same issue. The issue occurs across all devices on my xbox live account. I've tested this on Xbox App on Windows 10, Xbox App on Android, Xbox One S, and Xbox One. A lot of our xbox games rely on Party Chat communication, so this has become a pretty big issue for me and we've resorted to using our mobile devices in order to better communicate. <br /></p>

<br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\<br />
<br />
Look for 'Install Shield' and delete.<br />
<br />
Then restart your computer. See if it still comes up.<br />

    <title>How do I increase all text size but not change size of icons etc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam-joh  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I increase all text size but not change size of icons etc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can I change the size of all the text on my computer without having to change the size of anything else (such as icons etc)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various settings and combinations of settings but nothing seems to increase text size in everything (Office, browsers, control panel, folders, etc) without affecting lots of otherthings. Changing resolution messes with everything. Using the
 'change the size of all items' slider changes more than just text size so changes icon size etc. The 'change only the text size' drop down box is extremely limited and can only change 6 things - so the control panel text is unchanged and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 7 I could change text size and other sizes &nbsp;in so many things as well as increasing/decreasing text size to a certain percentage (eg 120%, custom, etc). I could change border sizes, border text size, active window size and text, inactive window size
 and text, etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adam</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have all idea about the text size feature and is limited to that. However, if you want the&nbsp;text on your screen as clear and smooth as possible ClearType technology might be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ClearType technology in Windows helps make the text on your screen as clear and smooth as possible and can&nbsp; help make text easier to read over long periods of time.&nbsp; If the text on your screen looks fuzzy, make sure ClearType is turned on.</p>

                    I have a Samsung ATIV 500T&nbsp;Smart PC (Tablet) running Windows 8&nbsp;and the touch screen quit responding.&nbsp; I can only access this machine using the keyboard/dock (which doesn't work all that well).&nbsp; How can I get the touch screen back?

            Hi Dick,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
As the issue is with touch screen and since you are able to access the Samsung ATIV 500T Smart PC with keyboard, I would suggest you contact Samsung and check.<br />
Refer to the link.<br />

            <p>That was my first line of action.&nbsp; They had me do a refresh, but that didn't help.&nbsp; I'm thinking that perhaps when I hooked up another monitor via the HDMI port, it somehow got confused and now thinks that it's not a touchscreen monitor (even though I'm
 no longer connected to the other monitor).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there's a registry entry somewhere that needs to be flipped on or off to tell it this IS a touch screen.</p>

            I know that this was posted two years ago, but I have the same tablet and it worked for a year and then just quit. It seems to be running correctly, it just does not recognize my touch. Did you ever figure out how to fix this problem with the Samsung ATIV
 500T?

            I never did find a solution... I just used it like a laptop for a long time and then at one point a software/firmware update finally just finished the whole machine off.&nbsp; It won't even boot now.&nbsp; I have since purchased a little Asus transformer that is
 working very nicely.&nbsp; I can use it as a tablet or a laptop, ort put it on my desk and use a TV as a second monitor via the HDMI port.&nbsp; That's what I was expecting from the ATIV.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unfortunate that you&nbsp;had to buy a new device to get it work. That could be a hardware issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            fatal error c0190003</h2>
                    I have looked ever where for a fix, and I've got nothing. &nbsp;So, I tried to update windows 7 with sp1. &nbsp;Well now I get a fatal error a quarter of the way through the update after reboot. &nbsp;It is always error c0190003 and it is always something to do with
 ssText3d. &nbsp;I just need a way to cancel the update so I can boot back into windows 7 pre update. &nbsp;I have tried to boot in safe mode, but it freezes. I've tried last know configuration, also just goes back to trying to update. &nbsp;I also tried this dism fix, but
 i always get an error. &nbsp;Worst case is a fix I found that requires deleting lines of code from the pending.xml.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
any takers? I'm stumped.

<h2>            &#34;Display Driver Failed to Start&#34; - Windows 10 Issue &#40;Early January 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there. For about a week now, I've been experiencing strange PC crashes that have gotten increasingly worse. At first, it would happen maybe once a day or every two days, but now it's consistent. Every time I open a game, my PC will crash within 1-5
 minutes of it being open. Basically my two monitors remain on, but the images are completely frozen. Often the audio of my friends over Discord or a video I am watching on YouTube remain to be played, but the computer is completely frozen, and the game audio
 has stopped (because the graphics card display has stopped running it, I presume).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means I can no longer play games on my PC, which is a major problem since that's half the reason I use it every day. Not only do I play games to have fun and socialise, I'm also studying animation at university, and I create YouTube video essays about
 videogames, so being able to actually use my graphics card for games and video editing is
<strong>vital</strong> to me. I am 99% positive this is a software issue to do with either Windows or my graphics card drivers (both of which I have reinstalled and repaired many, MANY times over the past few days to try and fix this issue) because sometimes
 I can play games for hours and hours just fine with no issues, and then I'll turn my PC off and go to bed, wake up in the morning and try to open a game and it will crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already posted about this on Reddit with further details about past crashes if you would like more information. Any help that can be provided is 100% appreciated, because I NEED this issue to stop ASAP. If it doesn't, I won't be able to use my computer
 properly, and I have a video in the works that needs editing and rendering, which uses my GPU, and I also have university classes starting up again next month. Not to mention, I kind of just want to be able to play games on my computer. I wouldn't spend all
 this money on extra or new monitors, hard drives, keyboards, mice, controllers and RAM if I didn't want to make use of the countless games I have bought as well. Thanks again for any help you can provide.</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Performance issues always depends on how you operate your computer. There are several reasons that it will operate in an unusual behavior. Examples are: if the operating system is not updated, virus definitions are outdated,
<strong>Windows Firewall</strong> is turned off, and there are many unnecessary startup programs during the boot process of your computer. This means that the programs will run and depends on your computer's performance.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In addition, you need to perform these best practices below to start operating your computer again:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Keep at least <span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">30%</span> or <span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">
30GB</span> of free space on your hard drive for optimum results.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that your hard drive is not full (Without warning message indicated in
Windows Defender</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Unplug all unnecessary external devices that is not currently in used (External hard disk, webcams, etc.).</span></li><li><span>Have a stable Internet connection.</span></li><li><span>If you don’t have enough memory, you should have no background applications running and work only with one program at a time.</span></li><li><span>All other programs and applications were closed if not in used.</span></li><li><span>Make a regular <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Have a periodic scan using <strong>Windows Defender</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If you are using a laptop, make sure that the power adapter is plugin when running heavy applications.</span></li></ul>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already do basically all of these things, except for the Disk Cleanup, and am not using a laptop. It is worth noting however that I have already done multiple reinstalls of Windows updates and software, along with disk checks and other clean-ups/scans
 through CMD and the like, and none of these have fixed the problem at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue appears to be caused by either a Windows update or an NVIDIA driver, because it never happened to me earlier. I run 3 hard drives, my two main ones are only a couple months old, and Windows is located on an SSD. None of these drives are close
 to full, they are all in the blue. I do normally have an external drive plugged in which is quite full, but obviously nothing is actually running off there. I am also running 16GB of memory and things like that, so performance really shouldn't be causing issues
 like this. It never has until these recent updates, and I haven't been using my PC any differently to normal when these issues began to occur. If anything I believe the first crash was after I had been playing Minecraft, which I had only just installed that
 day or the day before, but since that's a Microsoft product now, I suppose it's still part of the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to find my own fix by changing the power settings from Balanced to High Performance in Windows 10's settings, and changing my NVIDIA Control Panel's power settings under "3D Settings" to "Prefer Maximum Performance". I have also used MSI Afterburner
 to slightly underclock my GPU by 5%, with a temperature limit of 78 degrees Celsius instead of the default 80. This has fixed most of the crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it hasn't stopped them entirely. I am still getting crashes every now and then, often when not even playing games on my computer. Now, it seems every time I turn my PC on in the morning, it will crash after a few minutes no matter what. This means
 I can turn my PC on, login, go and do something else, come back, and it's frozen, and needs to be restarted. After this restart however, it seems to work fine for the rest of the day, including when I've tested playing games. I did have a crash the other day
 however, which occurred quite late in the day after my PC had been on for hours, and it was while I was editing a video in Adobe Premiere Pro (2018). This is basically all I have been using my PC for the past few days since I have a big video I am working
 on, so I haven't had as much time playing games to see if this will keep crashing the display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more advanced help you could provide is greatly appreciated. I came here and asked about the problem because I was at my wit's end with this issue after trying every possible fix I could find, and being in constant conversation with the Microsoft Support
 team on Twitter.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am also coming across with the same problem where my screen will just freeze and I will have to manually press the power off button and force my PC to shutdown itself. But even then my PC wouldn't even load up BIOS. Sometimes to "fix" it temporarily
 I would just have to wait until the next morning to turn it on again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It's also giving notifications where it saids: Display drivers failed to start. I tried reinstalling my display drivers and all its associating files and reinstalling it again (I have a Geforce 980 graphics card). But it is still giving me the error
 message and my computer will still freeze. Once this problem happens it will not stop happening until I completely not use my computer at all for a few days or even a week and turning it on again. The problem will then subside for a while but it will randomly
 happen again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have even tried performing disk cleanups, resetting virtual memory, deleting temporary files, running system file checker (which has given me the result that there are some corrupted files but it couldnt be fixed), and also disabling C-state in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just wondering if this is a bug that Win10 update has or there are actually problems with my GPU and its associated files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC specs:</p>
<p>Model: ASUS Desktop PC G20CB Series</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i7-6700 CPU @ 3.30GHz</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you performed a clean install Windows 10, it's possible that it wasn't able to detect the graphics card on your PC. To address this, I suggest that you check the manufacturer's website and download and install the latest display driver for your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>patricia i already try all of that. i tried windows automatic search for driver, i tried the oem driver i tried the NVidia driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>issue is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my pc is a dell xps 8500 that i have upgraded to windows 10 in august after the upgrade advisor said that all my hardware and software was good for windows 10 upgrade when it came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in November dell decided that they would not do test for this system for windows 10 and that if you upgraded to windows 10 Microsoft will have to give you the support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so is Microsoft doing the test for this system before they send update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>they collect data on user system to improve windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or should i return to windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i got issue at windows 10 anniversary update took me 2 month to make my pc work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and now this already a month with a pc that bsod.</p>
<p>
</p><p>dwm.exe dwmcore.dll nvlddmkm diminit Microsoft basic display driver that takes over made in 2006 64 hertz only giving communication timing issue at the hardware level since the monitor require a timing of 60 hertz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what good is a back up display driver if it cause timing issue and bsod?</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are now in 2018 why does Microsoft not upgrade their Microsoft basic display driver to give the proper timing for the monitor?</p>
<p>

<p>also Patricia wu i have other error report Cortana crash, windows login crash, i can't tell if it is because of the timing that cause bsod and system kernel reboot. or if it is cause by some windows error or windows corruption done by bsod causing windows
 corruption when windows does not properly shut down or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can tell you that i did dism.exe online/restorehealth to make sure that my windows image is the same as the Microsoft windows 10 build and i did sfc / scannnow to check file integrity seams that i have duplicate owner ship is it because of the update that
 tried to install them self in the bsod reboot and one update got stuck between 64% and 83%? is it because of windows store app do to reset restore etc... i have no idea.</p>

<p>Hello again, Steve. Apologies for the delayed response. Upon checking the graphics card manufacturer's website, the last released version of your current graphics card was only for Windows 8.1. At this point in time, I suggest that you contact GeForce and
 ask for options on a graphics card update that will work best with the current Windows 10 version and build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

<h2>            System crash with windows experince rating</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, just built a new computer windows 7 64-bit, i7 processor, 12 mgs ddr3 ram, asus P6X58D motherboard with 2 5800 vid cards in crossfire mode. Everything works great, all bios and drivers up to date. Every time I run Windows Experience to get my rig's rating,
 about 1/3 the way through my computer turns off completly, then reboots as I have set in bios. During start-up, the traditional do you want windows to start in * mode pops up, I hit normal, and everything is fine until I try to rate it again, same thing happens.</p>
<p>I have checked for temp and voltage issues, all settings are good.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same problem with a pc I built for a client. The solution was to change the memory settings in the BIOS. I had to drop the timing from 1333 to 800mhz and it sailed through the Windows Experience. Something worth looking ay or giving a try. Good
 luck.

    <title>CPU is thrasing like mad, going up to 100 &#37; of CPU usage almost - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrencetwh  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU is thrasing like mad, going up to 100 &#37; of CPU usage almost instantly.</h2>
                    <p>I am using IE 8.00. Windows XP SP3. When I browse the Internet, the CPU goes up like nuts, and in many cases to 100 % of&nbsp;Usage almost instantly, and, a result locks all programs that were open. I use Task Manager to view resource usage. My Norton 360 &nbsp;anti-viral
 is not taking up resources like this that I can see and this phenomenon occurs mostly when I open web sites and scroll a lot. Neither do I have any other programs running that require intense CPU usage but normal running programs. I also notice that the same
 things happening when I use MS Excel 2003, locks when I attempting to copy and paste even small amounts of information, especailly web site screen scrapes. Why is all this so&nbsp;hard on the CPU and why is my CPU usage shooting up to 100 % so much of the time.
 I can hear it like a moaning or thrashing sound when these things happen. Any ideas ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 GB mem on a Dell Dimension 3100, 80 GB HD. </p>

            <p>These solutions seemed to work for the time-being at least. I will monitor over next few days to see if it remains consistent as it has been today.</p>
<p>The ONLY ISSUE was this; when I did the suggested&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean Boot, gave me this warning/error "An Access Denied error was returned while attempting to change a service. You may need to log&nbsp;using an Administrator account to make the specified hanges".&nbsp; I was
 logged on as an Admin..Not sure why it gave this warning as it did appear that it was loaded in the mode requested. IN any case, really couldn't decipher much from this part of the overall solution anyways as the system still worked with less drivers loaded,
 less programs, etc,&nbsp;I could not identify any offending bad drivers or programs that may be causing the thrashing, not sure how this Clean Boot would tell me that ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice and hope all is well. This type of technical support is very useful and much appreciated. Thank You, Rep and thank you Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Help with uninstall &#47; fix of Visual C&#43;&#43; 2015 Redistributable</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping someone can help me: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I purchased and installed a software product that required/prompted installation of Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable. &nbsp;Something seems to have gone wrong with the installation. &nbsp;In the meantime, I have been trying to uninstall and reinstall
 the redistributable files. &nbsp;The game I installed (Edith Finch) is crashing my desktop and causing Windows to do a complete reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Control Panel / Uninstall, I am seeing a file called "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86) - 14.0.23026. &nbsp;However, when I attempt to uninstall, I receive the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 60px"><strong>"Windows cannot find C:/ProgramData/PackageCache/{[string of numbers]}/VC_redist.x86.exe. &nbsp;Make sure you typed the name correctly, then try again."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on here? &nbsp;Can anyone help? &nbsp;How do I fix this? &nbsp; Any advice would be incredibly appreciated.</p>

<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>

            This is almost always a hardware problem - either faulty RAM, a failing hard drive, a loose connection somewhere inside, etc. so I would rule that out first.<br />
<br />
You can look in the Event Log for messages like this.&nbsp; They are really not worth deciphering until you rule out hardware issues since you will probably find that it is a hardware issue:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System Error<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (102)<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1003<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose<br />
Description:<br />
Error code 000000f4, parameter1 00000003, parameter2 89fe0da0, parameter3 89fe0f14, parameter4 805d297c.<br />
<br />
The 000000f4 and the 00000003 is your clue that it is a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Have you made any hardware changes lately...&nbsp; adding additional RAM, new video card, or anything like that?<br />
<br />
I would run a chkdsk /r on your HDD and a memory test.<br />
<br />
To run chkdsk /r, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r<br />
<br />
Click OK and respond in the affirmative that you want the volume checked on the next reboot (then reboot of course).<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you chose to do it yourself, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk
 log and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1001<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
Checking file system on C:<br />
<br />
The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
A disk check has been scheduled.<br />
Windows will now check the disk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65536 KB occupied by the log file.<br />
&nbsp; 13632736 KB available on disk.<br />
Windows has finished checking your disk.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you see any errors - even errors that are corrected, run chkdsk /r again until you see no errors.&nbsp; You should have no errors.<br />
<br />
Run a test of your RAM with memtest86+ (I know it is boring and will cost you a CD).<br />
<br />
Memtest86+ is a more up to date version of the old memtest86 program and they are not the same.<br />
<br />
The memtest86+ will not run under Windows, so you will need to download the ISO file and create a bootable CD, boot on that and then run the memtest86+ program.<br />
<br />
If even a single error is reported that is a failure and should make you suspicious of your RAM.<br />
<br />
If you have multiple sticks of RAM you may need to run the test on them one at a time and change them out to isolate the failure to a particular single stick.<br />
<br />
Always keep at least the first bank of RAM occupied so the test will find something to do and there is enough to boot your system.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, reseating the RAM in the slots will relieve the error but a failure is still cause for suspicion.<br />
<br />

If someone says to run memtest86, you can tell them to go pound sand and that you know memtest86+ supercedes memtest86 and here's why:<br />

latest version of Skype</a>. Make sure that both have a strong Internet connection, if Skype detects a weak connection it will reduce the quality of the call and drop it altogether. Close any application that could interfere with the call, such as web browsing
