<h2>            Outlook for MAC 2011 Kerberos with Exchange 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,<br />
</p>
<p>I've been sent here from the Technet guys where you can find my original question:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/eb9d7af0-176d-4a29-9c64-72f849323e55/exchange-2013-kerberos-with-outlook-for-mac-2011?forum=exchangesvrdeploy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange 2013 Kerberos with Outlook for MAC 2011</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have 3 offices in 2 countrys, connected through IPsec VPN</li><li>One internal domain: domain.loc<br />
</li><li>One external (email) domain: domain.com<br />
</li><li>Every office has one DC and one Exchange 2013 SP1 Server at the moment.</li><li>ALL internal AND external Exchange URLs of all 3 Exchange Servers use mail.domain.com in order to keep SAN requirements low<br />
</li><li>I have deployed Kerberos according to this article&nbsp;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff808312%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx</li><li>The MAC Clients can domain join without any problems and access SMB shares with "single sign on"</li></ul>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong><br />
With Outlook 2007, 2010 and 2013 Clients everything is working perfectly. But on Outlook for MAC 2011 I have the issue that when I configure the mailaccount with Kerberos authentication, I get the Message: "This Exchange server does not use Kerberos authentication.
 Click OK to turn off Kerberos authentication".<br />
<br />
Does anyone have an advice?<br />
According to the proposed Answer of this <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/exchange/en-US/ea30d879-b27a-4075-86b7-b71585038dde/outlook-2011-for-mac-cannot-use-kerberos?forum=exchangesvrclientslegacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook 2011 for Mac - cannot use Kerberos</a> thread the problem is that kerberos does not work with EWS external URL. Which is fine because I only need to use it internally but since both external and internal URLs are the same, this could maybe confuse the
 not that sophisticated Outlook for MAC client. Can anyone confirm that?<br />
I know that kerberos is not working from outside the network. This test is only focusing on clients that are within the LAN.<br />
<br />
When you troubleshoot connection issues in Outlook on Windows you can CTRL+Click on the taskbar icon of outlook and go to "Connection Status" or "Test E-Mail AutoConfiguration" which saved my rear end quite often by now. Is there something similar on MAC?<br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestion is greatly appreciated. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best greetings,<br />
Vasko</p>

            <p>Solved it:</p>
<p>In IIS you have to put Negotiate in front of NTLM for Kerberos to work. Autodiscover does offer both NTLM and Negotiate providers but Outlook for some reason does not pick the "best" possible auth provider but just the first one.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Hardware keyboard unreliable after WM 6.1 upgrade</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Verizon XV6800 with the official 6.1 ROM. Ever since the upgrade, my hardware keyboard has been very unreliable. Now, a button press will often either produce nothing (so I have to press it multiple times to get a character)
 or it will produce multiple characters. <em>In otherwords,&nbsp;&nbsp; thhis is wht my &nbsp;sentencesend upp lookig like.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is obviously extremely frustrating. I have searched and didn't manage to find anything. Any advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, typing with the software on-screen keyboard works OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rex</p>

<p>I found out that this is a very common problem, apparently caused by a memory issue surfaced by WM 6.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.ppcgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=32126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.ppcgeeks.com/showthread.php?t=32126</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know there is no official solution to this. The only method that works is to restore to WM 6.0 using an unofficial package, like the below. Doing so fixed the problem for me.</p>

<p>Short of this, the only thing is to report your phone as defective to your provider and get a new phone.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Settings/Internet connection make sure that Allow background connections is switched on. If this setting is off no connections are made automatically and hence no mail checking will take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree it is on an odd location and I should switch itself on automatically when switching on scheduled sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what you find!</p>

<p>As embarrassed as I am - that may have done it.&nbsp; I turned that off as it was killing the battery but I would have thought that if I set my E-mails to check every 15 mins that they would when I had a wifi connection at least.&nbsp; I believe it operates that way
 on my N8.</p>

    <title>Outlook email Focused and Other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tracy-stephenmoncure  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook email Focused and Other</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 on an HP Pavilion All-in-One that is about 3 years old. A few days ago, my Outlook email heads changed to
<strong>Focused </strong>and <strong>Other</strong>. I can live with those categories. My problem is that day before yesterday, the headings disappeared. Now Outlook email says
<strong>Inbox </strong>and I have to change the filter to <strong>Unread </strong>
in order to read what should be in the <strong>Other </strong>category. My husband, who has a newer computer, does not have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will you please tell me how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I am using the windows mail on a windows 10 PC. To turn off the focused/other sorting I did the following: Click on the Hotmail account and at the bottom of the left hand column click on the cog wheel(Settings). This brings up a drop down menu on the right
 hand side. Click on "READING" and then scroll down to Focused Inbox and toggle the switch to off. It worked for me.

<h2>            Hotmail Account</h2>
                    I haven't used my hotmail email for years. Even though I have used it on my Facebook page, so I thought that it would be active, still. I have signed some apps with my facebook account, which is logged with my hotmail email. But the problem is, when I
 try to acces my hotmail, the email that I haven't used for years, the system says that someone has used it and now I have to answer some questions about my email, question that I do not remember. Even knowing the password I cannot take my hotmail account back.
 I need to get an important email from a registration that I had done with my facebook (which was logged with the hotmail). How can I do it? This email is really important to me.

            <p>Howdy FilipeStorch, just go to live.com click on the "Can't access your account" link then checkmark the box for "I know my password, but can't sign in " If none of the above verification proofs can be accessed on your account you will have to follow this
 link <a href="https://account.live-int.com/proofs/marklost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/proofs/marklost </a></p>
<p>With that link you will end up marking your current proofs as lost, and after 30 days you will be able to sign into the profile add a new proof (email or phone). Once this new proof has been added to your account you wont have any trouble accessing your
 email account.</p>
<p>Hope I was of assistance to you, FilipeStorch.</p>

            It doesn't matter :-) PowerPoint for Mac is not OLE-compliant. You cannot insert PowerPoint files into Word or Excel documents, nor can you insert documents of those types into a presentation file... even though the Insert&gt; Object dialog leads you to believe
 otherwise.<br />

I'd do a dir for %programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe. If it can't be found, there is no IE.<br />

<p>Try this macro, it has to be included in the worksheet where you want this behaviour:</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not Intersect(Target, Range("E1:F20")) Is Nothing and Target.Value &gt; 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target.Value = Int(Target.Value / 100) / 24 + (Target.Value - 100 * Int(Target.Value / 100)) / 1440<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.EnableEvents = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Change the range, E1:F20, to the range where this input should be possible. The cells in the range should be formatted as hh:mm, i.e military time.</p>
<p>Hope this helps / Lars-Åke</p>

    <title>IMAP is missing support of sufolders in Nokia N8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paa68  say:</h3>
<h2>            IMAP is missing support of sufolders in Nokia N8</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry to say, but Nokia N8 is 10 steps back compared to Nokia N80. That's because it is impossible to view the subfolders of an IMAP-account in Nokia N8.The default Standard-folders are the only folders you get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Nokia N80 there was a possibility to configure the root catalog, ("INBOX"), of the IMAP-account, and a possibility to subscribe to as many subfolders as you wants. There was also a possibility to copy messages from one folder to another subfolder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, could someone please tell the developers of the Nokia N8 to get back the IMAP-support of Nokia N80 back to Nokia N8 as soon as possible???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, at first I thought it was me, that I didn't understand how the configuring of IMAP on the N8 was supposed to work. But then after a lot of&nbsp; tweaking and fiddling around I just can't get it to display anything but the basic folders, Inbox, Sent, outgoing
 etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strange thing, I saw at some point in some synchronization menu the other folders, but couldn't do anything with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please Nokia, fix the broken IMAP, or let's say limited support&nbsp; in the next N8 public release.</p>

<p>After researching for a couple of days I found a workaround for this problem: you need to delete all existing mailboxes and start from scratch. Then create a new account with the following entries: User: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, Passwor: password and continue.
 This prevents the automatism to start which Nokia put in place. Otherwise you are automatically diverted to Nokia Messaging which is good for some users but not for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After having typed in the above, you can make all entries manually: imap server, ports, mail address etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case this worked for a while, but then after a week or so my phone stopps updating inbox and all of subfolders. Even manual update does not work anymore. I hope this is fixed by the next FW update</p>

<p>@Larswad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Nokia Messaging, you can at least choose the folders you want synchronized from the web interface (email.nokia.com). I'm not sure if you can also do that from the phone, but normally setting up the folders is a one-off action, so using the
 web for that should be no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do what the other reply says, you effectively stop using Nokia Messaging, and use the native e-mail client, so you'd need to first know exactly what you want..</p>

<p>I've the same problem on my N8 and can not subscribe to folders in my imap folders.</p>
<p>Moreover i can not send email using MFE with a Gmail account.</p>

<p>Email.nokia.com doesn't work for nokia n8 as the email client is for previous symbian version.</p>
<p>the client on N8 is more recent that the one on email.nokia.com</p>

<p>I did not say you have to download anything, but from the *web* interface you can choose which folders you want synchronized.</p>

<p>I can confirm this issue on the C7 too. Although the email client was working ok on the firmware version 12.3; in that version you could choose what folder to sync from the mailbox configuration. After updating to 12.4 the option is not available. Updating
 to the last version (13.016) didn't fix the problem. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>OK been having a fiddle and think I might have found this one out :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have essentially a gmail run account, but it is actually an @sky.com address so I use 'other' for setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you configure your email account using the workaround with false email, or just using the standard messaging setup (both wored the same for me).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the account is loaded, and you're looking at the inbox, if (when in landscape view), you tap the "@inbox" bit on the right, it brings up a list.&nbsp; If you give it a few seconds, "folders" then pops up at the bottom of the list, if you tap this, it then
 brings up the imap folder list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yee haa :) :) :)</p>

<h2>            JPEG&#39;s seem to have been corrupted by ransomware.</h2>
                    <p>This morning when I started using the computer I could not open any of the JPEGs on my desktop. I am running Win 7 and I have 3 different drives on my computer, none of the JPEGs on my "C" drive will open. I ran Panda Cloud Cleaner, Avast, Malwarebytes and
 Microsoft Security Essentials- they all found one or two viruses or malware,&nbsp;one was a Trojan:&nbsp; Trojan.Inject "C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\winamfes.exe"&nbsp; (as named by Malwarebytes).
</p>
<p>JPEGs stored on my "D" drive open fine and since I ran the cleaners, new JPEGs on my desktop will open fine. I am assuming my previous JPEGs are either corrupted or renamed some how???</p>
<p>Anybody have any ideas?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are upgrading from Windows 10 Insider Preview to the final version which will release on July 29, 2015, it will be considered as a genuine upgrade. You do not have to make any changes or reset to factory settings. This applies even if you have installed
 a Windows 10 ISO.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com Emails Moving directly to Trash on Arrival - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com Emails Moving directly to Trash on Arrival</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Monday last week, some emails that arrived were moved straight to Deleted Items. This seemed to happen around the same time as the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am accessing Outlook.com via a web browser on a computer, and through the Mail app on my iPhone. I have removed and re-added the mailbox on my phone and the issue still occurs. I do not have any rules set up and I don't have Clutter turned on. I can't
 find anything in Mail Options that would be making this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is exceedingly frustrating because important emails are just getting moved to Deleted Items before I even see them. I know they are arriving in my Inbox and then moving because my phone receieves the email in the Inbox, and the mysteriously moves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not just happening to me. I've asked a couple of my friends that also have Hotmail addresses that got upgraded last week, and they are all having the same frustrating issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Divya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have already tried removing the account from all devices, and only accessing it through a web browser. It still did it. I then re-added the account to my devices, and it continued to happen.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I noted this
 is my initial question.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't delete all emails - a majority still arrive and stay in my inbox. My guess would be about 30-50% of emails are being moved straight to Deleted Items. There does not seem to be any consistent trend as to what it is deleting, so it doesn't appear
 to be rule-based (no common From addresses, mixture of newsletters, personal and business, mixture of content types [html, rtf and plain text], no common To address [i.e. mixture of group and individual emails]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a perfect example of the issue, the email notifying me that you had replied to this question was moved straight to Deleted Items before I even saw it, however I also received other emails around the same time and they are still in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not permanently delete them, so recovering them would not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the emails being moved to Deleted Items are also not a part of any previous conversation, so it's not as though they are "ignored" (as you can do in the Desktop Outlook client).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this issue is happening to people who ONLY access their email through a web browser, and do not have it connected to any devices.
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would like it if there was a way to revert back to the classic view of Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I look forward to your future assistance.</p>

<p>What is causing the RPC to fail?&nbsp; Is this failure the cause of the problem?&nbsp; If not, how do I find the underlying problem and therefore the solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

I checked the status of the print spooler using services .msc and it was started.&nbsp; In any event the number of shutdown and restarts I have performed whilst trying to fix this has ensured that it has been restarted without fixing the issue.</p>

</p><p>Now to me this is an incredibly frightening message to receive, since this person has access to extremely sensitive financial information.&nbsp; So since I was thinking this person had been compromised, I sprung out of bed, changed the password
 on the users account, logged in as the user so I could find out where this persons email was going.&nbsp; Come to find out that this person was accessing their OWA and forwarding to another user in the department because they are leaving for vacation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 250 odd users, I couldn't imagine a large environment the staff being barraged by this alert.&nbsp; It would literally numb them to the situation until the day they got compromised and have zero idea because they turned the rule off.&nbsp;
 It is counter productive to what it is trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Being summer we have a lot of users that go on vacation (or take days off) that forget to forward email.&nbsp; I have given them instructions to use the OWA in those situations.&nbsp;
</span>I would like to suggest in the least, maybe some information like which email account is it being forwarded to as then all a person has to do and look at the message, without having to dig into the issue.&nbsp; Or maybe if the email is being forwarded intercompany
 that the alert does not trigger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There does not appear to be a way to edit this alert.&nbsp; It is either on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>Rudy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your response, honestly the links you provided have long been Googled before I asked my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resolutions provided are unacceptable as they negate the usefulness of the alert system altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn it off.. makes it useless.</p>
<p>2. The alerts go to me... hence why I asked the question.</p>
<p>3. What if my company is hit by a malware and I set the threshold at 10, I may not know every account compromised.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature was executed with an embarrassing level of thought.&nbsp; Yes I am sure they will update it (I hope) but dumping a this level of beta into an ecosystem is disgusting.</p>

<p>Hello Joel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for your reply. From your description above, this user's colleague access to his/her messages and forward the messages to others which shows that they have shared the account
 information with each other. </span><span>Actually</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>we</span><span> </span><span>recommend not sharing personal account information with others, even colleagues.
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>F</span><span>rom a safe and convenient point of view, we have
</span><span>mail enabled </span><span>Office </span><span>365
</span><span>Group and Shared Mailbox for team-assisted work</span><span>. And the group and shared mailbox memebers</span><span> can send and receive emails</span><span> in their own mailbox</span><span>.</span><span>
 In this way, the a</span><span>lerts will not be easily triggered</span><span>.</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, as I mentioned above, you can feel free to feedback any suggestion about your requirement to our related team. Your time is appreciated.</p>

<p>I think you have misunderstood me.&nbsp; The users are not sharing account information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User X logged into their OWA and forwarded their email to user Y.&nbsp; User Y does not know users X's password.&nbsp; User Y is just handling users X's email while user X is on vacation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I understand using groups and team mailboxes are the optimal position for some situations but in this case there are items that are directed specifically toward user X which are time sensitive thus the necessity for the robust "forward email to another user"
 system built into the Microsoft Office 365.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback I have is as I asked in the initial post is a way to either turn off the alert for users who forward email to another user inside the domain or what would be the best situation is adding language in the alert email (which was copied and pasted
 from in the first post) is a line stating which email address the user forwarded their email to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example in bold below</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><em>Severity:</em></span></span></span><span><em><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 188, 242, 1)">●</span></span></span></em><span>

            <p>Hi renee.47,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community Forum. It's my pleasure on helping you to receive emails on your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why an account is not receiving emails, these are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. Filter Settings of the account</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure that your account filter settings are not causing incoming email not to be delivered to your account, I suggest that you visit this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/im-not-receiving-emails-sent-by-my-family-or/377a9bf3-7975-4d76-a6eb-04dcc6d68097"><strong>I'm not receiving emails sent by my family or friends</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>B. Inbox is full.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some user not receiving emails due to there is no enough space from the Inbox. To make sure that you still have enough space to accommodate incoming emails. Free account initial storage limit is 5GB and 10GB for premium account. If you've exceeded
 the initial storage limit, please try to get rid of unnecessary email to free up some space from your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>C. Mail Client Settings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User might not also send or receive emails due to incorrect configuration when accessing account using Mail Client. For this reason, please reconfigure your account by following the settings of the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Send and receive Outlook.com email from an app</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>D. 3rd Party Email account</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using University email account such as (.edu) or other 3rd party account, it is possible that there is an issue with your network/server. You might need to contact your domain administrator for further assistance. They may have changed some settings
 in your domain's system that's why you are having problems receiving emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps provided did not resolve your issue, I would like to ask additional details regarding your concern:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Are you trying to access your account using a web browser or a Mail Client such as Windows Live Mail?<br />
&gt; Have you tried to send a test mail to your own email address? did you receive the test email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, please let us know the affected email address so we could investigate the issue on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please sign-in to this website in order to see the Private Message tab where you can provide the email account. We also need you to reply back to this post if you already provided the information on the private data area. This will help facilitate
 our actions regarding your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi TerriRosen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like you to try creating an email rule on your Microsoft account to check if that will fix the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your account via <a href="https://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mail.live.com</a>.
</li><li>Click on the <strong>gear</strong> icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/836a8040-6315-4846-aca1-1fc234ad9d81" />&nbsp;located on the upper right part of the page and choose
<strong>More mail settings</strong>. </li><li>Under <em>Customizing Outlook</em>, click on <strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.
</li><li>Click on <strong>New</strong>. </li><li>Step 1: Sender's address &gt; contains &gt; sears. </li><li>Step 2: Move to Inbox. </li><li>Click on <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>After creating the rule, try to request a password reset again and check if you will be able to receive the email message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know whether it works or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>

    <title>How to Prevent Tabs from being Accessed in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Prevent Tabs from being Accessed in Excel</h2>
                    I have an Excel workbook created for my staff to use, with numerous tabs at the bottom of the workbook. Each tab contains a worksheet in which the employee has to enter some data. &nbsp;I do not want the employee to be able to move on to the worksheet in the
 NEXT tab in sequence until the required information is completed in the current tab. &nbsp;How do I prevent a tab from being accessed like that? &nbsp;The cell in the worksheet (D35) must contain data before moving on to the next worksheet in the next tab at the bottom
 of the page.&nbsp;
                </div>

            <p>A&nbsp;VBA code solution. The code is designed to prevent the user from selecting any worksheet if the previous worksheet des not have D35 populated. This prevents the user going 2 or 3 (or more) sheets ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alt and F11 to open the VBA editor.</li><li>Double click ThisWorkbook in the Project Explorer (Left column)</li><li>Copy the code below and paste into the VBA editor</li><li>Close the VBA editor. (Cross at very top right of window. Do not select the cross below it because that only closes the module; not the VBA editor).</li><li>Save the workbook as Macro enabled.</li><li>Ensure that macros are enabled in Options. See help for how to do this. (The Option to "Disable all with notification" should be OK).</li><li>Now when the user attempts to change the worksheet it tests the prior worksheet for D35 being populated. If not populated then it loops backwards from the sheet until it finds D35 populated in a worksheet and then selects the next worksheet.</li><li>As per the comments in the code the user is prevented from selecting any worksheet where the previous worksheet does not have D35 populated.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub Workbook_SheetActivate(ByVal Sh As Object)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim s As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Sh.Index = 1 Then Exit Sub&nbsp; 'No worksheest prior to first sheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Next line goes to End Sub if prev sheet D35 is populated<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Worksheets(Sh.Index - 1).Range("D35") = "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Loop is in case user attempts to activate any sheet rather than next sheet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For s = Sh.Index To 1 Step -1&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Step backwards through sheets<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Find the&nbsp; a&nbsp;previous sheet where D35 not null<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Worksheets(s).Range("D35") &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worksheets(s + 1).Activate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If not null then activate next sheet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Must enter data in cell D35 before moving to next worksheet."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Exits the loop once a valid sheet is selected.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next s<br />
