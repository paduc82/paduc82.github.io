<h2>            Mail Merge and grouping results on one page</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me how to do a mailmerge, and output the result on one sheet by group. For example I have a spreadsheet with a bunch of different entries, in this case students. I would like to group all of the students and their results by the teacher
 they &nbsp;learned from. Is there a way to do this. See my example below
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Student<span> </span>Test #1<span>
</span>Test #2<span> </span>Test #3<span>
</span>Test #1 Grade&nbsp;<span> </span>
Test #2 Grade<span> </span>Test #3 Grade<span>
</span>Teacher</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Student 01 &nbsp;<span> </span>Math<span>
</span>English<span> </span>History<span>
</span>90<span> </span>80<span>
</span>90<span> </span>Smith<span>
</span></div>
<div>Student 02<span> </span>Math<span>
</span>English<span> </span>History<span>
</span>60<span> </span>70<span>
</span>80<span> </span>Jackson</div>
<div>Student 03<span> </span>Math<span>
</span>English<span> </span>PE<span>
</span>80<span> </span>90<span>
</span>95<span> </span>Taylor</div>
<div>Student 04&nbsp;<span> </span>PE<span>
</span>English<span> </span>Math<span>
</span>90<span> </span>80<span>
</span>80<span> </span>Smith<span>
</span></div>
<div>Student 05&nbsp;<span> </span>Math&nbsp;<span>
</span>English&nbsp;<span> </span>History<span>
</span>80<span> </span>80<span>
</span>80<span> </span>Jackson</div>
<div>Student 06<span> </span>Math<span>
</span>English<span> </span>History<span>
</span>85<span> </span>80<span>
</span>90<span> </span>Smith</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using the example above. I would like to group the results by teacher. Looking at the Teacher SMITH (far right) I was wondering if it is possible &nbsp; to create an output like the one below for each teacher</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Teacher - SMITH</div>
<div>NAME<span> </span></div>
<div>Student 01 &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Math - 90, English - 80, History-90</div>
<div>Student 04&nbsp;</div>
<div>PE -90, English -90, Math - 80</div>
<div>Student 06</div>
<div>Math - 85 , English-80 , History -90</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this possible?</div>
                </div>

            Below are general troubleshooting steps to solve various problems in Excel. Try them one by one and check the result after each step -<br />
<br />
1. Update your office as well as Windows 10 to latest patches from Microsoft site. Microsoft keeping releasing Office and Windows 10 patches to correct known errors. If Feb 10, 2016 update (KB3114717) is installed, this should be uninstalled.<br />
<br />
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-Office-and-your-computer-with-Microsoft-Update-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5<br />
<br />
2. Perform Quick Repair of the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
3. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel\") and see if is contains
 few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.<br />
<br />
Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note - to find Excel path, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)<br />
<br />
1. Open Excel<br />
2. ALT+F11<br />
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window<br />
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter<br />
5. You will have your path below.<br />
<br />
4. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.&nbsp;<br />
Also upgrade all your Printer Drivers to latest from the internet.<br />
<br />
7. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus &nbsp;etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.<br />
<br />
8. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start Excel in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. If yes, then start Excel normally and disable add-ins one by one and start Excel again every time you disable an add-in
 to determine the culprit add-in.<br />
<br />
To start Excel in Safe Mode -<br />
<br />
Hold CTRL key and click on Excel icon<br />
OR<br />
In the Search Box above Windows icon, type "Excel /s" without quotes and enter.<br />
<br />
9. Issues in Protected View<br />
<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings &gt; Uncheck all options<br />
<br />
(For reference, You may review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54)<br />
<br />
10. Go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15, look for EXCEL.EXE<br />
Right Click on this, Properties, In Compatibility tab, check ""Run this Program as an Administrator""<br />
Start the Excel. You might again get the error. Close Excel and uncheck "Run this Program as an Administrator" and start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore.<br />
(If folder path is not correct, you will have to find EXCEL.EXE manually, like Program Files (x86) may be Program Files. Or you can even search for EXCEL.EXE in your C: drive<br />
<br />
11. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced - In General section (go very much down in Advanced), check "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)". Close and re-start the Excel. Uncheck "Ignore Other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)".
 Close and re-start Excel again. You should not get the error anymore. (Basically, DDE should remain unchecked)<br />
<br />
12. You may try to disable the Hardware Graphic Acceleration and verify the result:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Open Excel.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click on file, Options.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Go to the Advanced tab.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Display section, check the box for 'Disable hardware graphics acceleration'.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Click ok and restart Excel.<br />
<br />
13. If above don't solve your problem, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license
 keys ready before you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

<div>Hi&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've had issues settingup hotmail on an old blackberry but have mannaged to resolve this now. &nbsp;However I've received this email:</div>
<div>One or more folders in your mailbox have name conflicts with others or system reserved names.</div>
<div>Folders with these names can't be downloaded by your IMAP e-mail program.</div>
<div>Junk</div>
<div>
<p>Please connect to your mailbox using your Web browser and rename those folders. Once renamed, those folders will be displayed in your IMAP e-mail application correctly.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I have noticed over last few weeks that emails which I used to get in my inbox are now going into Junk email, can you advise why this has started to happen.</div>
<div>I have the option of checking junk mail on a laptop or iPad but don't appear to have this option on the blackberry curve and therefore can't check whilst out. Is this something you can resolve as it never happened before.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. Usually, when receiving a new email directly to your Junk folder may arise due to incorrect Junk filter settings. We recommend creating Safe senders list. To do so, follow the solution provided by Brian Tillman [MVP-Outlook]

<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the troubleshooting steps, let us know the result.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d8a37767-6609-4eb3-8b3e-199118ebffe0" title="Leone19">
<p>
</p><p>Please check that the following are observed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check your webcam.</strong> Make sure your camera is installed, plugged into your computer, and turned on. If you’re using an external camera and you’re having problems with video, try plugging it into a different USB port. If you’re using a USB
 hub, try plugging it directly into your computer.</li><li><strong>Use the latest version of Skype</strong>. &nbsp;We’re always improving call quality, so for best performance, make sure that you and the person you’re calling are using the latest version of Skype.
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Download the latest version</span></a>.</li><li><strong>Is your webcam installed correctly? </strong>&nbsp;Select the Windows key and type
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, from the search results select <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Under Imaging devices, make sure your camera is listed. Right-click it and select
<strong>Enable</strong> (if you see a Disable option, then the camera is already enabled). If it's not listed, or if you see a question mark or exclamation mark, you'll need to update your driver software. Right-click it and select
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>, then select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, try looking on the device manufacturer's website.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Do you have more than one camera?
</strong>&nbsp;If you have more than one webcam connected to your computer (the built-<strong>in</strong> camera plus an external one), try changing the one that Skype is using. Open Skype, click your profile icon, and select
<strong>Settings</strong>. In the Skype Settings window, scroll down to <strong>Video Settings and</strong>&nbsp;select your preferred camera.</li><li><strong>Check the manufacturer's website. </strong>&nbsp;With so many brands of webcams, there may be many reasons why something might not work. Each brand is different, so it's always a good idea to check the manufacturer's website for user guides or troubleshooting
 help.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if the above list has been followed but the problem persists.</p>

            Hello FaiYap,<br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround. Confirm the complete error message so we could narrow down possible cause and your current Windows 10 running build.<br />
<br />
Also, if you've made any changes to your system prior to this, do let us know; include the steps you've followed to complete the action. There's a high chance that these changes caused the issue.
<br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your update on this. <br />
<br />
Regards.

            The error in requesting the insider account is when you click get started in insider.windows.com after signed in, it redirect me into insider.windows.com/error page.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've solved this by changing my server to Australia (from Malaysia) and the agreement page is redirected instead of error page. I registered the country Malaysia in my microsoft account(hotmail).<br />
<br />
Does this means that Malaysia are unable to join the windows insider program??

<p>Hey, I've successfully enrolled to the windows insider program, and already received the pre release update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was requesting an insider account, not getting the insider build. My laptop is always using the English(US). The question is I can't sign up as a insider when using malaysia's web, however it works while I switched my network to Australia using
 VPN. Its works on any device other than pc/laptop as long as I'm using Australia's server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat my previous question. Does this means that Malaysia are not selected for windows insider program?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Hello ChunFai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are quite lost with your statement. Having installed the preview builds indicates that you're already in Windows Insider Program, thus, no need to request for one. Your Microsoft account and Windows Insider account is the same. If you mean to get Windows
 Insider build on your other devices, go to Settings and link your account. You don't need to go the website to do it. Refer to the screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31bc898b-9d18-4e9f-a178-8268880135ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31bc898b-9d18-4e9f-a178-8268880135ac" /></a></p>
<p>And, no, it won't matter where you're from. As long as you have a Microsoft account, you can register as a Windows Insider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Animated dialing&#63;</h2>
                    My wife and I just got samsung jack's with winmo 6.1<br />
My wife's is a Fido phone that she had unlocked, and mine is an AT&amp;T unlocked phone.<br />
My question is this: When my wife makes and receives calls, she has a flashy animated background, however when I make or receive calls, my background is just a solid plain colour.<br />
How do I get the animated backgrounds? I have spent a lot of time searching through all the menus to find a setting, but no luck.<br />

            It seems like your wife has a different flavor of the OS. Each Mobile Operator have the ability to customize the operating system. What you see on your screen is AT&amp;T's choice. If you want to have the same animation, then you will have to get a Fido phone
 as well.

            There is no question about that ... the same ice cream but the flavoring is different.&nbsp; My guess is that there might be a 3rd party program out there that will add some flashy stuff if that is really what you want.

 365 account to find it. When we use the windowsphone.com website it says that our 365 account isn't a valid Microsoft account. We can log in to the 365 portal, but there isn't an option from there to find devices. Please help!!

<h2>            Unable to login to some secure websites in IE 8 and Chrome.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Fresh Install of Windows 7 secure site difficulties</span></p>
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I just finished a fresh install(not upgrade) of windows 7 and neither chrome or ie8 is able to login to some secure sites(https) with default settings. I say some because I am able to login to various email accounts, school sites, etc, but sites like newegg.com
 and such require different action. That action is enabling the common "remember my id" feature on many sites that use on https, I can successfully log in. There is no error that is generated, the page renders fine. What happens is just a redirect to the login
 page OR a redirect to the homepage of the site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried various solutions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>clearing everything in IE's &amp; chrome's settings </li><li>reseting IE8 </li><li>sfc /scannow </li><li>various dll's via regsvr32 </li><li>adding the problem site in question to trusted site list </li><li>compatibility&nbsp;mode </li><li>making sure the ssl certificate is installed </li><li>making sure ssl2 is being leveraged by the browser in question </li><li>reinstalling both browsers </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the kicker, though. While having issues with certain https sites on these particular browsers, firefox seems to have no issue with any of the secure sites. While I don't mind firefox, it certainly isn't my browser of choice(I generally use a mix of
 IE and chrome). *EDIT* Firefox only seems to work for some of the problem sites.... newegg is still not proper. Don't know how many others don't work. */EDIT*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any recommendations would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Same problem with the Months they move in the opposite direction. E.g. April to the left&nbsp;of March.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mark,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, you are using the default search box to search files. As the content is automatically crawled based on a defined crawl schedule</span> in SharePoint Online, generally something is searchable by using the default search box. Moreover,
 as re-indexing a site can cause a massive load on the search system, we don’t suggest you re-index your site unless you’ve made changes that require all items to be re-indexed.
</p>
<p><span>So re-indexing may take long time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In your environment, as you have migrated the data to a newly created site and the files can be searchable without issues, I suggest you use the site instead at work. You can add some more data in it and search them in the site to see the outcome.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you encounter some issues later, based on the specific symptoms, I suggest you post a new thread on our forum for expert help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

Doing so gives such participants access to an early preview of a product still in development and the possibility to help shape its release with early feedback. Over the years, the methodologies available to do pre-release testing of Microsoft code has opened the door to a new set of early adopters who are more willing to take such products for a early spin without hesitation. Microsoft has responded to the rapid changes since the early days of Windows 95 and in more recent times Windows XP which were only available to a select technical group of private testers. Since the release of Windows 7 in 2009, Microsoft has started making future releases o

<p>2. When Win 10 comes out will it come with WMC, or will I be able to add it?</p>
<p><strong>It will not be available at all. Microsoft no longer supports it with Windows 10 release. If you need it, stick with Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to figure out a VBA code to&nbsp;copy the value of the selected cell in column "B" and cells in columns "C, D, E, F" on the same row to the first empty cell in column "I" and the cells on that row in columns "J, K, L, M". I know very little about VBA
 or any kind of coding language and would not have gotten this far without ya'll helping me. I just can't figure this out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a VBA that copies a formula into the cells that references the original cells but I need to copy-paste only the values so if the original info is sorted it won't change the other info. This is the one I'm using that pastes the cell reference formula
 into the destination cells:</p>

If it is still not working as it should then can you upload an example workbook to OneDrive. If the workbook contains sensitive information like peoples names etc then in the example just replace them with alpha letters (A, B, C etc). A picture is worth a 1000
 words and an example workbook even better. The problem has been with communication and I have not been fully understanding what you require.</p>

</p><p><strong>Guidelines to upload a workbook on OneDrive. (If you already use OneDrive and your process for saving to it is different then you can probably start at step 8 to get the link but please zip the file before uploading.)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Zip your workbooks. Do not just save an unzipped workbook to OneDrive because the workbooks open with On-Line Excel and the limited functionality with the On-Line version causes problems.
</li><li>To Zip a file: In Windows Explorer Right click on the selected file and select Send to -&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder). By holding the Ctrl key and left click once on each file, you can select multiple workbooks before right clicking over one of the selections
 to send to a compressed file and they will all be included into the one Zip file.
</li><li>Do not use 3rd party compression applications because I cannot unzip them. I do not clog up my computer with 3rd party apps when there are perfectly good apps supplied with windows.</li><li>Go to this link.&nbsp; https://onedrive.live.com</li><li>Use the same login Id and Password that you use for this forum.</li><li>Select Upload in the blue bar across the top and browse to the zipped folder to be uploaded.</li><li>Select Open (or just double click). (Be patient and give it time to display the file after initially seeing the popup indicating it is done.)</li><li>Right click the file on OneDrive and select Share.</li><li>Select "Get a Link" from the popup menu.</li><li>Click in the field displaying the link and it should highlight and then Copy and Paste the link into your reply on this forum. (I suggest that you avoid the "Copy" button on the "Get a link" screen because it introduces additional steps that are not required.)</li></ol>

            There is no on screen keyboard in the c6. Pretty much like the n97, there is only alphanumeric keyboard and hand writing recognition built in. however, you can google betalab nokia and download the swype keyboard that nokia and swype are developing. That
 support portrait and landscape keyboard out of the box. Moreover it will automatically hide the keyboarda as you slide out the hardware keyboard.

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error usually occurs when you try to install a Office 2016 language pack and you don't have Office 2016 installed. Can you check this article and see if it helps?
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Error-code-30053-4-or-30053-39-when-installing-a-language-pack-76590aba-2613-47e0-90a4-8067dcf29d08?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are running Office 2013, so you will need to look here for the language pack.
