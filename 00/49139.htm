    <title>My Aero keeps switching back to basic, and my wireless keeps turning - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Aero keeps switching back to basic, and my wireless keeps turning off when it switches.</h2>
                    I've had Windows 7 for about a month on this computer (It came preinstalled).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, only today, my Windows 7 Aero keeps turning itself back to windows basic, and when the screen flickers, my wireless goes too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can get it working by troubleshooting aero, and I can get internet access by troubleshooting connection problems. But every time I log into Windows 7, it happens again. I don't want to take 10 minutes out of my time every time I want to use my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried troubleshooting both problems, but it only resolves them on a temporary basis. And my computer is much higher spec than needed to run Windows aero.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone shed some light on this? It's driving me insane!</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off&nbsp; firewall and test -</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also suggest you contact your isp provider&nbsp; and have them troubleshoot your connection for loss of signal, etc...</p>
<p>Have them check the&nbsp; address.&nbsp; If not recognized, they will disconnect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked your cables?&nbsp; </p>
<p>The computer disconnects from a wireless network after random time intervals in Windows XP</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 7 Safe in 2018&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering if it would be safe to switch from Windows 10 to Windows 7 because I prefer windows 7, but I wanted to know if it would be safe to stay on. I know that the support will end in 2020, and I wanted to know if it would still be safer than Windows
 10 Anniversary Update (because they ended support for that too.)

<p>Since Win 7 is still getting security updates and bug fixes (extended support) it's still (relatively) safe to use. However, 10 is getting the bulk of the attention from MS, and newer security tech and features. IMO you'd be safer on 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are you still running 10 Anniversary? Did you have problems updating past that point?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span><br />
What all troubleshooting steps have you tried?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:<br />
You may disconnect the external devices perform a clean boot and check.<br />
&nbsp;</span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>
<br />
<b>&nbsp;Note</b>: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above Knowledge Base article.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong></span><span>You may try to install updates one by one and check if it helps.<br />
To install updates manually, follow the below steps.<br />
1. Go to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads</span></a><span><br />
2. Search for the updates using KB article number for the update.<br />
3. Download and install it. </span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists then you may install the system update readiness tool and attempt to install the updates<br />

<p><span><strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>If the you have tried all the above steps then you may perform a in-place upgrade and check.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of

<h2>            F8 does not open advanced boot menu - just the basic one</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent some time looking through previous posts on this one but still stumped.&nbsp; I need to access 'Repair Your Computer' from the advanced boot menu, which by all accounts should appear after pressing F8 repeatedly during startup.&nbsp; When I do that however
 I am presented with a menu giving me the choice of which device to boot from, such as the HDD and DVD-ROM drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using a wireless keyboard and know that that can sometimes cause issues, so I have swapped it out for an older standard PS/2 keyboard and still the same result.&nbsp; If I switch the computer off without shutting down I can get the Windows Error Recovery
 menu, which lists Safe Mode options etc, but it does not list Repair Your Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could really do with getting into this, so any suggestions would be much appreciated.&nbsp; My OS is Windows 7 Professional 64-bit, upgraded from Vista Business 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

This happens when the PC manufacturer sets F8 as the BIOS key to select the boot device. To get the Windows F8 functionality, you need to do this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Keep tapping F8 at boot time to get the boot device selection menu,.</li><li>Select the hard disk as the boot device, then press Enter.</li><li>Immediately afterwards, keep tapping F8 in order to get the Windows boot menu.<br />
</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are ways for you to close the tabs and view your search history on Microsoft Edge in Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view your history on Microsoft Edge, it will depend on the search engine that you are using. If you are using Bing, your search history should be shown once you click on the search box. This is the same with other search engines. It will also depend if
 you allow the settings to save the search history on Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways in closing a tab on Microsoft Edge. You have an option to open a new tab without closing the previous tab to save the searched content. If you select or close a tab by opening a new one, it will only show the current tab that you opened
 on Microsoft Edge.</p>

    <title>Can Windows 7 Starter Edition support PowerPoint using Presenter&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobinsf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Windows 7 Starter Edition support PowerPoint using Presenter&#39;s View&#63;</h2>
                    I have a netbook (Acer Aspire One) with Windows 7 Starter Edition.&nbsp; I realize this is a stripped down version.&nbsp; I can add a monitor and extend my desktop so that both screens show the same thing, but I can't seem to get PowerPoint to show the presentation
 on one screen and the Presenter's View (with notes) on the other screen.&nbsp; Not sure if this is a software problem that could be addressed by upgrading or if the hardware itself is the problem.&nbsp; Would be nice to take the little netbook when I gave a presentation
 instead of lugging my laptop.

            FYI I upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium Edition and now PowerPoint works just fine.&nbsp; The Starter edition, which came with my netbook, is good for basic internet surfing and email, but not much else.&nbsp; For most users of these little machines, that's probably
 enough.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 and WQHD IPS display problems</h2>
                    Just got my brand new Lenovo Thinkpad T460s . It has a (2560 x 1440) 14" WQHD display. For some reason the email window in Outlook 2016 is not working correctly. All the menus and sub windows are fine except for the window with the actual content of the
 email. The images are all crammed together in the email in maybe 6 columns making the email illegible. I noticed similar problems with Quickbooks. Any thoughts on what to try. I read a couple of articles about DPI scaling with windows 10, but that doesn't
 seem like the answer.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, is the issue specific to QuickBooks and Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to identify if this is a display driver related issue, I would suggest you to try updating the display driver and check again. Follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R to open the run command.</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Expand display adapter.</p>
<p>4. Right click on the driver and update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, uninstall the driver and restart the computer and have&nbsp; windows automatically install the latest driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

            <p>Dear Wungraileng,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That solution did work to fix Outllook 2016. The Quickbooks problem is still there. It usually involves lists where you are selecting who to pay, what checks to print. It could be that since it is QB Pro 2012, I will have to update to the newest
 version. Intuit seems to stop supporting their Quickbooks versions after 3 years or so. The only other thing I have noticed with this screen is in a program I use called Paperport where the app like features in the menu bar are blurry. In the menu bar it may
 have a little app like image to click on to scan a document. Those are blurry across the menu bar. Every thing else seems to working fine. The WQHD display is pretty impressive with Windows 10 features, photos, and video replay.</p>

<h2>            Audio playback through two outputs</h2>
                    I'm trying to get the sound from my laptop playing out of two outputs, preferably through my computer's speakers/headphone jack and through Bluetooth connected speakers. I've seen posts and videos of how to do this on previous versions of Windows (I believe
 Windows 7) using "Stereo Mix" which is under the recording devices, but following those instructions doesn't seem to have any effect on my audio playback (I'm running Windows 10). If anyone knows how to do this, play audio through two outputs simultaneously,
 I would appreciate it. Thanks

<p>One really can't get too much useful information from the Event Viewer about BSODs - that is why the crash dump files are needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Describe how you just reinstalled your notebook...&nbsp; using a built in recovery partition, some backup you made, some recovery discs, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the BSOD seem to occur randomly at any time or if there is something in particular you can do that will make the system crash tell us what you have to do to make the system crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crash dump implicates:</p>

<h2>            Stuck on Almost Done, when I switched on Today&#63;</h2>
                    Stuck on Almost Done, when I switched on Today? Pc had been working fine. Had all the latest updates for Windows 8.1, including the spring one, successfully installed, and running. Switched on today. I had a multi-coloured screen for fifteen minutes, saying
 "Almost ready". Similar to when I was installing Windows 8 &amp; 8.1. Thought my pc had decided to refresh itself. Got to the end. And said lets get started. For which a black screen appeared. Luckily enough, task manager was working. And managed to switch off.
 And when I started my pc again. It was ok, and was as I had left it yesterday. Although notification centre, was asking for my password to be verified. Which I seem to get ask for on a weekly basis. Normally a Saturday, it will ask for a password.

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you could answer a few questions it would help us to resolve this issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span>Was the computer verified as a trusted device earlier?</p>
<p>2. What exactly do you mean when you say ‘Which I seem to get ask for on a weekly basis. Normally a Saturday, it will ask for a password.‘?</p>
<p>3. Does the issue reoccurs or happened only once?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think the computer has refreshed itself, then a Windows.old folder will be created after the computer is refreshed or reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us with the event viewer logs to check what really happened on the computer before the issue or when the issue occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to provide a detailed reports on events under Event Viewer:</span></p>
<p>

<strong>Event Viewer</strong> tile, Click to open the event viewer. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. In the left pane, expand out <strong>Windows Logs</strong>. Click on <strong>
Application log</strong> and highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see any red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>The notifications flag, will have x through it, taking me to settings where it'll ask for my password to be verified. Sometimes sending a code to my phone. No windows.old folder appeared. Just looked like the same screen from Windows 8/8.1 was being installed.

</p><p>You may run the SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer to make sure system files are intact. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them.<br />

            <p>I' have run the file checker. This what it said.</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some<br />
of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For<br />
example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not<br />
supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a problem with the apps being non responsive since the spring update. One day they'll be working fine then next day. They won't synchronise like Mail, or Facebook won't open at all. Then next day they'll be ok again. Then later in the week.
 They are non responsive again. I have tried re installing them. But it doesn't fix the problem. Facebook,Mail, and Bing sport. Are not working at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The result of sfc scan shows ‘Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If System File Checker (SFC) could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it could fix the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.<br />
<br />
If not, then run the Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealthcommand to repair any component store corruption, restart the PC afterwards, and try the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<strong>Search</strong>. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>. Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. Type the following commands. Press <strong>Enter </strong>after each command.<br />
Note: It may take several minutes for each command operation to be completed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Close the command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Darren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check if the issue persists in Clean Boot mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer to the link:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Refer the section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"<br />
to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>

<h2>            Intel Management Interface driver causes constant MEIx64 errors in WIndows Event Log</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update just installed this update:</p>
<p><strong>Inter-Other Hardware- Intel(R) Management Engine Interface</strong></p>
<p>Successfully installed on 8/20/2015</p>
<p>This update causes constant MEIx64 Event Codes 1,3 and 4 to be written to the System Event Log. I am running a clean install of Windows 10 on a Dell XPS 8700 computer. I noticed this problem last week while installing these drivers from the Dell website
 so I reinstalled WIndows 10 purposely avoiding this update. I reported the problem to Dell but I think they ignored it. How can I remove this update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Update doesn't give me the option to remove it.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had and I still have the same problem with the driver for the "Intel Management Engine Interface". After installing the newest version of Intel (11.0.0.1157 or version 1158)&nbsp;or the automatic installation of the driver by the update functionality of Windows
 10, the system will not reboot&nbsp;and&nbsp;boot again. Unfortunately&nbsp;the protected mode of Windows doesn`t boot also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Windows 10 will force an&nbsp;update to the latest driver automatically. So it is not possible to install an older version of the driver which doesn`t cause the boot failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current solution is to deaktivate the interface by the drive manager. After a new installation of Windows 10 the interface is shown as "PCI communication device". After the first updates Windows is installalling the&nbsp;driver and shows the interface with
 its correct name ... than you have to deaktivate the interface before the first reboot!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dear Harkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like Windows 10 very much even the system has still some bugs. But in my opinion Windows 10 Home should also have a possibility to choose and deaktivate updates like it was in Windows 7 or 8. Certainly their will be equal problems in the future with new
 drivers or some bugs in hot fixes&nbsp;...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best, </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi SocialMedia- KaylaE,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community! <br />
Good to hear that you are using Windows 8.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>It is not recommended to move certain files off the SSD as it can later come back to be an issue.<br />
</p>

            <p>What I've found easiest is to Make your Document, Photo &amp;&nbsp;Video directories on the other drive.&nbsp; Then go through each directory and ADD TO LIBRARY of that category.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then go and Remove the other directories from the Library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Download directory, I just point IE to a new position for saving (Any browser really).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also change my TMP directories to another drive and change in [Advanced]&nbsp; ]System Properties] in [Environment Variables].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the changing of Library position won't affect things like Visual Studio that looks at %user%/Documents&nbsp; until I manually tell the software to look elsewhere by default.</p>

<p><br />
Open File Explorer and go to your user profile. Right-click the folders you want to move and choose Properties. Then go to the Location tab. Move the folder to where you want to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can move the following folders: </p>
<ul>
<li>Contacts</li><li>Desktop</li><li>Documents</li><li>Downloads</li><li>Favorites</li><li>Music</li><li>Links</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Videos</li><li>Saved Games</li></ul>
<p>This is the safest and easiest way to move your user content to another drive.</p>

<h2>            HP Photosmart 7510 can&#39;t print</h2>
                    <p>My HP photosmart 7510 was working wonderfully, then suddenly, I can't print.&nbsp; Funny, I can scan from it, just not print!&nbsp; Diagnostice suggests that the problem is in the spooler, but I cannot locate where that is to attempt a fix.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also tried to print
 to a PDF file, and no longer hasd the PDF printer either, - maybe that are related, maybe not. Tried switching from wireless to wored, but that had no effect.&nbsp; Just as a test, I just printed a one page email from my iphone.&nbsp; no problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help, have
 turned both the PC &amp; printer on &amp; off, but no help there either!&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<h2>            Xbox Auto Deletes Captures from HDD</h2>
                    <p>After 2 hours of searching Google for answers there is simply nothing on this. I honestly think MS messed up somehow as I (and seemingly many others) have lost over a years worth of video clips, yet somehow I still have screenshots saved from the same period?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was absolutely no warning or update about this. In fact when my XBL storage is getting full Xbox tells me, why does this not happen for the HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's literally not even one reply from MS acknowledging a fix to the problem on any forum. All they say is 'try an external hard drive' or 'have you tried the drop down menu to switch from XBL to 'on this xbox?'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even now my clips regularly auto-delete, with no option to stop it. The whole point of me saving to the HDD was to stop things deleting from XBL, something explicitly stated on Xbox News / Xbox Assist pages, that to save clips you can keep a local copy on
 your xbox. So now I'm just beyond p***ed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone PLEASE give a definitive answer to what is going on and how I can stop this shambles of a storage set up. And if our old clips and saves can't be restored we should realistically receive some sort of compensation. Even iphones don't do this,
 and their software is notoriously buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did exactly as you wrote. I checked to see if the app was gone. And it was. I then when to microsoft store and downloaded the app again. It still does not allow the camera to reverse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my microsoft surface and checked the camera on it and it has the reverse button on the left side of the app widow. I check this dell unit and it doesn't have it yet??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating!!!! I don't know if we should give up or what!?!?!</p>

<p>I have an airport run, and am a bit bored, with nothing on TV. &nbsp;I was just going to do a thread on Genesis, but saw this. I am debating whether to get it, or not? I'm curious. &nbsp;I don't need it, have completed every possible playthrough and scenario, but
 am a sucker for all things ME. &nbsp;Its the only piece of dlc I don't own. Hmm, decisions. &nbsp;Wonder if its on Youtube?</p>

<p>Yeah, if I have some spare MS Points kicking around, I may get it out of curiosity's sake, but it's not really a burning curiosity or anything, ME3 will have a similiar "virtual save generator" so skipping this one is no big deal to me...:-)</p>

<p>When you pick New Game from the Main Menu, Genesis starts once Shepard gets blown into space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However if you have the option to play the first game then I'd say it is a waste fo time, since it misses so much out</p>

    <title>Webcam Timer for Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Webcam Timer for Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been searhing for one all day on the net - can't seem to find anything!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an Acer Aspire 5542 laptop with a built-in Crystal Eye webcam and I'm on Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered if there was a webcam timer I could download for it? One that waits for about 10 seconds and then captures whatever image/pose etc... I did see one link to a website but the photos you take are actually shared on the website! Don't want that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically I need a webcam timer that's compatible with Windows 7 and lets you take your own photos without having to share them on the net :)</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to use your favorite search engine to search for the software. You can use keywords such as ‘webcam software with timer’ as your search string in
 the search text box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>
