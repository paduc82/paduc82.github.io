<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure<br />
of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or
<br />
video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently,
<br />
remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace
<br />
the faulty&nbsp;component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />
For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this
<br />
resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible
<br />
update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at
<br />
the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting
<br />
Windows Advanced Options menu, choose theLast Known Good Configuration option. <br />
This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem: </em>Disable the program and confirm that this resolves
<br />
the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em>&nbsp; Run Chkdsk /f /r to detect and repair disk
<br />
errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If
<br />
the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Whea_uncorrectable_error on windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    Ok, so i recently bought a windows 10 upgrade disk and decided to finally bite the bullet and perform a clean install however when it gets to the last part right before the part where you setup your internet connection and other stuff it blue screens and
 shows the stop code whea_uncorrectable_error. I've tried to update on multiple hard drives and it always shows the same thing. Another issue I have is that when I get a blue screen my computer never restarts by itself I always have to force shut it down. anyways
 I'm all out of options and dont know what to do.

            Will it be outdated if I just bought it like two days ago? And this download issue has been pre-existing for a while so I honestly don't know if it's a hardware issue or what. Also when I restart my computer after the failed install it blue screens and
 gives me a message saying it's missing file "winload.efi".

<p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends. If your seller constantly keeps their merchandise updated while they're kept in stock, they could be up to date. However, if they just put it on the shelves and keep it there until someone buys it, it could very well be outdated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, the best thing we could do is to perform the instructions given by Andre so we can reinstall Windows 10. Kindly give it a try and see if it helps.</p>

                    I have been getting pop-up windows from some company called "Slimware Utilities", indicating that I have drivers that are outdated and need updating... is this a legitimate business and offer?

            No , that program is a PUP, potentially undesireable program. You may use something like the free version of AdwCleaner to get rid of it.

    <title>Gamertag not available&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ibfallen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag not available&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I am looking to change my gamertag.&nbsp; I have checked several websites that allegedly verify whether a gamertag is in use or not, and each one has told me that the gamertag I want to use is available.&nbsp; I have also tried sending a friend request to the gamertag
 on Xbox LIVE and have gotten an error "Can't complete this process. Please try again. For more info, visit..." and a message which gave the error "The gamertag you entered does not exist on Xbox LIVE."&nbsp; However, whenever I actually go to change my gamertag
 and I type in the name that I want, I get an error message saying the gamertag is unavailable.&nbsp; Why is this so?&nbsp; Is it actually unavailable or is there something up?&nbsp; Is there any way I can get the gamertag if it's not in use?&nbsp; (The new tag is a name I use
 for several other services and I would like to streamline my aliases.)</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thanks for any help or insight.</p>

<p>there is no valid way to see if a tag is available (those sites are mostly incorrect) the only way to see if it is is if you try to change your name to it. &nbsp;FYI the system does not recognize the difference between caps and lower case and spaces, for example
 davemcfly85, DaveMcFly85, and Dave McFly 85 are all the same tag. &nbsp;and also Xbox live is not the only service that uses the tag system, windows live PC games and Zune do as well, you will just have to pick another tag or do something exchange numbers for letters
 or add a number to the tag etc.</p>

<p>Gamertags are not used solely for Xbox accounts. They are also used for Zune and Games for Windows. Since they are not an on-demand service there is no purging timeframe for inactive gamertags. All you can do is keep checking the availability periodically.
 Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Not the answer I wanted to hear but it definitely helps!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm very picky with names like this--specific criteria and all--and it took me forever just to come up with the name I wanted. &nbsp;I've already partially integrated this name so I'd either have to deal with my names being varied and not streamlined or start
 that process all over and lose info., etc. for established accounts.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I heard that they occasionally purge inactive tags and make them available for the public to use. &nbsp;Do you know how often they do this? &nbsp;Is it worth waiting to see if the tag I want becomes available?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>@davemcfly85 - I know those services are largely inaccurate but the point I wanted to make was that all indicators said the tag was not in use and was available, even those directly from Xbox LIVE. &nbsp;(I didn't realize that other Microsoft services use tags
 from the same pool.)</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>I'm very picky with names like this--specific criteria and all--and it took me forever just to come up with the name I wanted. &nbsp;I've already partially integrated this name so I'd either have to deal with my names being varied and not streamlined or start
 that process all over and lose info., etc. for established accounts.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I heard that they occasionally purge inactive tags and make them available for the public to use. &nbsp;Do you know how often they do this? &nbsp;Is it worth waiting to see if the tag I want becomes available?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>@davemcfly85 - I know those services are largely inaccurate but the point I wanted to make was that all indicators said the tag was not in use and was available, even those directly from Xbox LIVE. &nbsp;(I didn't realize that other Microsoft services use tags
 from the same pool.)</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Upgrade from Release Preview</h2>
                    <p>I performed a clean install of Windows 8 Release Preview reformatting the hard disc and removing the OEM install of Windows 7.</p>
<p>Can I perform a clean install of Windows 8 with the Windows 8 Upgrade download without having to reinstall Windows 7 first?
</p>
<p>I have a valid Windows 7 OEM product key for the version of Windows 7 that was previously installed.

<h2>            FIFA 16 auf Xbox mit PC zusammen spielen&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi, meine Freunde haben alle eine Xbox One und Fifa 16. Ich habe aber nur einen PC. Ich habe gesehen dass man mit Win10 auch einen XBox Acc haben kann und alles. Jetzt wollte ich wissen, ob ich mit ihnen zusammen spielen kann und wenn ja welches Spiel
 ich mir kaufen soll, das f√ºr den Pc oder das f√ºr die Xbox?</span></p>

<p>Du hast zwar einen Xbox Account mit Windows 10, aber es gibt nur sehr wenige Spiele, die ein Miteinander Spielen zwischen Konsole und Windows 10 erlauben. Und FIFA 16 ist leider NICHT so ein Spiel.
</p>
<p>Du k√∂nntest mit dem kommenden (kostenlosen) Fable Legends gegen Konsolenspieler spielen.</p>
<p>Dazu brauchst Du aber die PC version.</p>
<p>Xbox One Spiele laufen auf dem Windows PC nicht. </p>
<p>Du kannst allerh√∂chstens eine Xbox One Konsole kaufen, und die Bildschirmausgabe auf Deinen PC streamen. √Ñhnlich wie bei Steam oder nVidia Shield kannst Du dann an einem recht schwachbr√ºstigen PC mit Bildschirm aufw√§ndige Spiele spielen.
</p>
<p>Aber dabei w√ºrde Dein PC lediglich als "Fernsteuerung" f√ºr eine im Haus befindliche Xbox Konsole dienen.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Du kannst mit Deinen Konsolenfreunden kein FIFA 16 am PC spielen. </p>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Support for PC</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft have finally released drivers for Windows for use with the Xbox One Controller</p>
<p>[quote user="Major Nelson"]</p>
<div>Beginning today, new PC drivers for the Xbox One controller will be available for download, offering PC gamers a better way to play using the Xbox One controller. We‚Äôre planning to release the drivers as part of a Windows update in the
 near future; however, today, I am happy to offer &nbsp;early access to our dedicated PC gamers on MajorNelson.com.
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://mjr.mn/XboxOnePCDriversx86" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PC Drivers for Xbox One Controller (x86)</a></p>
<p><a href="http://mjr.mn/XboxOnePCDriversx64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PC Drivers for Xbox One Controller (x64)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new PC drivers will enable the Xbox One controller to be used with any game that featured gamepad support for the Xbox 360 controller. Simply download the drivers, connect your Xbox One controller to your computer through a micro USB cable and you‚Äôll
 be gaming in no time.</p>

<p>I assume your asking where are all the Kinect games that you had on the 360? (at least I think that's what your asking)</p>
<p>Unfortunately Xbox 360 games do not work on the Xbox One, so the only "Kinect only" Kinect games are a fighting games (cant remember the name of it) and Kinect Sports Rivals.</p>
<p>there are loads of games that use Kinect, but they are Kinect only </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t keep time - again</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I read all the previous posts on this subject.&nbsp; I changed the motherboard battery on this Dell PC.&nbsp; I checked the proper boxes to sync the time with Microsoft.&nbsp; But, after I've powered off overnight the time is wrong on Windows 10 Pro at the next startup.&nbsp;
 The error can range from 1 to 4 hours ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the BIOS time and it is correct.&nbsp; I also have Ubuntu partitioned on the hard drive and it reports the correct time.&nbsp; I've checked the time with and without an Internet connection and both of these provide the correct time while Windows 10 does
 not.&nbsp; I reset to Windows 8 and the time was correct.&nbsp; I reinstalled Windows 10 from a new download and the time is wrong.&nbsp; The time will reset correctly after the PC makes contact with Microsoft but won't stay correct after the overnight shutdown.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>When the time is off, is it off only by the hour or are minutes also different?</p>

<p>When the BIOS shows the correct time and when Ubuntu shows the correct time then Win 10 must be at fault. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the condition might be a function of how I shut the system down.&nbsp; I do a normal shut down (not hibernate) and when I leave the room I turn off the room power switch.&nbsp; This switch shuts off all of the power in the room outlets.&nbsp; So there
 is no power to the computer and other devices during the night.&nbsp; When I start up in the morning, Windows 10 shows the time 4 hours ahead but with the proper minutes. &nbsp; After the PC is on for an hour or more with Internet connected the time is changed to the
 proper hour.&nbsp; The PC is not always connected to the Internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I did not turn off the room power but just the computer.&nbsp; Windows 10 showed the correct time on startup this morning.&nbsp; So it would appear that Windows needs the power to be connected to the computer at all times.&nbsp; Normally I can't do this because
 other equipment in the room need to be turned off and the circuit cannot be segregated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand how the power impacts Windows when it is supposedly shut down.&nbsp; I have to experiment a couple of more nights to see if this condition can be duplicated. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Due the Modem and router both shut off at the same time when you turn off the power to the room?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Set Time Zone is on it will try to get the time zone from your intenet location, if no internet it will default to Local set in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix to Windows is to turn <strong>Set Time&nbsp;</strong><strong>Automatically</strong>&nbsp; and
<strong>Set Time Zone Automatically</strong> to off. Then windows will use the time from your bios, and the time zone you manually set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to do it when I travel. see example:</p>

<p>My router and modem are in a different room that has power 24/7.&nbsp; My settings are set to automatically update time and manually set time zone on the PC.&nbsp; The time zone is correct.&nbsp; The PC is connected to the router via Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sunday night I left the PC room power on but shut down the PC.&nbsp; Monday AM when I turned on the PC Win 10 showed the correct time and it maintained the correct time all day.&nbsp; I shut down Windows and turned off the room power as usual on Monday evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At startup on Tuesday morning Windows showed the correct time and maintained the correct time all day.&nbsp; Hmmm?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down the PC and the room power as normal on Tuesday evening.&nbsp; Wednesday morning Windows shows time 4 hours advanced when I turned on the PC (11:15 AM rather than 7:15 AM).&nbsp; I checked the settings time zone and it is correct. &nbsp; The PC has been on more
 than an hour and the time is still 4 hours advanced.&nbsp; I don't know how often Windows queries Microsoft for the time adjustment.</p>

<p>More Wednesday update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed Windows and started Ubuntu.&nbsp; It shows the correct time.</p>
<p>I closed Ubuntu and looked at the BIOS settings.&nbsp; The Bios clock is 4 hours advanced.&nbsp; Hmmm?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC had a brand new Duracell battery installed on Saturday. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the battery is bad why does Ubuntu show the correct time on startup and Windows yet doesn't after more than an hour of Internet connection? &nbsp; Also, if the battery is bad why is the startup time consistently 4 hours ahead rather than behind or stuck at
 some static value?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS has been updated by Dell.&nbsp; So this may be a PC specific problem.&nbsp; I'll try starting up without the Ethernet connected to see if Ubuntu is just resetting time earlier than Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More Wednesday morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected the router from the PC.&nbsp; Windows started with the time 4 hours advanced as provided by the BIOS clock.&nbsp; Ubuntu started with the correct time so it isn't getting time corrected from the Internet at startup.&nbsp; So somehow Ubuntu knows to adjust
 the BIOS time.&nbsp; I don't pretend to understand anything about how the time is set in either operating system or in the BIOS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It presents an interesting conflict.&nbsp; I'm guessing that I'm just going to have to ignore the situation and manually adjust Windows time when I need to.&nbsp; Perhaps the error in BIOS time is an indication of a creeping malady in the PC.&nbsp; It shouldn't be malware
 because the hard drive was reformatted last week with the operating systems and all software reinstalled from new vendor downloads.&nbsp; I don't open email on this PC and it isn't networked with my other computers.&nbsp; I'll just have to wait to find out. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            my pc is showing 2 OS Windows 10 and windows 10 home</h2>
                    I began having issues when windows 10 was auto installed on my pc and since then i have been stuck in repair loops and keep getting a new error daily. Today my pc started up saying i have drive errors and needed to restart to repair, after doing that a
 couple times i used an online resource to find the solution " restore your pc ". And now my issue is seems to be that i have more than one OS and one is basically obsolete. Windows 10 home doesnt work when i try to use it so i am wondering how I can remove
 it. Also I am not very tech savvy so any reply i get needs to be in a step by step process in lamens terms so i can do what is needed to fix it.

<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having two operating systems installed with the option to choose between them when booting is known as
<strong>Dual-Boot</strong>. If you want to return to only using a single operating system, you can follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make sure to back up your personal files</p>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer, we recommend that you back up your files to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove Windows 10 home boot loader files</p>
<p>These are the steps you can follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>msconfig</strong> then hit <strong>Enter</strong> to open <strong>
System Configuration</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>Boot</strong> tab and you'll see both Windows OS you have in your computer.</li><li>Select the Windows OS <strong>you want to keep</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Set as Default</strong>.</li><li>Select the Windows OS <strong>you want to delete</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Delete</strong> to delete it from boot sequence.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>System Configuration</strong> window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>However, Windows 10 Home installation files are still available in the system. To delete those files simply delete the folder where Windows 10 Home is installed or you can format the hard disk drive where Windows 10 Home is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you further assistance, let us know.</p>

                    I currently run IntelliType 7.1 under Win'7.&nbsp; However, under the keyboard settings, my keyboard (Internet Keyboard Pro - the USB/PS2 keyboard with the 19 soft keys) is missing.&nbsp; Could it be added?&nbsp; It does feature in previous versions of IntelliType.&nbsp;
 The closest keyboard to mine in the current selection is the Multimedia Keyboard, but when I open the k/b properties with that settings, it takes a very long time to respond. &nbsp;

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have the latest version of IntelliType (7.1&nbsp; 2009-11-12&nbsp; ITPx86_1033_7.10.344.0) and it does not list the Internet Keyboard
<strong>Pro</strong> (Model No RT9420 V 5FTWXX, Product ID 51742-868-2033292-20008).&nbsp; The plain Internet Keyboard is listed tho (less hot keys), but mine not (mine has the
<strong>19</strong> hot keys).&nbsp; My Windows is also up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx!</p>

            I am also looking for the Internet Keyboard Pro type keyboard drivers. I am also running the latest Intellitype driver available for X64bit system 7.10.344.0 but the only keyboard type listed in the selection list of keyboards supported is the internet
 keyboard with only 10 special function keys listed. The Internet Keyboard Pro is not listed which has 19 special function keys (Back, Forward, Stop, Refresh, Search, Favorites, Web/Home, Mail, Mute, -Vol, +Vol, Play/Pause, Stop, Prev Teack, Next Track, Media,
 My Computer, Calculator, and Sleep). This keyboard version has not been available for the last 4 driver updates. Why???

            <p>Hi Jason,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are trying to know if you can run AutoCAD Civil 3D 2013 on a Windows 8 64 bit computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the AutoDesk website the program is compatible with Windows 7 operating systems. Check out
<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=15444804&amp;linkID=9240697#section6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link </a>from the support website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if there is a need, you may still install the same on Windows 8 in Windows 7 comaptibility mode. Here`s how you do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the <strong>setup</strong> file (the setup.exe file for the program) and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now click on the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which says Run
<strong>this program in compatibility mode for.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Windows&nbsp;7</strong>. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Now right click the setup file and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> and follow the normal installation procedure. Check to see if it helps.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Also see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link </a>for more information. Do reply if you have more questions. Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>Do I have to pay for Windows 10 after the &#34;free upgrade&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kate_watkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I have to pay for Windows 10 after the &#34;free upgrade&#34; period elapses&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I understand it is free to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 and 8 for a period of time (Until July 29, 2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I do complete the 'free upgrade', will I ever be billed for Windows 10, such as after the free upgrade period?</p>
<p>Or will there never be a required payment for windows 10 if obtained through this offer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

            <p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</em></span><span><em>‚Äì</em></span><span><em>at no additional charge. </em></span></p>

<p>---------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>

<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>
