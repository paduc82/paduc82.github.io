    <title>Valid inbound rule in windows firewall&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Valid inbound rule in windows firewall&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I was bitten by an alert that windows defender had stopped an attack however I should not do anything before contacting MICROSOFT CERTIFIED HELP DESK SUPPORT and absolutely do not shutdown the computer as data loss and an unbootable system could
 be the result. My screen was frozen and computer beeping so after trying a couple things i called the number (855-335-7701). Long story short they were trying to pass themselves off as SkyService247 and wanted to protect my computer for an annual fee. Never
 did find out how much. When they added a syskey password I pulled the plug. Luckily I had a restore point set earlier in the day so when my computer failed to reboot, I was able to restore it and it works OK now.</p>
<p>However, I see an entry in the inbound rules for windows firewall that simply has a name of G, no properties info, and the program is noted as C and they affect either the TCP or ICMPv4 protocol. 36 of these in the inbound rule for the firewall.</p>
<p>My question is are these valid and should they be allowed? I cannot seem to locate any information on these so any feedback will be most appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the links - mostly familiar with the topics. This one just got me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway the inbound rule is shown above. I did cycle the firewall on and off and it reduced the 36 rules down to the one shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error msg but I would expect some detail to the entry. Below shows some of the properties detail</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Battery Drain While Gaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin_001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Battery Drain While Gaming</h2>
                    <p>It has already been noted that the Surface Book 2 charging brick is not powerful enough to keep the laptop charging while gaming.&nbsp; I have first hand experience with this playing Mass Effect Andromeda.&nbsp; It's a slow drain but still enough to have to stop gaming
 short of the time I would game for.&nbsp; I bought it exclusively for the purpose of being able to game while on the road traveling.&nbsp; Microsoft should offer a free swap for a new more powerful charging brick unless they can fix it with an update.&nbsp; This was not
 listed as a feature when I bought it.&nbsp; Yes that was sarcasm.&nbsp; This is a $3200 machine and that's not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping MIcrosoft reads through these posts and actually cares to take care of it's customers on an oversight as dumb as this.&nbsp; Who the heck didn't test this?&nbsp; Why would Microsoft not say anything if they knew this?&nbsp; Shame on Microsoft for letting this
 happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-confirms-surface-book-2-battery-drain-problems-while-gaming</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amount of time your battery lasts will vary depending on the kinds of things you do with your Surface. You may watch this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F18ZmfUmKlQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/F18ZmfUmKlQ?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/F18ZmfUmKlQ?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> on how you can optimize your Surface battery. Also, you can read this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20443/windows-10-battery-saving-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for additional tips how you can extend your Surface's battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On some Surface models you can use Power Mode to adjust how much battery power your Surface is using. Select the battery icon in the Windows taskbar. Move the slider to adjust the Power Mode to a lower setting such as
<strong>Recommended </strong>or <strong>Battery saver</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the latest updates will help keep your Surface performing at its best. For more information on how to install Surface and Windows updates, click

<p>Posting a generic response like this is somewhat insulting.&nbsp; I related to a SPECIFIC KNOWN ISSUE in my statement.&nbsp; That specific known issue is that the battery drains while gaming.&nbsp; I already am well aware you can change the settings for battery performance.&nbsp;
 Setting it to any battery performance method still produces battery drain while gaming.&nbsp; Do you honestly believe I should have to be g<span>aming in Battery Saver Mode while connected to power...Come on man!!!!&nbsp; That's just
 ignorant.&nbsp; You might as well have asked me if it was plugged in and did you try plugging in another device to the outlet to make sure it's getting power.&nbsp; You could have responded with please contact tech support via phone so they can troubleshoot the issue
 further and that would have been more acceptable.&nbsp; Which I already did by the way.&nbsp; They didn't have an answer either and it seemed I knew more about the device than the tech I spoke to.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>The amount of time your battery lasts will vary depending on the kinds of things you do with your Surface."&nbsp; Thanks Captain Obvious!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"On some surface models"&nbsp; Yeah...Well I was specific and stated clearly that this is a SURFACEBOOK 2!!!&nbsp; So talking about "some surface models" is irrelevant to me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Why don't you guys (Microsoft, a multi-billion dollar company that sells millions of devices) try to re-create the issue ( on the previously mentioned SURFACE BOOK 2) and then reply with your results and a valid response
 to the specific issue.&nbsp; It's obviously an issue that's been put out there on the web so I would think it would be worth your time to figure out what the issue is.&nbsp; I even gave a link to an article about it.&nbsp; There are more articles that mention it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I returned my unit.&nbsp; I'm not going to sit around and wait for a fix that might come some day or be hopeful a future update addresses the issue. I will absolutely avoid Microsoft products in the future if possible.&nbsp;
 Especially Surface.&nbsp; My Surface pro 4 I had died on me after 1 year and 1 month just placing it out of warranty.&nbsp; I had to fork up another $450 for a replacement and that replacement now has a screen issue.&nbsp; It also was a 256GB model rather than the 512GB
 I had.&nbsp; I bought the Surface book&nbsp;2 because&nbsp;apparently I'm a sucker for issues.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought this specifically because&nbsp;I travel a lot and would like to game at night on the road after work.&nbsp; Meaning I would have to plug it in at work always as the battery might not last when I finally sit down to game
 with it at the end of the day.&nbsp; That's not always possible as I don't always have access to power in my line of work during the day.&nbsp; That's why I wanted the long battery life also.&nbsp; Fool me once, shame on you.&nbsp; Fool me twice, shame on me.&nbsp; I went for a third
 time.&nbsp; It's the last!!!</span></p>

</p><p>Sad to see this is happening to premium model such as Surface Book 2 and yet Microsoft Support still provide cut and paste generic answer which they know will not solve the issue at all. You can do this in 80s when internet connection speed is still 512k

</p><p>Admit you are aware on the problems, reassure us you are working on the solutions, update us with the progress, provide us beta firmware...show us you are sincerely looking at the it. Else, you are losing customer who thinks there is hope in Microsoft's

<h3> josephtorrente  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD graphical glitch</h2>
                    <p>I am talking about a glitch in BSOD not a glitch that causes BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win10 device running i5, 4GB Ram, NVIDIA 820M graphics card went bluescreen earlier due to debugging a Visual C++ code when RAM usage is near 100% (Edge crashed and it spiked my Ram and Disk usage to 100% dunno why and I have to restart to solve that,
 which I haven't done yet when the BSOD happened).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is it supposed to look like the BSOD of Win8.1 (I saw a very distorted :( emoticon and most part is Blue so I presume it is) but what happens is that it is glitched. Literally glitched to the point that I can't even see anything on the screen than
 a bunch distorted graphics. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated all of my graphics card to their latest version through windows update and checked on nvidia's site as well to make sure incase anyone would tell it's my graphics card.</p>

<h3> p.jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Kinect 360 - what can I do with it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just bought a Kinect 360 system for Windows (I'm using Windows 10) just to have a play around (the Kinect 2 is rather more expensive and I'd need a silly expensive adapter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 and have the 1.8 SDK installed; all the drivers are showing correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, what exactly can I do with it? I can't find any software that works with it (everything for Windows 10 seems to require the Kinect 2) and it won't even function as a webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found a few utilities out there, but they seem to depend on 3rd part drivers and not the official Microsoft ones; have I wasted my money?</p>

<h2>            forcing ready boost</h2>
                    <p>is there any way to force windows 10 to use my sd card for ReadyBoost. I have a MeeGoPad T01 with only 2gb ddr3 ram and I'd like to use ReadyBoost with my 16gb sd card to increase performance and available memory for apps and such. Does anyone know of a
 way to do this as under the ReadyBoost tab in properties it says unable to use ReadyBoost&nbsp;as system is already fast enough? Thanks in advance for any help</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you may already know, cache is being saved on the HDD by default, thus the system will not enable the Readyboost if the system detects that it is not needed.</p>

    <title>How to Prevent installation of software and IE extensions&#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maggie9000  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Prevent installation of software and IE extensions&#47; toolbars etc.</h2>
                    I am trying to help a small home-based business with a Windows 7 PC with IE 9. The PC is used for normal business purposes: Microsoft Office documents, email (AOL app), editing videos and burning them to DVD and/or uploading to YouTube and Vimeo, and searching
 in Internet Explorer for normal and legitimate business use
<div>My questions are as follows (explained after):
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All of the PCs here have Microsoft Family Safety and Microsoft Security Essentials installed. None of the PCs should be able to be used for ANYTHING (not just internet) between midnight and 8am.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>1.How can I have Internet Explorer 9 in Windows 7 automatically reset to its default state when it's closed? As if it was a PC in an internet cafe, library or school?&nbsp;This is to prevent the installation (either intentional or accidental) of toolbars, extensions,
 etc. into IE 9, If at all possible, I'd like to keep Google as the default search provider and home page; in addition "regular" extensions such as Flash Player, Real Player and Acrobat Reader have to remain in place and JavaScript has to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. The son has somehow managed to resume using his own PCs (and perhaps the business PC) at the restricted hours. I assume he got the Windows 7 SysInternals disc to remove the administrative password. Is there a way I can prevent this from happening again
 after reapplying the restrictions? Perhaps he simply restored the system from its restore partition or reinstalled Windows so I need a way of preventing these things from happening as well. Would a firmware password do the trick?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This probably wouldn't have happened if there was a way to allow the installation of software in a Standard Account. On the son's own PCs, it's okay if he installs software, browser toolbars and so on -- even if it's malware. It's only the business PC
 that needs to be free of this. It's also possible that he installed this junk on the business PC as some form of retribution.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is not possible to force the business users to use Firefox or Chrome instead of IE. And IE suffered from some bad extensions that were installed into Chrome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Explanation:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The adult son of the business owner uses this PC to occasionally do work for the business, but more often for his own use. The son, who may be a bit mentally ill and lives with his father in the home where the business is, keeps installing unwanted, unsafe
 malware extensions, toolbars and search providers in Internet Explorer and changing the home page. The office workers may have also unintentionally installed some malware search providers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On occasion, the son does work for the business, so has to have use of the business' PC. However, he often uses the PC for his own purposes which includes things like trying to download copyrighted content (movies, TV and music) without paying for it.
 It appears that he sometimes spend time searching for free games. (Before I put on the parental controls, he had installed many of these. He still frequently installs toolbars, extensions and search providers in IE to facilitate this [downloading of copyrighted
 media] and [probably] gets some of them simply by visiting the kinds of malicious websites that claim to offer free stuff. The son has four PCs of his own, most of which are unusable due to multiple malware infections.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The business owner had me install parental controls on the son's PC in addition to the business PC to prevent the use of any computer between the hours of midnight and 8am when the son is supposed to either sleep or study and not play games or use the
 computer for ANYTHING else. According to the business owner, the son's psychiatrist said that the son must sleep during these hours every day.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is now not possible for me to ask the son any questions -- he is understandably very unhappy about not being able to install any software on hie own PCs. Not that I was all that happy about doing this to him, but he's not the one paying me.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry this was so long. The situation is somewhat stressful.</div>
                </div>

            <p>A knowledgable user can bypass/get around any admin account log-on password, using any of the methods found in an internet search.</p>
<p>You could try setting up seperate restricted user accounts for normal use.</p>
<p>You might also want to set up another admin account, with the password reset/recovery disk for your own use. (In case a user causes problems in their attempt to bypass the restrictions)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming the PC's are networked/connected via a routor, a decent one has the capabilities both to restrict the sites accessed and to prevent net access between certain hours, both on a PC by PC basis.</p>
<p>There is third party software, as used on some PC's accessed by the public in the scenario you mentioned, allthough how this would impact on normal buisness type useage I could'nt say.</p>
<p>Some third party Internet Security apps also have the ability to restrict access/use their own parental type controls&nbsp;</p>

<h3> marshull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal 500gb Seagate Barracuda has gone missing after upgrading from XP SP3 to Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have 3 internal hard drives. Everything was fine when i was running XP SP3. But after upgrading to Windows 7, I lost one of my internal hard drives. It also does not show up in the BIOs either.</p>
<p>Missing drive is:</p>
<p>SATA Seagate Barracuda 500gb 7200.11</p>
<p>ST3500320AS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When rebooting, the BIOs hangs for a bit at detecting IDE devices. It does not do this if the drive is unplugged.</p>
<p>When windows begins to start, it hangs for about 5-10 minutes as the four colored dots appear just before they form the MS logo. It does not do this if the drive is unplugged. Drive also no longer show sup in the device manager.</p>
<p>I can not update the firmware on the drive as it is not seen by anything. I have tried to use Seagates diskfix tool and it can not find the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured something happened when I upgraded to W7, duh, and went to install XP on one of the other drives to see if that might get the back back online. I can not boot from the system disk as it says there is a system error and to boot from the system disk
 which s what I am doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So something went screwy. Any ideas?</p>

<p>If it does not show up in the BIOS, it might have died and gone to hard drive heaven.&nbsp; You did backup everything before you changed operating systems, didn't you?</p>
<p>Check the serial number with Seagate, hopefully it's not an OEM drive and has a 5 year warranty.&nbsp; They won't replace the data, but they will replace the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drive is removed from the PC, does it start faster?</p>

<p>Yes, if i remove the drive, the system starts up much faster. So i now it is trying to access it and just cant find what it is looking for. I would be very surprised if the drive died. Seems more likely something happened after upgrading to W7. It was working
 fine with no issues before then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea how I could install XP on a separate drive? Thinking that if I could get XP installed that the drive would come back.</p>
Edit- This drive was also not a main hard drive. It was just a second internal hard drive. No idea why upgrading to W7 would do this. Thinking it did something though.

<p>Did you remember to install the motherboard chipset drivers?&nbsp; And check the BIOS to make sure your drive order is set correctly.&nbsp; You can also install XP (multibook system) but it needs either a separate hard drive or a separate partition on the primary
 drive, you must NOT install two operating systems in the same partition, they will argue endlessly and drive you insane.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The album art should appear when in the "now playing" View. However, if you select an artist's album, the album art is not displayed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the upper right hand there is a View Options drop down. Change the view from Details to Expanded Tiles and the artwork for the album should reappear.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, then go to&nbsp;Action Center. Click on Troubleshooting. <br />
Click on View all on&nbsp;the left hand side, then select Windows Media Player troubleshooting
<br />
options</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer this link and check if it helps:<br />

            <p>I don't think I explained this fully.&nbsp; I rip a CD into Windows Media player.&nbsp; The CD is from a local band so the information (track names, band name, composer, artwork, etc.) is not found on-line.&nbsp; The ripped WMA files are stored in my media location under
 the folder names 'UNKNOWN'.</p>
<p>I manually edit all the information for the CD; title, band name, track names, etc.&nbsp; All the WMA files are now moved to a folder 'title', contained in the folder 'artistname'.</p>
<p>I manually add artwork by copying a scanned file of the CD cover and paste it into Windows Media Player.&nbsp; The moment I click 'paste artwork', the program takes me back to my library listing of all artists.&nbsp; If I scroll down to where this artist should be,
 it's gone.&nbsp; If I look for the information using Windows Explorer, the 'artist name' folder is there, the 'disc name or title' folder is there, but it's empty!&nbsp; All the WMA files (music) are gone.&nbsp; Searching my computer finds nothing.&nbsp; Files are deleted...poof!</p>
<p>If I rip the CD, manually edit all the information EXCEPT the artwork, no problems, no issues.</p>
<p>Adding artwork causes the wma files to disappear.&nbsp; The music files do not go to the recycle bin, they're just gone.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#40;64 bit&#41; gives blue screen after awaking from sleep while a usb device is plugged in</h2>
                    Windows 7 (64 bit) gives a blue screen after waking from sleep while a usb device is plugged in,<br />
I think the problem is something with the usb settings or so because when there is no usb device plugged in there is no blue screen after awaking from sleep<br />

<h2>            Can xbox live free account play Modern Warfare 3 online&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Can any one give any advise?</p>
<p>I am able to play MW3 online with my Xbox live free account for twice last week.</p>
<p>Until last night, when I try playing MW3 online, it tells me that my profile is not able to play Xbox Live.</p>
<p>And I'm stuck with Campaign mode and Special Ops mode.</p>
<p>Do I really need to get Xbox live Gold to get MW3 online? This sounds abit ridiculous as I am able to get MW3 online for twice.</p>
<p>Appreciate your comments and advice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>im not sure if you may have been using an xbox live 2 day pass that may have came with your copy (as it did with my copy) or even came to the end of your xbox live subscription. But to play online you need a Xbox live gold account. Is your account new and
 have been using the free month on your xbox?</p>
<p>You can check to see if you have had Gold by checking your account details on xbox.com, sign in and go to account then membership. and check to see if anything has expired.</p>
<p>thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Dudes,</p>
<p>Thank for the comments and replies. I am not a new user and have been a free xbox live user since July 2011. Crossed the 1 or 3 months free Gold subscription.</p>
<p>I have also checked on my account and it is still Xbox live free account. </p>
<p>As what Smwutches reply, then a Gold member would bring me to Online version.</p>
<p>Still, this sounds abit crapped as I need to pay to be play online????</p>
<p>Ridiculous...... sigh........</p>

<p>I know there was a free gold weekend not to long ago. It's a promotion where free members are able to play as gold for the that one weekend. They happen fairly often, but besides those times you'll need to pay for gold to play online with others</p>

<p>No &nbsp;you cannot, but al you need is a gold subscription or a 24/48 hour trial and you can jump straight on mw3 online and start having fun straight away, check to see if you have any spare trials

<p>Sorry about that, Polly0911. As others have mentioned a Gold membership is necessary to play Modern Warfare 3 online. If you have any further questions, please create a new thread for us and we'll be more than happy to assist! Thanks in advance.

<h2>            Windows 10 and usig a high gamute monitor like eizo cs240</h2>
                    Hi i am using a desktop with a monitor eizo cs240, its calibrated with eizo colornavigaror for correct color managment for editing photos in photo editing software. The software i use recognizes the color calibration but in windows if i add a wallpaper&nbsp;
 on tu the desktop&nbsp;or use a windows picture preview the colores are not correct if the calibration is made of the monitores RGB gamute the colores are to much saturated. Is there a solution to this problem that does not demand a second calibration to srgb ?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The color calibration software that you are using is for the monitor itself and it does not affect the system. We suggest that you use the graphic settings on your computer like the Intel Graphics control panel (depends on the video adapter) so that changes
 are being made in the system. You check the picture below for reference:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/484778c4-5860-47b5-ada9-857c6ee30042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/484778c4-5860-47b5-ada9-857c6ee30042" /></a></p>
<p>If you still want to use the Color navigator that you have mentioned, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Well i don't think that in any way this is a correct answer to the problem. It only shows that windows still has problems with color managment especially when you usue high gamute monitor's. Its nota the manufacturers problem thet the softwere doesn't
 recognises rgb color range correctly. Especially when other software used on that platform do it in the way they should.

<h2>            File History with no &#34;select drive&#34; option</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an HP Envy with Windows 8'1 installed. I am trying to create a file backup disk but when I open file history in control panel, on the left side where it normally shows "restore personal files" "select drive" "exclude folders" "advanced
 settings" there is nothing there. No option to "select drive". </p>
<p>I have a Seagate 300 GB USB connected I would like to us and although the system does recognize this drive, there is no way to connect for file as there is no option for me to do so.
</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<p>nope once set a region cannot be changed</p>
<p>you need to create a new account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 conditions must be met for region lock </p>
<p>same region disk + same region account + same region physical location </p>
<p>so japan+ &nbsp;japan + japan</p>
<p>most dlc can be shared accross accounts as long as it is the purchasing console</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however because you would have to purchase a japanese disk you need to check if it is compatible with your console region free</p>
<p>renting a&nbsp;disk works to test this</p>
<p>if it works great</p>
<p>if it doesn't either buy a japanese console or wait till you are back in the US</p>
<p>&nbsp;you will have to use a prepaid membership card as us billing address will not work on a japanese account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question about clearing cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> requiredcube656  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about clearing cache</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I know that clearing the system cache will delete any update files that are 8mb or smaller.</p>
<p>Will clearing just the game cache also delete update files&nbsp;that are 8mb or smaller?</p>
<p>I have asked this question in the past, not in these forums though, and I got a dozen different answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Thanks</p>

<p>RequiredCube656 hey there :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please explain what you mean by clearing just the game cache, or what you are trying to achieve? On the console, there is only one cache that you can clear and that is your system cache. Clearing your system cache removes items such as,&nbsp;game updates,
 system update installation packages and gamer pictures of your friends etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Cloud&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also clear the game cache by holding down LB, RB and X while the game is loading from title screen to start screen. I have always assumed it does the same thing as clearing the system cache except by doing it this way you can just clear the game
 cache for a specific game instead of clearing the cache for all the games you may have on your Xbox, which is what happens when you clear the system cache through settings.</p>
<p>I just thought that maybe there were minor differences. Maybe just doing the game cache would not delete updates files &nbsp;that are smaller than 8mb like clearing the system cache will do.</p>
<p>I really do not think there is any difference though except for what I stated above.</p>

<p>I will give an example; &nbsp;Lets say I have Skyrim and Oblivion on my Xbox HD. When I clear the system cache I will be prompted to reinstall the latest updates for both Skyrim and Oblivion whenever I go to play each game.</p>
<p>But, if I&nbsp;clear&nbsp;the&nbsp;game cache on Skyrim by holding RB, LB and X during the Skyrim title screen will I still be prompted to reinstall the updates for both Skyrim and Oblivion or did it only clear Skyrim's game cache by doing it that way and not the whole
 system?</p>

<p>Clearing a game's cache will do the same thing as clearing the system cache through the System Settings section of your Xbox 360. So essentially you are doing the same thing either way, except RB-LB-X will only clear that one game's cache.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also I am not positive if the RB-LB-X method works with all games, but if you need to clear a cache for a game you might as well try it. If you don't see results you could always do the system cache clear.</p>

<p>I apologize if I am causing any confusion with this question but I can't think of a better way to explain what I am trying to figure out here. Maybe I am the one that is confused, lol</p>
<p>Although, a lot of people don't even realize that the LB,RB, and X option of clearing the game cache even exist on the Xbox slim. Most people just know about the way to clear system cache through settings.</p>
