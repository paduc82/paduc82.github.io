                    <p>I'm on a 4th. generation iPad.</p>
<p>A few days ago I noticed that a new "Junk" folder had appeared in my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>I already have a "Junk email" folder which I think is normal.</p>
<p>How do I delete this new folder ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, we'd like to get the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes or applied an update to your device before the issue occurred?</li><li>Have you recently added a new email account on your Hotmail account?</li><li>Have you tried using a different browser and then check if the additional Junk folder will also appear?</li></ul>

            <p>Hi Paola</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your speedy reply.</p>
<p>I applied an update to the Outlook app on 8th.March. I don't think the "rogue" folder was there before that.</p>
<p>I haven't added an email account recently, but my wife opened one about 2 months ago. She is on .com, but I am on .co.uk.</p>
<p>This would hardly affect it surely.</p>
<p>I tried accessing my Hotmail account from Firefox (just downloaded the app), but the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that this is an "Apple" problem or a "Microsoft" one ?</p>
<p>It is not a big deal, but I would like to delete the folder if possible, but don't know how to go about it.</p>
<p>Any ideas will be gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't right-click - it's an iPad - there is no mouse.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that if you tap and hold on the text that you wish to delete, it's the same as right clicking, and it gives you the option to delete, but it doesn't work for me.</p>

            <p>Hi Paola</p>
<p>I have not thought about the problem for a few days, so thought that I would try again.</p>
<p>I logged on to my Outlook account via Firefox, but despite looking at all the options, I cannot see any option to delete the "rogue" folder.</p>
<p>Surely there must be an answer to this problem somewhere, even using an iPad with no ability to right-click.</p>
<p>Maybe it will correct itself one day with an app update, as I suspect that this is how it happened in the first place,</p>

    <title>Unable to activate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clever one  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to activate</h2>
                    <p>I participated in the Windows Insider program and now that I have upgraded to the full version I cannot activate the software.&nbsp; I am using a Dell Laptop that I believe had the original 8.1 key "injected" into the motherboard so I can't try that key (which
 was my first idea).&nbsp; I had activation problems in Insider but I was hoping that they would be fixed when the official version rolled out.&nbsp; I would like to avoid formatting to factory settings if possible (not even sure if it would work at this point).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Additional Information.&nbsp; Before installing the preview build I had "reserved" my copy on this machine.&nbsp; I haven't made any hardware changes only the install of the Win 10 preview.&nbsp; Is there any way to access that through my Microsoft account?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2:&nbsp; I am currently a student, so if anyone knows of a student upgrade that could be a possible workaround.&nbsp; I have tried dreamspark and my university page but sometimes these editions are hidden pretty well.</p>

<p>I move files from one folder within OneDrive to another within OneDrive and about 15 seconds or so, they move back to the original location.&nbsp; If I copy, then the new one disappears.&nbsp; If I move, then it goes back to original location.&nbsp; I also tried to rename
 then save it and it doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same issue occurs with web client and the app.</p>
<p>i have uninstalled and reinstalled desktop app with no success.</p>
<p>Is anyone else having the similar issue on a Mac?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for not responding sooner.&nbsp; After being on the phone with GoDaddy for a loooong time, they had me change name of the files which resulted in being able to move them and have them stay as intended.&nbsp; I will, however, add that in other folders,
 there are files with the exact same name nomenclature and they never had such issues.&nbsp; This has been a mystery which isn't solved but it is resolved for the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having another separate issue.&nbsp; Whenever I open a MS Excel file from one of my OneDrive folders, it almost always "Read Only" version and is locked for editing unless I hit the Edit button.&nbsp; If I simply make revisions and then hit Save, then it says
 that file cannot be saved as it is being used to open another file with the same name.&nbsp; Very frustrating at times as you have to then change the name of the file, save it, and then save it again with intended name followed by deleting the duplicate file no
 longer needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, how do I stop Microsoft from having AutoSave turned on for ALL files?&nbsp; Whenever you save a new file, it turns it on.&nbsp; I want it OFF for all files unless I specifically turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I will take this opportunity to slam Microsoft and GoDaddy.&nbsp; I was volleyed back and forth between them as they both said that I should call the other for technical support.</p>
<p>GoDaddy says that they are only the resellers of MS products and only have the capabilities to handle email related tech issues.&nbsp; All other issues such as OneDrive should be referred to MS as they are the developers of this product and GoDaddy doesn't have
 the knowledge to help.&nbsp; When I contacted MS, they said that PER LEGAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS they are not able to offer tech support to customers of GoDaddy.&nbsp; I was on the phone with MS and GD from 8pm till midnight and really got no real resolution other
 than the fact that if it happens again, just change the names and see if that resolves it.</p>

<p>Sometimes its not nokia who makes thr problem but the phone's users who hacks, installs whatever software and all that. I bet you can read around here about a lot of people who are having problems with their 5800. I'm proud to say that I haven't hacked mine
 nor installed weird software, or even downloaded software OTA (only through wifi or computer) and I've yet to experience a single bug, even the supposed v30 bugs are yet to show up. In fact my phone worked even better after the update. So please don't just
 go out and yell nokia sucks when people are often doing things to their phones which they aren't supposed to do in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also, if your phone is new and under warranty, you can always have it replaced from the store you bought it from.</p>

<p>Have you installed apps in your mobile?If yes, maybe this cause problems to your mobile.Some mobile phones are sensitive to apps.Uninstall all the apps, and do a factory settings reset.If it works and the problem/problems stopped, don't install again any
 app (untill you update your firmware) because maybe you will face the same, or similar problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Factory settings reset. In standby, dial *#7780# and the phone's security code (the nokia's default security code is 12345). This reset restores phone's original settings.</p>

<p>Why the hell do you guys own these phones?&nbsp; Why do you waste your money on phones you don't wanna make full use of?</p>
<p>Apps are there to enhance the whole smartphone experience and if the phone can not handle apps approved by Nokia themselves then surely there must be a problem somewhere.</p>

<p>Phatdumi, i agree with that you said, the applications 'bring live' to mobiles (<em>Apps are there to enhance the whole smartphone experience</em>&nbsp;you wrote).But, for some phones, applications can cause problems to them. For example, my N82 now it's okay,
 but if i install any application, it will&nbsp;freezes (depends from the application).This is because of the firmware, the apps you install, problematic device, or anything else, like, in which&nbsp;the memory (phone's memory or memory card)&nbsp;you install the apps.</p>

            FirstKnight did you try what I suggested to you. All this arguing wont help anything, lets focus on trying to get your phone in good working condition again. I know how it feels to spend a lot of money on something and only to find that it doesn't even
 function.

            This almost works, I can copy the time values from the 'short time' into the 'short date', but then anywhere else system wide (including when I open an email) I am shown the time + the date + the time again, so it doesn't really solve the problem without
 creating a new, more globally annoying one.

<p>I'd advise suggesting there. If you want gapless playback, you can request the feature there if it's not already on the phone in some setting or means. Some people don't like the gapless playback and want to know the difference as they use their phones for
 different things other than music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ex: Podcasts, Podrunner, etc.</p>

<h2>            Runtime 2010 Crashes when another user opens it on Terminal Server - 2003.</h2>
                    I recently installed Access Runtime 2010 along with SP1 on a Terminal Server running 2003.
<br />
<br />
If a user has a database open in 2010 and another user logs in and opens a different database in 2010, it will close the other users database instantly. No error message, no warning, no indication as to why.
<br />
<br />
Is seems as though the server is only capable of running a single instance of Runtime 2010.
<br />
<br />
Any idea what would cause this?<br />
<br />

            <p>Each user should be opening a SEPARATE COPY of the frontend.&nbsp; This should be split into a backend (tables only) and a frontend (the rest).&nbsp; Then EACH user should have a separate copy of the database frontend.&nbsp; You can have the shortcut to it actually be

    <title>Local time for contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eschelar&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Local time for contacts</h2>
                    <p>So we have a new forum thingy, which locks the previous discussions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS NEEDS TO BE TOP OF THE HEAP MICROSOFT/SKYPE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am one of many users who opposed strongly the FIRST TIME that Skype removed the contacts time display. There are countless reasons why this was and is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
As a user calling others, I like to check what time it is because I don't want to disturb them at certain times of the day. Friends, I don't like to call during working hours. Business contacts, I don't like to contact them outside of working hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype is GLOBAL by its very nature and TIME is a major factor for ANYTHING GLOBAL, it should be obvious to anyone that having quick and easy access to the local time of the contact is a MAJOR CORE FUNCTION of a GLOBAL communication program.<br />
<br />
Just since this past removal, I have been called NINE TIMES in the hours between 1am and 4am by people outside of this time zone. I have no choice but to keep my Skype online 24/7 in case of emergency because of my role here. However, NONE of those NINE calls
 in the past couple of months have been emergencies. NONE of those calls could have been avoided by any mechanism currently in Skype. ALL of those calls could have been avoided if Skype still showed the time.<br />
<br />
This is a pointed example of how Microsoft, Windows 10 and Skype are all moving in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM PROGRESS. Removing functions IS NOT PROGRESS. REMOVING IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS that help prevent loss of sleep for trivial concerns to which stupid people
 can credibly plead ignorance IS NOT PROGRESS. Making software LESS user friendly and less convenient is NOT PROGRESS.<br />
<br />
If you have this issue, please share your experience here so we can point to it for any Microsoftians who might happen by, but MORE IMPORTANTLY - take your post to Skype. Under the menu, help section, you will find "Give Feedback". Please post your comments
 there as well. At least that one is read by Skype devs.<br />
<br />
Very few people will be annoyed by this enough to take action, so Skype devs are likely enjoying the bliss of ignorance and resulting confirmation bias. But at least it's SOMETHING to help counteract this blatant contravention of logic that appears to be taking
 over the world of programming.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[I have moved this to the Skype for Windows 10 Feature suggestions board although you want it on all clients this is likely to be the board where it will get the most attention, users who support this idea please click me too below]</p>

 at an inappropriate time.

YES, YES, YES!!!! Please bring back the time. I have a Son in another country going to school and while I can mentally make the time change, it would be helpful to see it at a glance like before. I've been using Skype for at least three years and it is a great
 aid in staying in touch. Can't tell you how many times I've gotten the time zone wrong and woke my Son up by accident. I've been searching the community board to post this for three months. Skype support, isn't user friendly at all. If the purpose for Skype
 was to keep people in communication, it is my opinion that Skype has, "shot themselves in the foot" so to speak by removing this. It hinders my usage and reaching out.<br />
<br />
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back or if someone knows how I can get this to show on Skype again, please email me:

            <p>The "time", or timezone, for the city of my contact does not display (not even in the contact profile). &nbsp;it used to show there before i upgraded to the new skype version. &nbsp;what happened and how can i get that back? &nbsp;it is annoying because i want to see the
 local time for my contact like I used to. i do alot of calls around the world and it is much easier than for me to do the timezone conversion in my head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is a link to a picture on the help pages of the Contact profile and you can see in the picture, that the time is displayed for Las Vegas, NV the location of this contact. &nbsp;my system doesn't display this but i want that.</p>

<p>now that I understand from your post that this Time function has been removed by Microsoft, I find it ridiculous. to remove existing features that are clearly important is bad business practice and not caring about users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>as you suggested, i submitted this to MS under Give Feedback in Skype</p>

            <p>I can suggest two, suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be an account issue. In which case, try <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/wiki/wp8-wpemail/windows-account-not-syncing-error/b8791880-37b0-44d2-b093-6b5c1c32e879">
this</a> wiki article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not an account issue, try chatting with billing support. Check <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/wiki/wp8-wpaccount/contacting-chat-support/d1d1a529-484e-427b-bd39-3507d1a29d9f">

<p>reset my old&nbsp; Omnia&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so that my son could use it,&nbsp;&nbsp; set it up with his live account.
</p>
<p>All linked with Family Safety,&nbsp;&nbsp; can get and sync his email just can't download anything
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On family safety he doesn't show up as having a phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; on windowsphone you can't set it as he will be using a&nbsp; wp 7.8 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still want him to be able to download some apps and games. Won't have access to credit card details so no problem with him trying to buy anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but currently&nbsp; every single action is met with </p>

<p>Marketplace isn't available at the moment. </p>
<p>Please check again later.</p>
<p>Error code: 805a01f4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone was reset so enough space.&nbsp; Latest updates applied. Only thing is that it's a kids live account, but seems to be no where to define that he's allowed access.

            <p>Hello All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the marketplace connection issue you are experiencing.&nbsp; This error tends to indicate one of a&nbsp;few things; either there is an issue with your connection, an issue with your account or an issue with the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may have already been done but I would suggest you attempt to connect your phone to multiple networks.&nbsp; More then one WiFi network and a cellular data network.&nbsp; This should go a long way in determining if this if related to the connection you are using
 specifically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the same error over multiple networks, the next thing to focus on is the account.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;few things I might suggest you look into at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, go to <a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://accounts.live.com</a> and sign into the account being used on the phone.&nbsp; Please look for any indication that account must be verified.&nbsp; In addition to this, please check the personal
 info. section and ensure everything here is correct and up to date.</li><li>Next, go to <a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://commerce.microsoft.com</a> and sign into the same account.&nbsp; From here, go to the billing info. section and make sure this is complete and up to date.&nbsp; Even if you do not have a
 card on this account and do not intend on making purchases, it is important this is complete.</li><li>Now, go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a> and sign into the account.&nbsp; Verify that you see a Gamertag in the upper right corner of the page.&nbsp; If you are asked to create an account, please do so.&nbsp; The Xbox account is used to
 access the marketplace and a lack of an account could cause issues accessing the account.</li><li>If you are using a child account, please sign into <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xbox.com</a> with the parental account associated with your child's Xbox account.&nbsp; Go to MY ACCOUNT &gt; security family and forums &gt; In the privacy and online settings section go to each option and make sure there are no restrictions related to the phone
 or accessing marketplace content.</li><li>Finally, if you are willing and able to reset the phone, please reset the phone with another account.&nbsp; If you are using a child account, please try an adult account.&nbsp; What I want to try and determine here is if this is related to the specific account.&nbsp;
 If you reset the phone and it can connect without issue reset again with the trouble account and verify the connection issue continues.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this will set the phone back to it's factory settings.&nbsp; Media can be backed up to your PC,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media</a>.&nbsp; Contacts and calendar events should be backed up to the cloud.&nbsp; You can verify this by going to
<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a> and
<a href="http://calendars.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://calendars.live.com</a>.&nbsp; The information on your phone should be listed here.&nbsp; Text message history and game progress will be reset.&nbsp; To reset the phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</li></ul>
<p>I hope that some progress can be made with the steps above.&nbsp; If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

            <p>Hello R3ckl3ss:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the feedback.&nbsp; As this is only happening on the phone when using your son's account, this is looking to be related to the child account being used.&nbsp; It is most likely the account is still not fully set up, the terms of use have yet to be accepted
 or there are still some restrictions on the account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point there are only&nbsp;a couple more things I might point you to.</p>
<ul>
<li>I understand you have checked the account details several times and completed as much as you were comfortable completing based on my previous post.&nbsp; I would suggest you check the billing info. one final time and make sure all of the following are 100% complete,
 the name, the address, the phone number and the date of birth.&nbsp; If you are not comfortable putting your child's details here, consider putting your information in these fields.&nbsp; My experience is that if this information is left incomplete, marketplace accounts
 do not fully function.</li><li>Next, go to the following <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Account/NewTermsOfUse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
site</a> and sign into both the child's account and the parents account.&nbsp; After you accept the terms for one account, sign out, reload the page and sign in with the other account.&nbsp; After you have done this, restart the phone and try the download again.</li><li>Finally, consider creating another test account with the same information as this one.&nbsp; I would be interested to know if another Microsoft account with the same date of birth and similar account set up has the same issue.&nbsp; If it does, I would also be interested
 to know what happens if the date of birth on a child account you create is set to 14.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark W.</p>

<p>You have to be logged into Windows using your Microsoft Account and select Fast Ring to get any builds newer than 15063.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also download the ISO file for 16193 and mount that in Windows to run setup.exe and upgrade that way to a recent Fast Ring build. The latest build is 16226, which you can get via Windows Update.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t they get the new Mail app right&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Build 10130, the Mail app has been updated 3 times.&nbsp; The latest update was a new icon and a new "cloud" picture.&nbsp; Why are the Microsoft programmers concentrating on silly things like that instead of taking care of important issues?&nbsp; For
 example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have selected and deleted emails one by one, the only way to empty the trash folder is to select them all one by one for a second time.&nbsp; There needs to be an Empty Trash button or Empty Trash/Deleted Items on close option.&nbsp; I have been submitting
 feedback about this for weeks, but it's apparent Microsoft is ignoring it.</li><li>.txt file email messages sent from someone's iPhone will not display.</li><li>Mail live tile is never current.</li></ul>
<p>There is no issue with&nbsp;any of the above in the Windows 8.1 mail app, and that's one of several reasons I will not be replacing 8.1 with Windows 10.</p>

<p>Fully agree. There are too many (ignored) issues. I have my doubts also about the stability with all the crashes and non-working programs like Mail, Store, Feedback. One day it works, next day it is broken.</p>

            <p>It's July 13, 2015, and I just installed the latest Mail app update.&nbsp; STILL, there's no ability to select all items in the Trash folder to delete them all in one shot, and STILL it&nbsp;won't open attachments sent in an email from a cell phone.&nbsp; I've been submitting
 feedback in the Feedback app for months, and nobody seems to be listening.&nbsp; These are&nbsp;two things that have worked fine in the Windows 8 Mail App for years, so I don't&nbsp;understand why it's taking so long to get them working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thought.....The new Terms of Service mentions that Microsoft will be collecting data about us&nbsp;from, among other things, our emails.&nbsp; It also says Microsoft will automatically permanently delete "deleted" email in approximately 30 days.&nbsp; Are they intentionally
 making it more difficult for us to empty the trash folder so they have another 30 days to collect data?</p>

                    <p>How to stop my contact information being shared between different accounts. My Skype account started suddenly showing phone numbers from my mobile. I don't have Skype on my mobile phone. And my mobile decided to show weird e-mail addresses which turned out
 to be once in lifetime used on outgoing messages on my work laptop. Those were not even saved to my contact list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have clicked NO on all possible places to prevent this, but still don't seem have any control over it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I cannot give you a screenshot since just a week ago i cleaned all my contact files. But IM sure within next&nbsp; few weeks I'll have again something to show..&nbsp; This is something that keeps coming back since MS/google/ etc seem to think they have right
 to mess with our contacts, meaning copying them from one program/gadget to another. If I wanted that kind of "help" I should have a choice to intentionally accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What brought this up with Skype was when&nbsp; new Skype for Win10&nbsp; was pushed over my previous version (and did not work) I noticed that some new contacts were added to my contact list. Those were names with phone numbers from my mobile. I don't use Skype on
 my mobile and never needed/added that information to my laptop or any of our tablets.&nbsp;</p>

            Try going back to a previous Windows point to repair.
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to let your users on both Office 365 and Godaddy use the one custom domain name sending emails, simple domain sharing is a appropriate method to achieve your goal. From my experience, your current email service provider (Godaddy) is different
 from Exchange on premises (like Exchange 2013), there is no way to deploy a hybrid environment with Office 365. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Arabic language is automatically add whenever I restart my phone, if you have Hebrew keyboard&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey, started from the Denim update all users that uses Hebrew language start seeing the Arabic language without them asking for it.</p>
<p>I talked with Nokia Israel support and got the answer the MS consider everyone who's using Hebrew language as he is using Arabic automatically!! That's really annoying and weird! I don't care what language is that comes automatically (Arabic or any other
 language) but it really not cool.</p>
<p>so now, everytime I restart my phone I need to remove the Arabic keyboard!!</p>
<p>why are you doing this?</p>
<p>some people in Israel may speak Arabic also, but it's not everyone! Please stop this stupid thing.</p>
<p>after searching the web I see that it magically happens only with those too language.. I guess that you don't auto add Hebrew language to whoever set the Arabic language.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes some NOIA 6233 had this problem in the following cases:<br />
<br />
- the phone no have Internet subscription but has GPRS option activate (by default) : you must disable this option.<br />
<br />
- Voice dialing function is blocked and every noise can dial a number from the phonebook : it is necessary to reset the phone.<br />
<br />
It is rare but known bug.<br />
<br />
In all cases, it is necessary to upgrade the firmware to the latest version 5.43 with PC Suite.<br />
<br />

            <p>Adding to the other person's reply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, by&nbsp;occasionally,&nbsp;you mean that you're looking for programs that only scan, Malwarebytes' is a good program to install, partly because the free version actually removes items that it detects.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that it is never recommended to run two real-time antivirus programs at the same time, as such a setup has a major impact on performance, and&nbsp;the programs can reduce effectiveness of each other. From the knowledge that I have gained from the
 internet regarding the difficulties users have had with McAfee, it may be the antivirus that would conflict with others, if the other way around&nbsp;would&nbsp;not additionally true. If you wish to stick with McAfee, you will want to run it by itself, although you
 can use other programs to run scans/updates only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you really want to run two programs at once, you probably want to run the two most user-friendly and stable programs that I know of: Windows defender (included) and Malwarebytes' pro. Others on this form have said that this combination works very well.</p>

    <title>How do I view &#39;All Tasks&#39; in outlook, regardless of the task - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I view &#39;All Tasks&#39; in outlook, regardless of the task folder it is in&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a hierarchy of tasks in subfolders like this:-</p>
<p><em><strong><span>Tasks (Root)<br />
- Main Folder 1<br />
--- Sub Folder 1<br />
----- Sub Sub Folder 1<br />
<span><strong><span>--- Sub Folder 2<br />
<span><strong><span>--- Sub Folder 2<br />
</span></strong></span></span></strong><strong><span>- Main Folder 2<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>--- Sub Folder 1<br />
</span></strong><strong><span>--- Sub Folder 2</span></strong></em></p>
<p>I would like to be able to view 'All Tasks' in a single view. I had originally hoped that the root tasks folder would provide this, but I see it doesn't.</p>
<p>I have heard that a solution may be to use the 'Search Folders' function, but I do not know what criteria to use to distinguish between Tasks and any other Outlook item.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.<br />
Thanks.</p>

            Use the To-Do List in the Tasks Navigation (CTRL+4). You can create various views if you need to do some additional filtering and sorting.

<p>Whilst the To Do Bar is useful, it does not quite give me the functionality I need as it can only be viewed as a bar.</p>
<p>I need the ability to view many tasks with many columns... the To Do Bar is just a little too inconvenient.</p>
<p>Thanks, but any other suggestions?</p>

            Search folders won't work. The To-do folder (at the top of the Tasks navigation pane) should do all task folder-&nbsp; create a filtered view to remove flagged messages.
