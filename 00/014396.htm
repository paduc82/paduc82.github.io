<h2>            ATT Conferencing integration with Skype</h2>
                    When I schedule an online meeting, it adds the ATT conferencing phone number, but when people dial in, it does not feed their audio into the Skype room. How do I integrate the dial in number with Skype?

    <title>Microsoft Word Update on macOS High Sierra - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raebezer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word Update on macOS High Sierra</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem I've been having for a while, but have yet to find a solution. I have all Microsoft Office products set to update automatically. This problem ONLY exists on Word. (Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote all working perfectly.) The autoupdater tool
 tells me there is an update, and installs. This all *seems* to work fine. At the end of the installation process, the autoupdater once again checks for updates. It then tells me that the exact same update that I have installed is available and downloads and
 installs again. This loop is repeated ad infinitum unless I cancel the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have redownloaded the updater numerous times, and this hasn't solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help/advise as to why this is happening? I'm guessing that either the update isn't actually correctly installing, or that the autoupdater isn't recognising the update as being installed. No idea how to check which one of these it is, and how to
 fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be grateful if anyone can shed any light on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rae&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it has taken so long for me to get back to you (I've been really busy and needed to use Word so didn't want to do any uninstalls in case I had problems reinstalling).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now worked out what the problem was. On my Mac, all Office apps were installed in a folder called 'Microsoft Office 2016' in the 'Applications' folder. &nbsp;I was looking in there for something else, and saw that a version of Word was located outside
 this folder. This version had been updating, but the one inside the Office 2016 folder wasn't. I have no idea how I ended up with two versions of Word. I've always just let the MS Office updater do its thing, and installed any OS updates as soon as I'm prompted.
 At this point, I can only assume that something happened between an OS update and an office update that prompted office to install a new version of Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now simply replaced Word with the version that was updating, and all seems to be working okay so far (it was about a week ago now), including the autosave feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, problem solved for now. Hope this info helps if anyone else has encountered a similar problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <strong>Ben</strong>,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How do you access your account? Is it via a web browser or an Outlook application? If it's an application,
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">which version of Outlook</a></strong> are you using?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you get error messages when trying to search an email? </li><li>Does this happen to all keywords you tried to search?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><br />
If you are using a specific browser to access your account, you may clear its cache and cookies first then try again. You may also use another browser to isolate the issue if it's account related or a browser problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I recently switched from Palm to Windows Mobile, and am experiencing the first annoying things. I'm using Active sync 4.5 through the USB cable that came with my device (iPAQ 214). However, as I understood, I cannot
 schedule the synchronisation events in active sync in that way. As a result, the damn thing is almost every two minutes synching the device wich (1) slows down my computer all the time, and (2) leaves my device powered on. Anyone a suggestion to get rid of
 this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems the only way to get music into OneDrive is to add from your Music folder on your PC. However, only MP3's show there and not playlists. I am willing to download the playlist to share but there appears to be no option in the Groove app to actually
 "download" music, even with a pass. The only options are to add to Collection and to Play, and create playlists. No downloading? No Music sharing? Lame!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know of a way to accomplish this? I don't understand how to just export your collection to OneDrive (or playlists) so they can be stored in the cloud and also shared from there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft devs are reading this, please please please create a method to share music by PC and phone. (Windows Phone allows you to share full albums via text, email, and Facebook - but we should be able to share with other Music Pass friends and to more
 granular levels like songs and playlists)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

            <p>...and I'll answer my own question. It seems you can share Playlists through music.microsoft.com with other Groove members (formerly Xbox Live friends) by going to the Playlist, clicking More and then Share (through Email, Facebook, or Twitter)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can't share through the app, but this is better than nothing. </p>

            I have to record my own songs back into my multitrack recorder then share with my PC. GP is a bigger thief than Jobs. MS should spend more money on R&amp;D than on lawyers to monopolize the industry.

<h2>            Windows 10 OneNote App showing Read Only status on word document</h2>
                    I sent out a page that contained a Word document to my students. Students who opened it in OneNote2016 had no problems. Students who tried to open it in the Windows 10 app got the "read only" message on the Word document. Why? Aren't all platforms supposed
 to support this?

<h2>            Phone calls about MICROSOFT closing. Is this a scam&#63;</h2>
                    I keep receiving calls from someone saying that my MS account is expiring and they are going to deduct 499.00 from my bank account or if I open my bank account they will refund my initial 299.95 by transferring from a CHASE account to&nbsp; my bank account.
 I refused to do this and the man kept saying it all legitimate. I refused to do this and he told me to f... off and hung up. Then he called back 3-5 times.&nbsp; My bank said it sounds like a scam and not to do it. Has this happened to others.

<p>Common scam called a refund scam, though the variant discussed at the Federal Trade Commission website is slightly different than most of those affecting real people, since they always like to refer to the laws that all of the real scammers are simply thumbing
 their noses at.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Refund and Recovery Scams&nbsp;| Consumer Information</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your phone or carrier has some form of number blocking use it to block the scammer's number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, dump your carrier and get one that does, it's the only way to police these in today's abusive tech world.&nbsp; Smartphones are adding features to deal with these, but the ancient home phone without any form of caller ID is basically going defunct as
 a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, for now simply hang up when they call, since trying to reason with a malicious person is pointless.&nbsp; Talking to them just means they still have a chance at convincing you, so stop being nice, they aren't and will take whatever you let them
 including your time.</p>

<h2>            Are the preview builds slow becasue of MS test code or will the release be slow too&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This 10130 preview (running on desktop high performance i7-4770K box) is annoyingly slow.&nbsp; Slow to open folders, to open drives, to start an application or do most anything.&nbsp; It is very frustrating when I have to wait 4 of 5 seconds to even open a folder
 on a drive.&nbsp; Or 30 seconds to a minute for it to scan the network <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
each time</span> I open the Network folder.&nbsp; This same hardware ran Windows 8.1 without these lags. My C: drive is on a Samsung SSD and is very fast.&nbsp; My other three HD are all recent model mechanical ones operating at 7200 RPM.&nbsp; My Ethernet is all CAT6 cabling
 and GHz electronics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope my frustration will go away, and the many reported bugs fixed, before MS releases this for sale.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will be Vista all over again and I will go back to 8.1 or maybe even 7 which is the most stable release in years from MS.

<p>I don't think its special code - I am running it on a 9-year-old Athlon 64 x2-3800 with (until recently) a similar vintage 160GB 5400rpm HDD, and it seems positively snappy.&nbsp; Have you check what else is running, using Task Manager?&nbsp; The good performance
 is the one&nbsp;(and almost&nbsp;only) thing I like about W10 so far.</p>

<h2>            Sleep not syncing with phone from band</h2>
                    Last night's sleep hasn't synced with my phone for last two days. I record them using the tile, never automatically. They show up on the band, but do not on the phone. Yet the phone reflects the heart rate tracking over night in the calorie count. After
 it first happened on day on I made a sleep 0 min on and off, and that synced. I have the latest updates for both phone and band (original band).&nbsp; I have turned off and on both phone band and Bluetooth. Please don't suggest I do those as a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only
 will clear the data off the band as a last resort. Who&nbsp;has had this problem?

            I too am frustrated the abandoned the product&nbsp;in general. Seems to be the trend for Microsoft with Windows phone as well. It still works for runs, so I'm not ready to move to a forerunner yet. I've had it for 16 months and only wear for sleep and exercise,
 I'd like to see more use than that. I also did the uninstall/reinstall of the app today, didn't help.

            No that was the only step&nbsp;I did not take. I have still let those two nights but every night since has worked. I don't know if uninstalling and reinstalling the app fixed it, but I no longer have the problem.

            Have the same Problem with the band. Sync with activities and sleep did not work. Factory Reset did not work, reinstall band app also not. It seems that the Problem is based of The ms account. Due to if i login with an other Smartphone to the same Account
 the bug is still the same. With an other ms account band and app works fine.

<h2>            HOW CAN I RESTORE THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF SKYPE ON MY IPHONE</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my iPhone few hours ago, with the recommended Skype update - I felt assure I'm in good hands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the fast update finished - I was shocked !</p>
<p>A Horrible complete new version. Nothing like the Skype, I've been a member for maybe 12 years.</p>
<p>Ugly, non-friendly, and full of weird options, as the real ones were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist me, to erase this creation, and restore my former Skype app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even look at the mobile app. If I knew it.... I would have NEVER updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please create the option to restore the former Skype version, and enable me to stay a customer and loyal member of this website.</p>
<p>Anyone, who know of the method to get ride of it - please do write back (as a reply) to this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Not sure if and how we can distribute Microsoft software. But I think you can get an earlier version (.ipa file) and install on iPhone after deleting the latest version on it.

<p>Hi, I Have also just downloaded the latest version of Skype for iPhone. I couldn't reinstall the older version quick enough. The whole look is horrible, you can no longer change your status to away/ invisible. Messages that I had on my phone came
 up with a message Skype can no longer read this message with this version.. I'll stick with old one as lone as I can, I have been using Skype for years and have seen many changes on phone and computer versions, but guys this is just too too bad. Who thought
 this was a good update????&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC not a Mac, remove new version from your phone, go to recycle bin and restore previous version 6. Go to search and enter ipa. click on more options this should take you to where all your apps are. Find the latest version 8 and right click
 delete. Then find the earlier 6 and double click, it will ask you if you want to install the earlier one, say yes. Then go to your apps in itunes and scroll down, you will see skype, click install then sync or apply and the old version will return. Good luck</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System Restore" is the answer.</p>
<p>This enabled me to revert to the previous but "the good, old and useful" Skype version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the link and the the instructions to follow from MS support website, to perform a "System Restore".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply choose the latest available restore point on your PC which should be a date before you upgraded the Skype and continue to System Restore. This will revert everything in your PC back into the configuration on the chosen "restore point" (date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options</p>
<p>--------</p>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Restore from a system restore point"><span>Restore from a system restore point
</span></a>
<div>
<p>This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/e6bbddb0-9db4-4d88-9063-42c52c79a96e/create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create
 a restore point manually</a>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> &nbsp;button, type <strong>control panel </strong>
and<strong> </strong>then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
<div>Note</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Configure System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Configure</strong>&nbsp;and make sure&nbsp;<strong>Turn on system protection</strong>&nbsp;is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------------</p>
<p>Hope that helps as the lastest version of Skype is really useless and ugly.</p>

<h2>            Holiday Calendar in Outlook.com not available</h2>
                    The holiday calendar option in Outlook.com seems to have disappeared. How can I add a holiday calendar to my Windows 10 calendar?

            Thank you but that only shows my calendars. What should be shown on the drop-down list is a list of holiday calendars by country such as is available within Outlook 2016.

            We already have 16294 in Fast Ring.&nbsp; It might be the final in spite of new Canaries beyond that.&nbsp; It doesn't matter anyway.&nbsp; The final will be the final will be the final, no matter the number.

<h2>            Outlook 365 IMAP problems</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
I just downloaded and installed a fresh copy of Office 365 and have been trying to setup Outlook. I set up my yahoo account as an imap account (works just great on my Android phone).
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Outlook does it's synchronization and only downloads about 30-50 messages at a time and then the synchronization stops. It doesn't give any errors or say there are any problems, it just acts as if it completed a successful synchronization. With
 almost 4000 emails left to download I am tired of pushing the F9 button to get my mail. Does any one have any suggestions?<br />
<br />

            Don't try to open files from an external drive; that may be what corrupted them in the first place. Instead, copy them to a local drive and then try opening.

<code>Windows Update Improvements<br />
<br />
Microsoft has released an update directly to the Windows Update client to improve reliability. Any device running Windows 10 configured to receive updates automatically from Windows Update, including Enterprise and Pro editions, will be offered the latest Windows
 10 feature update based on device compatibility and Windows Update for Business deferral policy. This doesn't apply to long-term servicing editions.</code><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Known issues in this update</strong></span><br />
<br />
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Symptom</strong></td>
<td>
<strong>Workaround</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Windows Sandbox may fail to start with "ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND (0x80070002)" on devices in which the operating system language is changed during the update process when installing Windows 10, version 1903.</td>
<td>
Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
The Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN) service may stop working and you may receive the error “0xc0000005” on devices where the diagnostic data level is manually configured to the non-default setting of 0. You may also receive an error in the Application
 section of Windows Logs in Event Viewer with Event ID 1000 referencing “svchost.exe_RasMan” and “rasman.dll”.<br />
<br />
This issue only occurs when a VPN profile is configured as an Always On VPN (AOVPN) connection with or without device tunnel. This does not affect manual only VPN profiles or connections.</td>
<td>
To mitigate this issue, use one of the steps below, either the group policy step or the registry step, to configure one of the default telemetry settings.<br />
<br />
Set the value for the following group policy settings:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Group Policy Path: Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Data Collection and Preview Builds\Allow Telemetry</li><li>Safe Policy Setting: Enabled and set to 1 (Basic) or 2 (Enhanced) or 3 (Full)</li></ol>
<br />
Or set the following registry value:<br />
<br />
SubKey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection<br />
<br />
Setting: AllowTelemetry<br />
<br />
Type: REG_DWORD<br />
<br />
Value: 1, 2 or 3<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If the Remote Access Connection Manager service is not running after setting the Group Policy or registry key, you will need to manually start the service or restart the device.<br />
<br />
We are working on a resolution and estimate a solution will be available in late July.</td>

<td>
After installing this update, opening or using the Window-Eyes screen reader app may result in an error and some features may not function as expected.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Users who have already migrated from Window-Eyes to Freedom Scientific's other screen reader, JAWS, should not be affected by this issue.</td>

<h3> jimmy fallon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 defaults to plain text instead of RTF or HTML&#59; when launched from Quicken</h2>
                    <p>I use Quicken 2016 for sending invoices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I email normally from Outlook 2016, it default correctly to HTML as the email format so I can then set type sizes and fonts etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However every time I launch it from Quicken in order to send an invoice, it always defaults to plain text. So I have to manually set the HTML every time I send an invoice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's kind of an annoyance, but I would love a way to set this permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks..</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to revert to the &#39;old&#39; Skype</h2>
                    <p>I'm a 70 year old and I miss the 'old' Skype on Xbox One, it was a lifeline to daughter and new grandson in Australia, I can't seem to get the new one to work consistently, can't understand how to use it, don't understand the menus or how to move around
 the interface, it's just too confusing. It was once simple and did everything I wanted, it's now intimidating to a non-gamer, perhaps it should have a maximum age on the 'box'.</p>
<p>
Sorry but it's frustrating..</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have an option to revert to the old version of Skype for Xbox One. We do not recommend users to roll back to previous versions as there may&nbsp;be compatibility and usability issues.

    <title>Wildcard Find and Replace with Track Changes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wildcard Find and Replace with Track Changes</h2>
                    <span>While Track Changes is active,&nbsp;a wild card Find and Replace action does not yield the results expected. For instance, in a document, the occurrence of XYZ 123 (i.e. any three alpha characters

 followed by a space followed by any three numerals) needs to be changed to XYZ-123 (i.e.&nbsp;the three alpha characters followed by a hyphen followed by the three numerals). Normally (without Track Changes), the code for this operation would be (in the Find what:
 line) ([A-Z]{3}) ([0-9]{3}) and (in the Replace with: line) \1-\2. Yet, with Track Changes active, the results from this action&nbsp;is the following: XYZ123-, i.e. the hyphen is placed&nbsp;not between the two 'Find what' elements, but after the second element. Should
 I be doing something different, or is this a bug? Even older versions of Word give the same result.</span>

            This is an old bug; you can read a thread about it from 2006 <a href="http://www.wordbanter.com/showthread.php?t=45274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. It has never been fixed.<br />
<br />
As stated in this <a href="http://www.babelediting.com/2010/02/21/ms-word-wildcard-bug-character-transposition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a>, the only workaround is to turn off Track Changes while making the replacement.<br />
<br />
If it's important to have the replacements marked as changes, you could turn on Track Changes and run another replacement, finding
<span>([A-Z]{3})-([0-9]{3}) and replacing with ^&amp; (which is the code for "Find What Text"). That would at least get the change bars in the margins at the right places.<br />
<br />
If this is a frequent requirement, it would be best to write it into a macro.<br />

            You are not doing anything wrong.&nbsp; It's never been high enough&nbsp; on the&nbsp; bug list to fix, I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just turn&nbsp; track changes off when I have to run such F&amp;Rs.<br />

            <p>Thanks Jay and Pam for the workarounds offered.</p>
<p>In our organisation, the document compilers all send their documents to me for editing. Using track changes, I edit the documents, and return it to them to either accept or reject my edits (normally not too much of the latter). It therefore serves a secondary
 function to educate the compilers about our particular document standards.</p>
<p>But, if it ain't working, it ain't working. I guess the Word users just haven't shouted loud enough.</p>
<p>Thanks a million guys!</p>

            If I need to call the change to the author's attention, I highlight then first one and write a comment. It's better making the changes by hand!<br />

            <p>I realize this thread is pretty old, but I thought I'd post a partial workaround in case someone runs into this same issue, although for the example given above, the workaround won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to replace</p>
<p>1Q 2010</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>1Q10</p>
<p>and getting the same kind of result with track changes on: 110Q (right elements, wrong order).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original string looked like this:</p>
<p><span>Find what: ([1-4])Q [0-9][0-9]([0-9][0-9])</span></p>
<p><span>Replace with: \1Q\2</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>By making the Q a wildcard, I was able to get it to work.</p>
<p><span>Find what: ([1-4])([Q]) [0-9][0-9]([0-9][0-9])</span><span>Replace with: \1\2\3</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This won't work with the original poster's example because he is actually
<em>changing</em> the found text from a space to a hyphen. Maybe someone can think of a way to extend the workaround to work for such instance, but this is at least something.</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Vince</p>

<p>I just encountered this problem myself in Word 2013. Here is a workaround that seems to work with track changes switched on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Workaround()<br />
</p>
<p>'Adds a hyphen between the 1 and 2 in "12"</p>
<p>
</p><p>With ActiveDocument.Content<br />
With .Find<br />
&nbsp; .ClearFormatting<br />
&nbsp; .Replacement.ClearFormatting<br />
&nbsp; .Text = "(&lt;[1])([2]&gt;)"<br />
&nbsp; .Replacement.Text = ""<br />
&nbsp; .Forward = True<br />
&nbsp; .Wrap = wdFindStop<br />
&nbsp; .MatchWildcards = True<br />
&nbsp; .Execute<br />
End With<br />
Do While .Find.Found<br />
&nbsp; .MoveStart wdCharacter, 1<br />
&nbsp; .Collapse<br />
&nbsp; .InsertAfter "-"<br />
&nbsp; .MoveStart wdWord, -1<br />
&nbsp; .MoveEnd wdWord, 1<br />
&nbsp; .Copy<br />
&nbsp; .Delete<br />
&nbsp; .Collapse wdCollapseEnd<br />
&nbsp; .Paste<br />
&nbsp; .Find.Execute<br />
Loop<br />
End With</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
