<h2>            Mailmerge with CC &#47; BCC &#38; Filing Email to client folder when sent</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some queries from colleagues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Want to be able to send a mailmerge to more than 1 person i.e. To and CC field with Outlook 365. &nbsp;What do we need to do this? &nbsp;I had a search on Google and came up with a link to use an add-in MapiLab.</p>
<p><a href="http://https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/mailmerge.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mailmerge To and CC</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second query is relating to using Suitefiles where we get a prompt to save the email to a client folder when it is sent - will we be able to do this when a mailmerge is sent out or do we need to manually drag and drop the email to the client correspondence
 folder;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if we are not using the Suitefiles plugin - is there another way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>Bronwen</p>

            <p>Outlook indeed doesn't have native support for adding multiple recipients to a single message for a Mail Merge. The
<a href="https://addins.howto-outlook.com/mapilab_mailmerge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MailMerge Toolkit by MAPILab</a> is the most used add-in to add support for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the Mail Merge takes place in an automated&nbsp;background thread, it is not aware of any additional plugins so most likely you indeed won't get prompted by Suitefiles (unless their plugin works on the OnItemAdd event to move it which I doubt).</p>

    <title>Expired product key for Microsoft Office 2013 even though it was - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Expired product key for Microsoft Office 2013 even though it was purchased</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using the Microsoft Office 2013 version on my computer for about close to 2 years and it suddenly tells me that it has expired? It is strange that my product key has been expired even though I have made a purchase of the Microsoft Office 2013
 at my local store. I have no idea why it is like that. They have prompted me to enter the product key but the thing is I can't find my box as well. I have read through the forum and have installed Belarc Advisor as some have done, but when I got to the section
 where they are supposed to tell me what is my product key, it stated, "key: None Activated". I hope for some answers. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;I have tested this pretty thoroughly. It's definitely an issue when using word or Excel On iOS 12. When I tried to dictate in either of those apps, it will freeze or crash on my iPad fifth generation, my iPhone 6s, my wife's iPhone SE and her iPad Mini
 2. &nbsp;I have tried resetting the apps deleting and reinstalling. Nothing seems to fix the issue. Sometimes &nbsp;dictation &nbsp;will work intermittently, but sooner or later it will cause the app to freeze and crash. What's strange is that I don't have this issue at
 all with PowerPoint ( or I have not used PowerPoint enough to cause the issue)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>
<p>I saw Microsoft had this issue years ago And it seems to have bit them again. &nbsp;I'm amazed at how slow they are in responding to this given that many of the complaints for either of those apps reviewed on the App Store referred to this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Google products and the Apple office products. My problem with them is that they don't handle password-protected files &nbsp;very well or at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have been recommending &nbsp;WPS office by kingsoft. It is free, Though you can pay for some of the more advanced features, works flawlessly &nbsp;with dictation , you only need one app instead of three,and it handles password-protected files is better than any
 of its competitors, including Microsoft. The only feature that I have found missing when comparing it to Microsoft Excel &nbsp;is the ability to create and edit tables . But there are workarounds for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very full featured and even has some capabilities, such as data validation, that its competitors don't. &nbsp;As a bonus, WPS office also handles PDF and Zip files. &nbsp;Unlike its competitors, it Works with dropbox, one drive, and Google drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think Microsoft products look a little more polished, but I can't have them freezing and crashing when I press the microphone button on my iPad&nbsp;</p>

            I've had the same issue as well...pre-iOS 12 upgrade and after.&nbsp; MS Word either freezes or crashes altogether when I attempt to launch the dictate button.&nbsp; I've called both Apple and Microsoft regarding the issue and both point the finger at one another.&nbsp;
 On the lastest crash, a Message reply from MS read that they are aware of the issue and hope the problem will be resolved in Apple's next iOS software update.&nbsp; More finger pointing!&nbsp; Neither tech-Giant are rolling up their sleeves to resolve this issue in
 a timely matter for their customer's sake.&nbsp; I personally use dictation in MS Word frequently on my iPhone X for business.&nbsp; The work around for now, until these overpaid software guru's get it resolved, is to dictate into NOTES and then cut-n-paste into Word
 - cumbersome and inexcusable!

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>There is no <strong>Microsoft</strong> policy being cascaded when it comes to limiting our support in saving

    <title>New Software update for Nokia Lumia 900 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahmedilyas---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Software update for Nokia Lumia 900</h2>
                    
<p>Just updated my Nokia Lumia 900 software via Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow. Big mistake!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "smooth scrolling" update really is awful. There were no issues before so not sure why there was such a focus on this one by Nokia. Before I was able to smoothly and nicely scroll the tiles on the main screen and other applications by the flick of my
 finger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and now after the update, it is rough, jagged, not smooth and only scrolls up to 2 tiles at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what on earth is going on? Is there a way to revert the update? or even change the smooth scrolling settings? This REALLY breaks user experience functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also see Nokia has not focused on the extremely loud sounds that the phone produces via ringtones, SMS or other notifications even though the volume is set to 1. it is still FAR too loud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investment should have been placed on the volume rather than BREAKING the user experience functionality for smooth scrolling (which is not smooth AT ALL)</p>

<p>Follow up on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive uninstalled Accuweather and a few other apps. Since Ive done it, battery lasts longer and there seems to be no issue with the scrolling anymore. If you have AccuWeather installed try to disable the background task, reboot the device and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now I cant see the problem anymore.</p>

            I feel I gave OK verdict too early. Following the update screen controls gets seriously messed up every time i plug phone in to charger. Screen is bouncing up and down randomly which make phone unusable while while charging.<br />
This definitely did not happen prior to update.<br />

<p>see. I told ya!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for me, I dont have the accuweather software installed. This is regardless of new or old software. This is not about what apps you have on the phone. If it worked before, there is NO reason for it to not work AFTER the software update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the interesting point you raised about the battery is true - it seems to last less than before.....</p>

<p>Yes.. thats exactly the way to do that as mentioned in my earlier post.. You may also have to keep a back-up of your Contacts...( along with the messages...). Once you take back-up.. you may delete all entries from the OVI Suite...</p>
<p>.. but the drawbacks are..</p>
<p>You will not be able to see the Contacts / Messages as the file can not be opened with normal Windows software.. You will have to restore them on the phone ( If you want to see...).. and because of the same reason.. you are not sure if ALL data has been
 backed-up or not. There are reports on this forum that after Restore.. all the data is not visible.. means either the data back-up itself was not OK or the restore...so its advisable to ALSO keep these Synced with OVI..</p>

            + do not give up &amp; hope for the best, Windows 10 mobile is still in good (+) shape. My opinion is, if the fans keep challenging Microsoft to tackle this problem for the fans of Microsoft Lumia, then we can expect a re-launch of a new generation of MS Lumias
 in Q4 2019 or Q1 2020. The existing Lumia line, as presented on the Microsoft website, is still impressive &amp; with constant search you can find Lumias at online retailers. Windows 10 mobile is getting more competitive &amp; fluent design is making its way into
 many native apps. //

<p>I have to agree with&nbsp;<span>Szilard Lazar!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, there is nothing quite like Windows Phone and I cannot for the life of me understand why people cannot see its beauty. Just having Live Tiles is enough to make it better than anything on the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife finally had to bite the bullet and get a new device so she got a Samsung Android device. It is good but nowhere close to a Windows Phone. She is definitely not a "techie" and even she said that Windows phone was so much easier to use. She said Windows
 Phone was intuitive and her new Galaxy Note 8 was not. Eventually, we put on all the Microsoft apps including&nbsp;Microsoft Launcher. That one program brought her back to reality and she said it was a huge improvement to her experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to admit I like her device and I admit it was a big learning curve for me (since I have to do anything she needs to be done... lol) but it does the job (just not as good as Windows Phone. Yes, I am a die-hard WindowsPhone person!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the only hope is that there may well be a Surface Phone someday. Some say it will never happen but I believe that it will and I will wait as long as I can before I buy a new phone hoping it will be a Surface device!!</p>

<br />
Try to launch LUMIA once again, at least. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Never going to happen, not now, not in 2019 or 2020, not ever. No chance, 0.000% probability. Microsoft don't even have the rights to the name anymore, all production ceased over 2 years ago, all facilities are sold off or shut down. Windows 10 Mobile development
 ended almost a year ago, nobody, repeat nobody, is working on it. Security patches and bug fixes are NOT development NOR improvements, especially when one update tends to break something, which requires a follow-up update to fix it, which then breaks something
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Native apps were never a problem, so it doesn't matter how "fluent" they become as a coincidental benefit from their ongoing development for the PC version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile is not and cannot get more competitive when third party and even native apps are dying by the day - Twitter and Facebook apps are now only supported for build 15063 Creators update and later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above facts have nothing to do with how good the UI is or isn't. I personally have at least 40 apps which I need on a regular basis (which means several times a month, if not a week) both for personal and business use and they were either never available
 for Windows Mobile or stopped working. Using websites through the browser is rarely possible and a very painful experience on Edge on mobile anyway. I still own a dozen Lumias which testifies my support for the platform when it was functioning in a satisfactory
 way. We all have different requirements for our devices, I need to be able to use it efficiently on a daily basis and quite often on the go in different countries - I cannot do that with Windows phone and I cannot afford to delude myself that it is ever coming
 back, nor am I willing to suffer just to be "different" with beautiful live tiles on an otherwise relatively useless device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I am seeing, the Andromeda mobile device will not do it for me either, another half-baked MS attempt at divergence which may never happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who want to be different - get a Jolla Sailfish OS device, it actually works quite well.</p>

 patience &amp; put all the puzzle pieces right. I think in this moment Windows 10 mobile is a research project &amp; the company can get this right //&nbsp;

<p>Still impressive? They weren't that impressive when they were released, so now that there is no warranty service available, hard to find spare parts, and no replacements, how exactly are they as you state "still impressive"?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Mobile in good shape? Really? The ever growing app issue is an easy place to start. Even the core apps are getting worse. The OS itself is, to be nice, buggy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly in what universe is the OS getting more competitive? That .1% market share sure is impressive, And how about all of those vendors just rushing to build their own devices for the platform? And all of those app developers pleading to have their apps
 on the Windows Store? Oh. Wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its dead. Even if Microsoft for some money-losing reason wants to revive it, so what? Who in their right mind would give it yet another go? I think this would be the 5th failed attempt at a Windows mobile OS.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Phone low audio when talking on the phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Phone low audio when talking on the phone</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound quality on the Windows 10 phone is low. People I talk to say they can barely hear me and it sounds like I'm talking from a great distance, even though the volume is set at the highest setting. I've tried talking on my cell to different people with
 different cell phones and/or landlines and people say the same thing: they can barely hear me on the phone and it sounds like I'm far away and in a tunnel. I've tried talking to people on the speaker or on the phone as normal with the same issues. I don't
 have any other audio issues with Windows 10 phone. Netflix, Pandora, or anything else that requires sound from the phone all work fine and the sound quality is clear. The issue is strictly when talking on the phone. The phone is not damaged, nor has it been
 in water.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 phone brand is: ALCATEL OneTouch FierceXL. It is with T-Mobile and is a few years old.&nbsp; I like the phone a lot and don't have any other issues with the phone. I reset my phone, but it did not do anything to improve audio while talking on the
 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix this problem with my phone ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your concern on the voice quality being not audible enough from the receiving party when making calls, we would suggest downloading the B2X app from the Microsoft Store. This app is specially designed to test the
 overall hardware performance of Lumia phones. If in case the app detects a faulty microphone, you might as well get in touch with
<a href="https://support.b2x.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X support</a> to have it further re-assessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>

<h2>            Virtual desktops vanish on reboot windows 10</h2>

<p>
</p><p>But when I restart the 3 desktops are still there but the applications are no longer on the desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do they desktops not save the applications upon reboot?</p>

            It is expected that any running apps will close at Shutdown. If you were to use Hibernate instead, they might still be running on each desktop after powering up again.

    <title>Nokia Drive&#43; Beta map updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tunae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Drive&#43; Beta map updates&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I set my destination and get the routing (in USA), I also get a banner that says something to the effect of "Map update recommended". But, if I go to Settings to manage my maps, it just tells me that my USA map is downloaded and ready for me to use.
 There is no indication that I need to update that map, or any visible way to check if an update exists, or start an update. The only think I can think of doing is to delete the map &amp; reload it. But the USA map is huge and takes a loooong time to download,
 which I'd rather avoid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what am I missing? Are there updates? Or, is the initial banner simply wrong? If there are updates, how do I update? Delete &amp; reload? If there are none and the banner is on drugs, then how I do I know when there are updates? How frequently will there
 be updates, roughly? If there is no way to check whether a map I have downloaded has updates, how do I find out if I need to update a map that is not at the locale that I am in? In other words, while in USA, how do I&nbsp;know whether my Canada or Mexico or Europe
 maps need to be updated, before I head to those destinations, as opposed to arrive and search for Wifi to update them.</p>

            Boy, finally I am finding my own solution...<br />
<br />
The *separate* Nokia Maps app on the phone has the Map Update function. It really is beyond me why the heck Nokia Maps and Nokia Drive are two separate apps. It should be rolled into one.

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently set up a new Office365 email account but it seems I can only receive emails from people with the same domain name as I have e.g. other business colleagues.&nbsp; Do you know how I can fix this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a business account and none of my colleagues seem to be having the same problems - have I set it up incorrectly?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            VBA in Outlook 2007&#58; replay all with de original message</h2>
                    Hi, I need made a macro in vba for outlook 2007 to resolved this: I have so much e-mails to send with "replay all" every day. Each message have own contact to replay all. &nbsp;At today, I open each message and press "replay all" and "send"; every day for all
 messages. So, I need create a macro in vba to send all this mails with "replay all"&nbsp;every message, all five working days as week, at for example 9am. I think maybe this is a loop to start with the first message and end&nbsp;in the last message, when all messages
 from the especific folder are sent it.&nbsp;This emails are more and more&nbsp;every day.&nbsp;Is this posible?, do you know where can I find information to do this?. I was searching on web but nothing resolve this. Thanks in advanced!!. Regards. Kyara.

 when I launch an Office app, a pop-up says,&nbsp;"Background installation ran into a problem. ...We'll automatically resume installation as soon as possible, and you can keep working once you do." In other words, Office&nbsp;is stuck in a state of uncompleted install/uninstall,
 no longer works, and won't uninstall or install. The&nbsp;same thing happened to my wife, but somehow&nbsp;her machine&nbsp;ended in a better state.</p>

            <p>Ok, this issue was solved. Here's what happened. </p>
<ul>
<li>I went to the support page and&nbsp;tried the suggestions made&nbsp;by the&nbsp;virtual agent. Those didn't work.&nbsp;</li><li>Then I&nbsp;entered a chat with&nbsp;a&nbsp;live agent. The first agent said s/he was from "billing and accounts." That person was of no help and&nbsp;transferred me to a real tech support agent.</li><li>That person remoted into my machine and tried all the things I&nbsp;listed above, then ran a script called scrub.vbs. That didn't solve the problem, either.
</li><li>So the agent looked around the registry, but didn't do anything. </li><li>Then, the agent downloaded RevoUninstaller and ran it. Revo found registry keys and lots of Office related files, which the agent deleted. ...That solved the problem!&nbsp; Then Office could be installed.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>The agent believes previous installations&nbsp;had problems (in the reg keys, extraneous files, etc) that prevented this update from installing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks MS tech support! </p>
