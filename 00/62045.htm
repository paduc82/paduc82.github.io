<h2>            Marketplace Rip Off&#33;</h2>
                    

<p>Firstly, i'd like to start by saying that I apologize if I have put this in the wrong section and if somebody could either move this post to the correct section or simply comment on what section this post should have been posted in, i'd be very thankful.</p>
<p><span>My issue is this, the prices for download-able games are far too high! My Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 disc broke the other day. I need this as I use this for tournaments on the gaming site
<a href="http://www.gamebattles.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.gamebattles.com</a>&nbsp;. I was not going to any kind of store within the next week and ordering it online would have taken days to deliver, yes i'm aware that that's lazy :). I decided to look on
 the Xbox live marketplace for games on demand. I mean they always advertise that you can buy old(ish) games via download to your hard drive? Surly this would love my minor problem? Yet to me amazement, the price is
<strong>over twice as high</strong> as in retail and online stores!! This is truly disgusting because Call of duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an old game that usually retails at £15 (with slight variations on different stores)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Proof:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox live games marketplace Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2: (Please be aware I had to upload this image to an external site)&nbsp;<a href="http://oi45.tinypic.com/14cvez8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi45.tinypic.com/14cvez8.jpg</a>&nbsp;
</li><li>Game.co.uk Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (Again external site)&nbsp;<a href="http://oi50.tinypic.com/14vjosw.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oi50.tinypic.com/14vjosw.jpg</a>&nbsp;

</li></ul>
<p>I know I can't do much on my own, but if this post was to&nbsp;received enough attention, the department that handles the pricing may change it and it could revolutionise the way we buy our games!</p>

Also these prices are not just set by Microsoft, the game publisher also gets a say on what the price will be on the marketplace.</p>

<p>I took this from the link below because I'm feeling lazy tonight and didn't want to type a bunch of info out.<br />
<br />
<em><a href="http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/a/Xbox-360-Games-On-Demand-Faq.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/a/Xbox-360-Games-On-Demand-Faq.htm</a><br />
<br />
Xbox 360 Games on Demand titles are available for $20, $30, or $40 with a handful at $50 or $60. You can pay with either a credit card or Microsoft Points, just remember that MS Points are 80=$1, so a $20 game is 1600 MSP, $30 is 2400 MSP, etc.
<strong>The prices are set by the publisher and Microsoft and are generally higher than you'd pay for a physical copy of the same game.</strong>
<strong>The price difference between a GoD and physical copy can be anywhere from $2-3 all the way up to $20-30+ more for a digital copy.</strong> Just because they might cost a bit more, however, doesn't necessarily mean the Games on Demand version isn't worth
 buying.<br />
<br />
<strong>Buying a Games on Demand version of a game is usually going to cost more than a physical retail copy.</strong> It is up to you, however, to decide how much more you might be willing to spend for the
<strong>convenience</strong>. <strong>Not having to spend the time to go to the store, not having to buy gas, not having to deal with the occasional snobby jerk who works (or shops there ...) at GameStop, not having to wait on an item if you order it online,
 not having to switch discs when you buy a GoD copy (since it'll always be on your hard drive), etc.</strong>, are all things you should consider. Figure the cost difference between a GoD game and a physical copy as a Convenience Tax and decide how much that
 is worth to you<br />
<br />
</em>Long story short, there are benefits to buying games off of the Games on Demand service, but if you don't like the price, don't buy it.<em><br />

<p>I've bought quite a few GoD games for $10-$20 cheaper than what Best Buy/Gamestop/Walmart had them for brand new or used.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>It really is a hit or miss. &nbsp;When in doubt I always hit up amazon/ebay to see if there are any used versions cheaper and 9/10 there are WAY cheaper games. &nbsp;I have tons of patience so I honestly don't mind waiting for a week to get a game in the mail.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Also, I really wish whoever did these forum changes would just DIAF. &nbsp;Having to repost what I type 3-6 times everytime is getting a tad bit old -.-</p>

<h3> 4thfloor  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Natural 4000 - How to reassign right &#39;application&#39; key back to regular Windows Key&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.&nbsp; I'm using MS Intellitype version 8.2 software, and the keyboard is connected to a PC running Win 7 x64.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I want to reassign the Application key (which is between the right alt and ctrl keys) to behave like a Windows key (like the key between the left ctrl and alt keys).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I go to:<br />
<br />
Start/Programs/Microsoft Keyboard and choose "Microsoft Keyboard", I can to go to the Key Settings and find the Application key there.&nbsp; When I highlight it and choose Configure, I have only one option - Disable the application key.&nbsp; If I disable it, hitting
 the key does nothing but give me a little warning telling me that it is...disabled. &nbsp;&nbsp; The "Assign/Manage Macro..." key is greyed out.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to configure the key to behave like a regular Windows key?<br />
<br />

            Just do a Google search for a program called "KeyTweak". &nbsp;I had the same desire to change the same key to behave as though it were a windows key. &nbsp;And this program allows you to literally do that -- it does, however, change registry keys so make sure you
 save a backup of your registry keys before performing any changes. &nbsp;Hope this helps.

                    Often, when I Boot-up my PC with Windows 10, I get a "Preparing Windows" message on the opening screen, which takes forever. I then get advised that to access all my files etc. I must shutdown and the re-start. I'm finding this palaver most frustrating

<h2>            Connecting a wireless Bluetooth keyboard</h2>
                    I recently purchased a bluetooth keyboard for my HP 2000 Notebook PC to make gaming on it a little easier. When I try to connect the keyboard in the settings, the laptop will not pick it up. In the settings, it has the term 'bluetooth' on the devices setting.
 So, can I get some assistance on connecting my keyboard?&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One Controller, Uncomfortable and right trigger squeaky after a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xkjrk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller, Uncomfortable and right trigger squeaky after a 10 days of use.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just transitioned to Xbox one from my 360 a bit ago and here are my issues.</p>

<p>1. With the xbox 360 controller I can play FPS games for over 8 hours with no noticeable pain in my hands or joints.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the Xbox one controller I get pain in my pinky and ring finger down to into my wrist with any game play over 4 hours.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Are there alternate controllers that are similar to the xbox 360 ergonomics that I can use instead of the xbox one controller?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
2. I have had my xbox one for under a month and the right trigger is squeaky with feathering the right trigger.
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My xbox 360 controllers are squeak free and are several years old with much more usage and no squeaking.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>My hand size is large and I think that may be the issue. The hand grips on the Xbox one are less bulbous than the 360, so my hands lack sufficient area to grip the base of the controller.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please let me know if there are any resolutions to the issues I am experiencing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe the best solution in your case should be sticking with 360 controller.</p>
<p>You just have to keep pressuring them to make 360 controller use possible for xbox one.

Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you connect the Logitech cordless keyboard, the keys you listed in your post are they working? Try removing the driver for your laptop keyboard, check with the manufacturer
 to get the updated driver and reinstall it. If you cannot get the keys to work after these steps, you might be having a failing hardware issue.

<p>is it possible to disable UAC for a specific application for all administrator users on that machine?</p>
I tried to create a scheduled task with high privileges but it works only when its author starts it. If another administrator user logs in, he doesn't succeed to run the scheduled task.<br />

            Hi Guidio, 
<br />
<br />I know I've seen some 3rd party apps that do this, I've never looked for just UAC specific app exclusion. That being said, I found a link that may speak to what you are trying to do. Take a look and let me know - <a href="https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/129445-disable-uac-prompts-for-specific-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/129445-...</a>

<p>I tried the method you indicated to me, but it doesn't work. The application I need to run modifies a registry key and then must be started as an administrator. If I use the method you indicated to me I no longer have that feature. I would like any admin
 user can start the application with a double click without UAC.<br />
</p>
Thanks anyway!<br />

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - taskbar flashing depending on position of extra monitors</h2>
                    <p>I’m quite sure this is an Windows 10 issue but maybe some has a good idea on how to solve it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is Windows explorer behavior when placing displays “on top of each other” – see picture #1 below. Display 1 is my laptop (Lenovo Yoga 920) – I was thinking about putting it just in front of me (as opposed to the side of my screens) so I could
 use the Lenovo pen to draw/edit pictures (much easier than trying to use the mouse to annotate, for instance, a chart).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if I do that, Windows Explorer goes to ~20% CPU usage and Windows Driver Foundation uses another ~10% - see picture #2 below. Also, the task bar starts to blink and it becomes very difficult to make it work correctly (unless I disable “auto-hide” – but
 I don’t want the task bar using space, especially on display 2, where I always have some spreadsheets open). Therefore, I have to keep my displays as you see on picture #3 although, physically, my display 1 is just below display 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions on how to solve this issue are welcome!</p>

            I don't think it is actually a problem with Explorer. Rather it is a video driver issue.
<br />
<br />Quite some time back another user had a problem that sounds loosely related.  He had a multi monitor setup and things just wouldn't work right. After a lot of hair pulling he moved on of his monitors from one side of the prime monitor to the other. Problem fix. Very much like for you found.
<br />
<br />How about using your first layout, keeping the physical postitions the same, but change the way you are defining your logical setup, make the external monitor currently 2 as 1, and your Lenovo as 2.
<br />
<br />I know you don't have to define the laptop monitor as #1.  I have a 4K monitor plugged in to my laptop. I have defined it as #1. If I forget to turn it on before starting the computer Windows simply defaults display back to the built in monitor.

            Thanks Rohn007 - I want to try changing the monitors numbers. I couldn't find however a way to make my current "monitor #2" to be seeing by Windows 10 as "monitor #1". Is there an easy way to do it? My current "monitor #2" is already my main display (but
 assigning a different main display doesn't change the number).

            <pre>Sorry, my mistake. I thought I had done it in the past, but apparently not.  From what I've read the numbers are simply auto assigned and you can't change them.
All you can do is turn on the check box for "Make this my main display", on an alternate display. Which you apparently have done.
I guess that means there is no elegant fix for your problem. 
Please do report this problem to MS using feedback. You can simply copy your original posting here to the feedback.
FEEDBACK HUB- SEND FEEDBACK TO MICROSOFT WITH THE FEEDBACK HUB APP &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;F&gt;
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app 
There are real MS staff and developers who monitor all submissions to the UserVoice forums whether you submit them through the Feedback Hub, or by using the Feedback command built in to some MS applications, like Office 2016, or by using the appropriate link directly
NOTE: BEFORE entering your feedback, ESPECIALLY when you have crash problems or driver problems where you are willing to share configuration information from your system, click on the link to “go to diagnostic and usage data settings”. This takes you to the settings dialog for “Feedback &amp; Diagnostics”.  This dialog allows you to specify “Basic” or “Full”. Personally I prefer basic most of the time. But when it is display or driver issues it would be a good idea to set it to “FULL”. 
Note: make sure to click on “Problem” or “Suggestion” radio button at top of dialog. You can’t submit until one is selected. 
Note: After you input the description you are asked to pick categories to put the submission in to.  Clicking on the drop downs is slow and confusing. Instead, click on the “Show category suggestions” hyperlink. It often provides reasonable pairs you can select from. 
Note: there is a special check box for “problem with how text is displayed”
Note: there is a special category for “Driver” issues
Note: When you look at existing feedbacks there is a “Share” button near the top left side of the dialog to get a link to the suggestion. That button is NOT present when creating a new feedback.  You have to submit it, then in the Feedback Hub home you have to click on “My Feedback” at the very top of the screen and select “All Categories” just below that.  Then you can click on your recently submitted suggestion. Now, you can see the “Share” button to get a link you can post back to the forum so other people can comment and vote on the suggestion.
This next link is a wiki with a collection of MS UserVoice.com sites I’ve encountered (I’m sure there are more):
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-desktop/ms-suggestion-box-sites-at-usdervoicecom/7397119c-6d48-49e6-8d94-7bd0a50d214f
In addition, when you post a suggestion / complaint to UserVoice, if you have reached there by being guided while asking a question in a forum, please post a link back to your suggestion in UserVoice in the original Question. That way other people who see your original question because they are looking for the same fix can easily find your suggestion, vote for it and add supporting comments.

Softie Devlin Sco suggested using the Win 10 Feedback Hub to capture errors to submit to MS. I am waiting for confirmation that it can be used to capture, and submit to MS Support, Office installation errors.
NOTE: If you do submit a suggestion to UserVoice, please copy the link and post it back here in a reply so that other people can more easily find it and vote to support it and add their comments.
In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:
1.	On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in Cortana search, then launch the app.
2.	Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback.
3.	Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory
Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) (ie what ever action triggers the error) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done recreating the problem.
4.	Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit
5.	Click Continue using Feedback Hub
6.	Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear)
7.	Open the item you submitted, then click Share
8.	Click Copy link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/ &lt;unique link&gt;)

            <p>Hi Abhi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that&nbsp; you are unable to access USB Drive and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer connected to domain?</li><li>Have you checked if the same USB works fine with any other Windows 7 machine?</li><li>Have you tried changing the USB port in the machine?</li><li>If available, have you tried using any other USB drive in the same PC?</li></ul>
<p>Permissions are rules associated with objects on a computer or network, such as files and folders. Permissions determine whether you can access an object and what you can do with it. For example, you might have access to a document on a shared folder on
 a network. And even though you can read the document, you might not have permissions to make changes to it. System administrators and people with administrator accounts on computers can assign permissions to individual users or groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be several other reasons based on the questionnaire above and to diagnose the issue, let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Turn off the computer, wait for 1-2 minutes, restart computer, plug back USB drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard is where all of hardware of the computer is connected to, including the USB ports. Sometimes the motherboard needs to be “rebooted” also because something can go wrong, i.e. all your USB ports suddenly stop working. The small microprocessor
 on the motherboard will reload the drivers and your USB ports should be back to recognizing all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first turn off your computer using Shut Down or pressing the power button and then UNPLUG it from the wall outlet. Let it sit for about a minute or two and then plug the power cable&nbsp;back in and turn on the computer. When Windows is fully stated, plug
 the USB drive and check</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_818.jpg" />, and then clicking
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>. In the search box, type <span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span>. Under <span>Hardware and Sound</span>, click
<strong><span>Configure a device</span></strong>.</span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Give permission to drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the drive. Choose <strong>Properties</strong>.&nbsp;<span> </span>
</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click the button <strong>Advanced</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Click the button <strong>Edit</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Double-click on one permission entry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Give it full control right, and check the box “<strong>Apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container only</strong>”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that you're used to having Skype separated with Microsoft. However, as you know Skype is now a program being owned by Microsoft and the main reason why you are unable to unlink the separate Skype account to Microsoft is to align Skype's
 usages and policy with Microsoft as a part of our One Microsoft Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that closing your account means you won’t be able to use it to sign in to the Microsoft products and services you’ve been using. If you want to proceed in deleting the account, simply follow the steps on this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to buy a product from the Microsoft store US website, you need to be in the US because it will require you to enter your address and state. There's no option to choose a country when checking out the product you want to purchase. As a workaround,
 we suggest either accessing the Microsoft store India website and purchase the product you want there or if you know someone from the US, you can ask if they can order the product so that it will be delivered on their US address, and then have them ship the
 product to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, kindly reply to this thread.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; Pay particular attention to the DVD driver and get the most recent one available even if it shows it is already in good shape.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, do so from
 the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
</span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Did Microsoft Enforcement target me because of my religion&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebel ice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Did Microsoft Enforcement target me because of my religion&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since xbox enforcement has no way to contact them I'm posting this here to have it addressed. My gamerpic has been suspended and I need a justifiable reason for it. My gamerpic was the Jerusalem cross, a religious symbol that I have been using for months
 now, but yesterday 9/24/18 it suddenly became a problem? So my question is, is microsoft purposely preventing me from having a religious symbol as my gamerpic because its a christian symbol or would it be the same for all religious symbols?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone who wants to check that the cross is not linked to any hate group or extremists may use this link:

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue. We appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned the issue started after updating the graphic drivers, I would suggest you to try uninstalling the driver through device manager and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Locate the graphic driver and restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if that doesn't help, try performing a system restore. </p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This could be caused if the user account is corrupted. I suggest that you create a new user account and check if you are able to create the folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To create a new user profile, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account.
 When the account is created, a profile will also be created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 User Accounts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety and then clicking User Accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click
 Manage another account.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Create a new account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not give the existing user name for the new user
 account.</span></span></p>

<p>Download drivers section and download / reinstall your video driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would probably also&nbsp;completely uninstall the Java after clearing its stored files in control panel and temporary internet files.</p>
<p>Then download the full installer java version and reinstall it after a fresh 'restart'</p>

                    My computer OS is Win7 Professional and it has 32GB of memory and a 2GB graphic card installed, can I reduce the pagefile.sys to 8GB or less? Is it &nbsp; effecting the computer performance?
<div>And the computer playing back a DVD is not very well. It slows down every 10 minutes or so. Can someone help?</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Reduce the page file on C to a fixed size of 500mb. This will allow the creation of mini-dump files when things go wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then set&nbsp;up a system managed file on the 1Tb drive. &nbsp;</p>
