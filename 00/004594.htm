<h2>            I found a recurring charge for Skype service that I did not order.</h2>
                    How do I reach a live person via telephone or connect to live chat ? Every time I try, the link does not work for chat. I do not know of any account I have ever authorized for Skype, so I assume it is fraudulent

<p>Completely agree. </p>
<p>I want to contact Skype to discuss a bill that has blocked my credit card.&nbsp; How do I do that and why have Skype taken a £5 amount from my card.&nbsp; Nat West Mastercard confirm it is definitely Skype and not someone else pretending to be Skype.&nbsp; There are no
 bills for years on either of my Skype accounts.</p>
<p>They say the reason they did it is because Skype cross checks on several frauds now.&nbsp; They say contact MS customer services.&nbsp; What a joke!</p>

</p><p>Upon checking the Skype account linked to your community, we found out that you have an active Skype Number subscription. There are two ways that you can cancel your subscription depending if you have a calling subscription or a Skype Number. To cancel your
 calling subscription, the steps that you may follow is through this FAQ: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1881/how-do-i-cancel-or-change-my-skype-subscription?q=cancel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I do not think cancelling your subsciption helps. MS are letting somone use your (our) credit card (s) to buy Skype credit.&nbsp; This means that we can move house, unsubscribe or stand on our heads and MS will still let them use our cards to buy stuff.&nbsp; Basically,
 MS need to sort this out. <br />

<p>Thanks BenjieC </p>
<p>You have misunderstood the issue. I have checked both my Skype accounts and neither ave had a bill for years.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is confirmed by my bank and by your FAQs that criminals are using stolen credit cards to buy high volumes of small Skype credits.&nbsp; I now have
 a chat reference and a promise of an investigation.</p>
<p>Please read the complaints carefully before answering. </p>

<p>I have tried for 5 months to unsubscribe from Skype but there is nothing in the Skype system or Microsoft or my accounts which will let me find my accounts or unsubscribe.&nbsp; It seems strange, but I have come to believe that Skype must be being managed by
 a fraudulent entity stealing my money, and I find that really surprising and that Skype or Microsoft apparently intentionally keeps raising blind dead ends so we go round in circles getting nowhere.&nbsp; Even the so-called unsubscribe memos are misleading and
 lead nowhere.&nbsp; I believe that an electronic service which does not allow unsubscribe is illegal in Canada.&nbsp; I cannot find a human to tell me how to avoid recurring billings or to unsubscribe.&nbsp; If anyone knows how to do this, I would appreciate it.&nbsp; Cheers&nbsp;

<div>I'd imagine it is an HD2, shipped with Windows Mobile 6.5, that has been flashed with an Android operating system. I don't think it would be possible for it to retain its Windows Mobile identity in any way, so it'll probably only run Android functionality/apps.
 But you would be best asking whoever sold it to you - I may be wrong.</div>

    <title>Line and paragraph spacing in Office Word 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joseph_lynch&#35;&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Line and paragraph spacing in Office Word 2007</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello. Whenever I open a new Office Word 2007 document the line spacing is always set at 1.15 and the paragraph spacing is always double spacing; I have to manually change it to
 1.0 and "Remove space after paragraph". I would like it so when I open any and all new docs that the line spacing is always 1.0 and the paragraph spacing is always single spacing.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Can anyone please instruct me how to do this?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>
<span>Thank you.</span>

<p>This is certainly not something that should be happening. When you open a Word 2007 document in a newer version, the title bar will tell you that the document is in Compatibility Mode. Unless you explicitly resave the document in the newer format, it will
 remain a Word 2007 document and should be displayed the same. If you save in the newer format, it's conceivable that some formatting would be changed, but you shouldn't be experiencing what you're seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that this is a display issue only and that you don't see this in Print Preview (or at least not when you print)? If so, there are a couple of settings that may help:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>At <strong>File | Options | Advanced: Display</strong>, check the box for "Disable hardware graphics acceleration."</li><li>At <strong>File | Options | Advanced: Display</strong>, change the setting for "Optimize character positioning for layout rather than readability."</li></ol>
<p>If neither of those helps, you might check for an updated display driver for the computer.</p>

</p><p>Checked pst file and it is not marked as read only.&nbsp; Had on C drive in another file, but then just to be sure, put it right in same place as the new pst file that was created when I set up the 2013 account initially.</p>

</p><p>I brought pst file to a computer running <strong>Outlook 2010</strong> and did:&nbsp; File - Open - Open outlook data file and it instantly opened and all emails were there and could be opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the computer running <strong>Outlook 2013</strong> I tried 3 methods:</p>
<p>1. File - Open &amp; Export - Open outlook data file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing happens (dialog box goes away), no error message - there's no file to open after clicking&nbsp;&nbsp; (on 2010 you just click to open and then you see the new file)</p>
<p>2. File - Open - Import - Import/export - Import from another program or file - Outlook data file - Browse for file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error message: The operation failed.&nbsp; the messaging interfaces have returned an unknown error.&nbsp; If the problem persists restart outlook.</p>
<p>3. File - Account Settings - data files - Add&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; error: the requested operation failed</p>

<p>Hi Kiton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, if I only create <strong>100</strong> row cells, when in the scaling setting it will print 3 pages but in Autofit with 1x1 it will print one page. After I create nearly<strong> 1000 row cells</strong>, when in the scaling setting it
 will print 21 pages, but in Autofit with 1x1 it will print 3 pages. I think the root cause is due to although Autofit it was change the setting of the cell fonts as suitable as the printer can printer in one page for a lot of cells you have created but it
 still can not achieve the aim to in one page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that may I confirm that how much cells you have printed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Clark</p>

<h2>            formula to add&#47; subtract colums in Excel 2007</h2>
                    I can't seem to get to grips with entering and getting the right formula to add/ subtract colums. Can you please advise? Thank you.<br />
Thanks for your replies but what I want to know is how to add up the colum. I have tried =SUM(B3:B15) but it won't add up in cell in colum!!! Very frustrating.<br />
I'm sorry for the confusion. What I want to add is the figures entered in a colum i.e. colum B Numbers from 3 to 15 as mentioned I have tried =SUM(B3:B15) but it won't work when I press enter it just shows =SUM(B3:B15) in the space where I want the answer????<br />

            Maybe your Excel is at "displaying formula" mode. Try toggling back to "normal" mode &nbsp;by pressing "Ctrl" and "`" (the key on left of numeric 1 key, and above "tab" key) at the same time.
<div><br />
<div>Or it could be that the cell where you keyed in the formula are not formatted as numbers. Press "Ctrl 1" and reformat the cell as numbers.</div>

            Hi Bruce
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Go to Devices and Printers
<br />
<br />Right click your preferred printer and choose 'Set as Default' you will get a popup asking if you want Windows to stop managing your Printers - choose Yes . . .

            the main printer setting you referred to has the printer I want as default. in the word software the wrong printer is marked as default and will not let me change it.

            Have you restarted Word? Word uses the Windows default at startup, then retains the current setting (if you change it) as the active printer for the rest of the Word session (unless you change it again). You are unable to change to a different printer?
 In that case, you might try starting Word in Office Safe Mode (press <strong>Ctrl</strong> while Word is loading and answer yes when asked if you want to start in Safe Mode) to see what the situation is there.

            <p>Hi, Harsha. I get the same results on all four browsers I have tried, namely MS Edge, MS Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and MS Edge Mobile on my Lumia 650. Same each and every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather not do the Call Me or Start Chat, unless you can point me to someone in particular. I have already spent three hours or so on Chat, to no avail. The Tech I worked with did all kinds of things to my MS Surface 3, even though that makes no sense.
 It happens across multiple browsers, and the error message even states, "Something went wrong on our end." I do not believe it is my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my Surface 3 in September 2015, I should have an O365&nbsp;subscription until late August 2016. Yet, right before this happened (early August 2016), my O365 subscription disappeared from my online account. Curiously, Office 2016 is still installed on
 my Surface. I can create docs no problem, but I cannot on the Word and Excel Mobile Apps.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Inbox Rules doesn&#39;t work on existing mails, but works when new mail come</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_exchon-mso_o365b/outlook-inbox-rules-doesnt-work-on-existing-mails/38ed79c2-4d20-4cbd-8485-70ed630d4126" title="Split from this thread">
this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem in my organisation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Office 365, when I set a rule about an email I send To a person to move it to a specific inbox and stop processing more rules, whenever I RECEIVE an email that is addressed to me and also to this same person, it moves it into that other person's inbox
 instead of to the sender's inbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting various of the many filters around this, including <em>"Apply this rule after the message arrives
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">from &lt;people&gt;</span>, move it to the &lt;specified folder&gt;, and stop processing more rules"</em> but all the rules get screwed up then and none work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleting all the rules (5 times so far in 12 months) with no respite from the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I send an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and I receive an email from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - both emails should go to the person's inbox.&nbsp; They do not if there is more than one person in the To field eg a group organisational email sent to me, my colleagues
 as well as person1. They go to person1's inbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 2: If a person2 sends an email to both me and to person1, person2's email should to to person2's inbox. It won't. It will go to person1's inbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 3: In the send mail box; I can't run all the rules in there and move all the mail sent to the various inboxes like I used to be able to in Office 7; some move to the wrong inbox, even when there is only 1 email in the To field; some don't move at
 all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My rules all worked well in Office 7, it stopped working in Office 10 &amp; was the same in Office 16 and messed up all my internal and external people rules (I work in IT support) and doesn't work in Office 365 either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported it more than once and received simple replies which assumed I am a new user with no knowledge.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a simple rule I want to create, same as I had been using for..... however long rules have been in place in Office Outlook. I've been using Outlook since.. well, I'm 60 and I have been using computers since I was 25 if that helps. Can you call me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been reported so many times by so many people including me. Could you please tell me:</p>
<p>1. What you did to test it</p>
<p>2. If it worked, exactly what you set in the rules to make it work - with a specific example and screensnips if possible?</p>

<p><span>Hi Tracey,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Actually, the Outlook inbox rule is for the emails coming in (to the mailbox). In other words, the Outlook inbox rule is for controlling which folder the email will go to while the sender sends to you (the recipient).
 But it can't control which folder the email goes to from the sender side. For more information, you can refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59</a>&nbsp;(the
 first 2 sentences are introducing that the inbox rule is for coming emails for recipient).&nbsp;</p>

 manually, but since the stupid sync copied EVERYTHING in the documents folder I have 2000 files that are not needed to be saved on the website?

            When you delete from the website, you will be asked whether to delete it from the phone as well.&nbsp; Be sure to clear the checkbox before you click "okay."&nbsp; That will delete the duplicate photo from the MyPhone site without removing it from the phone.<br />

<h2>            Are there some whay to access Office365 calendars using VBScript&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>Anyone knows how to read calendars events from office 365 using VBScript?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the Outlook REST API:</p>
<p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/pt-br/office/office365/api/calendar-rest-operations</p>
<p>https://dev.outlook.com/restapi/getstarted</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I undertend that needs to register application and it's only to Android, IOs or Web application. And I have a Windows stand alone application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Enrico</p>

    <title>Favorite email folders scroll out of view in Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmclachlan- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Favorite email folders scroll out of view in Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I am new to Office 365. I am familiar with Office 2007 and Office 2016. In both of the desktop versions, email folders designated as "favorite", show at the top of the list of folders and when you scroll down your list of folders, the favorite folders remain
 displayed at the top of the list, like locked rows in Excel. When I&nbsp;use 365 however, the favorite folders scroll out of view. This is a real pain for me. Anyone have a solution to keep the favorite folders displayed as I scroll down my list of folders?</p>

<p>hi jim,</p>
<p>from your description, i’d like to confirm whether you want to remain the favorite folder at the top of the list in owa (outlook web app:
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office.com/owa</a> ) when you scroll down like the screenshot below shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ae301b15-e879-4158-be2d-8ed0339c999f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dae301b15-e879-4158-be2d-8ed0339c999f" /></a><br />
if yes, it is not feasible to achieve it . in the outlook client, this feature is different from that in owa. the favorite folder will&nbsp; remain at the top of the list. since this feature is not supported, you can submit feedback&nbsp; to our related team via

<p>if anything is misunderstood , please provide more details for your requirement.</p>
<p>thanks, <br />

<h2>            What do you do when the table is too big for page and goes into header of document&#63;</h2>
                    I already had two tables in the document. I am adding rows with graphics that enlarges the rows.&nbsp; The first table is not breaking and going up into the header of the document.&nbsp; The second table breaks to the next page but the header row did not.&nbsp; I would
 like it to do so.<br />

In the Table Properties dialog, make sure that the Text wrapping is set to None.&nbsp; To get the header row to repeat, you must click on the Repeat Header Rows item in the Data section of the Table Tools&gt;Layout tab of the Ribbon.
