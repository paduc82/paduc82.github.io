<h2>            How to deactivate Windows 10 I got from Microsoft Imagine in order to sell PC</h2>
                    <p>My university is part of Microsoft Imagine program and this is how I got product key for windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In meantime I got new machine and installed Windows 10 with same product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to sell my old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Formatting hard drive did not work, as soon as I reinstalled windows it activated itself with digital license.</p>
<p>2. Running slmgr /upk (In order to uninstall product key) did not work, as soon as I restarted windows&nbsp; activated itself with digital license.</p>
<p>3. Running following commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; slmgr /upk in order to uninstall product key</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; slmgr /cpky - this clears product key from registry</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; slmgr /rearm - to reset licensing status of the machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first this seemed to help, I restarted machine several times and windows was deactivated.</p>
<p>But when I performed update of the machine (Windows Update) then it activated itself again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply can not believe there is no easy way to do this.</p>
<p>I do not want to sell my PC with this problem, because even if completely format my HDD, the person who buys it can simply reinstall and get copy of windows for free.</p>
<p>I know that license is somehow tied to my hardware components(motherboard mostly) but changing motherboard is not an option and I find frustrating there is no easy way to do this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, bolevole,
<br />If this license is youth you need to fully delete Windows from PC before selling. Boot from installation media, run recovery environment, command prompt and format disk. Or just cancel booting three times in row to get a recovery environment.

<p>The problem is that person who buys my pc and install Windows 10 gets license for free, because even when Windows is completely deleted and reinstalled(which I did), it activates itself again.</p>

            Unfortunately there is no way to avoid this because of digital license exists and impossibility of Windows deactivating.
<br />But this is not your responsibility and not your liability, you cannot stop illegal using. You cannot transfer Windows and you do all you have to do so no one can blame you.

            But I am worried about my Windows on new machine, I do not want to have problems because same product key is used on two different machines. But since I know my product key, and potential buyer does not, does that mean I should not have any issues since
 I can confirm activation with my product key?

            Sure you may confirm activation with your product key. It will be better to activate your new PC before selling old one. May be you'll need to do phone activation.

<h2>            Use built-in administrator account or standard user account</h2>
                    &nbsp;<span>From: Luc<br />
<br />
<p>If I understand it correctly, for security reasons it's best to have a separate administrator account and a standard user account, even on one-user PCs (as in my case). However, which of the following two is
 the better option:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Enable the built-in administrator account and "downgrade" the account that was created when Vista was installed to that of a standard user;</p>
<p>2. Continue using the administrator account that was created when installing
</p>
<p>Vista, create a separate standard user account and leave the built-in administrator account alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice on pros and cons for any option (unless it's equally safe -- convenient it is for sure -- to have just one account if there's only one user).</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Luc</p>

Hi Luc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's actually better to do both. Create another administrator account (normal default or the built-in one) to use as a backup in case you need to repair your other default administrator account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more convenient to use just one of the administrator Accounts but it's just not as restricted as in a Standard account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For better security, you can create a Standard account and use it for everyday non-administrative tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Hope this helps,<br />

<h2>            Mail in Windows 10 - &#34;The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Verify that the link points to the correct file and location.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently upgraded my HP G62-b32sa laptop from Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit to Windows 10. I have set up two Outlook email accounts in the Windows 10 Mail app. In emails on both accounts, I receive the following error message in any area where an
 image should be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Verify that the link points to the correct file and location."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is accompanied with a small red cross in the upper left corner (please refer to attached image).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rectify this I have reset Windows 10, but the problem still persists. Kindly could you help me solve the problem, as it makes the the email experience in Windows 10 very jarring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/011794d4-4917-4d7d-b55a-ce450c468e70" /></p>

            I have this same issue. To add further information, I upgraded from Windows 8.1. The Modern mail app worked fine and displayed linked images. I have gone to settings for each of my accounts and confirmed that the box to download internet images is checked.
 It has not resolved the issue.

            One more point. I set up my accounts in Outlook 2013 and the linked images work fine (after selecting download images or add to safe sender). There is no equivalent feature in the Mail application. Unfortunately, I need to use mail with my office Exchange
 2003 server, which does not work with Outlook 2013.

            I am also having the same issue.&nbsp; I upgraded from&nbsp; 8.1 and the only issue I am having is email images not downloading.&nbsp; I have the box checked to download them but I am having the same issue.&nbsp; I tried &nbsp;installing outlook, which is also having several problems
 on my machine as well.&nbsp; However, it is noteworthy that when I created a new user account&nbsp; and added my email to the app on that account, it worked flawlessly.&nbsp; However, I feel too invested in my account to abandon it for a new one, so this doesn't work for
 me.

            I'm having the exact same problem with my Gmail Account. Does anybody know where the Temporary Folder for the Mail App is? Maybe it's missing or corrupt, so it would be a good idea to delete it or whatever. Creating a new User Account is not an option
 for me.

            I updated to Windows 10 on another computer. It displays linked images properly. BUT, on the second computer the trying to respond or forward a message causes Mail to crash. This is a problem as I now have non-functional mail on two computers.

            Same issue I have on my Lenovo Q190. Upgraded from Win. 8.1, mail worked flawlessly. Now on Win 10 I don't see any images even so I have it selected in the setup. Seems like mail is looking for the images in the wrong folder. MS- any idea? &nbsp;

            It's not a solution to reformat a whole PC (loosing settings, applications etc.) only to reset a single app. There should be a way to reset its storage.

            <p>Like you have also observed, creating a new user account solves the issue. Unfortunately the only solution seems to be to create a new user account (with a different name - using the same name will cause the same issues), transfer personal files from old
 account, and delete old account. I can understand however that this is not a feasible option for everyone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that a PC Refresh does not solve the issue. Clean install seems to be the only other workaround.

            <p><span><span>Hi Shashwat,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us try the following methods, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
</span><strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the article: <strong>Windows Startup settings (Including Safe Mode)</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when
 you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose
 some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected
 to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Perform System File Checker (SFC) scan, to repair the missing/corrupted system files.</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press ‘Windows + X’ keys. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.

Hi There. It's problem in your pointing driver I think. Because if you uninstall synaptics driver.It's working perfectly. So upgrade it or disable it.

<p>Same problem, Skype to Skype call ends as soon as contact is made. Re-Installed Skype from Windows Store still same (noted there was no facility to update as hinted in your suggestion) problem.
</p>
<p>Skype was working before on this new, PC Windows 10, 75 MB download speed, 5ms ping, Intel i7 prossesor and GTX1080 GPU 32Gb ram. All driver are up to date, checked via Device Manager and updated as nessesary manually.</p>

This is laughable. Most people only have one internet connection in their homes. At least tell them they might have to or look in to the setup port of forwarding or check their firewall settings.</span>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b>:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. During this 10 days, it will remove all the virus infected files and folders. I suggest you to
 create a backup of your data and then Install Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Place your computer in Clean boot state to identify the application causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Placing your computer in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates
 or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Switching OS from one hard drive to the other</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently purchased a new hard drive to install into my desktop which is running Windows 7. I currently have two hard drives at the moment on my system. One of them has the operating system installed on it (this is the drive I want to replace)
 that is a TB and the second hard drive is 500 GB and has all my music and software installed on it. The hard drive I just purchased is a TB but is also 7200rpm. I basically want to replace the TB I have now which is running at 5400rpm with my new one, as well
 as switch everything from my 500 GB hard drive (which is almost completely full) to this new TB, and in doing so put the operating system onto the 500 GB hard drive (essentially swapping the two). I assumed this would be accomplished by designating one of
 the hard drives as the one with the OS and the other as the one without. I am not, however, too sure as to how to accomplish this other than perhaps somehow by creating a system image. Help would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently purchased a new hard drive to install into my desktop which is running Windows 7. I currently have two hard drives at the moment on my system. One of them has the operating system installed on it (this is the drive I want to replace) that is
 a TB and the second hard drive is 500 GB and has all my music and software installed on it. The hard drive I just purchased is a TB but is also 7200rpm. I basically want to replace the TB I have now which is running at 5400rpm with my new one, as well as switch
 everything from my 500 GB hard drive (which is almost completely full) to this new TB, and in doing so put the operating system onto the 500 GB hard drive (essentially swapping the two). I assumed this would be accomplished by designating one of the hard drives
 as the one with the OS and the other as the one without. I am not, however, too sure as to how to accomplish this other than perhaps somehow by creating a system image. Help would be much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<div>Your best bet would be to use an external partition manager - you need to take a number of steps, and external managers are less likely to encounter problems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please clarify the target - as I read it, it is to have the new HD containing the contents&nbsp; old 500GB HD - and the old 500GB to have the OS partition on it</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If that's the case, then it's a fairly simple routine</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) clone the old 500GB drive to the new disk - then expand the partition to include the whole drive</div>
<div>2) Shrink the OS partition to less than 490GB</div>
<div>3) Clone the boot partition and the OS partition (and the Recovery&nbsp; partition if it exists)&nbsp;to the 500GB drive, make sure that the proper partition is made Active.</div>
<div>4) remove the old TB drive, reboot.</div>
<div>5) You may have to run a boot repair using the Win7 disk - and you may have to re-activate.</div>

<p>Sorry, I logged off @ around 4am &amp; didn't see your post...</p>
<p>X.V. Color is a Sony Technology &amp; as Silent Paradigm has stated, the Xbox360 doesn't support the X.V. Color Space.. So you, won't be able to use that setting for the Xbox360, unless your TV Converts to it.. Which would add Input Lag anyway...</p>

<p>The tv doesn't convert the source to xv and enabling it doesn't cause lag. ATM only certain camcorders support xv color.

<p>Does it typically make any difference if the setting is enabled when the output contains little to no over- or undershoot of legal BT.709 values? On my TV forcing xvYCC on with a regular BT.709 source makes no difference in color handling (which is correct).</p>

            No need to worry, system tries to keep a free space just after MFT - so called MFT zone - to keep MFT non-fragmented if there will be needed to increase it size. In addition, small MFT fragmentation does not have noticeable negative effect.

    <title>Microphones no longer working Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> undercover llama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphones no longer working Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have discovered a problem today and I cannot for the life of me figure it out. For the past few months my Turtle Beach x12 headset microphone has been working, and it still worked after I upgraded to preview build 10162 of Windows 10. However, yesterday
 when my friend called me on Skype, it said my audio device wasn't working. I looked in the Sound Manager in control panel and it wasn't picking up anything. I checked all the settings, volume was at max, there was nothing wrong. I figured that it was just
 dead because I had crushes the cords by accident a few times. So, I unplugged it and plugged in a Blue Snowball microphone and it worked perfectly. I thought the issue was gone. Well, today I tried recording a video to show my friend using Mirillis Action!(it
 might have relevance, but I'm not sure). Anyway, when I looked over the video the audio was very quiet, and this is what happened to my other microphone as well. I checked all the settings and they were fine. I tried changing the sample rate/bit depth thing,
 and then this new microphone stopped working as well. I tried changing the settings back to default, and still, dead. I tried to configure the microphone and it said the Wizard couldn't start and to check my audio settings. I reinstalled my Realtek Audio drivers
 and that didn't help. I restarted multiple times. I also tested the microphone on my laptop, which is also running Windows 10, and it worked fine. I am somewhat suspecting of Mirillis Action! because it has been crashing a lot, but I don't see how that would
 make my microphone completely unusable. I've looked this up on Google but it appears that no one has had this issue. Both the microphones went from working, to really quiet, to completely dead. Please help, I would really like to be able to talk to my friend
 on Skype again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the only Windows Topics for Windows 10 is Upgrade Reservation, and I don't know where else to ask this, so I'm just putting it in Windows 8.1, which was my old OS before upgrading to the preview build.</p>

            <p>Hi Llama,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>b) Did you make any changes to the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to incompatible corrupt drivers,&nbsp;missing updates or incorrect audio settings. In order to diagnose the root cause, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the audio troubleshooters and check if they are helpful. To check issues with the microphone, run the recording audio troubleshooter.</p>
<p>a) Type <em><strong>troubleshoot</strong></em> in the Search bar and click <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p>b) Click on <strong>View all</strong>.</p>
<p>c) Select <strong>Record Audio</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</p>
<p>d) Also, to check audio issues with the headset, run the <strong>Playing audio
</strong>troubleshooter from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>As you have already reinstalled drivers to no avail, I would suggest you to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check for the issue.</p>
If you the raw executable driver file for your sound card from the system manufacturer, I would suggest you to install the driver in compatibility mode as detailed below.
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the downloaded driver file.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Properties</span></strong> and&nbsp;then select <strong>
<span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Tick mark the option <strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode for:</span></strong> and then select
<strong><span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></strong> from the drop down menu (or any other operating system that is compatible with the driver).</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong> and install the driver.</span></li></ol>

            Hello, unfortunately none of those methods worked. The troubleshooter immediately told me it couldn't find a problem and the other method didn't do anything. Also, there aren't any changes that I can think of to my computer. I have also checked for viruses
 and found nothing. I've just been playing Terraria on Steam while talking to my friend over Skype. This problem was very sudden.

            <p>I looked again and there were actually multiple updates on the day that my first microphone stopped working. Action!, Java, and NVIDIA HD Audio drivers updated on that day. Could one of those be an issue, and if so, how could I revert to the older version?</p>

<p>
</p><p>What worked for me was a system restore. It seemed that one of the drivers that I had downloaded caused my microphones to suddenly stop working. I would suggest finding out if you installed any drivers on the day that it stopped working.</p>

Out of the blue, my media player has stopped working. I don't think I did anything to cause it, but it won't begin to play an audio CD. I get no error message, it just won't play. I have another media player on my computer, which didn't interfere with Media

<br />DRIVERS

<br />
<br />WdFilter.sys - Windows defender
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Uninstall Adguard, Kaspersky and Malwarebytes. Driver dates are within last few months. Keep a watch on your system for few hours. Later on, you can decide to install latest versions of these one by one. One at a time and watch for few hours to see if BSOD is caused by that particular app or not.
<br />3. Minor point - Also update your Windows so that all Windows related driver also get updated as NETIO.SYS is also named.

<p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows 8 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows 8 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>

<font><span>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows 8 Pro that come preinstalled on PCs have downgrade rights to a previous version of Windows (example: Windows 7, Windows Vista).</p>
<p>If your copy came pre-installed on your system, you may downgrade your copy to Windows 7.</p>
<p>If not you need purchase a copy of Windows 7 and install the same on your computer.</p>
<p>• Downgrade rights are only available for licenses obtained through OEM or Volume Licensing (VL) and not apply to Full version (FPP).</p>
<p>• OEM downgrade rights apply to Windows 8 Pro and allows for downgrades up to two prior version</p>
<p>• Software Assurance through VL (Volume licensing) provides the greatest flexibility, allowing for downgrades to all prior versions and editions besides Windows 7 Ultimate and Vista Ultimate editions.Without Software Assurance coverage, VL has downgrade
 rights to prior versions of Windows with the exception of Enterprise.</p>
<p>• It is not possible for a Windows 8 copy with multi-language function to downgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Windows XP Pro as multi language function is exclusive to Windows 7 Enterprise edition and not available for Professional edition.</p>

            <p>The only place I know of is on amazon.com where you should be able to find an OEM version of windows7 Pro. for about $100.&nbsp; Good news is that it comes with a key and a disk.&nbsp; Bad news is that the key is a one-time thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will offer you a bit of advice if you go that route....</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, create
 a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or 4 DVD +Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of
 your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp; With this image, you will never ever need a Win7 disk or activation

<h2>            Changed HDD for SSD now windows not activated</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I just cloned my HDD to an SSD, and now Windows is no longer activated.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter doesn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>The process returns the code 0x004f034</p>
<p>The Microsoft Account method does not work</p>
<p>The chat bot doesn't come up with anything helpful</p>
<p>I don't really want to call the US for help, but I can't see a UK number for Microsoft support ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have other people had this problem. I'm not doing anything at al unusual here. When I did this with another PC it just worked straight away. Maybe the difference here is it is not the original OS &amp; key this machine was bought with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi TonyB83, I tried a few of these things, not including disabling security yet (Kaspersky in my case). Despite that article being quite recent, not much of it is like my system behaves - no&nbsp;C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\Download folder fox example,
 no obvious option to search for phone numbers in the activation area. No response to SLUI 4 in Run pop-up.</p>
<p>What do I actually lose for not having Windows Activated ? For the moment it seems to be working, but I guess either I won't get updates (although I have so far) or it will just stop working ?</p>
<p>Many thanks..</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi. I need your help guys. My computer will not come out of power save mode. I was chatting with someone on MSN and my computer's light went from blue
 to orange and my screen went black and I got the message "power save mode, press any key or move the mouse to exit." I pressed all the keys and moved the mouse but it wouldn't exit power save mode. I unplugged my computer and I even switched around the RAM
 cards. I took out the CMOS battery and tried it. Nothing worked. I also took out my video and my graphics driver cables. It still does not work after I put everything back in place [except the battery]. I recently put the battery back in and it still dosen't
 work. I dusted my hardware inside my computer and cleaned the fans. There's this orange light on inside my computer as soon as i put the power cable in the back of my pc. I don't know what to do. This is so frustrating. I need your help! Here are some pictures
 of my computer[Dell Inspiron 530s A].<br />

<br />
To always allow all types of attachments, you can change this setting in Safety options. After changing this setting, you will be able to download and open all types of attachments; however, changing this setting won't unblock attachments that Mail has already
 received. To allow these types of attachments for certain messages, you can ask the sender to compress (or zip) an attachment before sending it.

<h2>            Option to uninstall&#47;change Programs not shown in Control Panel</h2>
                    
<p>original title: why is Uninstall, change or repair button not showing up on programs and features? How do i turn those options on?</p>
<p>I am trying to uninstall a program I installed on my computer (Vista OS) but when I go to the Programs and Features panel and select the program I want to remove, there is no button to Uninstall, Change or Repair.&nbsp; The only options above the list of programs
 are Organize and View.&nbsp; I selected the program to see if the Uninstall button would appear once a program is selected but no button appears.&nbsp; How do I turn on the option to Uninstall the program?. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the response ... however, that was the first thing I tried but no options appear.&nbsp; It appears that somewhere there is a flag that dictates that those options should not be shown which is probably why they don't show up when you right click
 also (I guess Microsoft is protecting users from themselves even if the user is not a novice). &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm just not sure where to turn the flag on so that those options appear. Microsoft has probably hidden this option or called it something that is not obvious.&nbsp;
 Sigh... I wish uninstalling a program was as simple as in Windows XP.</p>

    <title>HDD performance issues on Windows 10 - Stuttering and Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michellsr  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD performance issues on Windows 10 - Stuttering and Freezing</h2>
                    <p>For weeks from now I'm searching around the internet trying to figure out a solution for that problem that appeared when I changed my system to Windows 10 (Clean install, no upgrade from Windows 7).<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;The first time I encountered this problem was soon after installing Windows 10. I was copying large size files from one disk to another while listening to music but suddenly the music started to stutter, becoming
 almost impossible to proper listen to it. Then, I've started some tests and noticed that even when doing no heavy HDD tasks, random stuttering was appearing, with intervails that depends on how much tasks I'm doing on the HDD at that moment. For example, if
 I'm listening to music and save a file on any program, it will cause some stuttering on the audio.<br />
<br />
The most painfull consequence of this problem is with Nvidia Share (former Shadowplay). I like to record my gameplays to share on the internet, it always worked fine on that same PC with Windows 7, but since I've changed my system to Windows 10, its not working
 anymore because of that HDD performance issue (since it constant uses the HDD while recording). Everytime I start to record with Nvidia Share the game start to stutter and freeze randomly, just like the audio does when I'm just listening to music. It turns
 the gameplay almost impossible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Additional Info:</strong> I've installed Windows 10 on a new HDD, so I'm using 2 HDD's on my PC, the old one with the Windows 7 instance installed and that new one with Windows 10 installed (just like the screenshot below).&nbsp;If I boot my PC with the
 Windows 7 instance, none of these problems happens, I can listen to music and watch videos from my disk normaly with no stuttering, and record with Nvidia Share with no problem, all running smooth and fast. But everything turns bad again if I boot up with
 Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Possible solutions I've tried with no effect:</strong> Searching around the internet I've found many people with similar problems and many tips to solve it. Here is everything I've done based on those tips:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tried multiple drivers for my USB headset Plantronics Gamecom 780 (Thought this could be the problem at the beginning);</li><li>Changed the power plan to performance priority;</li><li>Changed the page file settings to manual with the system recommended value for min and max (also tried with higher values);</li><li>Used Driver Booster to update all my outdated drivers;</li><li>Added the "AHCI Link Power Management" option at the power management settings to set it Active (it was already set on Active);</li><li>Deactivated the "Windows Search" and "Superfetch" services;</li><li>Deactivated all Windows 10 notifications;</li><li>Deactivated the Xbox DVR recording;</li><li>Other minor desperate configurations like setting the desktop wallpaper to a solid black background.</li></ul>
<p>None of those tips gave me a result. The problem persists and I'm now completely out of options and drastically depending of help. I also use this machine as a workstation, even though I'm a designer and this problem doesnt disturbs my tasks on Photoshop
 and Illustrator, however, the risk of this problem affect my work on any momment is something I need to get rid off.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System specs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intel i7 930;</li><li>Mobo PCWare x58 Flame;</li><li>12 GB RAM DDR3 (3x 4GB working in tripple channel);</li><li>GeForce GTX 660;</li><li>2x HDD Kingston 1TB 7200rpm;</li><li>Windows 10 Pro.</li></ul>
<p>I much appreciate the help, in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Riel, first of all thank you for answering.<br />
<br />
Done all the 3 steps. I also checked my disk integrity and performed a clean system start up, only with the system services and processes running.
<strong>The problem persists</strong>.<br />
<br />
I'm starting to believe its a Windows 10 fault and I'm doomed to wait till microsoft fixes it on upcoming updates.<br />

<p>Have you tried disabling dynamic tick in the kernel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I am facing the same problem the OP is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bought a Y910-17ISK Lenovo 3 days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SSD is fine, nothing major, nice and smooth but the 1TB WD drive storage on AHCI is really clunky and stuttery at any program running on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: AoE 2 + any other game. Stutter occurs in a near constant 1 sec rate at booting a game and then diminishes and gets better the more stuff is loaded in memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 32GB of RAM, could basically load everything there but the underlying storage problem is real.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on both the Intel rapid storage driver and MS basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't yet done the HIPM + DISM tweak to turn it off, which I will once I get home in the morning. I also have Arch Linux installed next to it but I haven't yet started doing anything big on it so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@OP, I'm curious if you can fix it with disabling the dynamic tick feature they brought in after the windows 7 kernel(which was basically the Vista improved kernel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Requires admin rights.</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am in need of some help.</p>
<p>I currently have windows installed and every time windows updates to the latest version I get a blue screen error and my pc restarts.</p>
<p>The error stop code is "page fault in nonpaged area"</p>
<p>What failed "fp.sys"</p>
<p>This happens during the download at about 80-90%.</p>
<p>I have even paid out for a pc health check program as was told this should fix it but it has not.</p>
<p>Any help in trying to sort this would be appreciated as this is doing my head in now as I am unable to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>Thank in advance</p>

<p>Well what can i say.</p>
<p>At last it has worked and windows has updated without shutting down.</p>
<p>Removing safesearch and re-naming the fp.sys file did not work.</p>
<p>I ended up deleting all the fp.sys files in the old windows file and hey presto all is now updated.</p>
<p>These files are still in the recycle bin to make sure everything works with out them before permanently deleting.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for all your help and assistance.</p>
