<h2>            Error 801540B7 cannot re-download profile</h2>
                    
<p>Today while playing Forza Motorsport 4, as an online race ended (with 2 friends) my xbox live connection dropped and so I attempted to log back on. I got an error message referring me to support or to attempt to re-download my profile. Followed all of the
 troubleshooting on the xbox website and still nothing. I contacted the web support and Destinee ran me through a number of attempts to fix this, including deleting my profile (but leaving saved data). Attempting to re-download the profile has failed every
 time. It gives the error code 801540B7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have another xbox live account on my system and it connects just fine.</p>

<p>I really don't want to lose any data associated with the problem profile. Please help!</p>

<p>I just spoke to a Xbox Support Representative. Here's the details:</p>
<p>"Ok that code I did end up finding in my big book for 5000 here. It looks like a server maintenance error. This code has actually not once popped up until today for xbox live users. So this is something on our end, not yours, you would simply have to wait
 until the servers are fixed which should be before morning tomorrow or late tonight."</p>
<p>So it looks like this is just &nbsp;a temporary server error that will be cleared up by tomorrow.</p>

<h2>            XBox One Green Screen &#40;of death&#41;,</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone and Anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can anybody help/advise on Xbox one issue, the Green Screen (of death), to which I have been on you-tube and followed the various instructions on fixing the problem!!, I have reset to factory settings and still the Xbox has Green (screen)….. only,
 the problem is its not just the initial booting up screen, its the home screen and even as a game is loaded the whole screen is distorted in colour (that being predominately green with other colours not vibrant). would there have been a obvious cause that
 may have happened or is the Xbox Kaput? meaning unfixable.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help if there is any. &nbsp;</p>

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; If this is happening throughout the use of the console it could be a graphics card issue that needs to be repaired.&nbsp; You can set the repair up at

<p>Hi ATOMDisco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. Sorry to hear you're stuck on the green loading screen. That's never fun, but no worries! What we recommend is that you use our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One System Update Solution</a> to troubleshoot the issue. It not unusual for the green loading screen to remain on the screen if something has happened during a recent update and this should get you back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and please let us know the results!</p>
<p>I hope this helps out!</p>

<h2>            Canary Error</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the canary error message pop up for the last two days. When I press A to play in the menu screen it says I have no connection, but when I go to test my connection it says its working just fine. I have tried everything on the forum websites. I
 am also connected DIRECTLY. I was just trying to find out when this problem was going to be fixed.</p>

<p>I was playing Destiny all morning yesterday, packed up my console and went to work. Around 1:30pm i tried jumping back online, but i was receiving the "Canary" error on Destiny. I then tried to join my buddies party chat, received another error from Microsoft
 "Sorry, you cant join now. The game could be full, party chat could be full, privacy settings might prevent your joining, or there could be a connection problem. (0x87c40011)" Spent the day at work googling what was going on, since i dont have access to the
 modem at work to reset i assumed it was just that problem. When i got home last night i hooked up the console and unfortunately had the same problems. My xbox 360 is working just fine, party chat and online gaming. So I contacted xbox support via chat, she
 had me hard reset my console. She then had me reset my internet, but that didnt fix it either. We lost connection through chat due to the internet reset, we emailed back and forth a few times but she didnt offer any other advice. Before i realized it was almost
 midnight and i had to head to bed. This morning im still having the same issues, NONE of my games will open that have to connect to any type of server...FIFA 14, Madden 25, Diablo 3, Destiny, Warframe, NHL 15...some of them stop me at the tital screen with
 an error like Destiny. Others can not "sync" my game save information and give me the option to play in "offline" mode. So i call support this time thinking maybe they can help me out, they have me go through the same steps with no results. She tells me to
 call my ISP to have them open these ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;UDP Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;UDP Port 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>Im just now about to call but i can not believe that my Xbox One is connected to Live, i can send and receive messages, i can stream video from netflix, hulu, and amazon, but i cant join or send party chats or play any games. This is my first bad experience
 with Microsoft in 8 years. Im befuddled to say the least.</p>

<p>K so I got this error message yesterday a few hours after this post and I called microsoft about the code and they said that I had a corrupted file in my xbox and I would need a replacement. I was not able to install anything and my multiplayer connection
 was not working. My internet connection was working. Good news I have a warranty from the store in which I bought it and I will be receiving a new xbox one in 2 days. Sucks though I wanted to play Destiny. Oh well. Brand new Xbox one</p>

<h2>            Windows on task bar shifted from left to right side.</h2>
                    
<p>On the task bar, while I'm on the page, it usually shows up on the left hand side and it's the normal rectangular size. Now it's somehow shifted to the right hand side on the task bar and is scrunched up like a tiny square. It will also only show two window
 pages that I'm on even though I'm actually on more than one. What did I do, and how can I change it back because it is insanely annoying.&nbsp;HELP ME PLEASE!!!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right Click the TaskBar - Unlock <br />
<br />
Now on middle left or so (to right&nbsp;of the&nbsp;QuickLaunch area)&nbsp;you will see what looks like little rivets on the Taskbar -
<br />
grab that with left mouse and move it more to the left.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Why does a Window&#39;s 8 Volume show up TWICE on the opening Screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 on my Boot Drive, now when it boots up and displays the Volumes you want to boot Window's from, it shows the same Volume twice,.&nbsp; I just want to know why, and how I can delete the extra volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I ran Window's REFRESH to try to fix it and it didn't fix it.&nbsp; Now that it's been a few days, and I have installed a few programs, I am not going to REFRESH again (that clears out everything!).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Do I have to live with this - two identical volumes showing up on the opening screen?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Whoa!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would I want to RESET and wipe out all my SETTINGS, and all the PROGRAMS, and all the APPS that installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does not make sense, does it?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Double Volume appeared the first time I installed Windows on my Desktop.&nbsp; What's to stop it from appearing twice, or three times, if I reinstall Windows again from scratch?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think I'm doing a RESET - I'm not losing all my hard work; the work I did to install all those programs, apps, and drivers. NO WAY!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has to be an easier process, don'tcha thunk?</p>

            Hi ADT15299, 
<br />
<br />What Edition of Windows 10 is installed on your System?
<br />
<br />If it is Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise, I would contact that company since they may have installed a volume licence on your system and used a KMS Activator . . .
<br />
<br />To find out which Edition you are running, go to Settings - System - About

<br />
<br />Whoever installed it, might have installed a volume license (organization key) on your computer. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise volume license clients are used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Sometimes, users will copy these organization keys off the Internet and use them to install Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise, but they are blocked from activating because it can't reach appropriate KMS host (Server computer) which handles the activation request.  
<br />
<br />You would need to purchase a genuine license for Windows 10 Pro from the Microsoft Store. If you can't afford Pro, you can purchase Home, make a bootable copy then perform a custom install.

    <title>Skype no logner shows notifications or plays notification sounds on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrfunreal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype no logner shows notifications or plays notification sounds on win10 and android.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since quite a while now Skype refuses to play notification sounds or shows notification popups for me on win10 and my android phone.</p>
<p>Usually it had given me a big grey notification box with the new sound, but now it quietly adds a tiny "1" to the taskbar icon, which i have only seen pop up when i minimize skype right before i get a message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not acceptable. First you change skype to the point that everyone shows as offline every five minutes, changed the entire layout and now the notifications are gone. How the hell did you think pushing such an unfinished version is an acceptable idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you tell me "go to the windows setting and enable notifications", and "make sure skype has them enabled". They are enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are enabled on Win10 AND my phone but neither shows notifications or sounds. The phone also doesn't vibrate when set to mute like it usually did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why, how could you do this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have ruined skype to the point where the downsides are bigger than the things it offers. The things it offers being things that other simmilar programs also offer.</p>
<p />

            <p>Bring up Cortana (the icon next to Start menu), and type "internet explorer".&nbsp; You should now see the IE11 desktop app.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of&nbsp;now there&nbsp;are no updates with regards to plugins in Edge, but if you are having this issue while using I.E follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)Click on the&nbsp;Internet Explorer executable located at: C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe
</p>
<p>2)Right-click that &amp; select run as administrator.</p>
<p>3)You'll get the same warning, but it will allow you to enable the plug-in.</p>
<p>4)Close that instance of Internet Explorer and open your own - you will see that the plug-ins are still listed as "incompatible".</p>
<p>5)but it no longer shows the prompt every time&nbsp;you open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p>Reply us back for further assistance.</p>
<p>We are glad to help you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Is this&nbsp;the&nbsp;only user account that you have or is their any other user account set as Administrator?</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm, there is one <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and other&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>. Make sure you&nbsp;verify carefully&nbsp;that you are able to&nbsp;open
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>&nbsp;without providing a password in the UAC and just click
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then first make your user account an Administrator. To&nbsp;do so, follow the steps below.
</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows </strong>key <strong>+ X</strong> and click on <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Change <strong>View by</strong> from <strong>Category</strong> to <strong>Large icon/ Small icon</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>User Account</strong> and&nbsp;click on <strong>Change&nbsp;your account type</strong>.
</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>Administrator </strong>and select <strong>Change Account type</strong>. When the UAC prompt appears press
<strong>Enter</strong> without typing the password. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create another account and keep it as Standard, but make sure you always keep an administrator account. Once you have changed&nbsp;your account to Administrator, try the steps I have mentioned in the&nbsp;reply on August 1, 2016 and check if the issue persists.
</p>

Here is a forum game for call of duty: Black ops. I hope to have the game either this friday or next friday depending on immidiate turn out.<br />
Anyways it is split into left and right, this being either your hand you write with or political choice if you want to be abit more geeky.<br />
If it becomes popular like previous forum games there may be awards for MVPS and so forth, but it is still early days.<br />

<h2>            Plantronics Rig Microphone not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi I recently purchased a Plantronics rig 400pro head set, when i plug it into the controller i the mic didn't work i took it back and the shop replaced it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new headset has the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i plug the headset in the mute button disappears and the head set icon appears, when i go to the party menu a warning appears that no microphone can be found but this quickly disappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating my controllers and have tried 2 different xboxes and 2 different xbox accounts and still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on what it may be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>I've never seen anything like this before.</p>
<p>Did you check if it was on the disc before you put it in the drive? put another disc in and see if that loads. (not a game as if it's a hardware problem you don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>Have you leant the game out to anybody or does anybody else have access to it?</p>
<p>The only two ways I can see to try and get this to work is to</p>
<p>i - try to see if you can clean the disk as best you can and try again (obvious I know)</p>
<p>ii - see if your console will let you load the game to the HDD and see if that is any help</p>
<p>hope this works for you.</p>

<p>This can happen when the surfaces of the DVD start to separate from each other usually caused by bending which occurs when removing discs from the case. Depending on where on the disc it happens can determine the usefulness of the disc afterwards.</p>
<p>It could also be disc rot, there are multiple stories online about this occurrence (not Microsoft or games related) such as this one -
<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4908081/ns/technology_and_science-games/t/when-optical-discs-go-bad/#.Ug1lNZLVB8E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nbcnews.com/.../when-optical-discs-go-bad</a></p>
<p>As it is on the outer edge of the DVD it is likely the disc can not be repaired like scratches can.</p>

            have you even read the question?&nbsp; your answer is irrelevant.&nbsp; The OP is not complaining of software that doesn't work or won't install, but the lack of an option to sync the calendar app with a yahoo calendar account.<br />

            unfortunately this is not possible at this time, this kind of feature is not included.&nbsp; A workaround would be to create an account with one of the services that are supported (hotmail/live/google), export your yahoo calendar, import it into one of those
 accounts, and then use the new account for syncing and managing your calendar.<br />

            <div>How to get your Yahoo Calendar to import into Windows 8 App</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will need to have a calendar set up in Yahoo and Windows 8 signed in to your Microsoft Account. For more information on setting up Microsoft Accounts, visit http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/microsoft-account-tutorial.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Share your Yahoo Calendar.</div>
<div>2. Log in to https://calendar.yahoo.com.</div>
<div>3 &nbsp;In the left-hand column under Calendars, you should find the name of your calendar (such as Benjamin's_Calendar).</div>
<div>4. Click on the gear symbol on the right to Manage Calendars.</div>
<div>5. Choose "Share..." from the options that appear.</div>
<div>6. In the "Share..." popup box, choose the calendar you want to share, and click "Continue."</div>
<div>7. Find the "Share with iCal Address" section and copy the web address. &nbsp;It will look something like http://calendar.yahoo.com/benjamin/f0c6f0bda6505b96872795d06902f/ycal.ics?id=150.</div>
<div>8. Click "Save."</div>
<div><br />
<div>9. Link your Yahoo Calendar to your Windows Live Calendar.</div>
<div>10. Login to https://calendar.live.com.</div>
<div>11. Along the top menu bar click the "Import" option.</div>
<div>12. In the lefthand menu bar, choose "Subscribe."</div>
<div>13. In "Calendar URL" paste the iCal link you copied from Yahoo in Step #7.</div>
<div>13. Give your calendar a name and select a color for your Yahoo events.</div>
<div>14. Click "Subscribe."</div>
<div>15. You should now see your events from Yahoo Calendar in Windows Live Calendar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>16. Open your Windows 8 Calendar app.&nbsp;</div>
<div>17. Press F5 to sync the app with your Windows Live account.</div>
<div>18. You should now see your Yahoo Calendar events in the Windows 8 Calendar app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Troubleshooting</div>
<div>19. If your Yahoo Calendar events from Windows Live don't appear, make sure Windows 8 is signed in to your Microsoft Account.</div>
<div>20. Using the Charms menu or Windows Key-I, open "Settings."</div>
<div>20. At the bottom of this menu, choose "Change PC Settings."</div>
<div>21. Choose "Accounts." &nbsp;You should see your user name and the e-mail address you used to sign up for your Microsoft Account.</div>
<div>22. If you are not signed in to your Microsoft Account, select "Sign in to your Microsoft Account" and complete the sign-in process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if this works for you, and if you have any changes to the above instructions.</div>

            Hello Ben.&nbsp; Thanks for this.&nbsp; I followed your instructions and it appeared to work except when I updated my Yahoo calendar the next day and then synced it with the Windows calendar the updates did not appear.&nbsp; I waited and tried again but the Windows message
 confirms the sync is up to date, yet the modifications were not there.&nbsp; It appears the data was imported but not continually subscribed.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            Hi Mark,
<div>I wasn't aware of this as it is the first time I've tried setting it up. &nbsp;This appears to be a universal problem caused on the back end of Windows Live when subscribing to 3rd party calendars. &nbsp;Sync time appears to be about 2 days; I don't see any solution
 to problem yet according to this thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/ocalendar-oaddtask/my-subscribed-calendars-are-not-refreshing-in/eb97f3d7-8427-4400-981d-33e93b147c44?page=1&amp;tm=1386649767652">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/ocalendar-oaddtask/my-subscribed-calendars-are-not-refreshing-in/eb97f3d7-8427-4400-981d-33e93b147c44?page=1&amp;tm=1386649767652</a>.
 &nbsp;Based on that thread, Microsoft support engineers don't really seem to understand the issue, and haven't offered any workable solutions. &nbsp;This is something Microsoft will have to fix on the software side. &nbsp;I guess you could send feedback at feedback.live.com,
 but I am not very optimistic they will fix it soon.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bummed out,</div>

            Hi Ben.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I shut down my computer last night and when I switched it on this morning the Windows Calendar was up to date.&nbsp; It seems to be synced somewhat randomly, although it does work.&nbsp; I suppose we'll have to let Microsoft resolve
 this with an update at some point.&nbsp; Bye for now,

</p><p>It has NOTHING to do with having a payment linked to your account.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am having the same issue; we are XBOX Live Gold members, and we are unable to download our free games every month because there is some error and/or service alert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot get our free games for XBOX 360 OR for XBOX ONE because we cannot "confirm purchase" online, even logged in, and we cannot download the games through online browsers because it is deemed, "an unacceptable device".</p>
<p>

<p>For that issue you would need to migrate your account region.&nbsp;<a href="http://live.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://live.xbox.com/accountmigration</a></p>

    <title>Black screen after HP January 16, 2019 BIOS update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandjm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after HP January 16, 2019 BIOS update</h2>
                    <p>Our HP Pavilion x360 laptop computer went completely black after a BIOS update related to the HP Battery Recall Program.&nbsp; The update came through the HP Assistant software that came installed on the computer. The date of the update was shown as January 16,
 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying all the HP fixes listed on their support site, absolutely nothing worked...no key combination, no rolling back the BIOS, no attempting to install from a USB, etc.&nbsp; Our computer was "bricked" as they say. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We later found out that our battery was not even part of the recall, and should not have been sent the BIOS update, but it was too late. We were told it was a "landmark" case. Not sure what that means, but...…????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any information, or way, or any thoughts on a way to get our computer back up and running?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input/advice/ideas etc. are seriously appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:&nbsp;<span>We have also posted a question related to this in "license and activation" category if anyone has any more info for that.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!!!!!!</p>

<br />Sorry for inconvenience this has caused you. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the BIOS update is what is causing the system to not boot into Windows 10, then this would be an issue outside of Windows. This means, your best option would be to send in the laptop to a service center so they can investigate the problem and either replace the board or laptop.

<p>Thank you Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're "sort of" in that process, but having trouble getting a "real" fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sorry to put that question up here.&nbsp; Didn't think about it being a "non-windows" issue, but totally understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely appreciate your input. Thanks again.&nbsp; :)<br />

<h3> dtheo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow speed with Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230</h2>
                    <p>My computer will not register download speeds much faster than 12Mbps over wireless even though I have a 50mbps connection which is confirmed with an ethernet connection.</p>
<p>Is that the max speed of my Wifi device-&nbsp;Intel Centrino Wireless-N 2230?</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the Wifi connection to 50mbps?</p>
<p>

            Hi dtheo,<br /><br />Have you reset your modem/router yet? If not, let’s do that. And do you have another pc, or smart device? I’d love to check the speed on that as well. This would tell us whether it’s the network, or the PC. <br /><br />Also,  What’s the make and model of your PC? Click start, and type “system” and open system information. Next to system model you should see the model we need. <br /><br />Maybe there is an updated driver we can install for you model. <br /><br />Let me know!<br />- C

<p>It is not the network as I stated in original post - I can get full speed on ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Router was reset ,etc. </p>
<p>It is a wireless problem with this PC only. Mac wireless tests just as fast as ethernet too.</p>
<p>It is a Lenovo 20253&nbsp; (ideaPad P500 touch)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked for new drivers and it says I have the latest. I went to Intel and they no longer support this wireless device so that was a dead end.</p>

<p>No, troubleshooter did not find any problems.</p>
<p>It works as in it connects, but the speed is not maximum</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2017 screen burn&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark lnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 screen burn&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I notice on various Forums that the new SP 2017 has a universal issue with screen burn.</p>
<p>I have just received my second unit and this one also has the burn on the bottom edge - though not quite as pronounced as the first, but nevertheless really noticeable - and it is something I did not expect from such a high-profile device. Never had this
 issue with my previous Surface devices, and I am not alone in stating this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't wish to replace it again and have the same issue - these things take valuable time to set-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question: What is Microsoft doing; going to do about this?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If we had some definitive comment from MS i.e. recall &amp; replace when they sort their manufacturing rather than just being silent or stating that some screen burn is acceptable - which I accept, but not to this extent! - then we would have a clear road-map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just not fair on the loyal customers that wish to promote &amp; support MS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send this unit back and get a refund - but this just defeats the whole purpose and user experience of investing your hard-earned cash in a desirable device.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Thanks for getting back</p>
<p>I am in UK and ordered it from online MS Store</p>
<p><span>I know what my options are - exchange again or refund.</span></p>
<p>I have arranged to get a refund, but this is really not acceptable as I wanted ownership of the new Surface Pro. I could opt for a second exchange, however, the forums show that this issue is universal, therefore the likelihood of getting another unit with
 the same issue is very high, which just adds to the frustration and unacceptable user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not good...</p>
