    <title>Windows 10 Screen Resolution for Netbooks - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Screen Resolution for Netbooks</h2>
                    <p>On Windows XP it was possible to set a resolution of 1024x768 on a netbook with a maximum resolution of 1024x600.&nbsp; It was necessary to scroll up and down to access the extra vertical image (beyond 1024x600)&nbsp;but this permitted use of applications that required
 1024x768.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Windows 7 I understand that there was a work around, using 'downscaling' but the image aspect ratio was not respected, and was squashed/stretched.&nbsp; That was not much use to imaging applications needed an accurate rendition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Windows 10 restored the capability of XP, as described above?</p>

</p><p>To assist you better, I would like to ask some questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of your device?</p>
<p>2. What is the maximum screen resolution supported by&nbsp;your&nbsp;device?</p>
<p>3. Are you&nbsp;referring to set background image for your desktop?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Netbook is a Lenovo S10-2</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The normal resolution is 1024x600 but under Windows XP it can be driven at 1024x768 with part of the application window only accessible by vertical scrolling up or down, but not distorted in either dimension.&nbsp; Not sure if the built-in screen&nbsp;can be driven
 at resolutions greater than that.&nbsp; It can certainly drive greater resolutions when attached to an external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No, I'm not talking about a desktop image, I'm referring to use within applications&nbsp;which have&nbsp;a minimum resolution of 1024x768.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your reply and&nbsp;providing the requested information. We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, I would like to ask if your system came with Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform&nbsp;that from Windows 8 and above the minimum screen resolution&nbsp;that can be set is 1024*768.&nbsp;If your Graphic card can support&nbsp;lower resolution then yes, you can set the resolution to 1024*600. Also, I would like to inform that&nbsp;we can use
 downscaling in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to send a&nbsp;screen shot of the screen resolution available in your computer by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In the Search box type Control Panel and press Enter.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;In the top right corner, click on View by and select Large Icons.</p>
<p>3. Click on Display.</p>
<p>4. In the left navigation pane, click on Adjust Resolution.</p>
<p>5. In the Right pane, click&nbsp;on the drop down list for Resolution and&nbsp;send a screen shot of the particular screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that, </p>
<p>
</p><p>At home we have two of these computers.&nbsp; One runs on the Windows XP SP3, the other on Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will get you that information however on the Windows XP machine I am fairly certain that the maximum physical resolution of the fitted screen is 1024x600.&nbsp; It can run a virtual 1024x768, and perhaps more - but with scrolling required and it will drive
 larger external screens.&nbsp; From reading multiple websites I have not found any that suggest an easy method of setting 1310x768 which would be the resolution needed to retain to&nbsp;meet the minimum 1024x768 while respecting the&nbsp;aspect ratio (128:75)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-specifications</p>
<p>says that the minimum screen requirement is 800x600, not 1024x768. Can you confirm that 1024x600 would work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downscaling, as I originally explained, is not an acceptable solution to me and many others as the&nbsp;image is distorted i.e. stretched&nbsp;by that process.&nbsp; What is needed is the capability that was in Windows XP to extend the desktop vertically on small physical
 screens - now more, rather than less, common.&nbsp; It was a retrograde step not to include that option in Win 7/Win8/Win8.1 which should have been rectified for Win10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The computer running under Windows 7 only offers 800x600 or 1024x600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one running under XP offers a much larger list, see image. As with 1024x768 the desktop larger than 1024x600 is accessed by scrolling. &nbsp;It is not distorted/stretched.</p>

            Unbeknownst to me, there was a dialogue box open behind all other windows.
<div><br />
<div>It was&nbsp;Boxcryptor, asking if I wanted to encrypt the folders I was copying into Drive. &nbsp;I pressed Yes, but the copy process was taking a long time, and slowing down my PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I exited out of Boxcryptor (turned it off), and copied the folders again, and did not receive the original error message.</div>

            Hi cbm10121, Microsoft Support are hard to contact sometimes . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to contact Live Support - I warn you the wait is currently 56 minutes on the phone and 2 minutes on chat support.
<br />
<br />Hopefully, chat support can give you a case number you can use on NewEgg, otherwise phone support can do that . . .
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />One thing, the computer system you purchased on NewEgg - was it new or used. If it was used, is there a product key on the casing for Windows 7 or Windows 8?       
        </p>

            Try this to see if it reveals a key:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt phone activation:

<h2>            AMD AHCI raid controller and sata drivers not loading</h2>
                    I have gotten a beta install disk for windows 7 64 bit and I am coming up with driver issues from my AMD AHCI raid controller this seems to be a common problem in your forms is this just a beta issue or is this a Windows 7 issue and either way is there
 any plans to handle this problem. This is what most of my friends want there systems to be ( A sata raid drive system) for gaming purposes and "sata" seem to be a problem too and that is what the new solid state drives are it would be nice to know this is
 not going to be a issue, it looks like a nice OS but I wont purchase something that doesnt work.&nbsp;
<br />
And current drivers off gigabytes site for win 7 are not accepted of recognized for ga-ma790fx-ds5 the only one it did recognize was 64 bit xp drivers and even those it would not load

            More than a beta problem, the failure of the device maker to create working drivers is a device maker choice. Win seven has controllers available that carry the "Win 7 Logo". Those that don't are going to force the device owners to avoid installing 7,
 if Raid is what they want.

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
This seems to be a Java issue. You may also delete the&nbsp;files, they are just temp files.&nbsp;I would suggest you to try to uninstall and re-install Java to get rid of this issue. Try the steps provided in the following Java articles provided.</div>

<h2>            Computer crashes whenever I put on &#34;fullscreen games&#34;</h2>
                    I know this seems immature, but I love to play games on my Windows Vista. I've had this computer for about 3 years, and rarely have problems with it, at first I thought it was the screen but whenever I want to play a full-screen game such as the sims 3
 ( ^.^ ) It just crashes... It's really&nbsp;irritating&nbsp;and I need help! :'( Thanks -Rachael

</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to specific game or all games?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you reduce the Hardware acceleration on the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>For Windows vista and Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p>

<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Advanced Settings</b>, click the <b>Troubleshoot</b> tab, and then click <b>Change settings</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Move the
<b>Hardware acceleration </b>slider toward <b>None</b> to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you update the graphics card drivers on the computer by visiting the graphic
 card manufacturer to download and install the latest driver update, check if this helps.</span></p>

<h3> bleyedcasi  say:</h3>
<h2>            No hard drive installed&#63; Yet it boots in safe mode.</h2>
                    I have read through a few of the forums but none seem to hit my specific issue. As I try to boot up my computer it tells me there is no hard drive installed. Yet it loads clear to the welcome screen. If I enter my password it will show the arrow from the
 mouse and for a few secs the blue logo as it is attempting to load. It then just enters into a "sleep mode". I cant do anything but manully power down. I can load it just fine into safe mode with networking. I have done a restore which it told me was succesful
 but has not changed anything. I have done a disk scan and it told me everything was fine. But it wont perform the disk utlility check it says there is no disk. How can it be there but not be there? ....lol&nbsp; Through safe mode I can access my c drive, it says
 it is enabled and working properly. Please help, I am so confused as to what is going on. Thank you. (I do not have the cd's).

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your Computer to
 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<h2>            HP Laserjet 2200 </h2>
                    My HP Laserjet 2200 will not run under vista using my laptop even though I purchased a USB cable. The cable it compatable with Vista and the instructions that came with say to simply plug the printer in and turn the computer on and Vista will automatically
 recognize the adapater and install the necessary drivers. It does that but the printer does not print.

<h2>            Windows 10 built in application problems</h2>
                    <p>So I just installed Windows 10 a few hours ago...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After playing around with it's cool features I've ran into a problem. I've noticed some applications that came with Windows 10 are not functioning as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Store' closes when ever I click on an application. It does a load for about half a second on this page:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d9bcbc0-1bf3-42b1-8659-3bd1ebda8903" /></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">'Store' Has lost it's thumbnail.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f19c8087-faf0-483f-9c4a-59b6942b9d88" /></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Photos no longer have thumbnails (probably a problem with the 'Photos' application.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ded1e58-4631-435d-8536-bec289573b56" /></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">All applications that came with Windows 10 no longer have an icon on the task bar. This includes things like 'settings', 'store', 'people' and 'xbox'. It's not only these applications though; it's with everything app related to Microsoft.
 Edit: I've just found out it&nbsp; does it on "messenger" as well (which is not a Microsoft program, so now I'm confused)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83f303a6-feeb-437b-a3a1-f301f0251c3a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">The only settings that I have changed on my PC so far is

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/834b5b2d-02f5-4c06-a9ec-8257da6e5eb1" /></p>
<p>I also changed my location to United States so I could use Cortana. Could this have caused any problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I can get this sorted out ASAP, as it's really bugging me. Thanks in advance :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 not booting. Startup Repair not able to fix issue. Fixboot not working.</h2>
                    Hi MS community,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, the boot sector on my primary hard drive has become unusable. I don't know why, as I was not doing anything strange or unusual before it happened.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It started up in repair mode automatically, and I let it go through the auto-repair process. It ended with "Windows could not automatically repair..."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I booted from my Win7 CD, went into repair mode and did bootrec /fixmbr, then bootrec /fixboot.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I rebooted my system, and it again went into automatic repair mode, and was again unable to repair. I rebooted again, while tapping F8 and turned off automatic reboot on system failure.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That's when I saw the blue screen with a Stop 0x7B.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Safe mode is a no as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a screenshot of the BSD:</div>

            Hi Vijay,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried Method 1, and it failed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2 also failed, and there were no restore points found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will perform Method 3 later today, but is this the same as the following:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I disconnected my hard drive, and attached it to an external enclosure (USB) and connected it to another Windows 7 machine. From there I ran the disk checking utility and it found no errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a weird thing: I was hoping to be able to pull my images/music from the drive to back them up, but when I browse the file system I cannot see the c:\Windows folder or any of the user sub-folders. (Yes, show hidden items is on.) Have you ever seen
 this happen?</div>

            Hi Megacles,<br />
<br />
Do you have any external devices connected to the computer?<br />
<br />
When a USB flash drive is inserted in a computer, the computer hardware sometimes reports that the USB flash drive is the system partition. The Startup Repair tool examines the USB flash drive instead of the actual system partition on the hard disk. Because
 Startup Repair cannot locate the corrupted MBR, it does not detect a problem.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista or Windows 7 no longer starts, and the Startup Repair tool does not fix the problem<br />

            Hi Vijay,
<div><br />
<div>There are no other devices plugged into the computer. I ran the chkdisk as you suggested, but it found no bad sectors and there wasn't anything to repair.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here's something strange, the startup recovery error says&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows directory: c:\found.000\dir0443.chk</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Maybe that explains why I cannot see a c:\windows folder when I do a dir.</div>

<br />
The only option we have at the end is to perform inplace upgrade. I would suggest you to follow the steps from the link to perform inplace upgrade.<br />
<br />

</p>
<b>Note:&nbsp; </b><span>Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer. Make sure you backup all the data before you perform inplace upgrade.<br />

Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            How can the &#34;Invisible&#34; Folders, e.g. &#34;System Volume Information&#34;, or &#34;Content.IE5&#34;, be viewed&#63;</h2>
                    I have gone into <span style="font-weight: bold">Folder Options</span> and set "Show Hidden Files and Folders", and cleared "Hide protected operating system files" (and confirmed, in the pop-up. the potential danger in modifying files of this type). The
 problem is, all the questionable scripts and programs see to have no problem modifying the files that are in these folders, or using them as a repository for their own excrement.<br />
<br />
I suspect, because even the unsophisticated malware infections can by-pass this "protection", it is not a real access block in NTFS.&nbsp; It is just a arbitrary thing to keep out the "user", who admittedly does not always exhibit the best judgement. (They did purchase,
 and place important information on a system designed to be as open to "hacking" as Windows.)<br />
<br />
Will Off-Line utilities, as in Recovery, be able to view them?<br />

            The System Volume Information folder is where System Restore points are stored.&nbsp; Generally, you can clear it by turning off your System Restore function, rebooting, then turning it back on again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ( Right-click "My Computer" -&gt; Properties -&gt; "System Restore" tab.)<br />
<br />
If you absolutely <span style="font-style: italic">must&nbsp; </span>look in there, refer to the following KB article:<br />

            Hi Nightware21
<br />
<br />It sounds like your Photos app has developed a memory leak, try resetting that App
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Apps and find the Photos App
<br />
<br />Click that and choose 'Advanced Options'
<br />
<br />Then click Reset
<br />
<br />Check to see if this behavior has been resolved . ..

<p>Original&nbsp;Title: Problem: Guest account does not work even after enabling due to profile issues.</p>
<p>After enabling the Guest account on this system, attempts to log in under this account fail with the "user profile cannot be loaded" message. Based on information I found online about this error, I checked HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList
 to see if a key existed for Guest (it doesn't). I also checked the Windows application log and found the following entries:</p>

<p>The C:\Users\TEMP path does not exist, and the specified sqm file has no deny entries in its ACL, just full control for SYSTEM, LOCAL SERVICE, my admin account, and the Administrators group.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This concern could have occurred due to corrupt Windows Update Components.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to narrow it down and provide you the proper resolution, m<span>ay we ask if you made any recent changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span><br />
<span>Have you tried any possible troubleshooting steps? If yes, what are those steps? This is to avoid repeating of the possible steps done.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If Windows 10 fails to update, we recommend you<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset Windows Update components</a><span>. Resetting
 the Windows Update component wipes the slate clean and should cause Windows to begin the update process again. It will check what updates it has, what updates it needs and download and install as needed.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you require any further information, let us know.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Regards.</span></p>

<p>Hi there in Vietnam<br />
I had the same error, which kept this Win update failing to install around fifty times<br />
&nbsp;We couldnt complete updates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Undoing changes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dont turn off your computer<br />
My solution was sfc /sannow, ( write cmd, right click, run as administrator and write sfc /sannow)which found a data base error and claimed the problem became fixed.<br />
It however was followed by an unsuccessful update again next evening.<br />
In the morning I ran two trouble shootings on update errors. <br />
They claimed Windows Update error detected not fixed, check for pending updates not fixed<br />
The second one Potential Windows Database error detected not fixed.<br />
I switched off my PC , because the problem did not seem to become solved.<br />
Next morning however update settings claimed my PC software was up to date with a green v sign<br />
and it has been doing the same ever since.<br />
I sincerely do not know, whom to trust, because Win 10 tried to install fifty times this update, but also claimed it was successfully installed 4-5 times already.<br />
I dont know, if this works in your case.<br />
<br />

<h3> razich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home Printer Driver Installation Error Module Not Found</h2>
                    <p>A locally connected version 3 printer driver is found to be getting failed during installation in 64 bit Windows 10 Home version. The error being displayed near the end of installation states:
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><em>Operation could not be completed (error 0x0000007e).</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong><em>The specified module could not be found.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not matter whether the printer driver is installed through add printer wizard of Windows or through the driver installation package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same driver version was found to be working fine in 64 bit Windows 10 Professional version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance or help in this regard is valued at this end and highly appreciated.</p>

I was trying to type a command into the command prompt box, so I though I'd save time by using "Copy/Paste", however this wouldn't work! Why?

            <p>Hey, I suss'd it, If I "Copy" something to the clipboard, it stays there and can be "Pasted" into various places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I go to the Command Prompt Box, and first "left Click" to mark my place, then the clipboard is wiped out. so nothing is left to paste!! But, If I don't do the "left Click" first, just do a "Right Click" the contents of the clipboard are still
 there and get pasted!! </p>

<h2>            play slide show on TV</h2>
                    <p>I need to play a slide show for a reception in my home. I can put the slide show on a laptop but I am wondering if there is any way I can connect the laptop to a large TV and have the slide show viewed on the TV?</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

            <p>I got no replies, and I suppose I should not have posted this question on this site. Maybe it isn't really something the group deals with. So I apologize. But I eventually figured it out, so I will post the reply to my own question:</p>
<p>First of all, my laptop did not have an HDMI outlet, so I had to get a VGA to HDMI converter.&nbsp; And, of course, an HDMI cable.</p>
<p>You may have a more modern laptop with an HDMI port, so,if that is the case, all you would need is the HDMI cable.</p>
<p>In my situation, I started by connecting the HDMI+VGA connector to the laptop VGA port, and the other end&nbsp; to the TV, making note of the particular HDMI input number you are using (it was input 4 on my TV). My VGA to HDMI converter also came with a USB connector,
 which I connected to a USB port, but I am not sure it was necessary. Didn't hurt to connect it.</p>
<p>You may or may not see the laptop desktop on the TV now.</p>
<p>Now you have to "extend" the display on your laptop. Right click on desktop, choose screen resolution, identify the screens and choose to extend the display.</p>
<p>Now I had to change the resolution on my laptop to a lower than the recommended setting for the laptop. I have forgotten the exact resolution but it was a setting or two below the highest one.&nbsp; After resetting the resolution on the laptop, that was the first
 time I actually saw what was on the laptop screen projected onto the TV.</p>
<p>I didn't get any sound, but I didn't need it.</p>
<p>One last point, which probably just reinforces my lack of experience.</p>
<p>I wanted to do my slide show from powerpoint. Powerpoint 2010 did not like the photograph images I created. They were apparently too large. I had to resize them down to about 280 kb. I had 130 images, so that would have been an enormous job, except that
 I downloaded Irfanview, and there is a batch converter within that program. There are directions on the internet about how to do it. The only slightly tricky part is the "advanced" tab to fill out before starting the batch. I will try to attach an image of
 that screen.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e058145e-bd70-48b4-a28c-d970bc5c5ec8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e058145e-bd70-48b4-a28c-d970bc5c5ec8" /></a></p>
<p>Also one more mistake I made with my powerpoint slide show was to confuse timing the slides with "rehearse timings". Rehearse timings does not set the timing for the slides. You do that under "transitions"</p>
