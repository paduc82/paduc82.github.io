<h2>            Has Microsoft done anything to get more business apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is the anything Microsoft can do to pressure such businesses as Bank of America to put apps on the Windows phones and on Windows 10 in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like my Windows phones and tablets but there are many basic business that should be on the system.&nbsp; I firmly believe that there will be no growth in the market share unless some thing is done to remedy this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't written a program in years but creating an app for Windows cant be that complex if you have created one for IOS and Android.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the project to load several Android apps and they were very helpful, but that seems to have been abandoned with no explanation.&nbsp; It almost seems as though top people at MS want the phones to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very sad for those who have supported them.</p>

<h2>            Win 14295.r1 160318-1628  Windows Feedback Hub Blocked by Organization</h2>
                    <p>This is most annoying.&nbsp; I am starting this thread because my comment on another's thread from last year seems to be buried.<br />
<br />
Win 14295.r1 160318-1628&nbsp; installed automatically.&nbsp; Since then, the Feedback Hub is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Feedback is blocked.&nbsp; Your diagnostics and usage data setting is managed by your organization and currently doesn't allow feedback.&nbsp; For more info, contact your administrator."</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Settings | Privacy | Feedback &amp; Diagnostics, "Windows Insider Program Manages this Option"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the Group Policy <em>Computer Configuration&gt;Administrative Templates&gt;Windows Components&gt;Data Collection and Preview Builds&gt; Allow Telemetry

<p>

Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Data Collection and&nbsp; Preview Builds &gt; Allow Telemetry<br />

    <title>&#40;Inbox&#41; rules don&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael star  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;Inbox&#41; rules don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>So, I've got these very simple inbox rules but they do not work properly. I still receive emails with these words in the subject, header or body on a daily basis and it's annoying as @#$% . Hotmail has been around for years and it's still as bad as it was
 in the beginning, despite all the fancy name and interface updates. I want proper functionality and don't care about new icons and pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">If the header of the message contains the words 'supermarkt' or 'beginsaldo' or 'Jonne' or 'sgt' or 'monica' or 'gefeliciteerd' or 'wietolie' or 'CBD' or 'LIDL' or 'ikea' or 'bol.com' or 'mediamarkt' or 'ongehuwd' or 'apotheek'
 or 'recept' or 'domain service', delete the message and stop processing more rules on this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">If the body of the message contains the words 'supermarkt' or 'beginsaldo' or 'Jonne' or 'sgt' or 'monica' or 'gefeliciteerd' or 'wietolie' or 'CBD' or 'LIDL' or 'ikea' or 'bol.com' or 'mediamarkt' or 'ongehuwd' or 'apotheek' or
 'recept' or 'domain service', delete the message and stop processing more rules on this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">If the message includes specific words in the subject or body 'supermarkt' or 'beginsaldo' or 'Jonne' or 'sgt' or 'monica' or 'gefeliciteerd' or 'wietolie' or 'CBD' or 'LIDL' or 'IKEA' or 'bol.com' or 'mediamarkt' or 'ongehuwd'
 or 'apotheek' or 'recept' or 'Domain Service', delete the message and stop processing more rules on this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since there is no good answer anywhere about this basic functionality, I want to know the following:</p>
<p><strong>Why don't these rules work as intended and how do I fix it?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>99.9% of all these spam emails are sent with mailwizz from **** domains, hiding anonymously behind their registrars who never respond or comply with any regulation. I even receive emails which are so called sent by my own email address (@live.nl) - which
 should easily be detected by the M$ mailserver to be false through DKIM or SPF checks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the reason could be that there's a &lt; TBODY &gt; in the DOM in which the trigger words appear, rather than in the regular BODY of the email. A better solution would be to trigger on any occurrence of a word in the source of the email, rather than
 the standard elements within the document.</p>

            Hi Michael, 
<br />
<br />Are the messages in the junk email folder? Rules run after junk email filtering - so any junk caught by the filter does not get processed by rules. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I wonder if the reason could be that there's a &lt; TBODY &gt; in the DOM in which the trigger words appear, rather than in the regular BODY of the email. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Possibly, but only if they are in the Inbox. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; 99.9% of all these spam emails are sent with mailwizz 
<br />If they are in the inbox and that word is in the header, i'd do one rule for words in the message header and use this as the word.       
        </p>

<p>Ok, so despite the "rules" not being called "inbox rules" anymore,&nbsp; they still only apply to the inbox? I want to get rid of these mails from the junk folder as well. I don't want to plough through the junk mails every day to check if there's anything that
 shouldn't be there and I also don't want to manually delete all the rubbish in there on a daily basis to prevent the folder from growing into a shitpile . The Rules I made should make it easy to move everything with the trigger words to deleted folder straight
 away. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the rules not working to delete junk, legit emails actually DO get deleted without my consent as well, despite none of the trigger words being in the header or body (or even source) of the message. I've marked hundreds of emails as phishing scam
 over time and the exact same emails still appear in the junk folder forever after that, so I really wonder why the @#$% I keep reporting them if nothing ever changes. These emails look the same, use the same text and the same layout and are only sent from
 new ridiculous domain-names or link to ridiculous url's as the main difference. It can't be that #&amp;*$@*#$# hard to filter and delete them automatically now, can it?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this day and age it's an absolute joke for a company like M$ to fail so hard on a spam filter. They add a function to decide for me what I should focus on, but can't add a simple word filter to check the source of a message for trigger words in order
 to delete a message. Seriously, what clowns program this crap?</p>

<br />Ok, so despite the "rules" not being called "inbox rules" anymore,  they still only apply to the inbox? 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Correct. 
<br />
<br />If you use the outlook desktop software, you can run rules manually on any folder, but Outlook on the web doesn't have this feature. 
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />legit emails actually DO get deleted without my consent as well, despite none of the trigger words being in the header or body
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />This is why there isn't a junk mail option to delete (instead of move to junk mail) &amp; they give you 30 days to recover junk mail before its automatically deleted.

<h2>            Contact Phone Number Labels - 2 Mobile Numbers&#63;</h2>
                    I have several contacts who have multiple mobile phone numbers. In Outlook for Mac 15.30 I can't see a way to label more than 1 phone number as a "Mobile". If I label the first phone number as "Mobile" I'm not able to also select "Mobile" for another phone
 number, and there's no "Mobile 2" option either. Is there a way to modify the phone number labels?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c29df08b-6008-476e-bd58-cacdb9f401e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c29df08b-6008-476e-bd58-cacdb9f401e0" /></a>

            That is how I do it (double-clicking). <br />
The Header &amp; Footer Tools tab also has an Close Header and Footer button on the far right. The double-clicking in the body method dates back to at least Word 2002.<br />

    <title>Activate Offline Installer Version of Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judy.ja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Offline Installer Version of Office</h2>
                    I work at a college and we have a prison program that has faculty going out to local prisons to teach the inmates. One of the students has a disability and needs to work from a laptop. However, the prison does not allow any internet access in the building.
 I created an offline installer which was used to install office 2016 Pro Plus. After several calls to Office support, I finally reached someone who gave me instructions on how to capture the Installation ID so I could provide to him and then he would give
 me the confirmation ID. However, I tried contacting the person back via email and have not received a response. I then tried calling the activation number and it says the ID is invalid but it's not. Classes are about to start soon so we really need to Office
 working for this student.

            Hello Judy,
<br />
<br />Thanks for choose the Microsoft Community Services.
<br />
<br />The offline mode to install office (click to run versions) gave the option to install office without a internet connection, however you must be connected to activate the product.
<br />
<br />What kind of product do you have Click to run or MSI?

            I am so sorry Judy, but that troubleshooting is to find and work the internal id that change each sign in to activate, The id is stored when activating and you need to be connected to internet in order to activate and create the is on first time.

            The word "Low" in C15 on the priority matrix tab, which was your cell validation criteria, had a trailing space so the match didn't work.
<br />Action_Issues!I5 gives a blank because 'Extreme' is not a valid impact from the impact/likelihood matrix.

<h2>            Office365 audit log search returns &#39;no data available&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Audit Logs are enabled and I have a global admin account yet no results are displayed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can obtain data on my account and other admin accounts (which proves the Audit Log is turned on) but when&nbsp;performing other searches, there is no data found. It seems the Audit Log does not work for&nbsp;every user account. How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be very grateful for any helpful ideas. </p>

<p>In MS Outlook itself, in the Folders tree view pane, do you have that (Charlie.pst) connected/showing? if so rt click&gt;close.</p>
<p>Its showing the same date because its open in MS Outlook, and any connected data file, is modified (by date) as soon as MS Outlook is opened.</p>
<p>I assume that you dont use the archive options, the size of that outlook1.pst will lead to performance degradation, and should you need to run the inbox repair tool against that pst you may find it taking a considerable length of time, and rendering the

<p>
</p><p>I renamed the file and it is no longer opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I did not have it open, so not sure how it was generated to begin with.</p>

</p><p>I do compress the folder periodically and annually remove/export a lot of my business folders/emails which generally gets it back to a more acceptable 2 GB. Haven't had to run scanpst in a couple years or more.</p>

<h2>            How to automatically jump to another cell after input data&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm entering data in column A (going down after pressing enter). So I filled A1, A2,A3, A4....A60. After pressing enter in A60, I want the cursor to position automatically itself in cell C1. It will continue jumping from one column to another after I enter
 60 values in per column (columns E, G, I). The simple fact is that I don't want to use the mouse or the arrows to position the cursor at the beginning of the next column that I need to fill. How can I achieve this using VBA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hola Vladimir</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try this method before go into VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Select rows from 1 to 60</p>
<p>2-Go to Format cell &gt; Protection and Unlock cells (uncheck)<br />
<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3 - Go to Review &gt; Protect Sheet &gt; Select unlocked cells only</p>
<p>Password is Optional<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/547fdce0-32bb-442d-bb76-c2b0073bbf99?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/547fdce0-32bb-442d-bb76-c2b0073bbf99?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This will lock all the cells above row 60 so when you reach that row from any column It will jump to the top of the next column (B1,C1,D1.....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.</p>

<p>Thank you. It works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now that you respond to me, I realize the following situation. The columns that I need to fill with this process start at row 18. Before that row there are some information that I need to fill too (so I can't lock the cells). After I fill this info
 is when I move to the columns where I initiate automatic process. For example, when I press enter in A60, the cursor goes the first row that is unlocked in column B (which is B6 but I put there another information not related to what the columns have) and
 I need the cursor to go specifically to B18.&nbsp; This file is going to be used by other people, so I can't give them the password to protect and unprotect the worksheet.</p>
<p>

<p>You must follow the same process from my post but this time select rows from 8 to 60.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the other cells with info above row 8. You can do the same by selecting them individually.</p>
<p>To move across unlocked cells press Tab or the arrow keys as well as the Enter key.</p>

<h2>            Error C1010009 when updating Zune HD 32 GB firmware</h2>
                    My Zune 32GB won't update to latest firmware, which the Zune software claims I have to in order to use with my computer.&nbsp; Never has been a problem in the past, however the Zune Software just updated a few days ago to version 4.8.2345.&nbsp; My Zune is currently
 at version 4.5 (109) and trying to update to 4.5 (114).&nbsp; The Zune shows up in Device Manager, and it says it is working properly.&nbsp; I uninstalled the driver and reinstalled (automatically) when I reconnected the Zune to the USB port.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?&nbsp; I have looked through the KB and outside of the driver issue, didn't see anything relevant.&nbsp; I am guessing it could be a software bug?. I was about to attempt uninstalling and reinstalling the Zune Software, but if I do, do I lose everything
 (playlists, ratings, etc)?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>One possible solution is to do a "RESET" of your Zune HD - </p>
Method 2: Erase the Zune HD and reinstall the device software
<p>If the steps in Method 1 do not resolve the problem, follow these steps.</p>
<p>You should be aware that when you follow these steps, the player’s software and all content that is stored on the player will be removed. This includes music, videos, pictures, podcasts, friends, apps, and audiobooks.</p>
<p>When it is possible, we recommend that you sync your Zune HD player with the Zune client software on your computer to back up any Zune Marketplace content before you continue.</p>
<p>For more information about how to back up your content, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>

<span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/952590/ ) </span>How to back up content that you purchased from the Zune Marketplace</div>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>On/Off</strong> button for about 10 seconds until the player restarts.
<div>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fXbox%2fzune_hd_onoff.jpg" /></p>
</li><li>Immediately press and hold both the <strong>Media</strong> button and the <strong>
Home</strong> button until <strong>CONNECT ZUNE TO YOUR PC</strong> is displayed on the screen.

</li><li>After <strong>CONNECT ZUNE TO YOUR PC</strong> is displayed, connect your Zune HD to the computer that has the current version of the Zune software, and then update your Zune HD to the current version of the device software.</li></ol>
<p>After you give your Zune HD player a name, and configure some other settings, you should be able to use the device again.</p>

            <blockquote><br />
Now I am very hesitant to factory reset my Zune based on my concern that I won't be able to get it to update at all.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- If you try to perform factory reset, and it failed, Zune HD device will recover by it's own.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><br />
So question: Can I revert the Zune software to an older version to try that first, as that seems to be the one difference I can identify?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
- Unfortunately, there is no option to do that. However, you still have an older zune package installer, you may try.<br />

    <title>Password Reset Not Working - External Network - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password Reset Not Working - External Network</h2>
                    <p>I am an admin for both an internal and external Yammer network. The external network has all of our internal network members on it, as well as many external-only members; it is used as a communications hub for our franchisees. Recently I have had many external-only
 users come to me with issues when trying to reset their password. When they click the "reset password" link and enter in their email, they either never receive the email, or they receive it and when they click to try and reset their password they are sent
 right back to the login page where they originally clicked the link to reset their password - it's a vicious, frustrating circle they are caught in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the same canned response to tens of dozens of people who have posted this exact same question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"If you are using Basic Yammer account, than this profile doesn't have any administrator control to manage user accounts in Yammer.</em></p>
<div><em>The only option available to reset the password for basic users is to go to password reset link of Yammer and enter the email address.</em></div>
<div>
<p><em>If the email with password reset link is not received than please check with your exchange admin to see if there is any restrictions that is blocking emails from Yammer to get blocked. If you find my reply useful, would appreciate if you can click it
 as helpful." ...</em></p>
<p>... Please know, this response <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>i</strong></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>s not a solution to my problem, nor an answer to my question</strong></span>. I am asking for an actual solution to the very clear problem you have with users not being able to reset their
 password on the basic/free external networks. This is clearly a problem you've been made aware of, and it is causing a very bad user experience for many of your customers - I don't know if you just don't care, or if this isn't being communicated to the right
 people on your development team. I would expect you would want to resolve an issue that seems so simple and could alleviate a lot of frustration for your customers. No one is going to pay for a product that they have a bad experience with the free version

<p>Is this network a Yammer Basic or Yammer Enterprise</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its a Yammer Enterprise network, I agree that raising a support ticket would be the way to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the network doesn't belong to you, perhaps contacting the network owner to have them raise a support ticket would be a good way to get to the bottom of this.</p>

<p>Thanks again for the reply. The issue is that while the phone can support several individual bands for LTE, the software or hardware might limit the combinations of bands available for LTE carrier aggregation. For example, for the Nexus 6P (https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6102470?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3415518):</p>
<p>
</p><p>B1 and B20 are supported on FDD but the last line, CA DL does not show a B1-B20 combination so the device software for worldwide distribution may not support carrier aggregation on B1 and B20.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you disclose any information like the CA DL one below for the Lumia 950?</p>

<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>"Carrier Aggregation</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span>A feature of LTE networks that allows two separate radio frequency bands to act as one, improving data speeds and/or network capacity. The technology can be used to boost top theoretical LTE data download rates

<strong>Carrier Aggregation is the most notable feature of LTE Category 4 and above</strong>, often referred to as LTE-Advanced. Other features of Category 4 (and above) also help boost network efficiency and reliability. Network operators can pick and choose

<h2>            Outlook templates</h2>
                    Until last Friday, I was able to create emails templates and use them very easily. I created a list of them. It seems that it has disappeared over the weekend. I don't have access to the "View templates" feature anymore and can't find my templates. Can
 somebody help me?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got an update from our internal support team regarding this matter, they advised that Outlook templates are only add-ins. As of the moment this feature is not available in Outlook.com. However, we suggest to have this concern posted to
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook.UserVoice
</a></strong>for our software engineers and developers to check this matter and eventually if it gets enough votes this will be added to the next update.</p>

<h2>            Link Preview - How does it chose the image&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The "Link Preview" functionality within later versions of Outlook allows the user to send an optional preview of the content being linked to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will chose an image and some supporting text to display as shown here&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>My question is this: How does this feature chose what image it will pick to display?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched around and though Facebook and a few other companies appear to have a similar feature, I have been unable to figure out how to get outlook to chose one image over another. Does it looks for images of a particular size? aspect ratio? with
 specific meta tags?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This issue in not the URL itself but which image from that URL outlook chooses to pick. Here is some example code to illustrate my point:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;header&gt;&lt;img src="/header_image.jpg"&gt;&lt;h1 style="background-image:'http://www.mysite.com/image.png'"&gt;Page Title&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/header&gt;</p>

</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;footer&gt;<span>&lt;img src="/footer_image.jpg" /&gt;</span>&lt;/footer&gt;</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;/body&gt;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This is a very simple example but my question is: if I link to this page, by what means does outlook chose which image will be chosen for the preview link?</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I ask this question as I have found that when i link to my website, outlook is picking a partner logo from the footer if there are no other images within the body tag (i.e. no articles or similar content areas have an &lt;img&gt; tag.)</p>

            <p>The above did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing some testing on one of my programs (Garmin) that doesn't have the graphic in the place holder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The target shortcut name for&nbsp;Garmin is pointing to&nbsp;express.exe. If I&nbsp;go into the actual file location and change express.exe to express1.exe, then go into the start menu shortcut for Garmin and change the target name&nbsp;from express.exe to express1.exe the
 start menu&nbsp;instantly&nbsp;shows the icon graphic in the place holder for Garmin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed permissions or anything. I just changed the actual file name and the target file name in the shortcut, and the graphic is now showing in the Garmin place card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this. It appears the NAME of the program is the problem, or it appears that way?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried moving the file out and back in with no luck, and uninstalling and re-installing still leaves the place card blank..</p>

            When this has happened before, I've found that changing the tile size got the icon to reload, and it stayed when changing back to the original size. That could get tedious if you are missing lots of them. (and super annoying if you hadn't already dragged
 them over as tiles!)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem but it only seems to affect Microsoft Office applications. I'm going to try the fixes and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick</p>
<p>
</p><p>** Update **</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommended fixes don't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The office icons in the start menu file location points to the short cut which does have icons but these icons are not being passed back to the start menu. Instead I just have variously coloured square blocks which open the associated application but have
 no associated application icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I pin the coloured block to the task bar the icon is restored there but not in the start menu.</p>

            This is affecting me as well. I did an upgrade from the previous build and after, I did a Windows Reset. This is definitely a bug in this build and the solution Arun from Microsoft is providing is irrelevant.

            <p>Here is an oddity: For me one of the programs that is missing the icon from the place card&nbsp;is Garmin. The shortcut is pointing to express.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I take ANY file, place it on my desktop, rename it to express.exe, the icon instantly changes to the one attached to the original express.exe.</p>

            <p>Well, after preforming a fresh install of Windows 10 build 10240, and than immediately updating through the FAST build process to 10547 it appears the missing icons in the place cards in the Start Menu are a bug in Windows 10 build 10547. Some, not all of
 the start menu icons for Office 2013 Pro have place cards but no icons. However pinning one of the items that have a blank place card to Start does produce a place card with an icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested this on a fresh install and the ONLY install I did was for Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT user fixable as we will need to wait for Microsoft to address the problem.</p>

    <title>Invisible Worksheets with a workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nantucketbob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisible Worksheets with a workbook</h2>
                    
<p>I use a workbook called "sourcelist"&nbsp;as a mailing list of church members.&nbsp; (The file was created by an office person no longer employed.)&nbsp; &nbsp;It works fine with mail merge, but when mail merge asks for the source file and I point to "sourcelist" it opens a
 dialog window that seems to indicate there is a second worksheet within the file.&nbsp; However, there is none.&nbsp; That second worksheet appears to be a reasonable thing (list of members who pledged money).&nbsp; I have a screenshot of that window.&nbsp; Does anyone know what
 is going on?&nbsp;</p>

            If the "sourcelist" worksheet was hidden in the normal manner,<br />
try this:<br />
• Format.Sheet.UNhide...select the sourcelist sheet.<br />
• Click: OK<br />
<br />
Does that help?

            There are no hidden columns or rows.&nbsp; When I select Format Sheet it shows only Hide, no unhide.&nbsp; The dialog window that shows up in mail merge is titled "Select Table."&nbsp; I have never heard of "Tables" within Excel.&nbsp; The dialog box (Select Table)&nbsp; lists

<p>Try opening the excel file once more.</p>
<p>Hit alt-f11 to get to the VBE (where macros live).<br />
Hit ctrl-r to see the project explorer (like windows explorer).</p>
<p>Select your project.<br />
Hit the asterisk on the numeric keypad to expand all the branches in your<br />
project.</p>
<p>What do you see under the "microsoft excel objects"?</p>
<p>Is it just two items (like):<br />
Sheet1 (SheetNameHere)<br />
ThisWorkbook</p>
<p>If that's it, then I don't have a guess.</p>
<p>But if you see another object that looks like it could be sheet, try:<br />
Select that object<br />
Hit F4 to show the properties window<br />
Look for the .visible property and change it to -1 - xlsheetvisible</p>
<p>Then hit alt-f11 to go back to excel to see what that now visible sheet looks<br />
like.</p>

            I should add that I copied and pasted the entire worksheet, Sheet 1 (renamed Source List) to an empty excel file.&nbsp; A couple of the "tables" disappeared.&nbsp; I then copied that copy into an empty worksheet but the remaining tables did not disappear.&nbsp; My main

<p>And if you don't get a good answer here, you may want to ask in one of the<br />

<p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>in an earlier posting, you say you copied the Worksheet from an original file.<br />
That being the case, there will only be one worksheet object.</p>
<p>Try carrying out Dave's steps on the original file, and my bet is that you will see your extra sheet with it's properties currently set to xlveryyhidden.</p>

            I have two copies of the original file but valid at different dates (updated, Feb and June).&nbsp; The visual basic window brought up both copies.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, both copies in the visual basic window show only Sheet 1 and ThisWorkbook.&nbsp; I will get
 an unaltered file from the office computer and check that. <br />

            Hi NareshSalaskar 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As first step of troubleshooting let's try to rule out Skype client as the source of trouble. Let me know the results after below steps to advise you further on this.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>I've had the same issue because I don't want my work computer to save my password, so that anyone can log into my account if I am away from my desk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to keep the settings per my own profile, yet sign off without it remembering my credentials?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get attachment field in form based on query to work...</h2>
                    <p>I created a form based on a query, then I added the attachment field. I then put the form in Form View and try to attach a document to the record, and it doesn't work.&nbsp; I tried doing it using the table, and it worked, but then I lose all my data links between
 tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some tips would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
