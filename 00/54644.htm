    <title>Family safety not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgloney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family safety not working</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and family restrictions have worked for the last couple of years. My daughter took a several month breaking from using my Windows 10 desktop and recently started again. She now has no restrictions. I have checked both mine and her microsoft
 accounts and we are both logged in. From my account I can see her listed as a child and I can see the restrictions are set. Family safety restrictions are still set up with time limits and preventing access to chrome.&nbsp; From her account, I can see me listed
 as the parent. However, when logged onto the computer as her, I have no restrictions at all. Time is not limited and chrome is not blocked. I have confirmed diagnostic data is set to full but I get no reporting of her activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't find a way to actually contact microsoft. Totally frustrating. Any recommendations?<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks for your attempt to help me. I had found that discussion and I think I have tried everything listed. I did find out my child's account needed to be verified again. However, I have verified her account and nothing has been resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to https://aka.ms/familyverify in her account I am directed to ask permission by email from my parent. My parent email does receive the request. However, safety restrictions still don't seem to work when she is logged in. The computer is set to
 not allow the app Chrome, but Chrome still works. In my parent account I see no activity listed even though I know there is activity since I am in her account. I also get no restriction of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss having now spent a few hours going through every step I can find on the Microsoft community site :(</p>
<p>

<p>Interestingly, content blocking in Microsoft Edge does now seem to be working. When I log in to her account and go to any non-approved website, it prompts to ask for permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Chrome is still not blocked, activity is still not being reported and time limits are still not being enforced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange that the account is partially working. I would think it would be all or nothing. Anyway, wanted to report this change in case it provides any additional insight that might help someone suggest how to fix the problems.</p>

            <div>I don't understand your use of the words "unloading" and "leave a few hours</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems like you are saying that if you completely drain the battery that the</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I know you have been posting about this in several threads and have started</div>
<div>several threads, but this definitely sounds like a hardware problem. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If this is the case, the ONLY thing you can do is contact support for an out of</div>
<div>warranty exchange and if you are not in a country where the SP3 is/was</div>
<div>officially sold, you will need to find someone in a supported country to handle</div>
<div>all of this for you.</div>

</p><p>1 - Battery is over.<br />
2 - Press button on appears a white ball low battery.<br />
3 - Leave the surface for some time without turning on. Leave about 2 hours unplugged.<br />
4 - When the low battery white ball does not appear put in the energy.<br />
5 - Power on Surface.<br />
6 - Working Keyboard.<br />
7 - Turning Surface Off<br />
8 - Keyboard not working anymore&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For turn on you need to do the process again. Drain battery and turn on surface. Working Keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I left the surface turned on with the keyboard working, I'll leave up to 100% battery and then turn off to see if the keyboard will work.</p>

            <div>Johnny, you've been advised on the solution multiple times. I'm reposting it</div>
<div>here:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"You need to exchange your Surface if you completely reimaged with a released</div>
<div>version of Windows from a downloadable recovery image and still have issues</div>
<div>(this has been explained to you in all the other threads). You've stated you are</div>
<div>running Insider Builds in another thread "I am insider, I installed the last</div>
<div>update of the insider for this, and nothing solved."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you live in an unsupported country and you need to find </div>
<div>someone in a supported country to handle the exchange for you and that person </div>
<div>will need to pay for the refurb and you will need to reimburse that person. "</div>

            This is hardware.<br />
Some MVPs told me they need a firmware. Unfortunately I have a new Surface with few loads and I'm already with this big problem.&nbsp;This started with a firmware update hidden on July 22.&nbsp;Everything working normally, when you turn it off an hour and call the other
 day no longer works. This is not to bring a product into a Microsoft store.<br />
<br />
I'm selling my Surface and I'm going to buy a Xiaomi notebook. I never buy a Microsoft product again!&nbsp;

<p>After putting this on Reddit, Johnny redirected me to this thread.</p>
<p>I did some extra testing and what he says is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to quote myself:</p>
<p>"A month ago my type cover stopped working. Happened lots of times, so no problem, soft reset to uefi and normally it's good to go. However, not this time. Tried all common solutions but nothing. Full reset to the win10 image didn't help either. Even tried
 reset to the win8.1 image to be absolutely sure.</p>
<p>I tried a friend's type cover, same issue. He tried mine and it worked flawlessly on his surface."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of this, the battery drains extremely fast when in sleep mode, so these 2 issues are related to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let my surface drain completely, beyond the level that the white "battery empty" icon flashes when you try to turn it on;
</p>
<p>and then I connect the keyboard, plug in the charger and power on the device; the keyboard works flawlessly.</p>
<p>However, when I close the lid or when I disconnect the keyboard, I can't get it working again without letting the battery drain untill it is completely empty again.</p>
<p>I can reproduce this again and again. Works everytime when done like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope that Microsoft takes it responsibility with this issue.</p>
<p>My surface is worthless now altough it never fell and was treated with utmost care.
</p>
<p>This problem arose from one day to another and is clearly some type of hardware issue which should be covered by a warranty extension plan.</p>
<p>Microsoft, please deal with this issue and take your responsibility to replace faulty devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: I live in Belgium</p>

</p><p>Android apps do not run on everything and is the same in the Apple world also.&nbsp; These apps check the device type you have and if it does not match the criteria, it will not work.</p>

    <title>How to stop Windows 10 from downgrading my Intel Graphics - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rve88  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Windows 10 from downgrading my Intel Graphics Drivers&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
A few days ago we received our new Zenbook 3 Deluxe (UX490UA) and updated to the latest Intel Graphics Driver (24.20.100.6194).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, every time I try to run Windows update, it downloads the Intel Graphics Driver from 2016 (21.xxxx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have reinstalled the latest driver, which is compatible with my i7 7500 processor, 4 times, however, every time Windows is downgrading me again.<br />
<br />
In addition, editing registry as well as disabling driver updates under the "device installation settings" didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop Windows from messing with this driver as it is driving me nuts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with the "show or hide trouble shooter package" but it is mentioning in the title it will "temporarily hide" hide the Windows update.<br />
It currently isn't showing up, however, how long will it take till it forces this update again?<br />
<br />
The tool I am mentioning can be found below:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help? I am literally 1 step away from changing to OSX... :-(<br />
<br />
Thanks a million in advance!</p>

<p>Many thanks for your feedback. Unfortunately, I am using Windows 10 Home, hence gpedit.msc&nbsp; isn't available to me. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the steps mentioned on tenforums: The "include driver updates when I update Windows" isn't there. No clue why Microsoft removed it as I don't see any valid reason... Why not disable it y default, but allow people to enable it by there choice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second&nbsp; and fourth option (editing the registry) didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long will show or hide trouble shooter package" hide my update? Permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just stunned that Windows 10 forced 2 year old updates and doesn't allow me to permanently block them.

<p>Hi Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your feedback! Unfortunately, the steps described by Laptopmag I have already tried. In fact, they were the ones I tried first. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also installed and executed O&amp;O Shutup 10 which I hope disables driver updates permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea how long the "hide trouble shooter package" normally hides updates? Is this permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would love to hear from Microsoft why on earth they take away their clients choice to prevent a driver from being downloaded or worse, to prevent Windows 10 from downgrading to a 2 year old driver. It's just absurd... :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course they can promote driver updates or have the option to update drivers automatically for people who don't have much knowledge about PCs, HOWEVER at least they should grant everyone else the possibility to disable this option AND make sure that Windows
 Updater NEVER downgrades a driver...</p>

            Hi Malik, tried all this. The "hide trouble shooter package" you are able to download on the bottom of the site doesn't say&nbsp; if this is hiding the update permanently or just temporary. :(

            <p>I believe the Atheros AR5007EG is a 802.11b/g device. That would have a maximum speed of 54Mbit/s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For 100Mbit/s you need a Wireless N device - 802.11n standard.</p>

            Windows 10 version 1803 was in development when the vulnerabilities were introduced so the patch is injected into the OS itself. There is no way you can remove the package from the OS.
<br />Please note that both OS update and microcode(BIOS) update might slow down the system. So preferably, you should not install the BIOS update.

            Yea, that's what mine is as well, and that's never going to be patched through microcode. Only Windows will protect you, albeit with a performance hit. Frankly, though, the question I posed remains: Which would you rather have - a slower, safe PC or a PC that will operate very quickly for the bad guys when they get their malware on it?

            That is not correct. I installed 1803 today. The microcode updates are missing. Intels official tool shows that the system is vulnerable.

<p>it looks like either the new microcode updates are either not available for the final 1803 release yet OR not implemented/included in the final 1803 release.</p>

            My Windows 10 laptop was patched against spectre before the 1803 update. After the update the fixes are gone. So I am certain that the microcode updates are not implemented. That is not a good situation in any way.

But the new sequel American Nightmare is yet to arrive on Xbox Live Arcade, and maybe on PC again in near future..

            <p>lol it's still an exclusive. &nbsp;or rather maybe they should say CONSOLE exclusive so people won't get in a tizzy about something being exclusive. &nbsp;not that it even matters if a game comes on another platform but still .. Halo is still an Xbox exclusive, Gears of War is etc. &nbsp;both have PC versions and both are still Xbox exclusive because no one considers a game being available on PC as breaking exclusivity.</p>

<p>This is great news! The title does not deserve to be an exclusive. It deserves to be in as many homes as possible. I just hope they fix the dreadful facial animations and adopt the real eyes software tools used for the Mass Effect series. Anything is better
 than the dreaded "dead eyes" <span><em>synonymous</em></span> with the Havok Engine.<br />
<br />
@Nameloi, why with the cynicism? I mean surely you're not letting the abhorrent disdain instilled in you rear its ugly end when it comes to all things Kinect, right? It shouldn't affect your life in that way, right? So if it doesn't then there's really no real
 need to be this distasteful toward it. <br />
<br />
I mean you're obviously a great reviewer so it would only serve to remain somewhat open minded even though you're disappointed with it. You know, in the unlikely event that there may one day be a Kinect title that you would vouch for. On the retrospect you
 winning a lottery would be more likely, however, my point still stands. =)<br />
<br />
All said and done though, and as much as I understand where you're coming from, it's a case of to each and their own, I suppose.</p>

<p>I tell you what. I am PRAYING that Sony starts making leaps to make PSN more like Xbox Live. PSN is currently a piece of garbage service and that is literally the only thing keeping me from switching to Playstation. Our list of exclusives is absolutely abismal
 right now. Now that Gears is over, all we have is Halo 4 (which we don't even know will be good since it is a completely different developer making it) and Forza. I am not even going to count the Kinect nonsense because those aren't even real games in my eyes.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>xp access this computer from network invalid &#43;SID entries - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sreyes27  say:</h3>
<h2>            xp access this computer from network invalid &#43;SID entries</h2>
                    I have a Windows XP Professional SP? (I can find out) machine which is bringing up the invalid SID properties under the settings: Local Security Policy under Security Settings| Local Policies | User Rights Assignment|Access this computer from the network.&nbsp;
 This entry is showing (the properties pop-up) invalid SID entries for the user ids.&nbsp; I imagine these userids existed at some point but they don't anymore.&nbsp; How can I clear these entries as my machine is not accessible from the network?&nbsp; I can ping the machine
 but I can't access it from the network (browse - so as to share folders and files).<br />
<br />
What are your recommendations?&nbsp; I assume that these invalid SIDs are the reason why I can't access this machine from the network.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            <p>Sorry it has taken a while for me to respond.&nbsp; I had not returned to the office which has this problem with their XP machine until today.&nbsp; Specifically, the machine is running Windows XP 2002 with SP3.&nbsp; I cannot access the computer from the network - even
 as Administrator.&nbsp; The Administrator account cannot view or have access to 
\\remote-pc\admin$ share.&nbsp; Looking at the</p>
<p>'Local Security Settings | Local Policies | User Rights Assignment | Access this computer from the network Properties' window shows invalid SID's as the setting.&nbsp; It appears that this machine used to belong to a domain but that domain does not exist any
 longer.&nbsp; Nevertheless, that XP machine is plugged in to the LAN as the other computers.&nbsp; I can ping it but can't access any shares on it.&nbsp; How can I resolve this issue?&nbsp; I am specifically looking for a way to have access to the \\remote-pc\admin$ share.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You shouldn't need to worry too much about removing the invalid SIDs but you can if you want.&nbsp; You should be more concerned about adding yourself to the list.&nbsp; Being logged in locally as an administrator on the computer "remote-pc", when you double-click
 on the "Access this computer from the network" entry from the "User Rights Assignment" screen under "Local Security Settings", you should have a screen with a button on the bottom labeled "Add User or Group".&nbsp; Simply click this button and add the "Administrators"
 group from your computer by inserting the name&nbsp; "remote-pc\Administrators" where "remote-pc" is the network name of your computer and "Administrators" is entered as-is (name of the Administrators group).&nbsp; Removal is just as easy with the "Remove" button.<br />
<br />
If the "Add User or Group" button is Greyed-out (which I must suspect as the above solution is rather obvious), then the easiest way to include yourself&nbsp;is to use the command-line "NTRights" program to add the remote access rights to yourself.&nbsp; "NTRights" is
 included as part of the free Resource Tools Kit available here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17657</a>&nbsp;&gt;<br />
After installing the resource kit, you can grant remote access rights to all administrators on your machine by bringing up a command prompt (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and entering the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ntrights&nbsp; -u&nbsp; remote-pc\Administrators&nbsp; +r&nbsp; SeNetworkLogonRights<br />
You might also want to check to make sure that administrators are not denied this right (Denials take precedent over Allows) by checking the "Deny access to this computer from the network" policy setting.&nbsp; If administrators are denied, you can remove it with
 a command such as:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ntrights&nbsp; -u&nbsp; remote-pc\Administrators&nbsp; -r&nbsp; SeDenyNetworkLogonRight<br />
<br />
Note that "SeNetworkLogonRight" and "SeDenyNetworkLogonRight" are not listed as permissible entries if you enter " ntrights /? " but they will work.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are trying to login remotely using Remote Desktop Connection, you will need to assign yourself the "SeInteractiveLogonRight" using the procedure above. (The properties above were for File and Printer Sharing connections)<br />

            After resetting the security settings pertaining to assigning default network access to the computer (the setting "Access this computer from the network") now shows the groups (grayed out) "Administrators, Backup Operators, Everyone, Power Users, and Users).&nbsp;
 I then downloaded and installed the resource kit (the Microsoft link you indicated).&nbsp; I&nbsp; then tried the command ' ntrights&nbsp; -u&nbsp; remote-pc\Administrators&nbsp; +r&nbsp; SeNetworkLogonRights' .&nbsp; This failed displaying the error "Granting SeNetworkLogonRights to Nuclear\Administrators&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ... failed (GetAccountSid(Nuclear\Administrators)=1332"<br />
I then tried removing it from the Group Policy (if it was set there) but that failed for the same 1332 error.&nbsp; So even though I was able to remove those invalid SIDs, I still cannot access this computer from the network.&nbsp; What do you suggest?<br />

            It appears that the computer is having problems associating the name "Nuclear\Administrators" with the SID of the Administrators group.&nbsp; You might try removing the "Nuclear\" part and simply inserting "Administrators" as in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ntrights -u&nbsp; Administrators&nbsp; +r SeNetworkLogonRights<br />
or, since "Administrators" is a "well-known" group, the SID is known to be S-1-5-32-544, so maybe you can enter the SID directly.&nbsp; In some cases, I see it preceded by an asterisk, so you might try:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ntrights&nbsp; -u&nbsp; *S-1-5-32-544&nbsp; +r SeNetworkLogonRights<br />
(or try eliminating the asterisk before the "S" if that doesn't work).<br />
<br />
You also indicate that "Access this computer from the network" already shows Administrators...[etc] so maybe administrators already do have access even though it is greyed-out (indicating it can't be edited).&nbsp; This then begs the question "How are you authenticating
 to the computer over the network?"&nbsp; If "Simple File Sharing" is enabled, then you are authenticating as "Guest" and may not have any rights.&nbsp; Make sure Simple File Sharing is disabled (Control Panel -&gt; Folder Options -&gt; View (Tab) -&gt; last item in the window
 list unchecked).&nbsp; Do you have matching username/password accounts on both machines?&nbsp; Does it ask for username/password?<br />
<br />
Attempting to connect over the network from a command prompt window will produce more meaningful errors.&nbsp; So on another network computer, bring up the command prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; \\remote-pc\sharename&nbsp; password&nbsp; /user:username<br />
where you substitute the network name of the machine for "remote-pc", the network share name for "sharename", and the user you are authenticating as (user name remote-pc recognizes) for "username", and the associated password for "password".&nbsp; See what error
 you get.<br />
<br />
Hope This Helps,<br />

There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.<br />
<br />
What is bizarre to me is that we have another machine running Windows 7 64-bit (Billing) which is configured the same way as the XP machine (Nuclear) which does NOT have this problem.&nbsp; I can access this other machine thru it's ip address.&nbsp; I can access the
 share \\192,168.3.2\ADMIN$ on this other machine (called Billing).&nbsp; I am trying to access the shame share on the Nuclear machine but I cannot (i.e. \\192.168.3.32\ADMIN$).&nbsp; I'm gonna try to see why I can from the Billing machine and I can't from the Nuclear
 machine.&nbsp; So far, the only difference is that Billing is Windows 7 and Nuclear is Windows XP SP3.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thank&nbsp; you,<br />

            <p>You provided some good information -- although I must admit I'm stretching to interpret it.</p>
<p>The Error 1789 you get when trying to change rights indicates a failure of either you or your machine&nbsp;to authenticate to the domain.&nbsp; Which, to me, says that you may have physically&nbsp;disconnected a domain computer from the domain but perhaps not changed it
 into a Workstation.&nbsp; Assuming that you have administrator rights and&nbsp;do not want it to be on a domain,&nbsp; right-click "My Computer" then:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Properties -&gt; Computer Name (Tab) -&gt; Change -&gt; then make sure "Workgroup" (give it a&nbsp;workgroup name, too)&nbsp;is checked and "OK" your way out.</p>
<p>Before you do this, though, make absolutely sure that you can log into the computer using a
<u>Local</u> Administrator account and not a domain administrator account whose login credentials have been cached.&nbsp; Otherwise you will find yourself in this situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You cannot log on after you remove a computer from the domain"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317049" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317049</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>The best to avoid this is to create a new&nbsp;local&nbsp;user with administrator privilege before making the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm glad you tried to connect with IP address.&nbsp; The error you received "There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request" indicates that from the network perspective, your machine is not responding at all&nbsp;to attempts to connect.</p>
<p>One cause is a Firewall.&nbsp; Assuming you are using the Windows Firewall, go to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Panel -&gt; Windows Firewall</p>
<p>On the "General" tab, make sure "Don't Allow Exceptions" is not checked.</p>
<p>On the "Exceptions" tab, make sure File and Printer Sharing shows up with a check mark beside it.</p>
<p>If you're not using Windows Firewall, try temporarily disabling your current firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second cause would be that File and Printer Sharing is not enabled.&nbsp; Go to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Control Panel -&gt; Network Connections -&gt;</p>
<p>then right-click on your network connection and select "Properties".&nbsp; Make sure "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" appears in the "This connection uses..." box and it is checked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also verify that your network sharing service is running:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc"<br />
When the window appears, find the line named "Server" and verify that its status is "Started" and its "Startup Type" is "Automatic".&nbsp; If not, double-click on it and make it that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope one of the above helps you out a bit,</p>

            It seems to me that the the state of computer (Nuclear) is in a bad state (permitted or allowed to be in
<br />
this state because of a Microsoft coding error or simply a design flaw).&nbsp; It is without a domain really.<br />
It thinks it is part of a domain when in fact the domain is nonexistent.&nbsp; Basically, all the machines in the
<br />
office are in this limbo state.&nbsp; It is curious why the Windows 2003 Server (used to be the DC) is able to access the \\Billing\Admin$ share (which is on a Windows 7 - named Billing) and it cannot access the same share on the Nuclear (Windows XP SP3 - \\Nuclear\Admin$).&nbsp;
 Why it is able to access the Admin$ share on Windows 7 and it cannot on Windows XP.&nbsp; Both machines are configured the same (except that one is Windows 7 and the other is a Windows XP machine).&nbsp; The Windows Firewall has been temporarily disabled on these machines
 until the problem is fixed.&nbsp; I think the actual resolution is to restore the domain but why it currently works for some computers and it doesn't for the others.&nbsp; It might take some time to setup the DC so we were trying to get by without for the time being.&nbsp;
 What do you suggest?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Start menu,Task Bar,Search Bar unable to left click</h2>
                    I am using Win 10 build number 10240.Till 1st Oct-2015 I was able to use all the features of Win 10 without any error.But after 2nd Oct-2015 suddenly my Start button,task bar,search bar,icons on the right side of task bar stopped operating.I am unable
 to left click on any of them but i can right click them.I tried almost all the solutions on internet to solve the issue but none of them work. I am also unable to create new user.Nothing happens when i click on the Add new user button.Unable to use even the
 Calculator.I also tried to run the Shell Experience Host manually from system apps folder.Initially it showed that Windows Defender has blocked the application so i added an exception in Windows Defender settings for that folder. So i was able to run it but
 of no use.It does not reflect in the services running section.So now i am almost helpless.....Pls give an update for the same to rectify the problem...I am facing lot of problems due to it...

</p><p><span><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you installed any third party antivirus software?</li></ul>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Conflict between third party applications.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Corrupt System Files.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Run the SFC.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>key on the keyboard.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong><span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>At the command prompt window, type the following commands:</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> without quotes and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Run the DISM Tool.</span></strong></p>
<span>If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>key on the keyboard.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong><span>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>At the command prompt window, type the following commands:</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press the Enter key after each command:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type <strong>Exit</strong>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.</span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To work with this issue, refer these methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Open Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows update troubleshooter makes sure that your computer is connected to the Internet, and checks to see whether your network adapter and Windows Update services
 are running correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Check which update is getting installed. Refer the following article.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disable both Antivirus and firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable antivirus software</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Firewall</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-firewall</span></a></span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:</span><span>
 Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other security programs and firewall after the test.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><span><br />
Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're
 done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then try installing the update again.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to open any windows program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlottee97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open any windows program</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I've had quite a few issues with my laptop since I got it last June, such as the CPU running at 100% a lot and being slow and unresponsive. It's an Asus X441S with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, I was studying in my uni library and it crashed. I rebooted it and it seemed fine but about 40 minutes later, it crashed again. Now I can't open any of the Windows programs that were pre-installed on my laptop. This includes everything
 on the taskbar (volume, battery, wifi etc.), the start menu, task manager - pretty much all of the basic programs on my laptop. The weird thing is, everything that I've installed on my laptop myself still works - Google Chrome, Norton, Adobe Acrobat Reader
 DC, Office, Spotify etc.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do because everything I try requires opening a program such as Task Manager, which I can't do! No error messages or anything come up, it just does nothing and acts as if I haven't tried to open anything!</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Hi Charlotte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted Windows system file is a possible cause for the Windows apps to malfunction. It would be great if you can tell us more about your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you notice any system setting changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you installed the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">latest updates</a></strong> for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the current <strong>OS Build</strong> of your Windows 10 laptop? Click the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>As initial troubleshooting, we recommend running the troubleshooter for Windows apps. The automated troubleshooter will scan and fix your PC for any issues found with your apps. You can get the troubleshooter from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store: run the troubleshooter">
<strong>page</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue continue even after running the automated troubleshooter, you can run the
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool and the <strong>SFC</strong> tool to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. You'll need administrator permission to run these tools. You can find the instructions on how to run the tools

<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I haven't noticed any system setting changes prior to the issue - I can't check because I can't open settings!</p>
<p>I've installed the latest updates.</p>
<p>I'm unable to check the OS Build of my laptop as the Start button is not working/unresponsive. I also can't run the troubleshooter as it won't open!</p>
<p>I'm very limited with what I can do as hardly any of the basic Windows apps, such as the settings and start button, are working!</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. Let's troubleshoot your issue by performing a clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, click <strong>Start</strong>, type and search for <strong>msconfig</strong>.</li><li>Then, select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong>Services </strong>tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click <strong>
Disable all</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup </strong>tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the Startup tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Close <strong>Task Manager.</strong> </li><li>Lastly, on the Startup tab of the System Configuration dialog box, tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persist, we suggest the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new local user account</a> and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create installation media using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> and use it to restore your PC.</p>
<p>Here are some things you'll need before you begin:</p>
<ul>
<li>A PC with a reliable Internet connection. The download is about 4 GB, and the time it takes to download it will depend on your Internet connection.A USB flash drive or DVD.
</li><li>A blank USB flash drive or DVD with at least 5 GB of available drive space. Using a DVD requires a DVD burner and software on the PC youre using to create the media and a DVD player on the PC where you want to install Windows.</li><li>A product key. The 25-character product key.</li></ul>
<p>Here are some things to check on the PC where you want to install Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit or 32-bit processor (CPU). Youll need to download either the 64-bit or 32-bit version of Windows thats appropriate for your CPU. To check this on your current PC, go to PC info in PC settings or System in Control Panel, and look for System type.</li><li>System requirements. See the system requirements before installing Windows 10. We also recommend that you visit your PC manufacturer's website for info about updated drivers and hardware compatibility.</li><li>Language in Windows. You'll need to choose the same language when you install Windows 10. To see which language you're currently using, go to Time and language in PC settings or Region in Control Panel.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To restore your PC using installation media, refer to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>disabling startup programs doesn't not always speedup the boot process.<br />
<br />
make sure you have the services Superfetch and ReadyBoost running and next try to speed up the boot with the help of my guide [1]. This trains the advanced prefetcher in Windows Vista.<strong>This increase the boot performance a lot. All other tweaking tools
 are useless. Only use this method with this Microsoft Toolkit.<br />
</strong><br />
If this doesn't speed up the boot process, follow my guide [2] to make a boot trace and compress the boot_BASE+CSWITCH+DRIVERS+POWER_1.etl as 7z or RAR and upload it to your Skydrive [3] and post the link here.<br />
<br />
I take a look at the trace, maybe I see what's wrong with your Windows.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Stella-50,</p>
<p>How slow is slow? For example my machine (e-machine E4264 2.2ghz with 2GB RAM) boots in around 95 seconds. To me I call that about average. I'm currently in the process of looking for a new machine as this one is already 3 years old, so maybe that oen will
 be slightly quicker to boot.</p>
<p>What you can 'disable' will depend upon what is actually launching at start up and, unfortunately, you haven't told us that at the moment. What you must not disable is your anti virus software (updater); anything to do with your mouse and keyboard etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you made a list of what application are actually running at startup (via msconfig startup tab) someone can take a look at them and see if or what can be disabled.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could take a look at Startup Delayer <a href="http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?page=2&amp;show=startdelay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.r2.com.au/software.php?page=2&amp;show=startdelay</a>&nbsp;to see if you can delay the time different applications load to allow windows to boot quicker. I haven't used it so I can't say how good/bad it is.&nbsp; It is freeware.</p>

                    <p>The Windows 10 computer in the library where I live has a message that says the May Update is on its way but the computer is not compatible.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A link showed an article that says they are now using ML to update units using the April 2018 update and earlier versions, but this computer has version 1809 and it is not loaded with a lot of stuff. So what can be the not compatible problem?</p>

            Hi Hesed.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It could be software or hardware that's deemed not compatible by the Windows Upgrade Advisor, which like Windows Update is buggy and not always right.  But they re not pushing the version update this time like before because of all the problems it can cause consumers.  You have to choose it and then if it Advisor thinks it will run, it will install.  
<br />
<br />If you want to try it then I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi HESED3<br /><br />I am an Independent Advisor here to help<br /><br /> Compatibility with each release of Windows 10 has a lot of factors. The biggest one is the hardware inside the computer and whether or not the hardware is compatible with the newest updates . <br /><br />For more information on compatibility with Windows 10 please see the following link<br /><br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows...</a>

            Hi Hesed3,
<br />
<br />Rest assured, you have absolutely nothing to do, and there is nothing wrong with that PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft are releasing version 1903 in stages, initially, users must click Update Now to get that update, now it is being released to certain PC hardware architectures and then to all PC's . . . 
<br />
<br />This is being dome to make sure the update is compatible with all systems and not causing the uses PC's to crash. This is actually a safer way to release these major updates to minimize any update related bugs for users 
<br />
<br />So, all you need to do is wait a little while until your hardware is included in this release . . .

<p>Thanks for your reply, Greg (and thanks to James and Dave also).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Today it offered me another chance to "Check for Updates" and it turned out to be a Cumulative one, so it is possible that the problem is about to be corrected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I guess that I was expecting too much when I assumed that if it knew something was incompatible it would tell me what exactly that was at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, although the computer is for the use of residents who do not have a machine of their own, it began as a Windows 7 Professional b<span>ut it is a very basic unit.&nbsp;
</span>Keeping my fingers crossed.</p>

            Well, the Feature Update was finally installed on Thursday.&nbsp; No hint as to what was done to fix the incompatibility, but it seems to be working fine.&nbsp; I'll settle for that.

<h2>            Screen flickers on new ACER Aspire laptop when not plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new ACER Aspire laptop only about a week ago, and I have noticed that the screen flickers/blinks when it's running on battery. I have two GPUs in this laptop: an Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620, and an NVIDIA GeForce MX150.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the Intel graphics card in Safe Mode, and then installing all the newest windows updates, like one site suggested, but it didn't seem to fix the problem. Other sites suggested I lower the screen brightness (it's on the minimum at
 the moment and still happening), so that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>

            Hi JDKray ... you said you bought it a week ago?
<br />So you have warranty.
<br />I would contact Acer and get it replaced.
<br />Sounds like a hardware glitch.
<br />Cause the only other option is to fully reset your PC to see if that fixes it.

<p>Fully reset as in to factory settings? I tried that but it didn't fix it. I also installed all updates afterwards, and made sure I had the most recent versions of both GPUs, and it still didn't fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
All I can do now is try to take the laptop back and get it replaced then? Is there anything else I can try first?</p>

            I think you have exhausted all options.
<br />I would take it in for warranty if I were you.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I got the laptop replaced. Same thing happened on this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, what I didn't realize at first is that the blinking that was happening was a feature implemented into this laptop that automatically changes the brightness depending on what's on screen. It was only noticeable when the laptop was running on battery.
 This never happened on my old laptop so I didn't know what to make of it. All I knew was that it was very irritating to the eyes and I wanted it gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After realizing what was happening, I did some research and I was able to disable it. (right click desktop, click Intel Graphics Settings, Power, disable "Display Power Saving Technology)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely an annoying feature and I ended up believing something was wrong with the machine itself.</p>
<p>
