                    <p>In Win10 Office 365 Outlook isn't saving calendar items if they have a reminder time or day indicated. Message is that item is in a folder that does not allow reminers. What's that about?</p>

            Hi Bob,
<br />What type of email account do you have configured in Outlook? POP, IMAP, Outlook.com, or Microsoft Exchange?  
<br />
<br />What folder are you saving the event in? If you are using icloud, this is normal - icloud should add a reminder to it.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Calendar and Contacts fail to sync with Outlook for Android but eMail syncs just fine</h2>
                    <p>I am a medical professional, not an IT professional. So, I need some "for dummies" support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 and am running Windows 10 and Office 365 Home, from which I get Outlook 2016 for my email, my calendar, and my contacts. I am not using any storage in the cloud...the data is resident on my PC harddrive. My email provider
 is Comcast, so I have this set up using the IMAP settings. All appears to be working. I also want to use my Samsung Galaxy S4Active smart phone running Android 5.0.1 to access my Outlook email, calendar, and contacts. So, I downloaded and installed the Outlook
 for Android app. Email works great...I can send, receive, and auto-sync my email with my desktop. But, my calendar and contacts do not sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft sent me a link (https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Set-up-email-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-886DB551-8DFA-4FD5-B835-F8E532091872) to&nbsp; help resolve this, but I still am having trouble following that procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me:</p>
<p>1- will Comcast outlook calendar and contacts be supported in my case?</p>
<p>2- is there a setting somewhere that I need to look at to make sure calendar and contacts are shared?</p>
<p>3- if I have to "publish" my calendar to allow the Outlook for Android app, what are the disadvantages of this? and how do I do this without me having a personal website to use?</p>

            We have implemented a security update called Familiar location protection to keep our customers‚Äô accounts secure. The message "You haven't signed in from this location recently." will occur if you are signing in from a location more than 300 miles from
 your normal location. The Microsoft account service will prompt you for an additional challenge to complete the log in. Codes can be the date of birth, or receiving a code sent to your SMS number or alternate email if configured.<br />
<br />
<br />
To prevent this you will need to configure your computer/mobile device as a trusted device<br />
<br />
Given the new security measures, Account Settings requires an extra security, through the use of a security code.&nbsp; Also known as 2 step authentication<br />
<br />
If you mark your computer, phone or tablet as a Trusted Device, you won't be asked for any codes when you access these settings in the future.&nbsp; To do this<br />
<br />
1. Login your account here.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Under Security &amp; Privacy&nbsp; Click on "Manage Advanced Security"<br />
<br />
3. You will see the "protect your account" page. Select any option to get a code, and request for it.<br />
<br />
4. You will see a checkbox that says : "I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code". Tick the checkbox, and enter the code.<br />
<br />
Your computer/device is now Trusted. Whenever you use your account on that specific computer/device, you will no longer asked for a code.

<h2>            Populating an unbound field in a report to a specific field of a specific record</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My problem is figuring out how to make a field in the report return a value base on answers I give in a parameter I've set for the query. To try and explain what I mean. I have the query set to ask
 for a specific rabbit ear number this then returns that rabbits pedigree information along with his lineage going back to great great grandparents. I designed a report with unbound fields so it had the look I wanted and I am now trying to get that report to
 populate fields base on specific record in the query. So I run the report and enter the rabbit's ear number I need a pedigree for and the report fields populate with the information in the pedigree query. The problem is that say I make the control source for
 the name field in the report the RabbitName field from the PedigreeQuery this returns the first record in that query and then expanded my report to contain multiple sections for each subsequent record. I want the name field to populate with the rabbit name
 that corresponds with the ear number in the parameter question asked at the beginning of the report and the subsequent fields to populate with the lineage information. I'm am however having difficulties figuring out how to make it do this. Anyone have suggestions?</span>

            I can remove the parameter from the query, but then it is going to return all my rabbits and I need to be able to make a report that is going to populate every field based off one rabbit, So if I don't set a parameter how do I tell the report which rabbit
 to base the report on? and then get the subsequent fields to populate with the lineage information? and do this every time without having to make changes to the report filters?

            <p>Scott didn't say not to use a paramter - he suggested a different <em>kind</em> of paramter. Rather than a prompt like
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Enter ear number:]</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should use a little unbound Form (named frmCriteria say)&nbsp;with a control (say a combo box cboEartag&nbsp;to select only existing ear numbers) and a criterion</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Forms]![frmCriteria]![cboEartag]</p>

            Again, there are two ways to do this. One is to place criteria in your query. You do this by placing the criteria in a control on a form, then reference that control as the criteria. The other is to use the WHERE clause of the Open Report method to create
 a filter for the report.

            [Enter Ear Number:] is what I am using in my query. I placed this command in the criteria box in design view of the query. Doing this allowed me to pull only lineage information on the rabbit with that ear number. So what you are saying is to create an
 unbound form using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[Forms]![frmCriteria]![cboEartag] as the filter criteria instead. I will give this a try, but I am not quite sure I understand how to do this. Will let you if it works or if I need more

            I get it now. I wasn't fully understanding what you were trying to tell me in your first response. I will try using the form method. Like I told John though, I am not sure I still fully understand how to set this up, but I learn well from trial and error.
 Most the time I just need pointed in the right direction. I will let you know if this method works better or if I might need a little more direction in setting this up. Thank you for all your help.

            <p>Ok, I think where I went wrong was the way I ran the query. After I posted, I went back in and closed all my open tabs. I then reopened the Query and a prompt asking for the filter came up. I entered a rabbits ear number and this time the data populated.
 Going to see if this filtered through to the rest of my lineage queries and the union query that I use to populate my pedigree report. Then see if that fixed my issue with the report itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the PedigreeControl form and select an ear number then run my query it pulls no data? If I run it as above it does pull data, the same data as it did when I had the [Enter Ear Number] prompt. This makes the union query i created to combine all
 the lineage data run in the exact same manner and my report to populate in the same manner. If it would be helpful to look at my database thus far so you can see its set up I can email it to you.</p>

    <title>Odd behaviors when opening a Word file &#38; when updating fields - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Odd behaviors when opening a Word file &#38; when updating fields</h2>
                    A document file I'm editing has a couple of odd behaviors, and I wonder if anyone can explain them.<br />
<br />
First, when I open the file I usually get a message box with a gas gauge and the text "Scanning document..." This box remains open for anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes while the gas gauge fills. Then Word closes the box and lets me edit normally.
 It looks like something a virus checker would do, but I've never seen this behavior ever with any other document file, and I can't imagine why a virus checker would check this file and no other.<br />
<br />
Second, when I update the document's fields (Ctrl+A, F9), Word opens three or four consecutive message boxes with this text:<br />
<br />
"The linked file isn't available. This error can occur if the linked file has been moved or hasn't been saved. Embedding the data instead of linking it can help avoid this error, but the data won't be updated automatically if it changes in the source file"
 [There is no period at the end of the text.]<br />
<br />
After I close the last message box, Word updates the fields normally.<br />
<br />
The obvious response is to find the broken links and identify, then obtain the missing files. Problem is there are no external links at all in this document. It's totally self-contained.

<p>The "Scanning" message certainly seems to be a virus checker, except for the fact that this is the only document that displays it. Is the document perhaps macro-enabled (either *.docm or *.doc), allowing a Document_Open or AutoOpen macro to run automatically
 when the document opens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The messages during field updates implies that there really are linking fields somewhere in the document, perhaps ones you can't see. Try pressing Alt+F9 to display field codes, and look through the document, especially in places such as headers and footers.
 For example, if a section has "First Page" headers/footers turned on, but the section has only one page, you'll never see the "Primary" header/footer unless you force a second or third page. However, fields in those places will still try to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see anything suspicious, I may be able to supply a macro that can search the undisplayed parts of the document.</p>

<p>I've found nothing suspicious so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is a .docx, not macro enabled. (If there were any macros in it, disruptive or not, I would be expected to track down the member of my team who added them and find out why. No one else edits documents of this type.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document contains dozens of field codes, but none that look like they could cause this problem. Most of them are {SEQ}, {REF}, or {HYPERLINK}. I believe that all of the hyperlinks are either to bookmarks in the same file or to Web URLs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no unusual field codes in the headers and footers, only the ones that are supposed to be there: {STYLEREF}, {DOCPROPERTY}, and {PAGE}. Only one section had fewer than three pages, and forcing page breaks in it revealed nothing unexpected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did discover several {EMBED} commands that aren't supposed to be there, but I don't think they could cause this problem. All of them refer to Visio drawings that should be stored separately.</p>

<p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us with your question. We‚Äôre sorry to hear about the issue you are having when trying to log in to your Bing Ads Account, but rest assured, we‚Äôre happy to help!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Below I have listed a few common reasons as to why you may be facing this issue and suggestions on how to troubleshoot them:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Microsoft Account Credential Issue:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>More often than not, the log in issue faced by advertisers is due to an error with their Microsoft Account credentials. You can try resetting this by going to
</span><a href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1547248695&amp;rver=7.0.6730.0&amp;wp=LBI&amp;wreply=https:%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2fen-us%2fhomepage%2fSecure%2fPassport%3fru%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.msn.com%252f%253focid%253dmailsignout%2526pfr%253d1&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=1184&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;pcexp=True" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Live.com</span></a><span>
 and clicking <em>Forgot Username</em>. Once you have done this and have verified your username, try logging back into your Bing Ads Account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Cache and cookies:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Log in issues can be the product of the browser‚Äôs data being overloaded or the browser having old usernames/passwords stored which is causing incorrect credentials to be prepopulating when signing
 in. To alleviate this issue, we suggest that you clear your cache and cookies, close the browser, reopen it, and attempt to log in again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Non-compatible browser:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you find that clearing your cache and cookies doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue, we suggest trying a different browser. Sometimes, browsers can be out of date and cause issues with logging in.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the event that the troubleshooting steps listed above don‚Äôt work, I would be more than happy to look into this matter further. I have sent you a private message on how to proceed as I will need
 to collect some information from you. Please check your private messages!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>

<h2>            Lost permission to access to mounted drive - Q drive issues</h2>
                    Hi<br />
I have lost the ability to access a mounted drive.<br />
Previously, I would mount the drive as Q: and it would immediately open, saying it was Q: Microsoft Office Click-to-run (Protected).&nbsp; I could access the files I wanted within the drive.&nbsp; I have never had a problem before today.<br />
<br />
The drive is from a True Crypt encrypted file - I can mount the drive by entering the password to True Crypt, no problem. It mounts, shows up as local disc Q:, but when I click on it, it will not open and I get a message saying 'You don't currently have permission
 to access this folder'.<br />
When I follow the directions to security, and access the properties, a tab for sharing comes up but nothing labelled Security - is that a problem?<br />
<br />
In sharing, I give full control to 'Everyone', go back to the advanced sharing and select apply but it then says:<br />
'An error occured when trying to share Q, access is denied. The shared resource was not created at this time.'<br />
<br />
When I got this laptop I set up True Crypt on it to create an encrypted file - when I open this and mount it, I have to choose a drive. In my ignorance I chose Q at random, not realising this had other significance. I have quite a lot of files within this encrypted
 file that I would like to access (mostly backed up but a few small bits that aren't but I would like to access if possible).<br />
As the encrypted file seemed to mount on Q with no problems, I ignored the Click-to-run label and just continued to use it since April 2012 until now.<br />
<br />
I have had no issues until today, when suddenly it started saying I was denied access. It is listed under Computer as Local Drive Q: now, rather than saying Q: Microsoft click-to run 2010 (protected)'. When I click on it, I cannot open the drive.<br />
I just googled click-to-run and realise that choosing Q: was probably unfortunate as it means something in relation to click-to-run (I had no idea about what the click-to-run meant, it just appeared that way the first time I mounted the drive, which worked,
 so I didn't think it mattered)<br />
Is the original choice of the Q drive causing the problem here?&nbsp; Is the fact that it no longer says click-to-run a sign of what has happened?<br />
<br />
I have tried mounting the file on a different drive, but I still cannot open it<br />
<br />
Please could I have some help - it would be much appreciated!<br />
<br />
<br />
(This is complicated by the fact I have been having other problems today. Basically,<br />
I used HP Support Assistant to download updates for my laptop, since then I cannot open the devices and printers box - it just hangs and does not populate. I have done system restores, followed instructions from this forum about turning on bluetooth support,
 printer spooling, resetting explorer, but nothing has worked. I have then gone to open this mounted folder and found it doesn't work.<br />
Getting rather stressed about the whole thing.)<br />
<br />
(Running Windows 7 Professional 64 on an HP Probook 4330s)

<p><span>Hi Tina,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In OneDrive for business, items are retained for 93 days from the time you delete them from their original location. Then the documents automatically move to second stage recycle bin where
 they reside for few days and then they are deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If <strong>
Empty Recycle</strong> bin option do not delete all the documents, then you can leave them to delete on its own.</span></p>

<h2>            How to upgrade Outlook on High Sierra without deleting all messages &#34;On my computer&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Mac OS X High Sierra. I just upgraded from an older version of Mac OS X and had to update Microsoft Office because the old version of Outlook 2016 is no longer compatible.<br />
<br />
Now all of the emails stored "On my computer" are gone. How can I get these back? I can use Time Machine if needed. Thanks.

            Exchange. However, the emails I'm trying to save were stored "On my computer," not online (because I ran out of space online).<br />
<br />
I just need to upgrade Outlook without losing all of these emails. Is there a way to do this, or do I need to downgrade from High Sierra, export all of those messages, re-upgrade to High Sierra, and switch to an email program that works better?<br />

<p>Hi WhereAreMyEmails,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my experience, Outlook for Mac won‚Äôt delete the emails that are stored under ‚Äú On my computer‚Äù , &nbsp;I suggest do the following steps to find them out:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>would you please have a look to confirm if you checked the option ‚ÄúHide On my computer folders‚Äù under Outlook&gt; Preference&gt; General. I suggest try to uncheck the checkbox to see if the message will come back.</li><li>If the messages are still missing, we can try to find them by searching in the search bar in your Outlook for Mac.</li></ol>

 that you case be escalated because the agent will not have the power to help you.

</p><p>You cannot use the Product Key provided by the vendor more than once to install Office 2016.&nbsp; It is a Redemption Key and can only be used once. It is also your proof of purchase so keep it safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You reinstall Office from your Office Account at:&nbsp;<a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a>
 You need to sign in with the same email address and password for the Microsoft Account that you used when you first installed your Office. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I would like to share my experience for my nokia 5800. It has code 0575590. Stuck to V30. I tried to updater through NSU but no updates were available. I has a problem of LCD screen flickering and for this I went to Nokia care as I have warrenty left.
 After changing the LCD screen they also updated the firmware to V31. I connected the phone to OVI suite and checked for available update and BINGO!!!! V40 was available for update. Now I have updated to V40 and it is working fantastic. My advise go to Nokia
 care and get your update.</p>

            <p>Your guess is as good as mine. I wish they'd just made a tab for "Display and Print" and then included
<strong>all</strong> the printing options on that tab; as it is, the print options are divided between Display and Advanced: Print. Of course, Advanced: Show document content also includes a lot of "display" options as well. I guess the rationale is that these
 are the "advanced" display and print options.</p>

            Unfortunately, while the text does rotate with the shape in Word 2010, that doesn't work in Word 2007. The only rotatable text in 2007 or earlier is WordArt -- or you can create a box of rotated text in PowerPoint, copy it there, and paste it as a graphic
 into the Word document.<br />

    <title>Lumia 950-Powers off by itself lately - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steelguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950-Powers off by itself lately</h2>
                    <p>Part One:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Lumia 950 smartphone, that I have used successfully for about a year, started shutting off and immediately restarting itself about 3 days ago. It's done this 5 or 6 times. Soft reset does nothing.</p>
<p>HAVE THEY FOUND OUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT AND HOW TO FIX IT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part Two:</p>
<p>I spent close to an hour writing an important email today. It was perfect ! ‚ò∫&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was about 30 seconds from sending it when, out of nowhere, the phone shut down. (and restarted normally)</p>
<p>I expected that&nbsp; a draft copy of my email would be waiting for me. Gone !! No draft.......not in my sent folder........nowhere to be found! Question......Why didn't Outlook save a draft ?? I wouldn't think that this issue would be a Lumia problem as much
 as it might be an Outlook problem but I have no idea......I am NOT high-tech savvy. Is there any way I can recover my draft email?
</p>
<p>I'll never be able to duplicate it.........I'll get close......but I'd rather have the original&nbsp; back !! Thanks in advance for your thoughts on these two issues.</p>

<p>Apparently, the only way you can secure a draft while still editing is to send it to your email to have a copy. With this issue, we would suggest sending your feedback to
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Feedback
</a>page, so this feature of "retrieving unsaved drafts" can be included in future updates of the app.</p>

            I have resolved the issue myself. I used a cleaner and cleaned ALL temp files and cookies, then cleaned my registry. This seemed to fix the games issue as well as my other apps (like Hulu).

            If this isn't a page border it might be one or more graphic objects anchored to the header. Double-click the header area to activate the header/footer view. See if you can click and select one or more "borders." Press the Delete key.

<h2>            Autopopulate Customer Name based on Customer Code data</h2>
                    I am new to Access and I have two tables - one with data tracking changes for specific customers, and one with the customer codes and the customer names on it. I want to be able to input the customer code into the first table and have the company name
 autopopulate. I'm sure this is something super easy, and I'm overlooking something, but I'm stumped!

<div>However, do you really need to see the Customer code? The usual way this is done, is by using a combobox that displays the customer name but stores the code.</div>

<h2>            Recover lost folders in outlook</h2>
                    I have a gmail account which I configured through imap so all my emails appeared in outlook. i also set up outlook folders so I could save the emails there. Stupidly , I "refreshed" my laptop. I then had to reset up the configured account but all the folders
 containing my stored emails have disappeared and I can not see a way to recover them. I have version 2013 . Can these be recovered at all ?

            Hi julieshepherd,
<br />When you did the refresh did you keep your files? 
<br />If so you may be able to find your old outlook OST File under the windows.old folder on C: Find Windows.old highlight the folder make sure you view -Hidden Items- is checked and -file name extensions- (included a screenshot. Do a search for     *.ost       look at the dates I suspect the date of your refresh would be the last date on the old file. Or check your c:/ you may find your new one and an old one. 
<br />Convert it to a PST using a third party tool then you could re add it to your outlook as a personal folder.

<br />I hope this helps

<h2>            Office 365 Business with the New 2016 apps - Install Hangs at 90&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi looking for some assistance please.</p>
<p>Having issues installing Office 365 Business with the New 2016 apps on a new laptop. Operating system is Window 10 64-bit, I have completely disabled AVG Antivirus, stopped the print spooler, run system file checker (no errors found) and removed the install
 each time with the Fix it tools.</p>
<p>Every attempt to install the installation hangs at 90%, though the actual programs seem to be installed and useable?
</p>
<p>I have tried to repair the office install and it reports repair can't be run whilst another install is in progress.

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>You may try the following steps below to check the outcome.<br />
1.Make sure all the versions of Office are fully uninstalled with fix it tool or manually.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description I understand that you have an issue the start screen being unresponsive in Windows 10 technical preview 10122 and issue persisted even when restored back to build 10074(there is no build as 10077). We apologize for the unhandiness
 caused to you. This could have been caused due to corrupted files installed on the computer, or user profile might be corrupted and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better I would like to know the details below</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>What is the network adapter you are using?</li><li>Do you get any error message/code? If yes, mention the complete error message/code.</li></ol>
<p><span>Hence you have mentioned in the issue description that you have restored back to build 10074 and you have the same issue. Let‚Äôs try performing the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Run <strong><span>System File Checker </span></strong>is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> <em>The above article holds good to Windows 10 technical preview also.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists then </span><span>I suggest you go ahead and use the ISO image for the installation of build 10074.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for helping, I've begun the troubleshooting steps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo X220 laptop, originally Win7, then 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under network adapters I see:</p>
<p>Bluetooth Device (personal Area Network)</p>
<p>Bluetooth Device (RFCOMM Protocol TDI)</p>
<p>Intel(R) 82579 Gigabit Network Connection</p>
<p>Intel(R) Centrino(R) Advanced-N 6205</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not getting any error messages per se, my start menu just doesn't work (I can right click on it and do various things), my bluetooth mouse is not working, and the desktop resolution has changed (to big icons etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>bluetooth mouse is working just needed to repair it</p>
<p>

            also, I made an image of the ISO for 10074 on a dvd and tried to boot from it and I get an error message that says it can't read or install from a file that isn't NTFS, so did I not create the ISO dvd correctly?

</p><p>If you're using Build 10122, you must know the problems with the Start screen!&nbsp; Because everyone else knows about the problems!</p>

            <p>yes i was aware of the potential problems with it before I installed the new build, I can't help myself,</p>
<p>
</p><p>good news is I created a different (the correct) kind of ISO disk and now I"ve got 10074 back on my machine and the start menu on it is better than it was before I installed 10122, so that's good</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I lost some programs and files, I'm sure I can root around in windows.old and find them maybe....wish me luck!</p>
