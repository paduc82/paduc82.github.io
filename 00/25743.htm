    <title>Graphics Card not Recognized Even After Trying all Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Graphics Card not Recognized Even After Trying all Drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my NVIDIA Geforce 9600M graphics card shows up as Basic Microsoft Display Adapter in Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview and the vendor does not say NVIDIA. I've downloaded and tried to install all the graphics drivers relevant to my graphics card from the
 Geforce website but the installation always fails. Has anyone faced a similar problem and managed to solve it? I've searched all the threads on this forum but none of the solutions have worked for me. I'm running Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview on a 2009 MacBook
 Pro because the Mac Operating System was accidentally deleted permanently and I don't have an install or recovery disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and time.</p>

            You would want to also upgrade the notebooks' format to 2010 to take advantage of certain features that only work in 2010 format notebooks, unless you are still using OneNote 2007 to access those notebooks from another computer. To upgrade the notebook
 right click on the notebook name and click Properties, then click Convert to 2010.

<h2>            fixmyregistry.exe</h2>
                    can someone tell me how to remove this virus/malware ... whenever I use the uninstall in control panel then as part of uninstall this software INSTALLS (or virus/malware in system) installs the SPEEDMYPC.EXE.<br />
When I uninstall SPEEDMTYPC (through control panel) it installs FIXMYREGISTRY.EXE<br />
<br />
Windows security doesn't detect this as a threat and neither does the malicious software removal see it as a threat.<br />
<br />
There are web instructions on how to remove it but are not from any known trusted source.<br />
<br />
DOes microsoft / windows have anything to remove this ?<br />

            <p>Thank you for the response - My findings:</p>
<p>1) The AdwCleaner was installed but it didn't remove the SpeedUpMyPC or FixMyRegistry issue - it didn't report anything (subsequently uninstalled it)</p>
<p>2) Had already tried Malwarebytes earlier and didn't use this procedure</p>
<p>3) Tried the Junkware Removal Tool - It "found" the offending files / folders / and registry entries for SpeedUpMyPC and removed them.</p>
<p>.....Since SpeedUpMyPC works in tandem with FixMyRegistry, namely whenever I used the COntrol Panel to delete SpeedUpMyPC, it would remove SpeedUpMyPC and then siently install FixMyRegistry in it's place.&nbsp; The reverse would happen if I tried Uninstalling
 FixMyRegistry.</p>
<p>.....Once SpeedUpMyPC was removed, I searched the registry for FixMyRegistry and found 3 instances, and removed them manually (especially the ones in Startup).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) Didn't bother with Hitman Pro as my problem appears solved.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Wanted to give the details for anyone else encountering this problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank You So Very Much </p>

<div>I have been using the outlook service for my domain for the past 3-4 months. So far I have had no problem with sending and receiving emails. However since the past 48 hours I am not being able to receive any emails.<br />

Upon going to domains.live.com using my administrator account, I see a warning message saying you need to prove the owenership of your domain. Although my DNS records looked all fine, I still deleted them and re-entered the required records. However I am still
 getting the message and not being able to receive emails.<br />
<br />
I request you to kindly look into the problem.</div>

    <title>Why the enormous growth in file size from compatibility mode to Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galahad72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why the enormous growth in file size from compatibility mode to Word 2013&#63;</h2>
                    This concerns a file that began PDF life at <b>5</b> MB. It has a lot of math, logic symbols and some diagrams, and the symbols weren't unicode in the originating wordprocessor. Acrobat exported the file to DOCX as
<b>10</b> MB.&nbsp;Opened and saved in Compatibility Mode in Word 2013, the file remained at
<b>10</b> MB.&nbsp;Converted to Word 2013 and saved, it became <b>82</b> MB.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've gone through the process 3 times. What could account for the enormous size increase, especially when compared with the next test?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A second file was converted. It was a PDF that this time originated as a scan. As a DOCX export from Acrobat it was
<b>5.6</b> MB. After being converted from Compatibility Mode in Word 2013, it grew to only&nbsp;<b>6.5</b> MB. Yet it too has considerable math.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. Despite taking a long time to load, the first file scrolls fast through its 1100 pages.</div>
                </div>

            It looks as though the large growth in file size is to be expected, though the math and diagrams add extra. I took a second file that originated in another wordprocessor and not as a scan. It was
<b>5.2</b> MB exported from Acrobat as DOCX. After being converted to Word 2013 from Compatibility Mode, the size grew to
<b>18.4</b> MB. This time there was no math and no diagrams. As Suzanne points out
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/getting-the-best-pdf-import-retain-page-layout-or/f91ea184-004c-4784-b577-3c1003ce158e">
in another thread</a>, a PDF could be opened directly by Word 2013. When I did it with this PDF, the resulting file was
<b>5.0</b> MB instead of <b>18.4</b>.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My PDF from scans wouldn't open directly because of errors. That's not really a loss, since even if it had opened, it would not have been searchable, just an image. But did it need to become&nbsp;<b>82</b> MB in Word 2013 as opposed to
<b>10</b> in Compatibility Mode?</div>

            Hi Michaelfranklin105,
<br />
<br />I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />When did you last sign into your inbox? If it's been over a year ago, unfortunately, Microsoft will close your account.
<br />
<br />Please see this section of Microsoft's service agreement:
<br />
<br />"ii. Account Use. You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a five-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account. You must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you. You must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account. If we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership. Based 
<br />
<br />From here:

            Not good news, unfortunately. In their service agreement Microsoft goes on to say:
<br />
<br />"iv. Closing Your Account.
<br />1. You can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason. To close your Microsoft account, please visit <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618278</a>. When you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60-days just in case you change your mind. After that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed. Logging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.
<br />2. If your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen. First, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately. Second, we’ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you). You should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won’t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed. Third, you may lose access to products you’ve acquired.?

            That's a really old reference that hasn't been necessary anymore for many versions. Uncheck it. Debug &gt; Compile and you will likely find everything still works just fine.

<h2>            editing pictures etc publisher 2013 vs 2016</h2>
                    <p>So I upgraded to Office 2016 from Office 2013 and I noticed something odd in Publisher. &nbsp;In Publisher 2013 if I edit a preview of the changes shows up in the main document which is really nice (see lemonade cocktail in &nbsp;the first picture.) &nbsp;In Publisher
 2016 I can still edit the pictures but no nice preview in the large document is given. (refer to the lemonade cocktail in the second picture) &nbsp;Is that the way it works now or do I need to change some kind of setting? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi, the functionality you are describing is called Live Preview, and Live Preview has been removed from Publisher 2016. This was an intentional change and not a bug, so your Publisher 2016 is behaving normally.

<p>
</p><p>I have an office 365 account from school stevens.edu.&nbsp; I first set it up to forward to my personal gmail&nbsp;address.&nbsp; I did not like this so I disabled it. However, my stevens.edu emails are still being forwarded to my gmail.&nbsp; I have checked my gmail&nbsp;settings
 under Accounts and Import and my stevens email is not there. I checked the settings in Outlook.&nbsp; Forwarding is disabled and there are no rules. It's driving me crazy because no where in either gmail&nbsp;or my outlook settings is forwarding my outloook emails enabled
 but for some reason it keeps forwarding them to my gmail.&nbsp; How do I make this stop???</p>

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />You can validate if you have any inbox rules configured in any configured desktop Outlook application.
<br />If not, I suggest you contact the administrator of your organization and be the one who validates the mail flow to identify which rule is still executing.
<br />Also if you made the recent change I recommend you wait at least 24 hours because the changes in Office 365 delay propagate on occasion.
<br />
<br />I hope it will be very helpful.
<br />Let me know.
<br />
<br />Greetings Dayamis

            First couple times I did try without any installed programs, drivers for peripherals, and anything I do it just don't wan't to install, it go fine when it first download it, getting ready to install, then it install at windows up to 100%, and ask to restart,
 well I restart, and then it start to install, go to 30% reboot, and continue install up 42% it stays long time on there, then it go fast up to 55%, and then back to 45%, it stays again long time on there, and reboot and tells you it will put back your old
 version.

<p>Where your Install is failing seems to be when The video driver has just installed at least that is when it does on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I say this is until the 42 % my screen is only using about 70% of the screen and after the Install starts moving forward again it is using 100% of the Screen.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Undo&#34; &#38; &#34;Redo&#34; buttons constantly grayed-out in Excel 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Recently upgraded to Office 2010 from Office 2003 running on Windows XP.</p>
<p>In Excel 2010 whenever I click outside the cell being edited the "undo"&nbsp;button grays-out and I loose all ability to&nbsp;undo any previous changes.&nbsp; As long as I don't click outside the cell being edited the undo button is active and will undo any changes...as
 long as I don't click on another cell.&nbsp; The second I click on another cell the undo button goes gray and I loose all ability to undo my changes.&nbsp; I have also tried CTRL+Z to undo and that too is inactive once I click on a new cell.&nbsp; I had this identical problem
 with Excel 2003 and was hoping that the upgrade to 2010 whould fix the issue, but apparently it simply carried over to the 2010 version.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and the reinstalled Office 2010 with no change.&nbsp; I have checked Access 2010, Word 2010, Outlook 2010&nbsp;and
 PowerPoint 2010 and the problem <strong>does not</strong> occur on&nbsp;those Office 2010 products.</p>
<p>I have looked through all the settings and options in Excel and wasn't able to find any setting that may affect this.&nbsp; I have also searched for solutions online with little success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help, tips or ideas on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Tivanoyo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update. Yes, my theory was that because apps from Microsoft Store runs in a Sandbox, the instance of the files were separate and that was why you wasn't able to see them via File Explorer and only the app itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, we're glad to hear that the issue was resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<p>Hi Tivanoyo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the updated videos. We notice that your Excel version writes Version 1810 (Build 11001.20108 Microsoft Store). However, using an Office 365 work/school account usually installs a Click to Run build and not a Microsoft Store build, as seen below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26b1727d-f4ae-4109-9efa-b04c3109e225?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26b1727d-f4ae-4109-9efa-b04c3109e225?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm how did you install Office? Was it from the Microsoft Store as the build suggests? If so, we would like you to try and uninstall this build and install it via the steps below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2019
 on a PC or Mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing it from the portal should help you install the Click-to-Run build that we have here, so that we can see if this is caused by a different build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<h2>            Report or list of all formulas used in an Access Database</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am trying to find a way to see all my formulas in an Access database.&nbsp; I have tried playing around with the Database documenter to no avail.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My need to see all the formulas is to better explain to a new developer what is going on and my hope is that I do not have to "recreate" all of them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way or a report that I can create that would give me all the formulas?&nbsp; Maybe pulling something from the VBA?&nbsp; (I am not a developer...).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Wayne,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the input...&nbsp; I did this already and it shows the "SQL"&nbsp;in the formulas.&nbsp; I was just hoping that there was a way to pull out all the expressions that did not involve me having to go through the Word doc and pulling them out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand that any developer should know how to do this but I am at the beginning stages of maybe working with a new developer and was trying to show them the "flow" of all the calculations.&nbsp; Since there are over 300 unique equations, I wanted to give
 him a sense of what is to come.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I did follow the instructions in the article. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there is nothing in this article that speaks to "disabling" the services, as you suggest. &nbsp;This article only addresses "Add or change research services."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, some services (Microsoft) cannot be unchecked. &nbsp;(Have you tried it?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find NO WAY to disable the Research Pane, as you suggest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More suggestions please.</p>

<h2>            Bing Rewards 25&#40;&#63;&#41;  Digit Gift Card Code</h2>
                    <p>Bing has a Reward wherein after collecting 1000 credits, you can get $10 off on the Microsoft store. I reached the 1000 credit goal and got the confirmation email with an "Order Confirmation" number and a "Gift Code" number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After attempting to purchase something and redeem the gift code, I discovered that the "Gift Code" had insufficient digits. Gift Cards should have a 25 digit code, but the code given to me through Bing was only 9 digits, and thus I could not purchase what
 I wanted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I should do with the Bing Rewards "Gift Code" number so I can redeem my $10? So far, I have not been able to find out what it is I have to do with this code to redeem it.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#34;Attach File&#34; menu not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed Office 2016 and really like the "Attach File" concept, with the menu offering recently edited files. However, in my install, the menu drops down and immediately "rolls back up, not allowing me to select a file for insertion. I am able to
 drag and drop a file to insert it into a menu, but can no longer use the ribbon button/dropdown menu to do so.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Office 365 apps to no avail.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Change default settings for drill down details from Pivot Table</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to change the default settings for the drill down information that you get from pivot tables?&nbsp; It's default format is a blue table that does not auto-fit columns.&nbsp; My preference would be to have th drill down detail show as just a normal range.&nbsp;
 I have seen spreadsheets that have this where VBA wasn't used but I am not sure how to do it.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

                    <p>B"H</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest Skye for Desktop version (8.27.0.85), Windows 7 with all updates installed. I have checked the "Automatically start Skype" and "Start Skype in background" option in the General settings. I experience two problems:</p>
<p>1. Skype starts automatically, but does not sign me in till I press the Skype icon in the taskbar.</p>
<p>2. Sometimes Skype gets stuck when I press the icon in the taskbar and doesn't sign me in.</p>
<p>When I unchecked "Start Skype in background" automatic sign in did work.</p>
<p>What I want is a working automatic sign in while opening in the background. Can this be done? Is there a bug here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, Dovid.</p>

            Hi, debresser 
<br />
<br />You can uninstall and install the new version again, if these do not work, you can try to reinstall the Classic version, which was extended until a new warning, I hope you can solve the problem.

</p><p>Yes, I saw the advice to re-install on forums, and tried that before posting. Didn't work. But thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing an old version would of course solve "my" problem, but not "the" problem. Apart from the fact that for various reasons I prefer to always use the most recent version of programs.</p>

            Ok I understand why I told you to uninstall the current version and reinstall, if this did not work, install the Classic version, the new version has some problems that are still being corrected.

    <title>How to cancel a subscription if I cannot access my billing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to cancel a subscription if I cannot access my billing information&#63;</h2>
                    Right can you please help me with this it is very annoying considering I am being made to pay for subscriptions I don't want and cannot afford because of this **** up system. When I go to my subscriptions to cancel the music pass, I'm sure as you know
 you are required to enter a security code which is sent to you in an email but the email address you are sending the code to is not my email address therefore I cannot enter the code and also I am gonna be seriously **** pissed off if my account gets locked
 or something for the 30 days as the Xbox one is coming out in like 19 days and I would quite like to have my account, thankyou.
