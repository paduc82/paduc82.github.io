            Hi ORV_HYB,<br />
<br />
Based on my experience, I suggest you check with the attendee if he has <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-9684b670-7588-4eea-8717-9e5799047540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 the following information for further investigation:<br />
1. When did the organizer/attendee notice this issue? Right after deploying Exchange hybrid in your organization?<br />
2. Since you are in Exchange hybrid deployment, may I confirm where the organizer and attendee’s mailboxes are homed? Are they using Exchange Online service or On-premises Exchange service?<br />
3. Could you reproduce the issue if the organizer creates a recurring meeting with another attendee? Also, what if another user creates a recurring meeting and invites this specific attendee? By asking so, I’d like to confirm if the issue just occurs between
 this organizer and attendee.<br />
4. If the organizer creates a normal meeting with this attendee, does the issue persist?<br />
5. Please provide us with the .msg file of auto-accepted email from the organizer’s side and the auto-forwarded email from the recipient side for further analysis. To save an email as .msg file in the Outlook client, just drag it to the desktop. For privacy
 concern, you can provide the .msg file via the private message below:<br />

            <p>Hi ORV_HYB,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the detailed updates.<br />
<br />
With an Exchange-based hybrid deployment, you can choose to either move on-premises Exchange mailboxes to the Exchange Online organization or move Exchange Online mailboxes to the Exchange organization. Thus, I wonder if you mean those 70 mailboxes were just
 moved to Exchange Online by saying ‘they’re all migrated to Exchange Hybrid’. If not, please specify the situation for our better understanding. Also, could you let me know how you moved those mailboxes? For your reference:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/o365e_hrcmoverequest_fl312271%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/o365e_hrcmoverequest_fl312271%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Moreover, please help us clarify the following information for further troubleshooting:<br />
1. May I confirm if the other users set up delegates for their mailboxes in Outlook?
<br />
2. Does the issue occur to the rest of the 69 users if they create a recurring meeting with other users who were ‘migrated to Exchange Hybrid’?<br />
3. Are those affected mailboxes all user mailboxes or some of them are resource mailboxes like room mailboxes?<br />
4. About the .msg files, I’m really sorry for my mistake and I have changed my setting in private message to allow attachments. Please check to see if you can upload the example emails now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your updates.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam<br />

            Hi ORV_HYB,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
I have checked the example emails and have a better understanding of the situation now.
<br />
<br />
However, I’m a bit confused about the recipients who receive the forwarded emails. From the emails you provided, it seems the users who get the forwarded emails are also mailboxes that were just moved to Exchange Online, right? Anyway, as the issue can always
 be reproduced whoever (among the rest of the 69 users) the affected user sends a recurring meeting invitation to, I’d like to confirm if there are any similarities among the recipients who receive the forwarded invitations when inviting different users to
 a recurring meeting.<br />
<br />
Also, I’d like to confirm where the affected user created the recurring meeting, in the Outlook desktop client or
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>? Does the issue persist if he directly creates the recurring event in OWA?
<br />

            Hi ORV_HYB,<br />
<br />
Thanks for getting back to us. <br />
<br />
About the similarities among the recipients who receive the forwarded invitations, I just want to confirm if they are always forwarded to the same or a set of users (within the 69 migrated users). To be more specific, let’s say user A is the affected user and
 user B, user C and user D are three other migrated users:<br />
1. When user A sends a recurring event to user B, will this invitation always be forwarded to user C or user D? If not, is it randomly forwarded? You can schedule some recurring events with the same user to find out if there are any clues.
<br />
2. As I see in the example emails provided, some of the invitations are forwarded back to the affected user (user A) while some others are forwarded to other recipients? Is that the case?<br />
Appreciate if you can perform more tests to see if we can find some clues (whether the invitations will always be forwarded to certain users) from this part as the issue is a bit uncommon from my perspective.
<br />
<br />
Since you also mentioned the differences between the account, could you specify if there are any differences between the affected account and the others (especially in mailbox permissions) prior to the hybrid move?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sam <br />

    <title>Office 2013 not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mp jones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 not updating</h2>
                    When I first bought Office 2013 Home and Business, I was using Windows 8 as a different user than I am now. Mainly because I created a new user with Outlook instead of Live. I have given my system a minor overhaul and reinstalled Windows 8 and decided
 to take a look at Windows 8.1. Although, I have noticed that Office 2013 will not automatically update itself as it should do.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My build version is 15.0.443.1508 but if you look at the latest updates for Office 2013 in July the build is different from mine. I have checked all the files which have been updated and it looks as though nothing has been updated. For example,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MSOIDCLIL.DLL version is 7.250.4424.0 whereas the update is 7.250.4551.0</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the case or everything within office 2013 has not been updated. Surly this hasn't anything to do with the fact that at the time I registered Office 2013 I was using a different profile. I have signed in as the profile used at the point of registration
 as well and this doesn't poll updates either. I have tried all the all the fixes to get the updates to poll but it doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only other way that I can update is to do everything manually which is a pain in the backside because there are quite a lot of updates since the initial release of Office 2013.</div>
                </div>

            Hello all,
<div><br />
<div>[<b>RESOLVED</b>]</div>
<div><br />
<div>As an IT Technician you'd think I would know all the answers, but in fact at times we also get stuck in the mud and have to work our way backwards to try and resolve what caused the problem in the first place. I have been faultfinding for 18 years, and
 I am still learning... Although, now and again we all fall flat on our face and get stuck. Then all of the sudden the penny drops, As you bring your finger and thumb to make a letter
<b>"L"</b> bring your hand to your forehead and bend backwards whilst uttering the words. Looser. or you could just go D'oh! you idiot of course I never thought that this would be the cause of the problems I have been experiencing. Now I have resolved this
 matter I need to explain to everybody else why this is happening and how to avoid it from happening again.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b><u>IMPORTANT!</u></b></div>
<div><b><i>DON'T BOTHER WASTING YOUR TIME IN RUNNING THE REPAIR BECAUSE IT WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE INSTALLATION. IT WILL NOT UPDATE IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED OFFICE 2013 FROM AN ISO.</i>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div><b>What is the cause...?</b></div>
<div>Under no circumstances must you make your <b>MS Office 2013</b> into and <b>
ISO </b>and then load the software from the <b>ISO </b>to your PC. Why? you may be asking... Well that is a good question and one which I shall gladly explain. If you are a good moral citizen and you have legally obtained a copy of Office 2013 via means of
 purchasing or could be a complimentary copy for services rendered. Within your Office account you have the option of downloading the software and then burning this onto a disc. Or you can just download and then install Office 2013 directly to your PC and then
 run the installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you turn office 2013 installation into an ISO it will render the software incapable of running updates after the software has been installed. why does this happen. The only thing that I can think, is either the installation has become corrupt for some...
 or the installation assumes the software you're installing is illegal and will not update. Although, the installation allowed the registration key which is provided for you when you download the software to burn on a Disc. I personally think that the ISO was
 the main cause of the fault. It installs fine... but does not update after the installation is completed.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>What should you do...?</b></div>
<div>Office 2013 isn't a massive installation. It doesn't take that long to download, and even shorter to install. I would highly recommend, if you are reinstalling your OS and you are at the point of installing Office 2013. Log into your account and download
 the installation files and then run the installation directly from your PC. Once the installation has been completed. It will take a few minutes to go through all the updates. Once the installation has been completed, check the build by opening MS Word and
 then go to your account and look at the build N# it should now all be up to date and working correctly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tested this with an ISO and Dsic and both came back with the same results, as they wouldn't update. Again, either the download or install files are corrupt when they are copied to a disc or made into an ISO? If you download and then install directly
 from your PC it works fine. Even though MS are happy for you to burn this software to a disc to make the installation process easier. For some reason, and I would state this could be the same for a few other people who have done the same as me, by making the
 install files into an ISO. The software becomes corrupt. Which doesn't make any sense at all. Because if the software was compromised then it wouldn't install the software...? And I can assure you it wouldn't accept the install key either. Therefore, it can
 be argued the software wasn't corrupt, it is down to something else that is causing the updates to be ignored.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We could go on and on for hours fulling scenarios out of the air until sundown. The fact of the matter, the cause of the problem is simple.
<b><u>DO NOT</u></b> burn to a disc. <b><u>DO NOT</u></b> make an <b><u>ISO</u> </b>
and <b><u>DO NOT</u></b> install the software from either or the software just won't update. Who is at fault here, and who is to blame...?</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>The Bottom Line...</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Download Office 2013 directly from your account.</li><li>Install Office 2013 directly from your PC.</li><li>You don't need a licence key for Office 2013 when downloaded directly.</li><li>Once the installation has completed, it will update Office 2013.</li><li>When the installation has completed, check the build.</li><li>The default build is 15.0.443.1508 if this N# is higher it has been updated.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>Below is what it should look like once the software has been updated correctly. If you're installation is like this after it has finished installing. Then the updates have been applied. If the Number is still showing as 15.0.443.1508 then this is the default
 version and no updates have been applied.</div>

            When you use Exchange server mailboxes, users should only be able to send on behalf of another address if they have send on behalf permissions. If they have the right permissions on a mailbox, they can send as or send on behalf of that mailbox.  You need to check the permissions on each mailbox. 
<br />
<br />I'll check gpo to see if there is a policy for outlook - I think you could disable the from button, but should not if the users have more than one account in their profile.

            To remove send on behalf permissions, you can use powershell:
<br />This removes permissions for a specific user from a specific mailbox:
<br />Set-Mailbox "mailbox name" -GrantSendOnBehalfTo @{remove="user"}
<br />
<br />This removes specific users from all mailboxes:
<br />Get-Mailbox | Set-Mailbox -GrantSendOnBehalfTo @{remove="user1","user2"}
<br />As you can see from the examples, if you want to remove multiple users, use a comma separated list, otherwise, use a single user. 
<br />
<br />You can hide the from field in outlook using group policy - i don't recommend doing this if the user ha more than one mailbox in their profile.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>None of the users have sent on behalf permissions in Exchange and that's the reason they are not able to send on behalf from OWA but they can do it from MS Office outlook app.</p>
<p>How do I do restrict that?</p>

            You can disable the From button using a command id and group policy. The Command ID is 1867.
<br />
<br />See  my article for the steps:

<br />
<br />
<br />Note that if there are already 2 accounts in the profile, the key won't work - you can't hide the from field.  With one account, the button is grayed out so the from is not accessible.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7d0e63d-415a-4eae-a9bb-fa50ed8d34d5?upload=true" />

            Do you use log on scripts? You can use a logon script to set this key (for outlook 2016/2019/365):
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\DisabledCmdBarItemsList
<br />"TCID1"="1867"
<br />
<br />If you use group policy, you can use the office group policy templates to set it up.  The setting is under Outlook 2016 &gt; Disable items in the user interface &gt; custom. Enter 1867 as the ID value. 
<br />The administrative templates are here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>

<p>Outlook does not play any part in the sync process. That is under the control&nbsp;of the sync software in use.</p>
<p>You should check in the appropriate Apple forum. Knowing whether you are using 32 or 64bit Outlook is also going to be relevant. Not everything supports 64bit.</p>

<h2>            Font Color&#47;Size&#47;Style Changes As I&#39;m Typing.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for a while and is very annoying and time consuming, having to keep changing the font before I send my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am typing the font changes colors usually after a line brake/paragraph</p>
<p>I have the color&nbsp;set to black but it changes to gray or purple every single time.</p>
<p>Some times after the second line brake/paragraph the font size will get real small, or&nbsp;change style.</p>
<p>When I am done with writing I have to highlight the whole email&nbsp;to change the color, size, and style so its all the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this, or&nbsp;can I&nbsp;remove the formatting to make it stop doing this? &nbsp;If there's no formatting, then it can't do this. right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is&nbsp;so annoying I am thinking about using another email service, I don't want to because I really like outlook.com email service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>It doesn't do this when I use my iPhone, iPod touch or iPad mini.</p>
<p>I guess they use the their own default font, or no formatting?</p>
<p>I have another Outlook.com account and its doing the same on that account</p>
<p>I even tried from my work on three of&nbsp;their computers, one was an Apple iMac&nbsp;and it did the same.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is the issue I'm currently experiencing whereby as I type an email in Outlook, the ability to tap on either bold or italics* throws the cursor into the address box (to whomever I'm sending the email!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, this is coincident with copy and paste of images from other tabs/browsers not actually pasting successfully into the body of the mail itself; I right click to 'paste' and... nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* If I go back to a word or phrase that I want to emphasize with bold or italics, by going back to that section and highlighting-then-clicking the B or
<em>I </em>icons, then it works but this is laborious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only been an issue this week and is unrelated to the device I'm using, nor is it browser related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>H.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Today I'm found out that the trick also working for my friend's Nokia 6290 (s40 5rd): I connected the phone first time with firmware installed v10.10 and Nokia Suite is working O.K. except the usb modem. I had to try "Nokia Win10 Test Drivers" and&nbsp;the
 modem&nbsp;successfully got to work! But once I upgraded the firmware to v10.65 I found out that the solution is stopped working then I changed modem driver to HUAWEI and it started working fine.

            You have to create a "Batch" file, file type <span style="font-weight: bold">
.bat</span><br />
<br />
For instance <span style="font-weight: bold">MyBat.bat<br />
</span><br />
You create<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>it with <span style="font-weight: bold">
notepad.<br />
<br />
</span>A<span style="font-weight: bold"> .</span>bat file contains<span style="font-weight: bold"> commands</span>, at least one.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>The command for starting programs is (surprise !): <span style="font-weight: bold">
start<br />
<br />
</span>Parameters are <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;program&gt;</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">
&lt;file to open&gt;,</span> for instance:<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
start &lt;program&gt; &lt;file to open&gt;<br />
<br />
</span>In your case:<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
start notepad.exe may.txt<br />
<br />
</span>This variant only works with notepad and if may.txt is in the same folder as the .bat file.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>For other programs and files you need a full path, similar to<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
<br />
</span>C:/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Documents/may.txt<br />
<br />
Tip: you can get the paths easily (in W7) by navigating to the path with explorer, right click the path at the top and select copy (to the clipboard).<br />
<br />
For testing start the MyBat.bat by double click in explorer.<br />

<h2>            Can receive but not send emails from Outlook 2016</h2>
                    I have a PC and Outlook 2016.&nbsp; On Outlook 2016, I have four email accounts set up. Up until a week ago, I could send and receive successfully from all 4.&nbsp; A week ago, my outlook.com account stopped letting me send message (I can still receive).&nbsp; I get
 "This message could not be sent. You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified user. Error is [0x80070005-0x000004dc-0x00000524]."&nbsp; I have deleted the account and re-enabled it but that didn't work.

<p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error message usually occurs when you don't have Send As permissions for the shared mailbox. We suggest granting Send As permission to the user for the shared mailbox, and configuring the shared
 mailbox. Kindly check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3045224/can-t-send-an-email-message-when-full-access-permission-is-granted-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>for the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. This issue would also occur if your email and the recipient's email were hosted on the same mail server before migration. We would like to know if you've already tried sending an email message using Outlook on web, and check if
 the issue persists. You may also try these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Create a new message instead of replying to emails directly.</p>
<p>Method 2: Clear the auto-complete cache, then manually type the recipient's email address when replying to emails.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Outlook, click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Mail</strong>.</li><li>Under Send Messages, click <strong>Empty Auto-Complete List</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li></ol>

If all else fails, us the WDRT&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/windows-device-recovery-tool-faq and then restore from your usual auto-backup.<br />

            ...actually the pass code your mobile is asking is for the bluetooth that you are trying to pair with your mobile e.g. bluetooth headset…<br />
<br />
...read your bluetooth device manual and I’m very sure that the pass code is written there…

            Thanks for your information. I find my passcode is 0000. Actually I am having my old Bluetooth HS-36W which I was paird with my previous Nokia N70, now my new mobile is Nokia 6300, I have seen from Nokia site that this Bluetooth headset will not support
 6300. This could be the reason I can't able to pair. Thanks for your advice.

    <title>Product key expired - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eileenheggelund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product key expired</h2>
                    <p>I purchased and installed&nbsp;Office 2013 for Home and Business in Sept. 2013. I have a Dell laptop running Windows 7. All of a sudden, today, Sept. 28, 2014 I am unable to open&nbsp;my Word or Excel files.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;tried going to they Quick Repair feature which gave me an Error Code 30145-13. Then I tried the online repair method which gave me an Error code 30145-4.</p>
<p>I then contacted Tech support at which time I was informed that my product key was "expired"??? and my problem cannot be solved. I did not receive an installation&nbsp; disc therefore I cannot uninstall and reinstall the software. I am told that the only way
 to access my files again is to purchase another Office Suite. I don't believe I should be forced to do that. I was not told that the product key would expire when I purchased the software.&nbsp;Has anyone else had this problem and gotten resolution?</p>

<p>Trial licenses expire, as do office365 licenses (monthly, yearly,) which are subscription based.</p>

            <p>Hi hotsauce02,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm Laurentiu, a software engineer from the OneNote Ink team. I just checked your version number and it looks like you need to update OneNote to get the fix to your problem. The version that contains the fix is: 16.0.4327.1000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it looks like you installed the app via MSI, you can get this update via windows update. The link below should point you to the windows update page:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Update-Office-with-Microsoft-Update-f59d3f9d-bd5d-4d3b-a08e-1dd659cf5282?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Update-Office-with-Microsoft-Update-f59d3f9d-bd5d-4d3b-a08e-1dd659cf5282?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-IE&amp;ad=IE</a>

    <title>Word 2011 skips line numbering between pages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2011 skips line numbering between pages</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"incorrect line numbers"</div>
Word 2011 for Mac seems to have issues with continuous line numbering. It skips lines between pages - sometimes two lines, sometimes 30. I've opened the same document in an older version of Word and it does not have any problems. I was under the impression
 line numbering did not count anything in the headers and footers. This could explain a few missing lines, but jumps from line 55 to line 83 do not make sense. Any advice on how to get this to work properly in Word 2011?

            I'm not qualified to get into the "whys &amp; wherefores" re the revision of the behavior, but I believe the simplest &amp; most immediate solution is to avoid using the Final Showing Markup view of the tracked changes. Change to one of the other options (such
 as Original Showing Markup) &amp; see if the Line Numbering doesn't cooperate.<br />
<br />
I understand the logic because the deletions are still contained in the document flow until those changes are accepted/rejected. However, the deleted lines are being displayed in the balloons rather than in the text flow. My gripe is that interruption of the
 numbering does not occur at the actual point of the deletions :-) If it did work that way [IMHO] it would be ideal. Having the interruption occur at the next page break while the numbering at the spot of the deletion remains sequential is what I find to be
 a very misleading flaw.<br />
<br />

            Try adding line numbers to the original document before enabling track changes. Otherwise, Word will number the deleted lines but, since they don't show in Balloon view, there will be a skip in numeration.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Why is Word numbering the deleted lines, if they don't show? Because it tries to be consistent by showing the same line numbers for all visible lines for a given view (in this case, Final Showing Markup), whether the deleted lines are visible or not. In
 this way, all line numbers will be the same for that view, whether you use Balloons or not.</div>

<h2>            Scoring system for radio buttons</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to create a survey with Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree options and score them appropriately 1-5. Is there a way to combine the radio button function with an automatic scoring function so the sample audience 1) have their individual scores averaged
 i.e. this person scored 3.7 / 5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and 2) is there a method of building the spread sheet so that I can input data and get averages for the question so I know where to look in terms of bringing about change?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There would be other beneficial features I could discuss later, but these are the key areas. There are 44 questions with about 10 of them proposed as a negative, meaning the scoring would have to be in reverse, any suggestions there would be most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone out there provides a service I'm willing to looking that too. I'm recently self-employed and need to spend more time winning work rather than learning more excel skills right now.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
I don't know if separate applications like Papyrus or AquaCalendar can do it, but check them out (you can locate them through, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.my-symbian.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.my-symbian.com</a> and the S60 3rd Edition application catalog there).

<h2>            emails not fully loading in Outlook</h2>
                    The problem began last week in Hotmail and is now worse than before.&nbsp; Emails when opened partially load.&nbsp; Most pictures are just red x and Outlook is much, much slower than Hotmail ever was.&nbsp; Clicking "show picture" does nothing.&nbsp; Virus scans and spyware

    <title>Microsoft Office Default Font on Mac &#38; HTML Email Signatures on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Default Font on Mac &#38; HTML Email Signatures on Microsoft Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if anyone has come across the two below issues and how you managed to rectify them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Updating default font for Microsoft Office 2016 on Mac 10.12 Sierra (when users are installed as part of a Company). Default font is reset in applications such as Outlook, Excel and Word to Arial but on each users restart, the font defaults back to Calibri.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Secondly, installing HTML email signatures on Microsoft Outlook 2016 on Mac 10.12 Sierra. Have tried the various apps on the market and other email signature builders but the font and colour is changing as soon as the signature is installed in Outlook.
 Tried soooo many different things but our IT company are adamant that we need to revert back to a plain text e-sig.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure we are not the only ones suffering from these issues!<br />
</p>
<p>Has anyone got any suggestions? Thank you!<br />
</p>

    <title>Why is the text color in my document not recognized by my printer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maureena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the text color in my document not recognized by my printer&#63;</h2>
                    Is this a printer problem or a setup issue with Microsoft Word 2007? I have green text in my document and a print preview in Word looks correct. But when I go to print the document on my Canon printer, the preview there shows the text as black. I tried
 some different things with style sets/colors and finally got the text in both the Word and the printer print previews to be green, but now my inserted pictures are Ok in Word, but have a greenish cast in the print preview. I have also inserted a watermark,
 which is green, and shows up as green in both print previews.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This leads me to believe that I am doing something wrong with setting the style sets or colors under styles incorrectly, but I'm not sure what it is. Now I have things so messed up that I can't get the green color out of the inserted pictures, even when
 I start with a blank document and redo everything. How do I get back to where I started? I can live with the text always being black if I can get my pictures fixed.</div>

            <blockquote>I was having this exact problem.&nbsp; I googled and your question came up.&nbsp; I don't know if you've fixed the problem or not, but I did!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I, too, thought it was word, NOT the printer.&nbsp; I also know how to change from color to B&amp;W, etc.&nbsp; However, I found something in the "Advanced" tab under printer properties.&nbsp; Under Document Properties there was an option for "print all text in black."&nbsp; Once
 I disabled that, my document prints correctly.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have no idea how it got enabled in the first place, but I hope this helps!<br />

Hi, Steve. Glad you got your problem fixed. I finally gave up on it for awhile, but then I wanted to send a Thanksgiving letter in colored print so I had to revisit it. In my case it did turn out to be a Microsoft Office Word problem. I had to get Microsoft
 on the phone to get it solved. When I went to the drop down menu for font color, I changed the color to green, and the software looked like the color change had worked, but of course, the font was still printing black. The Microsoft person explained that I
 had changed the "default" color, which can't be done. Typical answer, Even though the color showed green, the "default" color of black continued to override it. When I went further down into the drop down font color menu and changed the color there, it worked.
 So, I just said "great!" and didn't even try to get them to explain how their software allowed me to change and see the color change in a field that can't be changed.&nbsp;The rep that helped me pretty much zeroed in on the problem right away, so they must be aware
 of this little glitch.&nbsp;I just shrugged my shoulders and said to myself "There goes Bill Gates' weird logic (and programming) again." LOL&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your response.&nbsp;</div>
