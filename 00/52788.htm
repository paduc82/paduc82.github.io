<h2>            Can a AMD Radeon HD 6450 dislplay Aero effects&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My AMD Radeon HD 6450 was just displaying Aero yesterday but now it won't. I decided to scan for issues with the Fix It tool and it told me my card doesn't support these Aero effects even though it did yesterday. I have tryed re-running my Windows Experience
 Index with the same errror "Your score cannot be determined." This problem arised after I overclocked to 3.90 Ghz so could that be my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Crafter,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to us on Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform you that the issue that you‚Äôre facing with Windows Aero, occurred after you changed the overclock speed to 3.90 Ghz. It is not at all recommended to overclock
 your computer as overclocking can lead to multiple issues. Moreover, once you overclock the computer, the warranty goes void.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may try updating the drivers for
<strong><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AMD Radeon HD 6450</a> </strong>
for your computer and check if this helps you. </span></p>

<p>Also go to Action Center in Control Panel and look for troubleshoot and run performance troubleshooter.</p>

</p>
<p>You'll have to contact Windows Store support personnel regarding the issue.&nbsp; Microsoft usually does require a credit card be on file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you asked if the $50.01 balance&nbsp;is legit and why you cannot use it?</p>

<p>I personally would ask for a refund.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>*****Why does this have to go on for me since 2015 I cannot reset my Windows 10 password???***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I come here and ask for help and get lame response from MS IT guys.&nbsp; They state the very obvious academic in their reply.</p>
<p>They pretend I haven't mentioned how many times I have tried to reset password.&nbsp; Of course I did all the steps many times and no new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 2015 for pete's sake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, what I knew would happen, I am losing MS access an App at a time.</p>
<p>I cannot access Skype do to recent WIN 10 Update of yesterday 8/8/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 2015 I have been sure I will soon lose access to my entire computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest MS IT guy has a rating of about 20% success per his profile.</p>
<p>I cannot reply to his email to tell him AGAIN I have already followed the MS bouncing ball to reset my password.</p>
<p>His name is <span>Jess Can and been with MS for a whole year or so.&nbsp; My problem pre-dates him by 2 yrs!!!</span></p>
<p><span>I can only reply to his answer to his support as a Yes-You answered my question.&nbsp; No place or link to say NO-You did not answer my question!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice yesterday when I cried for help again that a lot of people are ate up with this BS on daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspect I will again receive the Canned / Spam reply from the great IT of MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sux so bad, now I cannot talk via skype with my kids a mere 7,000 miles away from home.</p>

<p>Thank you for your effort on this long time issue.</p>
<p>I had so many errors today with this and other I just remembered to check this to see if any replies.&nbsp; By the way no email stating you had replied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many, Many errors on this site today.&nbsp; Error 404 or 405 all morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read yesterday somewhere that often people cannot reset their MS password except on MS IE.&nbsp; So I ran over to my dusty IE and tried.&nbsp; No new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any screenshots.&nbsp; All I have is since 2015 I have been trying to reset my password via MS sites and I follow the directions to end up with no new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some website MS refers me to and I end up there too often answering questions about me skype contacts.&nbsp; At least 2 email subjects I have sent from my outlook email.</p>
<p>I don't use outlook but as of yesterday I was able to access it so I emailed myself the same email to 2 different email accounts so I know those subjects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot imagine this problem is not rampant throughout the World.</p>
<p>People may not use their MS password often?</p>
<p>Every time I turn on my computer it goes to bios password.&nbsp; I enter that.</p>
<p>It wirrs around and then my screen come up and II enter my PIN.&nbsp; Bingo...Rolling along fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, 8/9/2017 Win 10 update rolls in and finishes.</p>
<p>Since then I cannot use skype.&nbsp; Wants my MS password.&nbsp; I knew this day would come.&nbsp; I tried since 2015 to head this off but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well I couldn't use my old email associated with MS so now I have a new one with another email affiliated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not forward to me the generic reset password instructions.&nbsp; They are not working here.</p>
<p>I really have a brain and yesterday nor even today is not my first computer rodeo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all sorts of Forums and what have you to figure this out.</p>
<p>Nada...Zilch and now to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to laugh a bit with all this but utterly ridiculous!</p>

<p>Worthless it was because all he could tell me to do is the MS bouncing ball I have been chasing since 2015.&nbsp; He would have known that if he would have read my plea for aide.</p>

<p>Here's you a screen shot of some of todays circus.</p>
<p>Even though I have my MS page set to remember my password, this AM it doesn't know who I am nor password.&nbsp; All day I cannot login via Chrome.&nbsp; Yesterday good to go....Today...NOT.&nbsp; Many, MANY Error 404 or 405 on Chrome.&nbsp; If you look at that little pop out
 it says I am logged out.&nbsp; That is all it will do and never lets me login.&nbsp; That little pop out is what I get whenever I select Login.&nbsp; You guys have this all working perrrrrfect.</p>

<p>Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what your message is to mean.&nbsp; Apparently you thought it necessary to send me link to someone else's problems not related to mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we will have to realize you failed for me at least.&nbsp; Apparently not much help to the other lost and confused illiterate user of MS.&nbsp; That is how you people up there in your perceived cloud of confusion think of users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ever amazed with the attitudes of IT people and their perceived omnipotence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same problem since 2015 trying to reset my MS password.</p>
<p>I have cried for help quietly over that time with no answer aside from a link to th reset process that hasn't worked or I wouldn't be saying it didn't work???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I cannot login using chrome so I am forced to the antique IE of MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People that know computers do not care for Windows and most assuredly Win 10.</p>
<p>People of your walk love it so yu have job security and get to pop off at the dumb customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now been removed from using skype is my important issue now regarding my stupid MS password.</p>

</p><p>The first thing I did, which you have ignored, is asked you a question about how you would use the page that you showed us in your screenshot.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link to the thread was intended to give you some ideas by reading about related problem symptoms.&nbsp; If you read it you would see that the OP managed to find a chat with a specialist about MS accounts.&nbsp; It is obviously related to yours because you have
 to be signed in to post here in Answers and I think it is the confusing UX that we are being subjected to that is the problem or in your case at least a significant one that it would help for you to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of the confusion in that thread is due to the OP not being able to describe sufficiently what he was doing and seeing. &nbsp; The same so far could be said about your symptom description.&nbsp; Remember, your words have to substitute for what our eyes might notice.&nbsp;
 In fact, that is what I used to have to say in the years before screenshots or user created videos were a possibility.&nbsp; In any case, if you want help you need to communicate clearly and not just use it as an opportunity to bleat your frustrations. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems with Xbox One Connecting to EA Server</h2>
                    
<p>I am regretting purchasing the xbox one.&nbsp; It is frustrating when the problem of the xbox one not connecting to the EA server is continually occurring and has been for the past 7 months.&nbsp; Subsequently, online games cannot be played because of the EA server
 not connecting.&nbsp; Support has been previously contacted and we were told to unplug and shut down the xbox one and reboot it.&nbsp; This does not help the situation.&nbsp; There is no one to communicate this issue with verbally.&nbsp; Where is the xbox one support for the
 customers!&nbsp; This customer needs the support of Microsoft after investing money into the xbox one and it's games for several children.</p>

<p>Hi meandtheboys,</p>
<p>Only certain original Xbox games are backwards compatible. You can find the list of supported games
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/games/xbox-games/play-original-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, ensure that you are using an official Xbox Hard Drive (not a third party one), as there is a partition on the official drives that contains some emulation data required to play original Xbox games.</p>

<p>It's one of 2 things then.</p>
<p>1) Make sure the games you're trying to play are on this list - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
en.wikipedia.org/.../List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360</a> &nbsp;If they're not on that list, they won't work.</p>
<p>2) What kind of hard drive are you using? Did it come with your console or was it purchase separately?

<p>Hey there meandtheboys9,<br />
<br />
Smwutches and Karachi are correct, even if the games are on the compatibility list, unless you are sure you're using an official Microsoft hard drive original Xbox games will not work on an Xbox 360 console.</p>

<h2>            media players &#39;end playback&#39; randomly when recieving internet radio broadcasts</h2>
                    I am running &lt;acronym title="Windows 7"&gt;win7&lt;/acronym&gt; ultimate 64bit and have had winamp and media player installed from day 1 for over 2 months now.<br />
<br />
However over the last week I have a problem with all media players 'ending playback' for no apparent reason while recieving internet radio broadcasts.<br />
<br />
i have reinstalled winamp again (the latest version), updated the codecs as a precaution and played around with the buffering settings all to no avail.<br />
<br />
locally played mp3 files etc play with no problems at all so i am pretty sure it isn't a local network issue as they are stored on a NAS box with two routers between it and my machine.<br />
<br />
has anyone had a similar / same problem and found a work around?

<p>playback ends abrubptly no buffering prior to playback ending, it's just happening with one station which is running out at 96kbit and it is doing this on all types of media player, winamp, windows media player and enbeded players on sites</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have tried another station using same players which was transmitting at 192kbit and that seemed to play without issue, is it possible that it's related to the bitrate? and if so is there a way of altering windows settings to sort it or something within the
 players itself?</p>

<p>Hi Savan / Mary</p>
<p>I am not getting any error messages or buffering during or at the end of playback, The only indication that I do get is the fact that the stream does stop and my msn messenger which is set to display song information says 'playback end' just above the system
 tray on the task bar.</p>
<p>The station itself reports no problems at their end as other people who share the same chat room as myself all tune in to the same station without problem. I have checked internet security logs (kaspersky 2010) and the logs show no untoward activity that
 can explain what is happening at the times it does</p>
<p>Hope this is of some help</p>

<p><span>Is there a way that I can submit a feature request to the development team for Skype for Business to add a feature to have it automatically minimize on startup?&nbsp; I am already aware of the setting that allows skype to minimize
 to the system tray.&nbsp; I already have this setting turned on, and it does not fully solve my problem.&nbsp; I don't want to have to manually minimize this every time I restart my computer.&nbsp; It is really annoying.&nbsp; Please either forward this request to the developers
 or please tell me where I can post this so that they will see it.</span></p>

    <title>Pen Sensitivity Issue - Must press significantly before ink is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylestufflebam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen Sensitivity Issue - Must press significantly before ink is registered</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had some issues with the Surface Pro 3 pen. When I initially purchased the SP3, everything worked flawlessly, and I loved writing and drawing on it. Unforunately, the pen started going to hell after about 7 weeks, with the ink starting before I even
 touched the pen, and then producing maximum thickness lines when barely grazing the surface of the screen. Fortunately, Microsoft Support shipped a replacement pen when I called for technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, now I have the opposite problem. Touching the pen to the surface doesn't register any input until I press down. I can literally lightly bounce the pen on the screen and produce no lines in Fresh Paint or Photoshop, nor will it click any buttons
 or similar input. I have to press down to get it to work. This may seem trivial, but taking notes or drawing wears my hand out within minutes this way, and I pretty much always see screen ripples from the pressure I'm pushing down on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing the WinTab drivers from the N-Trig website, but it doesn't appear to have changed anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The non-registry of light touches remains system-wide (onenote, photoshop, the **** start menu, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help. Help for all that is good in the world.</p>

            <p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the Surface Community. I'm very sorry to hear that you have to press the Pen hard for it to be registered by the screen. I fully understand your frustration, and I d love to work with you to help resolve the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, did you install all of the updates available after receiving the replacement?</li><li>Try checking <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/troubleshoot-surface-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this troubleshooting article for the Pro 3 Pen</a></strong> to see if any of them helps.</li><li>Have you tried changing the batteries inside the Pen?</li><li>If you haven't done so already, I would suggest <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen#solution2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting the touchscreen calibration</a></strong>:
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;Press the Windows logo key&nbsp;+ S to open <strong>Search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;Type <strong>Control Panel</strong>, then use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, and press Enter. <br />
(Or, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;In Control Panel, use the arrow keys to highlight <strong>
Hardware and Sound</strong> and press Enter.<br />
(Or, click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:&nbsp;Under Tablet PC Settings use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong>, and press Enter.<br />
(Or, click <strong>Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;Use the Tab key to select the <strong>Reset</strong> button, and press Enter.<br />
(Or, click <strong>Reset</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 6</strong>:&nbsp;Use the Tab key to select <strong>Yes</strong>, press Enter, and then follow the instructions on the screen.<br />
(Or, click <strong>Yes</strong>, and then follow the instructions on the screen.)<br />
<strong>Step 7</strong>:&nbsp;After Surface removes recalibration data, test touch input again.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If none of them seems to be helping, try&nbsp;the <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-pro-wont-turn-on#shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2 button shutdown</a></strong>:
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button on your Surface at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:&nbsp;Press and release the power button on your Surface to turn it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what you are seeing.</p>

            <p>Although I have done this operation before many times,/ office word has to be open.</p>
<p>There is an issue with the clip boards getting confused at times because when your on the web windows wants to use the window 7 clip board instead of the office clip board,</p>
<p>I'm on win-7 home premium so it has No group policies to further restrict access to office clip board.</p>
<p>So I believe you might be having a group policy issue which I have no idea how to check that issue,</p>
<p>I would suggest Pasting to Notepad first from the webpage to see if it will work,</p>
<p>Then Copy from Notepad and Paste to Office word.</p>
<p>You should also edit your question and move it to the Office 2010 word forum for more suggestions to try,</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            &#42;&#42;&#42;  Windows XP see only 2.5 GB RAM&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I have Windows XP Pro SP3 for a Dell 8400 computer. Before it had 2 GB of RAM and today I add 2 GB of RAM more, but&nbsp;in Windows System Properties it show only 2.25 GB RAM. ?? Am I wasting my money when I bought that extra 2 GB RAM? Why can't Win XP
 Pro see the entire 4 GB RAM? I check the BIOS and it show 4 GB RAM and System Information show 4 GB of Total Physical Memory. Any explanation? Thanks.

<p>Thank you for getting back to me. Since you've encrypted your computer using BitLocker, a recovery key will be generated. Note that the recovery key can only be used on the current Windows version of your PC. I'd suggest checking this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026181/windows-10-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to help you locate your BitLocker recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, here's another <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to learn more about BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For in-depth assistance, I'd suggest posting your question in the <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprosecurity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Forums</a></strong>, where we have support professionals

    <title>Primary alias is wrong when trying to login to windows account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenkuper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Primary alias is wrong when trying to login to windows account.</h2>
                    I have a windows 8.1 OS. Whenever I try to access my Microsoft apps, ie: Calender, xbox, change pc setting in the charms menu, etc. I'm prompted to login to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; The primary alias listed&nbsp;on that logon screen&nbsp;is wrong and will not allow
 me to get past the login screen even though I put in the correct password.&nbsp;I get a message, "Password is&nbsp;wrong, try again" or "access has been block because of too many attempts to logon".&nbsp;When I go to the "change primary alias" screen the email address listed
 there is correct. I've tried to change it to another one but cannot. I can logon when I go to the "sign in to your Microsoft account" screen but it provides no access to my apps. I've tried to go to "change pc settings" to disable the account in order to put
 in the correct email address but I'm prompted to login and viola, no can do. How do I change the email address that is hard wired into the logon screen so I can access my apps?

            <p>Microsoft has always allowed users to take advantage of aliases in the past, similar to how other services use the same type of alias feature. However, many Windows 8 users wanted to use an alias as opposed to being forced&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technorms.com/15218/create-user-accounts-windows-8-quickly-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create User Accounts in Windows 8 Quickly With This Guide">to
 create an account</a>&nbsp;when they upgraded or installed the OS. Microsoft has never allowed that until now. &nbsp;This was an additional way to secure an account, have some privacy and could be used as a countermeasure to unauthorized logins.</p>
<p>Eric Doerr, Group Project Manager for Microsoft Accounts, <a href="http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/08/21/a-better-way-to-manage-aliases-and-primary-email-address-for-your-microsoft-account.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="A better way to manage aliases and primary email address for your Microsoft account">
explains it further</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre replacing rename with a simpler and clearer choice to make any of your aliases a primary alias. We‚Äôve also made it clearer why you might want to do this (and why you might not). &nbsp;Now that you can sign in with any alias, really the only reason to make
 a different alias [from] your primary one is if you want a different email name to show on your Microsoft devices, like the background of your Xbox or your Windows 8 PC.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were a lot of loopholes to renaming an account and the process could be cumbersome depending on how a user first created the Microsoft Account. You could essentially in a worst case scenario be completely locked out of your

Microsoft Account‚Äôs</a> primary e-mail account for up to 30 days if you followed the process wrong in several places. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why Microsoft has made this change to how aliases work in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at how these changes work and what concerns users have with Microsoft Account aliases in Windows 8 and 8.1.</p>
Using an Alias in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1
<p>The instructions shared below will work in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 and requires an Internet connection.</p>
<p>Head here to login to your Microsoft Account on the Web.</p>
<p>Enter your password and click <strong>‚ÄúSign in.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftncdn.vikitech.netdna-cdn.com%2fassets%2f2-sign-in1.png" height="279" width="350" /></p>
<p>Depending on your security settings, you many need to do verification to prove your identity. Go through the steps and continue on.</p>
<p>On the main screen, scroll down until you see Account aliases.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftncdn.vikitech.netdna-cdn.com%2fassets%2f3-account-aliases-on-main-menu.png" height="123" width="254" /></p>
<p>Click on <strong>‚ÄúAdd or change aliases‚Äù </strong>to enter the options for your Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>If you have several aliases already set up, you can click ‚Äú<strong>Make primary‚Äù</strong> underneath one to make the switch to it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can click <strong>‚ÄúAdd alias‚Äù</strong> to create a new one to use as your primary login for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>When creating an alias, you can create a new e-mail address with Microsoft or you can use an existing e-mail address, such as a Gmail or Yahoo account, to use to

<h2>            Opening Samsung S8 on windows 10&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey Folks</p>
<p>Wondering if I might be able to have some assistance about how to get windows 10 to open my Samsung S8 phone so I can get to my media. Do we require a specific software to make this happen? It used to be a plug and play thing but now ?????? KAI? Surely it
 can not be that difficult....any tips would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your USB cable may be designed only for charging or your Android drivers may be outdated that's why you're experiencing issues with connecting your device to your Windows 10 computer. To provide effective steps to resolve the issue, we'd like to isolate
 it first by asking a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What happens when you connect your phone to your Windows 10 computer?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you tried using a different USB cable to connect your device to your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you update your <strong>Media Transfer Protocol</strong> USB device drivers. To update your drivers, you can follow the steps

I've tried this three times so far and I keep getting the message below when trying to validate my XP OS (required prior to downloading driver).
<br />
"This version of the Windows Genuine Advantage validation tool is no longer supported.&nbsp; Please download the newest version and ensure that your system clock is accurate."<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows XP SP3.&nbsp; I downloaded and ran what I think is the latest version of the validation tool but I don't get a validation code which I need to download the driver.&nbsp; I just get a pop-up saying that my OS is valid.
<br />
<br />
Please help!&nbsp; I want to get the most out of my PC and tablet.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            logitech wireless mouse and microsoft wireless keyboard</h2>
                    Can a logitech wireless mouse and a MS wireless comfort keyboard coexist on the same machine running Win 7 home? With the two separate usb dongles or whatever they are called? I should add this computer had a MS wireless mouse. Both mouse and keyboard
 are the 5000 models.<br />

            <p>That should not be an issue, friardave. I used to have a Logitech Wireless KBD and Mouse Combo when I was on Windows 7. Junior's rough handling of the mouse caused the Mouse to die prematurely. So, instead of going in for an expensive Wireless Combo, I got
 him a cheap Wireless Chinese Mouse, retaining the Logitech Wireless KBD. Use up 2 USB Ports it did, but in a Desktop, there are plenty of USB Ports anyways!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I retained this until I upgraded to Windows 8.1, when I got a hp Combo - by then junior had managed to trash the Logitech KBD too...</p>

            <p>Hi friardave,</p>
<p>I haven't used an MS Mouse so can't be 100% sure. However I don't see any reason why it shouldn't, since one can use multiple devices on USB. I would just go ahead &amp; try it out!</p>
<p>Best of Luck!</p>
