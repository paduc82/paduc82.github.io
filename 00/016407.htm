<h2>            Running songs directly to dock from PC</h2>
                    
<p>I bought 6233 with DT-21 dock many years ago. It was an awesome combination. The speakers of the dock are really great. However now, am finding it extremely difficult to connect my phone to PC through dock because of some lose connections between dock-phone
 connecting ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOwever I will like to use the dock to output what I play on my PC. I mean is it possible to run songs from PC directly on my dock, dock has got power socket, micro-USB socket and audio jack behind it . It will be great alternative to take it as external
 speakers for my laptop especially on trips &nbsp;:p.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
if the audio jack is an auxiliary jack then by all means it may be very well possible to run music from your PC to the speakers. from what little information i could find from Google on the DT-21, it only had a PopPort connection for the phone, and miniUSB
 somewhere on it. I suppose you could run a cable from a 3.5mm connection on your PC to the auxiliary (if it is there) on the DT-21, or the other way around if the ports are the other way around.<br />
<br />
As the DT-21 is quite a dated accessory now, there is very limited information on the product.

<h2>            Hotmail conversion to Outlook - I lost all emails from prior to the change</h2>
                    Hi there - my Hotmail account has recently been converted to Outlook (which is great!) however I cannot retrieve (or at least I don't see) any of my previous emails, all emails that were in my mailbox prior to the switch to Outlook... &nbsp;Any advice? &nbsp;Have
 they been archived somewhere..?

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Marie-Pier11,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Welcome to the Microsoft Community! I'd be happy to assist you with your concern on your account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let me see if I understood you correctly, your emails disappeared after your account was upgraded to Outlook. In that case, please be informed that by upgrading to Outlook.com,
 you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here are the possible reasons on why your emails/folders are missing in your account:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1.
<strong><span>Due to inactivity in account:</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If your emails were over 365 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity in your account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your
 account before renamed, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages yourself (Link to recover deleted messages is under DELETED folder). You can refer to this article for more information:
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span><font color="#0000ff">Deleted email messages</font></span></b></a></span>
</li><li>
<span>If you were accessing your emails on a mail client such as Windows Live Mail or through your mobile device, but didnâ€™t log into your web account for over 365 days, you may lose emails
 due to inactivity in web account. </span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.
<strong><span>You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account:</span></strong> If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt
 would have asked you â€“ â€˜Where do you want to save your emails?â€™ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder
 will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under â€˜Foldersâ€™. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3.
<strong><span>Your account was hacked even before you renamed your account:</span></strong> A hacker had already deleted emails in their account before you renamed the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, if the data loss on your account was because of the upgrade, you can provide us more information by answering the questions below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>When was the account switched to Outlook.com?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Did the data loss occur right after Outlook.com upgrade or was the data still there for a brief time?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Did you have issues logging in before noticing data loss â€“ did you have to reset his/her password?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Did you click on any link before the issue occurred?</span>
</li><li>
<span>Did you try to deactivate or downgrade to Hotmail.com before the issue occurred?</span></li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In addition to that, I've created a private message area that asks for some information. Just click on the "You have a private reply to this message" link above your
 post to view the message.</span></p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We certainly understand the issue with your Windows phone. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where&nbsp;that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the

<strong>Note</strong> that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Tasks getting cut off on left hand side - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lahna_b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Tasks getting cut off on left hand side</h2>
                    My client is having an issue in Outlook 2016 where they will assign another user a task and when that user opens it, it will be cut off on the left hand side. This happens when the Task is fully opened and also in the preview side bar view. I've moved
 the columns which does nothing, and also run Outlook.exe /cleanviews on both machines. The user sending the tasks can receive tasks from others fine, and it doesn't matter who they send them to, they get cut off. The cut off tasks open fine in Web Mail. They
 are both using 2016, and aren't using custom forms. Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e69fdb-1430-4928-b178-b548442c1824?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e69fdb-1430-4928-b178-b548442c1824?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Lahna_B,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To verify if this is an issue with the Outlook app or account, I suggest that you ask your clients to perform the troubleshooting steps mentioned below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Outlook in Safe mode. Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click
<strong>Run.</strong> In the Run box, type <strong>outlook /safe</strong>, and click
<strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Check if there is an available update for your Office. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><dl><dd>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Open any Office 2016 app, such as Word, and create a new document.</p>
</dd><dd>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account</strong> (or <strong>Office Account</strong> if you opened Outlook 2016).</p>
</dd><dd>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Under <strong>Product Information</strong>, choose <strong>Update Options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update Now</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Close the "<strong>You're up to date!</strong>" window after Office is done checking for and installing updates.</p>
</dd></dl>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, confirm with your clients if they will experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<span>Can you edit query normally after you set up Excel in safe mode?(Hold CTRL key and click workbook.) If so, that means this issue may be caused by Add-ins. You can open the workbook normally and click File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins to disable

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since your Office is not the latest version 1711(8730.2165), Iâ€™d like to suggest you update your Office to the latest version to see the outcome.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can edit query, to check whether this issue is related to add-ins, please open your file in safe mode(Hold CTRL key and click your workbook) to see the outcome. If you can
 edit your query in safe mode, you can click File&gt;Options&gt;Add-ins to uncheck add-ins one by one to check which one caused this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you still canâ€™t edit query, Iâ€™d like to suggest you repair your Office to check if this issue still exists. You can follow the steps to do that:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Type this address Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features in File Explorer to find your program list.</span></li><li>
<span>Right-click Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus&gt;click change&gt;Quick Repair.</span></li><li>
<span>Click Online Repair if this issue still exists.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Besides, if this issue persists after Office repair, Iâ€™d like to suggest you

    <title>Compile a list from a seperate spreadsheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phill_r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compile a list from a seperate spreadsheet</h2>
                    Hello, I'm administrating an awards competition and using Excel to keep track of all the entries.<br />
<br />
I have a 'Master Log' spreadsheet, where every single entry is logged into this document.<br />
<br />
Entries are broken down by:<br />
1) Name of Company<br />
2) Category the entry they submitted is for (multiple categories, multiple possible entries for each category)<br />
3) Each category is separated into 'classes', so companies of similar size compete against each other (a behmoth doesn't face off against a little guy)<br />
<br />
The setup of my spreadsheet is:<br />
Column R = Name of company<br />
Column U = Category of their entry<br />
Column V = Class<br />
Column W = Name of Entry<br />
<br />
Very simplified example (ignoring column S and T):<br />
ABC Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry A<br />
ABC Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry B<br />
ABC Company, Category #3, Class B, Entry C<br />
DEF Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry D<br />
DEF Company, Category #2, Class C, Entry E<br />
<br />
What i'd like to do is create an Excel scoresheet for judging purposes. I'd like the scoresheet to be a seperate document that refers to the Master Log spreadsheet and 'pulls' specific things. My scoresheets will be broken down by Category and Class.<br />
<br />
So if it was a scoresheet for Category #1, Class A, the contents would need to be:<br />
ABC Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry A<br />
ABC Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry B<br />
DEF Company, Category #1, Class A, Entry D<br />
<br />
How do I do this? Any advice or links to tutorials would be greatly appreciated. Is there a technical term for what I'm trying to achieve?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi, the best way is to create a pivot table where you use as filter the Category #, to see how to create a pivot table look at Debra web</p>

            You could download the trial version of MathType.
<br />After the trial period, the remaining function is essentially Equation Editor 3.0.

<h2>            Why is there STILL no call&#47;text reminder option on WP &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as I read there is no option of repeat reminder for missed calls or new(unread) messages in WP 8 and WP 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me ask a question,</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY IS MICROSOFT DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS FUNCTION IN WP 8 OR WP 8.1 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read like a milion of questions and demands on the net, and still, even in WP 8.1 there is still no option for this ?</p>
<p>And I ask why ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>note:</p>
<p>For people wha have same problem I finally found a solution.</p>
<p>Buy a Blackberry, Apple or Android device. :) Because ALL of these CAN do this stupid thing, even my old dump LG can do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please , I'm so intrested what or where is a problem.)</span></p>

    <title>Windows activation not connecting to the server anymore&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> immortalisgladiatura  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows activation not connecting to the server anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here's the story:</p>
<p>I had Win 7 Ultimate, and through the free upgrade offer, installed Win 10, from initial Anniversary ed. through to build 17133 (Insider). Had developed some issues, and tried reset, which didn't correct said issues.</p>
<p>Through troubleshooting, I physically removed some hardware such as cd/dvd drives, usb device headers, and other minor things.</p>
<p>Mobo, ram, video card, hard drives remained the same.</p>
<p>Then to further troubleshoot, I figured I'd re-install Win 10 Creators, without installing Win 7, to avoid bloat, and downloaded the ISO and mounted on a USB drive...Unfortunately...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now windows will not update, nor activate, and gives me "We can't reach our activation servers right now. Make sure you're connected to the internet, wait a few minutes, and try again." Error code: 0x80072F8F...which basically translates to Date and time
 not set properly from what I have found online.</p>
<p>So I checked my cmos battery, which did turn out to be near dead, and upon replacement, reformatted, and again, clean installed Win 10 Creators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation troubleshooter is no help either as it attempts, then throws the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found this online:</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10 free upgrade&nbsp;product key and activation from Windows 7/8:&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">If you upgraded your PC to Windows 10 from a genuine copy of either Windows 8/8.1 or Windows 7, your license will
 be tied to the hardware you upgrade on, not your Microsoft account, and you wonâ€™t get any new product key either.&nbsp;You can verify this using any third-party product key fetching software like&nbsp;ProduKey or&nbsp;The Ultimate PID Checker.&nbsp;They will show you generic
 product keys like <strong>*** Removed for privacy ***</strong> for Windows 10 Home and
</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>*** Removed for privacy ***</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"> for Windows 10 Pro edition.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">So what if you want to clean install Windows 10 on the same machine? Yes you can do that by downloading an ISO file, turning it into a USB drive or DVD media and then running the setup for clean install.
 During install, when Windows setup asks you for product key, simply skip the step and let it complete the installation. Once Windows 10 clean install is complete, your copy of Windows will activate automatically as soon as you connect to Internet. This is
 because Microsoft knows you clean installed on the same hardware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So what gives?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello <em>ImmortalisGladiatura</em>,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Error code 0x80072F8F</strong></em> usually occurs when your Windows device is having difficulty connecting to the Internet. Aside from verifying the data and time of your machine, I also advise checking your Internet connection if it's stable.
 To help you resolve the issue, I suggest running the Network troubleshooter. This tool is designed to scan and fix your device for any misconfiguration with your device drivers. You will need administrator access to run this tool.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span> button.</span></li><li><span>Type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> and then hit
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Internet Connections</strong><span> under <strong>
Get up and running</strong></span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run the troubleshooter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for replying,</p>
<p>I have already tried the various troubleshooters, to no avail.</p>
<p>Additionally, it seems I can access everything on the web, with exception to Windows update, and the Activation server it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also already tried the SFC and DISM, which report nothing out of the usual.</p>

<p>The device has a digital licence if you upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. You don't need to input any keys during installation and activation should be automatic once the device connects to the internet after a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have the correct edition of Windows 10. If you had Windows 7 Ultimate then you should have Windows 10 Pro. How long have you waited for activation. Have you restarted a few times. Perhaps the server is busy.</p>

<p>Heya,</p>
<p>My upgrade was Win 7 Ultimate, to Win 10 Pro. It's been more than a day (w/multiple restarts) giving me that error, both through Win update, and Activation troubleshooter, including the M$ website one.</p>
<p>I just find it odd that I can go to any web site, including M$ with no issues, yet cannot connect to Win update, or Activation.</p>

<p>Could it be that I am still "enrolled" in Insider?</p>
<p>I see this after running slui.exe :</p>
<p>The last product key (ID: **notgoingtopostkey**) you entered can't be used on this copy of windows. (0x80072F8F)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is the digital key I'm assuming I had when originally upgraded, through to Insider build 17133, as it looks nothing like the Win 7 key I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to hold off on chat support as long as possible, I'd prefer to find the solution and possibly fix it on my end. I'm betting this will happen again if I end up re-installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, strangely enough, the apps have no issue updating...Skype just updated itself, yet I still get the "We couldn't connect to the update service yada yada yada..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: If it is indeed that I am still "enrolled" I am going to install the current build , as I have read that if you removed the Windows.old folder (which I did when I formatted my disk) then you would run into issues. I'll keep this updated.</p>

<p>Ok, so I downloaded, and clean installed build 17127 (couldn't find 17133) and it didn't help in the least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ended up calling support, and they did fix my activation issue...to a point. I cannot get back into Insider, clicking "Get started" brings up the "Oops...something went wrong" BS 0x0 error, which I haven't found a solution to yet.</p>
<p>Since there is an expiry date on this version of windows, I am definitely going to have issues.</p>
<p>Lastly, the "tech support" member, claimed to have fixed the Windows update issue (which I brought up repeatedly)...however, it's not.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I avoid MS support.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>I have managed to fix the Windows Update not connecting issue, by going into the services, and "starting" literally anything that had to do with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also half fixed the Insider issue by going into the registry, and changing HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability EnablePreviwBuilds to a 1 (was a 2 for some reason)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insider now shows, however, It states "Your Windows Insider Account requires attention to get Insider Preview builds" with a "Fix me" button underneath, which when clicked gives me the same BS error of 0x0.</p>
<p>Still have more work to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Account Troubleshooter, and it says it cannot connect to the sync server.</p>
<p>Maybe whichever service handles the Sync, is not started. I have no idea which service it uses, and I haven't yet found info online.</p>

<h2>            I think I found out why my start menu won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>So I decide to re-install Windows 10, and tried to figured out why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed 10041, the mail, calendar, and the people shows broken, I ignored first to install all the drivers and programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all is done, I tried to restart several times, and see if these programs have an effect on start menu, It wasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to fix the app, it was the same.&nbsp; the old app store failed to install these broken apps, and next time when booting up Windows, the start menu quits working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out the reasons, but I can not fix it.</p>

            <p>This latest build (10041) is an affront to thinking people.&nbsp; No Mail, no Calendar, no People, no action when the Windows logo key is pressed, lock screen permanently locked, display in Office blurry (why just Office?), IE crashes every 32 seconds yet Google
 Chrome is blocked from installation.&nbsp; Some of us have been waiting since 1982 for Microsoft to â€œget Windows right,â€ believing, against all the experiential evidence, that Microsoft would.&nbsp; My bitterness over the catastrophic depredations of Windows 10 is beyond
 articulation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This preview project should have been dedicated to refining the look and feel of Windows so that, upon its launch, we would no longer have to be embarrassed in conversation with our Apple devotee friends. Now, I couldnâ€™t, in good conscience, endorse Windows
 10 for anybody who isnâ€™t an arch software wonk.&nbsp; Does my shock and disappointment betray my naivetÃ©? I suppose so. Sometimes, when one wants very badly for something to work, one loses oneâ€™s healthy skepticism.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            You account &#40;-----&#41; can view documents, but it doesn&#39;t allow editing on a Mac.</h2>
                    I realize this situation has been asked before, but none of the solutions seem to work for me. I have been using Microsoft Office 365 through a school account on my personal macbook without any problems for the last year and a half. Only now have I seen
 this message that I can only view and not edit documents ... this goes for every Office desktop application. &nbsp;I have tried deleting the suggested files from the Library "Group Containers" folder, I have deleted the Microsoft Office files from Keychain Access,
 and I have completely uninstalled Office (following the instructions on this site), and reinstalled it. I still get the same message. The licenses on my online account include "The latest desktop version of Office." Any idea what else could be causing this?

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>There
 are few factors that can contribute to the issue you are facing. Since the settings have already been checked and you have reinstalled Office, there is a possibility that this can be caused by the account itself.</span></span></p>

<br />
Is there an option like there was with Office windows to do this ??<br />
<br />
I'm using an SSD so space at the moment is crucial.. <br />

Any suggestions....<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You could upload to an IMAP account like Gmail then delete from Outlook. I believe Gmail offers 7GB free.<br />
<br />
This would allow you to access via your browser.<br />
<br />
Note: Gmail will throttle you if you upload too many messages in a day. I suggest doing one folder at a time. I would start with 100-200 messages at a time. Verify they uploaded to Gmail in the browser.<br />
<br />
You might want to use Copy not Move to be sure nothing gets lost in the transfer. Only delete from Outlook when you have verified they are on the server.<br />
<br />
Upload to the Gmail Inbox. After you get them into Gmail's Inbox, create a folder (Gmail calls them labels) and move out of the Inbox. This moves them off your computer.<br />
<br />
Under Gmail's Settings &gt; Labels uncheck sync to IMAP option. This way you can keep the Gmail account active in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Do NOT select to sync Gmail's All Mail folder to Outlook.<br />

<h2>            Excel 2007 is running very slow. Can anyone suggest how to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    The problem is not in just one excel document but all of them. Any operation, whether it is moving cells or typing in a cell, take 3 to 5 seconds. It's been happening for several weeks now and I am tearing my hair out. This is what I have already tried.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Office diagnostic test <br />
Uninstalling windows updates<br />
Switching the calculations option to "manual'<br />
Went to the binoculars and "select objects" - "selection pane" to see if I had a lot of hidden objects. All that was listed was what I could see - 5 text boxes and a Word Art<br />
Saved as Excel Workbook instead of 97-2003 as was previously saved in compatability mode<br />
<br />
None of this helped. Also the screen blinks once about every 3 seconds. Any ideas?<br />
<br />

<br />
I need to access web pages inside my application, so I tried to use DISPLAYCLASS control. I need to show status bar of the HTML control (I can see the status bar with AxWebBrowser Control), so tried to fetch the IWebBrowser2 interface from DTM_BROWSERDISPATCH
 as recommened by Microsoft (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb415471.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb415471.aspx</a>). For some reason I always get E_NOINTERFACE.<br />
<br />
Can someone please shed some light on the issue... Is it a bug? or I am missing something here

<p>Hi Kallolkumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opting for an Insider Build is free of cost and you just need to register for the Insider Build. To register go to
<em><a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider</a></em> and click on
<strong>BECOME AN INSIDER</strong>. After registering in the Windows Insider Program and installing your first Windows 10 Insider Preview build1, you will begin to receive updates to the device(s) you have enrolled. During the development process, the build
 number will change with each update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.</p>

<h2>            Access 2016 &#40;part of Office 365&#41; Right-Click</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I am having problems with the Right-Click Menus in Access.&nbsp; I have run through Bob Larson's suggestion noted below from the link at the bottom of this post; No Joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check your startup options under the Office Button &gt; Access Options &gt; Current Database and make sure you didn't uncheck the ALLOW DEFAULT SHORTCUT MENUS.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Issue description:&nbsp; When I open an object in Access (table, query, form, etc), regardless of if I'm in {object} View, Design View, Layout View; if I right-click the title bar of the object I no longer get a Menu (list is something like Save, Close, {object}
 View, Design View, Layout View, Build Event, Tab Order, Object Properties, Properties).&nbsp; I have the same issue in personal DBs and Customer DBs (Navigation Pane hidden, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp; As stated I have already run through Bob Larson's suggestion, I even checked it and then unchecked it.&nbsp; But as I said the issue is not DB dependent.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be welcome.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Forgot to mention that I can right-click in the navigation pane and get the expected menus.&nbsp; This just seems to affect the right-click on the Object Title Bar.&nbsp; -- B</p>

<p>&nbsp; Sorry folks, neither option worked.&nbsp; I still get NO response when I right-click an object's title bar.&nbsp; Frustrating.&nbsp; I do get a slightly changed version of the previous Right-Click menu when I move just below the title bar frame (within the object, but
 within a few pixels of the top edge) and right-click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; But I don't get the previous menu which held some additional options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thank you to both Jason Sheppard and Edgar R.G. for their suggestions.&nbsp; Though none resulted in a resolution.&nbsp; :(&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Same performance with a different profile.&nbsp; Though that was a pre-existing profile.&nbsp; I'll create a new one and see if that fixes things.&nbsp; I'll get back once I've done that ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; But this is happening across the board, on three different machines (three versions of Windows 10: Pro, Home, Student) with different profiles.&nbsp; The only consistent thing is each is using the same MicroSoft Account.</p>

<h2>            Why such a phone - Nokia Lumia 920&#33;</h2>
                    If Nokia Lumia had so many problems like heating up, sending sms instead of mms, then why the **** did Nokia release such a phone? I am a fan of Nokia and I plan to buy this phone by the middle of May. But when I read all these complaints my mind tells
 me if I should go for it. Can anyone just give me the details of the all the complaints and issues on Nokia Lumia 920? Do you think I should get a Nokia Lumia 920 after all these issues?

            <blockquote>Thanks a lot sir!
<div>Yes I do remember reading Telstra in&nbsp;Australia!<br />
<br />
Sir, I plan to buy my phone from United Arab Emirates! And I wish to take it to India for my higher studies.<br />
So I read online that Lumia 920 when bought in US from AT&amp;T was network locked. So if I buy the phone from a mobile store rather than a network carrier will it be network locked? I guess not right?<br />
<br />
And I did hear that you wont be able to use Nokia Music in India. Is it right?</div>
<div>And lastly, I really love Nokia Maps as mentioned above. So If I put India's maps in my phone and then take it to India will I be able to use it freely? I suppose the answer is YES!<br />
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I am from India, so let me take a shot at answering the India specific answers :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will do well by buying the phone in UAE. From what my friends what who stay there have said, phones there are unlocked and come with micro sim which is used here as well. So, you can buy the phone there, come to our country and buy a sim here and start
 using it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the maps, yes, if you download the Nokia maps of India, it will be usable here. Based on my own personal experience, I have to say the maps are just fantastic. for instance, some of the smallest villages in far off places are also listed with names
 and everything. It's awesome!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Music works here as well. As long as you have a valid Nokia Music account. The music is DRM free, so I don't think you will have any problems using the service when you come here. Of course, in India, Nokia music is subscription based. Not sure how
 it works in another countries. So, if you have a valid subscription, you should be good to go.</p>

            Yes, the Lumia 920 from the US is network locked. Get it from Europe if you can. Usually those are unlocked.<br />
<br />
I don't know of the availability of Nokia Music. You'll have to ask Nokia.<br />
<br />
Nokia Maps is free for all devices.<br />

    <title>N95 - Bluetooth restrictions with Audi MMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paula6  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 - Bluetooth restrictions with Audi MMI</h2>
                    I would like to be able to say that I am now the proud owner of a N95. However, after two weeks of checking the web and searching through forums I feel totally demoralised. Whilst the N95 would appear to be absolutely state-of-the-art from a connectivity
 point of view with UMTS, Wlan and Bluetooth â€“ the opposite would appear to be true. I have an Audi A6 with MMI and Bluetooth Connectivity. Although I can make and receive calls, the phone offers no contact or address book functionality. My old RAZR V3 works
 fine, even offering a named list of missed callers but with the N95 nothing! Even the tool offered by Nokia to synchronise the address book (810_Contacts_Sync) doesnâ€™t work.<br />
<br />
I never switch too early to new technologies because they take time to ripen and I donâ€™t have the time and energy to be an early adopter. However, the N95 has been around over 6 months but doesnâ€™t seem to have progressed at all on this topic. If Nokia wants
 to survive in this world of travelling professionals they have to start taking this kind of problem seriously.<br />
<br />
Everything seems to come down to Nokia being unaware of the fact that apart from the Bluetooth 2.0 standard there are also slightly older standards called 1.1 and 1.2 â€“ which SonyEricsson and Motorola happily support. The web is full of questions and threads
 regarding this subject. There appears to be a whole community of Audi drivers keen to get their N95â€™s working, but being disappointed. Nokia would appear to be doing itâ€™s best to ignore this deficit in the N95 and makes no comment. I cannot understand why
 a mobile phone with such capabilities as the N95 should ignore a world full of slightly older Bluetooth connections. After two weeks of searching and hoping for a solution for me it comes down to change the phone not the car â€“ Iâ€™ll sell the N95 and switch
 back to an out-of-date Motorola!<br />
<br />

            Very frustrating!<br />
<br />
Strange that you pay Â£400 to get bluetooth in your A6 (on the current option list) and it doesn't support the latest standard, though. I think that could be worth taking up with Audi - after all, Â£400 is a heck of lot to pay for a Â£30 bluetooth adaptor.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Audi actually has a list of verified mobile phones which work with the Audi MMI.<br />
<a href="http://www.audi.de/etc/medialib/cms4imp/audi2/product/technology/pdf.Par.0004.File.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.audi.de/etc/medialib/cms4imp/audi2/product/technology/pdf.Par.0004.File.pdf</a><br />
Unfortunately there is no mention of the N95!<br />
<br />
That said, it would not appear to be an Audi problem. There are also reports of the web from BMW and VW owners. The problem would seem to lay with Nokia - but again - they choose to ignore it!<br />
<br />

            Just to correct my last entry. It is now mentioned at the end of the list. But it wasn't there when I checked it. Audi say exactly what everyone is saying - there is now access to the address and contact data stored in the mobile.<br />

            Just as an after thought, I hope people donâ€™t get me wrong. The N95 is a really great device, the sound quality is great, the camera is great and makes very good pictures and mp4 movies. The expandability with the mini-sd card is exactly what I wanted.
 But because I spend a lot of time in my car, I need a mobile which is safe to use while driving. And the bottom line is this phone is not safe to use on road if you own an Audi, BMW, VW and probably a list as long as your arm.<br />
<br />
What really annoys me is that people first reported this problem back in January 2007 and Nokia doesnâ€™t seem to be interested in doing anything about it. I canâ€™t believe that a high-tech device like the N95 canâ€™t be fixed with a simple software patch!

            I have just ordered a new Audi S3, with a Generation II (bluetooth) phone preparation.<br />
<br />
I have been looking into this for a little while, as I have a Nokia N95, I also have a Nokia 8800 Sirocco. Checking other posts out there is some information to be had.<br />
<br />
I have been at the dealers (I dont pick the car up for two weeks yet) doing some limited tests.<br />
<br />
What I have found is:<br />
The N95 works ok. With the exception of it copying the phonebook from the phone to the car. The other functions such as the call handling, network signal power, network ID etc operate OK.<br />
<br />
The 8800 Sirocco, seems to work completely with all the operations working.<br />
<br />
The N95 is a Nokia S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 Handset (symbian based)<br />
The 8800 Sirocco is a S40 handset.<br />
<br />
The symbian handset doesnt have the Bluetooth Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP) and this is what is stopping the phone book being copied across to the car. Reading other posts on this discussion group, it would appear that Nokia are "looking" to add this at
 a later date (I wouldnt hold my breath on that though) with a Software Update, as far as I can tell no Symbian handset by Nokia has this bluetooth profile.<br />
The next thing is the 810 contacts push software, which appears to have had limited success with the MMI. There are two things that you need to bear in mind before using the 810 push software.<br />
<br />
First, your MMI system needs to have the latest version of the software, now this may have to be installed by the Dealer with the diagnostic equipment, or it might (not 100% sure about this SO CHECK!) be updated with the latest mapping disc from your Audi Dealer.
 Also worth checking that you have the latest software on your N95.<br />
<br />
Second, with the 810 contact push/downloader installed in the phone, you need to delete the pairing from BOTH the car and the phone after this ensure that the 810 push is still running and then re pair the phone to the car, it should then download the contacts
 from the N95 to the car, again other users here have said it takes a while, and sometimes fails.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

            Thatâ€™s interesting what you are saying about the PBAP capability in the N95. But I wonâ€™t be holding my breath for a fix of the N95. I went a head and ditched the mobile yesterday. But if there was a way of linking an N95 to my Audi Iâ€™d switch back tomorrow
 â€“ itâ€™s quite a stunning device.<br />
<br />
With regards to the 810 contacts application from Nokia. I went though the procedure of deâ€“coupling from both sides and all that, but from what I understand the Audi has to establish the connection while the contacts application is running. There would appear
 to be two different Bluetooth MMI versions available, one which can search for Bluetooth devices and the other which cannot. I have the latter â€œFSEâ€ version which canâ€™t search for devices. I canâ€™t therefore establish a new connection.<br />
<br />
The idea that Audi might be able to update the MMI system had crossed my mind, but there are no such reports on the web which I have come across. Thanks for the helpful suggestions anyway. It would be nice to hear some kind of response from Nokia. I think itâ€™s
 a rather arrogant approach to simply stick their head in the ground and pretend the world revolves around them. Like I said at the beginning these problems where first reported in January 2007!<br />
<br />
Anyone else out there feeling disappointed?<br />

            You have to wonder why on earth they removed PBAP - they must have known that a lot of car systems use it.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a retrograde step to me.

Whilst pretty big has some extra detail from what I have found here.<br />
<br />
Have a look through and see if you can pick up some extra snippits of info.<br />
<br />
As far as I know the 810 application is set to run from starting the phone, and should be running in the background all the time.<br />
<br />
Will give it a go with my S3 (which should have the latest everything seeing as it was built on July 24th!)<br />
<br />
As for the PBAP - I dont think that there are any Symbian handsets which contain that profile.<br />

<li>In File &gt; Options &gt; Save, check the two boxes for "Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files" and "Save to computer by default". ["Backstage" is what Microsoft calls all the things on the File tab.] In the "Default local file location" box,
 enter the path to the folder you use most often, or the parent folder of a group of often-used subfolders.</li><li>To open an existing document, use the Ctrl+O shortcut to pop up the Open dialog box. To save a document for the first time or to save it as a different file, use the F12 key to pop up the Save As dialog box.</li><li>For folders you use frequently, add them to the Quick Access list. In the Open dialog, the Save As dialog, or the File Explorer program (which are all the same code), right-click any folder and click Pin to Quick Access. The folder will appear in the list
 at the top of the left panel until you remove it.</li></ul>

<h2>            Being billed by Skype but no record of purchased skype number or billing info on account</h2>
                    I login to https://secure.skype.com. Go to Manage Features section and select 'Skype Number' and it behaves as if I've no number. I have purchased a number and I'm being billed for it every quarter. Under 'billing information' section no invoices are being
 displayed. I also receive no email notification each time the money is taken from my account. I need to cancel that number and get a new one.
