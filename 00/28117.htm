    <title>Support for multiple genres - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Support for multiple genres</h2>
                    
<p>I have a collection of music originally curated in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; Some music there is currently labeled with multiple genres, making it easy to create very specific and very broad playlists based on genre criteria.&nbsp; Now that I have a Windows Phone,
 I expect I'll be using Zune as my default PC music center, and would really like to see multiple genre functionality supported in both Zune and on the phone.&nbsp; In the meantime, since you show "Multiple Genres" in the UI, it might be really helpful for there
 to be a Help item added that addresses this.</p>
<p>On a related note, there were a couple of threads about this topic in the Zune forum at one time (e.g., one was at<a href="http://forums.zune.net/0/1/548284/ShowPost.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.zune.net/0/1/548284/ShowPost.aspx</a>).&nbsp; Since such threads still seem
 relevant, why are these no longer visible in the Forums?</p>
<p>-Chris</p>

<p>Yes, this would be a nice feature and I really liked it on Windows Media Player. (But no device ever implemented, to my knowledge.) I've wanted this since day one, as well as multiple discrete artists per song (Zune basically just ignores all but the first
 one now)... but it never happened. I guess it's just too much of a fringe feature to make the feature list.</p>
<p>Regarding previous threads... that's because Microsoft took the old forum off-line with no notice, redirected the URL to the Answers site, and didn't tell anyone before they did it. I can't even reference complicated postings I made, so I'd need to rewrite
 them. :-( What a loss... it should have been left as a read-only archive.</p>

    <title>How do I roll back MSE to a previous version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I roll back MSE to a previous version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why do I want to do this?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This printer that I'm trying to use, which has been a problem since the beginning, only prints blank pages. After having read the original post on
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/recent-security-update-from-windows-kb2902885/c16deacc-fea6-460e-a109-a4ed8ffdce51">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/recent-security-update-from-windows-kb2902885/c16deacc-fea6-460e-a109-a4ed8ffdce51</a>, I suspect MSE to be a possibility, so as part of troubleshooting, I want to try to roll it back.
 I'm not talking about signature updates, I want to roll back to a client version before 4.4.340.0. I'm not interested in printer help, I just want to try this and see if it helps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, the computer that I want to roll back MSE on is not my primary computer that I normally use.</p>

            <p>You might try System Restore, but that may make things worse.</p>
<p>An uninstall would be the only way to remove MSE and then you'd have to have saved a copy or seek out an unsupported copy of the prior installer version.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd first simply disable MSE protection and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that I've given up using the features of an HP all in one via wireless as I've had to reinstall the HP software multiple times for no apparent reason when the FAX and Scan components failed to work.</p>

    <title>All email received from my domain are marked as spam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rofaic  say:</h3>
<h2>            All email received from my domain are marked as spam</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently created a new App, which supports modules like forgot passwords and welcome emails to users. Every email sent to Hotmail emails however goes directly to SPAM event though I implemented all possible verification (including&nbsp;SPF,&nbsp;dkim and&nbsp;dmarc).</p>
<p>Here are some extract of the message headers.</p>
<p>Reverse DNS match the actual domain name.</p>
<p>
Authentication-Results: spf=pass (sender IP is 78.129.155.223)<br />
&nbsp;smtp.mailfrom=flink.fit; hotmail.com; dkim=pass (signature was verified)<br />
&nbsp;header.d=flink.fit;hotmail.com; dmarc=pass action=none header.from=flink.fit;<br />
Received-SPF: Pass (protection.outlook.com: domain of flink.fit designates<br />
&nbsp;78.129.155.223 as permitted sender) receiver=protection.outlook.com;<br />
&nbsp;client-ip=78.129.155.223; helo= mail.flink.fit;<br />
</p><p>
CMM-Authentication-Results: hotmail.com; spf=pass (sender IP is<br />
&nbsp;78.129.155.223; identity alignment result is pass and alignment mode is<br />
&nbsp;relaxed) *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; dkim=pass (identity alignment<br />
&nbsp;result is pass and alignment mode is relaxed) header.d=flink.fit; x-hmca=pass<br />
&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
CMM-X-SID-PRA: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
CMM-X-AUTH-Result: PASS<br />
CMM-X-SID-Result: PASS<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As you can see everything is marked as PASS, no errors, but the email is still marked as SPAM with the following SCL and PCL ratings.</p>
<p>
X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL: 5<br />
X-MS-Exchange-Organization-PCL: 2<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I really don't know which additional checks I can implement. Did anyone experience this behavior or can suggest a possible solution?</p>
<p>Is it possible to open a ticket about this?</p>

<p>What's a Span Blacklist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked MS for years how I can work the blocked function for emails and domains in Outlook that worked so well in Windows Live Mail, but not even a single answer or response from MS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, suddenly, every email to my MSN account that I've had for 10 years, automatically goes into junk:</p>
<p>the last live email in my MSN account is from mid-2016&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, of course, MS won't restore my Outlook.com account for some reason they won't explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to go to Gmail just to have simple email functions work?</p>

<p>A Mail Blacklist is where an individual,&nbsp;company, server, or mail server is blacklisted as being a sender of spam.
</p>
<p>Other companies will subscribe to the list so that their mail servers can better determine what is psam.</p>
<p>

Answer: This message might appear if an adult's Microsoft account is missing certain information, such as the account owner's date of birth or country/region. Sign in to

            Well, as I previously said, both those items were present. However, just to try it, I went into the edit function for personal information, and deleted and reentered those data. For whatever reason, the system now apparently considers me adult enough to
 get apps without an(other) adult's approval. Go figure.

<h3> garethd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Android app &#34;from&#58;&#34; header</h2>
                    <p>When I send an Outlook.com email from the Outlook Android app, the email is sent with only my email address rather than my name in the email from header: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** instead of "Firstname Lastname".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option I can see in the app settings to change this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook server settings for my account are all correct - when I send an email via the Outlook web interface, everything works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure I'm missing something that's easy to fix but I can't find it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            delete record in subform&#58; recordset vs delete query</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am still unclear about the these two methods:</p>
<p>if i use a delete query to delete a record from a subform, this works fine...(been told "it is the proper way")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Private Sub txtQuantity_DblClick(Cancel As Integer)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim myUnitSoldID As Long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myUnitSoldID = Me.Text77 <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'create Query string<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "DELETE * FROM tblInvoicesDetails WHERE UnitSoldID=" &amp; myUnitSoldID<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.RunSQL strSQL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Requery</p>
<p>end sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I have 50 records already displayed on a subform why would I, in order to delete only one, want to tell access to look again for 49 records that were already on the subform? also, the subform, at least on mine, displays a "deleted" text for a split
 second before the record disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if instead I delete the record from the recordset, I will delete only what I need (1 record) and the form is not queried unnecessarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub txtQuantity_DblClick(Cancel As Integer)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error GoTo ErrorHandler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
'delete current record from invoice form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Recordset.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Recordset.MoveNext<br />
<br />
ExitSub:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
ErrorHandler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Number &amp; " " &amp; Err.Description<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume ExitSub<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>I probably have it all wrong but could not find much of an answer on the net</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>"Under the hood," the actions are probably identical. &nbsp;If you use Recordset.Delete, the form still has to Requery, but there's the added benefit of no "flash" of #Deleted, and the form will probably be left on the "next" record rather than the first one.
 &nbsp;But you have to be careful that you're deleting the correct record. &nbsp;I would do:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Private Sub txtQuantity_DblClick(Cancel As Integer)</span><br />
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Dim rst As DAO.Recordset</span></span></p>
<p><span>' Get a copy of the form's recordset</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Set rst = Me.Recordset</span></p>
<p><span>' Point to the current record</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; rst.Bookmark = Me.Bookmark<br />
<br />
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; Set rst = Nothing</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit Sub</span><br />

            I started getting this error with the current build when restarting from the power option in the start menu. I have found if I right click the start button and select restart from that menu I do not have the error. Also I did a sign out and then did a
 restart from the power option on the login screen and did not have this error. Must be some different code behind the scene.

<h2>            Problems with microSD after upgrading to Windows mobile 10</h2>
                    I bought for my wife before 6 months a Lumia 640 dual sim. Worked perfect with the microSD until the upgrade to WM10. Need scanning every time she opens the device, looses photos and blocks access to applications which are stored at the microSD card. For
 now I changed the storage option to the device. Is there hope to be solved with the anniversary update?

<h2>            Excel calendar dates and information into a calendar format</h2>
                    I work at a school and this school year, we decided to move our calendar to our new website.&nbsp; The downside to this is that we do not have a calendar that we can print out in a user-friendly format like Publisher calendars.&nbsp; The calendar information is
 currently stored in Excel.&nbsp; My question is this:&nbsp; Is there a way to take that information that is in Excel and import or merge into a calendar that we could print out?

            <p>I have a lot of answers for this, and none of them really have to do with Excel. You're also not clear on the actual question. Do you need a calendar like a Publisher Calendar? Or do you need a calendar that works on a website? Or both? Or what? Here's some
 preliminary info:</p>
<p>--If you're wanting to put it on the web, why not search Google for a "free web-based calendar"? Perhaps they have one that will take your Excel data. This assumes your data starts in Row 2 and you have headings in Row 1, and only one row per event.</p>
<p>--You could make a Word calendar (File--New--Calendar and there's all kinds there, but you'll have to move on to Word Mail merge to populate it. Same data rules apply with the Excel file as above.</p>

            We were wanting to put it into a Publisher calendar.&nbsp; Our school moved to a new website and the calendar is on there.&nbsp; It's just difficult to print out in a month's view and all the info is not there when we print it off.&nbsp; We used to have a calendar typed
 up in Publisher with all the school events listed each day.&nbsp; We did not want to go back to having to type the calendar events in Publisher; we were trying to look for a way to mail merge the info into a calendar - - something like we did in Publisher.

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Visio 2016 volume licensed with Project 2016 cloud based</h2>
                    <p>I need to install Visio 2016 on the same computer that has Project 2016. Visio is volume licensed. Project is a monthly subscription. The first error told me to uninstall 38a6a2d4.msi. The next error was:</p>
<p>We found a problem!</p>
<p>We're sorry, Microsoft Office installer encountered a problem because you have these Click-to-Run installer based Office programs installed on your computer:</p>
<p>Microsoft Project Professional 2016 - en-us</p>
<p>Windows Installer and Click-to-Run editions of Office programs don't get along for this version, so you can only have one type installed at a time. Please try installing the Click-to-Run edition of Office instead, or uninstall your other Click-to-Run based
 Office programs and try this installation again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First question is for Microsoft... - REALLY MICROSOFT? You created the operation system and the programs and you made them incompatible with each other. Come on Microsoft - I thought you were better than this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second - I downloaded the Office Deployment Tool but the sample files are for 2019. Can I modify them for 2016 even though it says to only use it for 2019? If I just try to run setup.exe it flashes on the screen and goes away doing absolutely nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third - Can I uninstall Project, install Visio, and then go back and reinstall Project, or will I get a similar error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jessica :)</p>

<p>So I uninstalled Project and installed Visio and now can't reinstall Project. We get a similar error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied a config file from microsoft and modified it but it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to switch it around after I swapped the programs to install Project but Project is cloud-based so I don't have a volume license key for it like I do Visio. So I think Project has to be installed first and then the volume license Visio second, but
 the config file has to be correct. Either way all it does is flash on the screen and go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt;Add OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Product ID="VisioStd2016Volume" PIDKEY="<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Visio Standard 2016 C2R-P for use with the Office Deployment Tool</span>"&gt;
 I changed this to hide my key.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Product&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/Add&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It's so confusing.&nbsp;</p>

                    Can't print from any Office 2007 application. Trued Word, Excel, Powerpoint. None will print anything. Even a new document. Printer works outside of Office. Even the XPS "printer" doesn't work. Repair of Office 2007 didn't work either.

<p><span>Is that happening only with the Office Applications? Try printing through Internet explorer or through the Notepad. If you are
 able to print through Internet Explorer and Notepad, then try repairing Office applications.</span></p>

<p><span>If it’s not printing with any of these then you have to contact the printer manufacturer and ask them to update the printer

Hi, <br />
<br />
Glad you reached out! Iris scanner and PIN are the only security features that Lumia 950 supports. However, you may try installing a Lock Screen application from Windows Store that has password security feature. You may also want to send a suggestion via our
 Feedback Hub.

            WinAmp lets you convert into AAC or eAAC<br />
<br />
iTunes can also convert to AAC (Mpeg4)into .M4a container.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player 11 allows you to convert to WMA which is "similar" to mpeg4 in terms of compression.<br />
<br />
There are many many other programs also to convert audio files.

            If you convert mp3 into aac the sound quality goes down. If yo have the music on CD it's better to rip it straight to aac instead of trying to convert from mp3.

    <title>Audio files won&#39;t play in Powerpoint 2011 14.1 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio files won&#39;t play in Powerpoint 2011 14.1 for Mac</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have Powerpoint 2011 version 14.1 installed on one of my Mac laptops and it will not play inserted m4a audio files. The speaker icon shows up in the slide butnothing happens when clicking the icons/ the audio will not play. If I save this powerpoint presentation
 and try it on my other Mac laptop running Powerpoint 14.0 (still 2011) these icons will play the audio; so the audio is being embedded and clearly this problem has something to do with this version (14.1) and maybe the OS (MacBook Pro OSX 10.6.8) ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, on my other laptop running Powerpoint 14.0 I do not have these problems (OSX 10.8.4). But any presentation that runs successfully on it will still not play in the 14.1 version on the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my products are registered and although I don't have access to my install discs (in storage in another country), is there some way I can uninstall 14.1 and download/revert to 14.0 since I have my product key, etc.? I'm guessing this is just a bug with
 14.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>If your version info is accurate, that's the most likely cause of the problem... Both Macs need to have their Office 2011 installations updated. Version
<strong>14.4.1</strong> is the current update level. See the suggested procedure on this web page:
<a href="http://www.office.mvps.org/install/reinstall_office2011.html#update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update Office 2011</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 14.0 Mac you'll need to apply 14.1.0 first, then run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions. On the 14.1 system you can go directly to the 14.4.1 update. Repair permissions on each Mac &amp; Restart once 14.4.1 is applied.</p>

    <title>Lumia 630 resuming-loading exit problem &#40;with random apps&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lumia 630 resuming-loading exit problem &#40;with random apps&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing an irritating issue with my Lumia 630 since day one. One or two times a day when I open an app a black screen says "resuming" then "loading"</p>
<p>and then phone just resumes to the homescreen . It happens with random apps sometimes including messaging .</p>
<p>it seems to be an issue related with less amount of RAM in 630 but apart from these loading -resuming -exit times phone can easily handle more than a practical multitasking. Also if RAM is filled by so many parallel apps phone says resuming for a second
 and continue with the concerned app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when problem occurs phone cant even run a single app like messaging.</p>
<p>when I looked for the solution I find same problem with Lumia 1520 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows the solution please share . I will take my phone to service centre but they will only reinstall os .(a solution for all problemem)</p>
<p>I went there for screen dim problem ( when I open lock to use the phone ) that time also they said phone requires reinstalling OS ..but on this community users with same screen dim problem reported no effect of new OS .</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try updating the apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try uninstalling/reinstalling the troublesome app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use Nokia Reset tool</p>
