<h2>            Microsoft Runtime DLL Installer error</h2>
                    I have been attempting to load a Reckon program from disc (I've tried 2 different discs, same program) I get a msg that the program couldn't load Microsoft Runtime, so load fails. I have another Reckon program on my pc, which works fine.&nbsp; I've also been
 trying to download VMware, and get the same issue..." Set-up cannot continue. The Microsoft Runtime DLL Installer failed to complete installation". Microsoft support say I should contact the manufacturer, but Microsoft
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is</strong></span> the manufacturer and I have the same issue with products from&nbsp; 2 totally different software providers?? Any thoughts would be really appreciated. Thanks

            I have got the same issue when i try to install Vmware Workstation Pro on Windows 10. I just right click on the installer file, and click "run as administrator". My PC required me to enter my admin password so i did, and it installed successfully.

            Thanks for taking the time to reply....I have tried several times to ensure I am operating as administrator, and did as you did and right clicked on the installer...on my pc it just ticks to say that I am the administrator (doesn't ask for a password),
 unfortunately on mine it doesn't make any difference...Runtime still won't load. But thanks again for your help.

            Thank you <span>Gina Cool for your reply...I had read somewhere that the CD drive may be the issue, and have just tried again now to install VM after disabling the drive, but unfortunately that's not the problem. Once again, thanks for taking time to reply,

<h2>            Recording on Skype.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was recently speaking with someone on Skype and everything they said were being typed at the same time( like a voice recognition thing) and the whole chat was copied on my end. I Do not know if my words were being recorded this way on the other
 person's end too. I deleted the chat. Does deleting the chat, delete the chat on the other person's device also?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn't it a violation of privacy to record someone without their permission? Anybody knows which version of Skype does this kind of recording?</p>

</p><p>Let's start with this: what you describe sounds a lot like Skype Translator. These FAQ articles explain how Skype Translator works:</p>

</p><p><em>Does deleting the chat, delete the chat on the other person's device also?
</em></p>
<p>No, it does not - only on your side.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Anybody knows which version of Skype does this kind of recording?</em></p>
<p>As explained, above, sounds like the Skype Translator feature may have been in use.</p>
<p>Skype does not include - and has never included - a call recording capability in any of the software versions or mobile apps, meaning there is no feature to record an audio-only or video call.</p>

<h2>            Does Microsoft actuallly have any REAL people on their chat system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to report to anyone at Microsoft&nbsp;that their grammar checking algorithm used in Word&nbsp;and&nbsp;Outlook does not understand the difference between there, their and they're.&nbsp; I've concluded that the site is a machine pretending to be human.&nbsp; With a queue
 length of zero,&nbsp; I should have guessed it was a lie that I was being connected to a person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>example:</p>

<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The</span> restriction does not apply with there only being one installed device.&nbsp;"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Microsoft wants "there" to be "their".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>there&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &nbsp;a location, physical or existentially,&nbsp; doesn't matter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; =&nbsp; possession of them</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>they're&nbsp; =&nbsp; the contraction of "they are"</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyone who speaks English as their native language&nbsp; and didn't fail third grade in elementary school will agree that the sentence&nbsp;
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">"The</span> restriction does not apply with their only being one installed device.&nbsp;" is quite simply wrong.</span></span></p>
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">"The</span> restriction does not apply with their only being one installed device.&nbsp;" is quite simply wrong.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first response was inappropriate, having missed the point.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was directed to a link related to the latest Outlook release&nbsp;with instructions on how to use the grammar checker,&nbsp; as if there were a flag that could be set to choose between "Check Grammar
 Properly" and "Check Grammar Wrong".&nbsp; The next reply was at least related to the proper release of Outlook but was equally off the mark.&nbsp; I asked if the respondent spoke English as a primary language since they didn't understand what I was saying about the
 grammar blunder.&nbsp; They responded off subject.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked if they were really human to which they said "yes", of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed up with "Prove it, add one to seven and SPELL the answer",&nbsp; they got confused and ran off on a&nbsp;nonsense tangent. &nbsp;I gave up
 and dropped the session 100% convinced I was either dealing with a machine or a moron.&nbsp; Almost instantly I got a follow-up email asking how satisfied I was with the interaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email suggested that if dissatisfied,&nbsp; I could open another session referencing the first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started by requesting a human, ..., again, and reporting that my real concern was that I was stuck interacting with a machine in the prior session that didn't understand the problem.&nbsp; My FIRST request was for them to prove they were human.&nbsp; I asked again
 with a little twist&nbsp;"Please add one to seven and SPELL the answer but deliberately spell it wrong by reversing the e and the i".&nbsp;&nbsp; I could swear it was as if I were talking to the robot in "Lost In Space", "Does not compute Will Robinson".&nbsp; They either hire
 people who have absolutely no clue, or this is a machine.&nbsp; My bet,&nbsp; a machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever get a machine on a robocall pretending to be human?&nbsp;&nbsp; Its funny. &nbsp;One of these days I'll get one to self destruct by saying "rm -r *", "fdisk"&nbsp;, "halt",&nbsp; "del /s *,*" or
 similar.&nbsp; To date, I've not been successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp; common feeling or has anyone ever had an interaction that felt like it was really human?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

    <title>My Internet works for a short time, before it stops working every time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laughablechimp  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Internet works for a short time, before it stops working every time it connects.</h2>
                    <p>My internet suddenly encountered this weird problem today. I've confirmed that its something to do with my laptop since other devices can connect just fine and it seems to be unable to work with multiple different connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all the details first. Firstly, the laptop takes a lot of time to connect with the router, more than normally before suddenly the wifi icon shifts to the disabled connections icon. Once I click on it, it suddenly shows that I've connected to the router
 and there seems to be no problems. Internet works.....for a few seconds. Then, no data or occasionally barely any data goes through. I've confirmed this as I can google precisely 1 webpage if I'm quick enough before it fails and the network activity through
 task manager supports this. Its connected to the router, just not the internet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting to my hotspot also shows the same thing, just without the short connection. It just doesn't work straight away and for some reason is harder to connect to it sometimes requiring multiple tries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried troubleshooting through windows and its giving me some weird results. Basically, one troubleshoot can give me a selection of different results, different than if I troubleshoot it again to the point that I don't know which result is correct. And
 I know some results are wrong since they say something is wrong with the router, which I know to be false. Sometimes, the wifi disconnects mid-troubleshoot for some reason, further giving me false results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, I do know it has something to do with the IPV6. IPV4 has internet but it doesn't seem to be able to connect through IPV6. I can't seem to disable it either through my attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, that's all I have. And I have tried a lot of things to fix this from updating the drivers, to going through the command prompt and of corse restarting the router. But for all I know, I could've done any of these steps wrongly. Please help.</p>
<p>

An incompatible wireless network drive is one of the possible reasons why your Internet connection frequently disconnects. The issue might also occur if the third party applications/programs is conflicting with the network drivers installed on the computer.
 Kindly try to reinstall the driver by opening the <strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we suggest that you try to running your computer in clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or connecting to the Internet. You can follow the steps in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to run your computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
Note: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.
<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.

<p>I connected a JVC Gr-d290us (MiniDV camcorder) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like the Canon ZR960 there is no imaging device identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My printer is correctly identified as an imaging device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have another desktop to install my Rosewell RC504, so can't easily crosscheck&nbsp;</p>
<p>that issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question comes to mind,&nbsp; are "imaging device" drivers supposed to be automatically</p>
<p>loaded at boot up? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to test the 1394 port ?&nbsp; The RC504 is identified in the IEEE 1394 managing devices</p>
<p>area.&nbsp; I wonder if the &nbsp; RC504 is actually working correctly?&nbsp; Manage devices "says" it is working correctly.</p>

<p>It looks like the manufacturer of the device you're trying to install didn't release drivers to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, we suggest that you contact your manufacturer and ask for the legacy drivers of the device for Windows 7. Once you have the file of the drivers, right-click on it and choose
<strong>Extract</strong>. Once done, add it as a legacy driver. To do so, see the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; <strong>Action </strong>&gt; <strong>Add legacy hardware</strong>. Follow the virtual steps to add a hardware.</li><li>Once done, it will show you the common hardware types; then, choose <strong>IEEE 1394 host controllers</strong>.</li><li>After choosing IEEE 1394 host controllers, it will show you the page to select the manufacturer and model of your hardware.</li><li>To choose for the legacy driver you've extracted, click <strong>Have Disk</strong> &gt;
<strong>Browse</strong>. Now it will show you the window to locate the file.</li></ol>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You may have developed a hardware issue. Check with Dell Support and ask<br />
in their forums about any knows issue. Unusual I will admit however with<br />
millions of folks upgrading there will be a few that have an untimely hardware<br />
issue. Of course it could be BIOS, chipset, other compatibility problems.<br />

You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. You
<p>would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool<strong>.&nbsp;Since you tried a USB make a DVD and use it. Watch the screen</strong><br />
<strong>as the computer boots and&nbsp;enter Setup to set to boot to&nbsp;CD/DVD 1st.</strong><br />

    <title>How to bypass User account password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to bypass User account password</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, there, can somebody help me to solve this issue?
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I use Windows 7 home edition and I set up a user account with password for my son. But my son can by pass the password&nbsp;and get into the&nbsp;computer without any password. Can you please tell me how he
 can do this? In addition, now he sets up an administer account on my computer without any password. Thus, my account becomes another administrator account with password. I cannot delete the administer account created by my son. I guess that my son used DOS
 to bypass the password and then he can use my computer. Does any one have the same experiences and would you please share with me how I can stop my son from doing this?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks, </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Anyone who has the appropriate tools and skills can do what your son did. I could do it too. It is a fact with all operating systems that there are methods to access a machine without passwords, provided that you have physical access to the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a laptop then you can set a BIOS password to prevent your son from using it. However, if you happen to forget the BIOS password then you will need to send the machine to the distributor. You will be locked out the same as everyone else.</p>

<h2>            Display drivers stopped have responding and have recovered windows 7</h2>
                    I,m wondering if anyone has found an answer to this problem. My graphics card has worked well until I upgraded from XP to windows 7. After the upgrade my screen will flash or blink then show the message ( Display drivers stopped responding and have recovered)
 I have installed the latest drivers from AMD. My card is a Visiontek Radeon HD 2400 Pro AGP.

WIn 7 has a higher system requirement (by far) than XP.&nbsp; Yours just meets the minimum specs for win 7. (256mb)<br />
<br />
That is often related to heat.&nbsp; I suggest you download cpu-z &amp; gpu-z and keep an eye on the temps<br />

            <p>Hi Willie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular error message indicates that you do not have the required drivers for the display adaptor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 you will need to download and install the latest set of drivers for the display card adaptor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link for the AMD ATI website:</p>

<div>I have installed drivers from AMD and Visiontek, Visiontek is the name on the video card. The driver I have installed now is ver 8.723.0.0 date 4-6-10 Just this morning I had it happen. From what I've been reading it's going to take someone more tech savvy
 then me to fix this. It seems that the time that windows waits need to be changed, and that calls for messing around in the registry. I don't know if this issue is that critical or just a irritating inconvenience. Will it cause a system crash or will it just
 cause video loss. Also when I changed the drivers I lost the wddm 1.1 software, don't know if that matters.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
Issue Description:
<p>
<span>During startup or use of an application, (most commonly a game / video application) the system or application will freeze, crash or exit to the
 desktop / a blue screen (BSOD). Additionally, an error message appears stating that the “Display driver stopped responding and has recovered” and may reference one of the following driver files:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>ATIKMDAG.sys</span></li><li>
<span>ATI2DVAG.sys</span></li><li>
<span>ATI2CQAG.dll</span></li><li>
<span>ATIVPK.sys</span></li><li>
<span>AMD2DVAG.sys</span></li><li>
<span>AMDKMDAG.sys</span></li><li>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Issue Cause:
<p>
The issue occurs when the Timeout Detection and Recovery (TDR) feature available in Windows Vista® and Windows 7 detects that the graphics card (GPU)&nbsp;has not responded within a predetermined period of time and reinitializes it with the Windows Display Driver
 Model (WDDM) to prevent the need to reboot. There is no single cause for a TDR event to be triggered.</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/wddm_timeout.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Additional Details</a><span>&nbsp;about
 TDR events can be found on Microsoft’s website.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen
<strong><span>before sign-in. </span>
</strong><span>I suggest you </span><span>to tr</span></span><span>y connecting to different video outputs on
 the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li>
<span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li>
<span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to boot to Safe Mode with Low video resolution mode and check. If the operating system is able to boot successfully and allows you to log on to your computer with an
 administrator account, entering into Windows 10 Safe Mode should be easy (and so would rectifying the issue). Boot the computer to Safe mode and check if it persists. Follow the steps given below to boot the computer in safe mode.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Shift Key</span><span> and then restart your computer,
</span></li><li>
<span>Windows 10 will reboot and ask you to select an option. Choose
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>Then, on the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> screen, select
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">options</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>On the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Advanced</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">options</span><span> screen, choose
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Startup</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Settings</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>Windows 10 notifies you that you can restart your device in order to change advanced boot options, including enabling
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span>. Press
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Restart</span><span>.</span></li><li>
<span>After Windows 10 reboots, you can choose which boot options you want enabled. To get into
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span>, you have three different options.
</span></li><li>
<span>To enable </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Safe</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Mode</span><span> press the
</span><span style="font-style: italic">F4</span><span> key on your keyboard.</span></li></ol>
<p>Select Safe Mode with Low video resolution and check, let us know the status of the issue.</p>

            Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and<br />
memory when you get to those sections and then return back to the trouble-<br />
shooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0x50: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA<br />
<br />
</strong>The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</p>
<br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased <br />
Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses.</li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA Parameters

</p><p>If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE_STRING)
<strong>KiBugCheckDriver</strong>.</p>
<br />
<strong>Cause <br />
<br />
</strong>Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).
<p><br />
Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p><br />
Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</strong> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the
 system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a faulty system service problem:</strong> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer,
 and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving an antivirus software problem:</strong> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</strong> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI
 controller and the disk.</p>
<p><br />
Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.</p>
Remarks
<p><br />
Typically, this address is in freed memory or is simply invalid.</p>
<p><br />
This cannot be protected by a <strong>try - except</strong> handler -- it can only be protected by a probe.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low</p>
<p>level chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h3> remeez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 64 bit shutting down after idle for 2-3 hours</h2>
                    <p>I've got a Windows 10 desktop that shuts down after 1-3 hours idle. No bluescreen, just shuts off. This has been going on for at least 5 months and was occurring when I had Windows 8 as well. I don't think it's bluescreening, I've sat here and just watched
 the pc and it just turns off. All I can get out of EventViewer is "The previous system shutdown at &lt;time&gt; on ‎&lt;date&gt; was unexpected. The shutdowns are at no particular time; just 1-3 hours after I leave the pc. When I turn the PC on it first goes to the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone into power management and turned off every "go to sleep" setting. I have 3 USB devices plugged in. I've updated all my drivers. I don't think it's heat, or at least I don't understand how it could be that, it's liquid cooled and is fine running
 new games at high settings for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>

    <title>Creating An Image With A Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Creating An Image With A Laptop</h2>
                    <p>My wife will be receiving a new laptop tomorrow. I'm concerned about how to save an image in case of a HD failure. Most laptops, as you know, have only one HD. What is the best way to create a bootable image without saving it on the laptops HD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even-though this would be a lengthy process, why couldn't a backup image be sent through a network to my desktop computer and stored on that computers slave drive?. I was told I could do this but it wouldn't be bootable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the input. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Randy</p>

            <div>I fully support your approach. I buy a few dozen machines each year and I create an image of each and every one.</div>
<div><br />
Here are a few answers to your questions:
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>The standard way</b>.<br />
- Buy a 2.5" hard disk in a USB case.<br />
- Use the native image creation tool (Control Panel / Backup and Restore) to create an image which you park on the USB disk.<br />
- Burn a Windows Repair CD (same location as before).<br />
- Check if you can boot the machine with this CD and if it recognises the image you created.<br />
Advantage: No software cost.<br />
Drawbacks: Poor functionality and unsatisfactory reliability of the image creation tool.</li><li><b>The best way</b>.<br />
- Buy a mature third party image creation tool.<br />
- The rest is as above. Remember to burn and test the bootable Rescue CD!<br />
Advantage: Good functionality and reliability.<br />
Drawback: Depending on what you select, the image tool might cost some money.</li><li><b>Network storage</b>.<br />
You can do this provided that the image tool lets you store and retrieve image files via the network. It is mandatory to test the method. Remember that an untested backup method is close to useless.</li></ul>

            <p>Check the applications provided with the laptop. Apart from the recovery tool which depends on the HDD itself being OK quite a few also include a disk creation utility. You have to provide the blank DVDs but the tool then burns them with the images needed
 to restore the system in case of an actual disk failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set created on my Acer actually recreated the recovery partition on the hard disk then used that to rebuild the Windows itself.</p>

            <p>These are all good suggestions but require another hardware or just install the OS instead of an image.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps creating an image to another networked computer over a wireless router might be asking much&nbsp;including the time to do such a task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me, the laptop should be able to create a image recover disk which would be able to access the drive on the desktop where the image is stored. All being done by the BIOS. Transfer would be done by USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a way, isn't this the way its done on Windows 7 image recovery?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
