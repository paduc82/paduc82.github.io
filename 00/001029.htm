<h2>            sms backup &#43;</h2>
                    <p>I set up sms backup +, and had it send all old text messages to my G-Mail account. When I went to check my G-Mail it is only showing the text messages from the sender, not from me.&nbsp; I want to have the whole conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7</p>
<p>Laptop is Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t see certain OneNote notebooks on Windows 10 App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I created 4 notebooks on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 (Android app). I also had the option to open up any of the other notebooks I had associated with my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, these notebooks created on my Tab S3 don't show up on my Windows 10 app. They exist, as you can see them on OneDrive (Windows Explorer or the website) and OneNote through a browser shows those 4 notebooks. But they don't exist on the Windows app.
 I've tried resetting the Windows app but they still do not show up. They also do exist because if I try making a new one with the same name the app gives me an error saying that it already exists.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted or outdated application may be the possible reason why you're unable to see the notebooks in your OneNote apps. To efficiently assist you, we'd like to gather more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried checking if there is a recent update for your OneNote?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling then reinstalling your OneNote?</li><li>Have you tried creating another notebook and did you get any error message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Tried all of these, unfortunately nothing has helped.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was on the most recent version.</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling also did nothing to help.</li><li>Creating a new notebook does nothing. No error message, just nothing happens.

</p><p>Just sign in to OneDrive via your web browser, navigate to Documents where your Notebooks are stored and open each notebook inside the browser. Then go back to the App and click "More Notebooks" and they should magically appear there.</p>

<p>This works for me. Basically just open the notebook on the web version, and it'll appear on your "More Notebooks" section on desktop version. In my case I created the notebook on an android device. The OneNote team should probably fix this.</p>

            Not sure if this is as much of a fix but its a work around.&nbsp; So what I have noticed is that if I start a new notebook in onenote on my phone it is not visible on onenote on pc but it is visible in onenote 2016.&nbsp; So I'm thinking its some compatibility issue.
 To remedy the problem start all potential notebooks in onenote on PC first then sync and open the notebooks on your phone onenote app.&nbsp; At that point I have been able to add to it and changes will be visible back and forth.&nbsp;

    <title>Office 365 impacting 32bit app printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oneofmany63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 impacting 32bit app printing</h2>
                    <p>We just setup our business with Office 365. We use (and have been using for the last 15 years) a myself custom-written software based on an older Borland 32bit software to manage our purchasing/sales/inventory. I run Win8.1Pro, the rest of our systems run
 Win7Pro SP1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We have all installed the Office suite including Outlook and Lync from the portal, and everything is fine on all systems except mine. After installing, when I either use the provided Print Setup / Print in the framework, or use the Print code on any form
 we use, it immediately causes the application to crash. I've tried reinstalling the database software, reinstalling print driver to no avail. I rollback using System Restore, and all is fine. The Win7 Pro systems are not experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What in the Office 365 install is affecting the print sub system to cause this? Is there a known workaround or patch? I have been unable to find anything so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grant</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the delay in responding to this topic, as it was necessary for me to get this system back in a usable state. Removing Office365 and reinstalling the database software fixed the problem, however using webmail is not great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software: Borland Paradox 32bit for Windows 95.</p>
<p>Application: Custom written form-based</p>
<p>Printers: HP LaserJet M1522nf , Bullzip PDF Printer</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: When Office365 is downloaded/installed it immediately causes the application to crash anytime it invokes a printing call - whether Print Setup / Print from the File Menu of the default application, or on any form when using a button which calls
 the Borland print() routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, there are currently four clients running Win 7 Pro with Office 365 installed that are not exhibiting this issue. None are running the .exe in any compatability mode, and all are standard domain users with no administrative priviledges. They
 have not been elevated to launch or run their version of Paradox, and exhibit no issues when printing or changing printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to resolve on my system: Unlike the other clients I set up where I installed both the Paradox software and the Borland BDE (database engine) to the root of C:, mine was installed in the default Program Files directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test to replicate. I installed the standalone Lync application and ran it a few days without any issue. I then installed 365 again, and immediately incurred the same error on print. I restored to a state prior to the install. I then installed Paradox
 and the BDE into a directory on the C: root to duplicate known working configurations on the Win7 Pro64 clients. Everything was tested as functional. I then reinstalled the 365 and immediately had the same issue. Reboot. Same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleared the application log as it had a few lines regarding the crash, and launched the program again. Forms load properly. Connection to server tables is fine. Upon printing, dialog box appears - Paradox for Windows Desktop has stopped working..

            <p>An update to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my requirements preclude the need for the entire Office suite, and I really only require the Lync and Outlook software, I decided to test with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Office Pro + trial and it offered the option to select only Outlook during the install. After install, everything worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then plunked down the cash to purchase a standalone copy of Outlook, which worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gripe is that the Office 365 suite does not allow me to install only the components I require, instead the entire suite is installed by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that it is the updating of certain library files for the use of one of the other applications.</p>

            <p>Office 365 uses click to run technology and can only be installed to the win drive, its an all or none installation.</p>
<p>
I don't think you mentioned whether you were using 365 on the win7 PC, if you are and everything is OK under win7, then it would appear win8 is causing the issue (or at least the interaction between win8 and your bespoke software)</p>

            <p>We have four clients running Win7 Pro64 that are not experiencing this issue. Same Paradox setup. Same 365 setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 8.1 Pro, so it definitely is OS related. Keep in mind that the issue appeared only after the 365 install, and was remedied by its removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke a little too soon on the all is well. Although I can print without issues, I must now use the CP Devices &amp; Printers to set default printer when changing back and forth from HP to PDF printer, as the File -&gt; Printer Setup menu just hangs forever with
 the spinning circle of life :)</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The custom app uses a simple print() function which is internal to the Borland framework, and is non-traceable nor modifiable through debug. You simply pass what you want to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it is the same one used in the Paradox framework, as it's built-in File -&gt; Print and File -&gt; Printer Setup menu causes the same issue. This is not something that I use when the custom software is running, but it allows printing of whatever is the
 active window (table/query/form/report) much like Photoshop for example. Normally it will bring up the Microsoft "Windows" Print dialog menu, but instead&nbsp;it crashes the app to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am simply trying to determine what gets changed in the 32bit Windows Printing sub-system when Office 365 32bit&nbsp;is installed. Obviously there are some libraries updated that must have been modified for these Office apps that changed the way older applications
 can use them. </p>

<p>It was only with either KB 2939068 and/or KB 2919355 that errors were found and it was only after installing KB 2939068 manually, rather than via Windows Update,&nbsp;that DISM and SFC were able to repair the problem. Prior to that they each ended with&nbsp;a message

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2015 - Cursor keeps loosing focus while replying to an email</h2>
                    <p>I am having a nagging issue with Outlook for Mac 365. &nbsp;As I type a reply to an email the cursor will loose focus and I have to click into the email to start typing again and at some point the cursor loses focus again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online and tried a number of things recommended for 2011. &nbsp; Here is what I have all tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on and off When replying or forwarding, use the format of the original message</li><li>Compose messages in HTML by default</li><li>Verify the fronts on my computer and removing any duplicates</li></ul>
<p>This is starting to get pretty annoying - any suggestions on what I can do to fix this issue? It doesn't happen on all emails.</p>

            So I worked on this more yesterday - the problem appears to be something to do with autocorrect and auto format. &nbsp;I turned of all autocorrect and auto format options in Outlook and the issue is no longer happening. &nbsp;I haven't had time to try the options
 one by one to nail down which one it is specifically.

</p><p>I've been having this issue myself - thought perhaps it was an errant tap on the trackpad. I'm going to try your temporary fix of autocorrect auto-format to see if I get the same behavior.&nbsp;</p>

            I unfortunately have not found a longer term fix and haven't seen Microsoft post anything about it. &nbsp;Right now I have every option turned off in Auto Correct and Auto Format. &nbsp;I was going to try turning them back on one by one to figure out which option
 it specifically is but haven't had the time to deal with it.

I did more testing on this and you don't have to turn off all of autocorrect/auto format. You just have to turn off 1 setting. It appears the bug is related to the "Capitalize the first letter of sentences" in AutoCorrect section of Preference--&gt;Auto Correct.
 Unchecking that fixes the issue as a workaround until MS fixes this properly as a bug.

            <p>This is absolutely related to the auto-format function (possibly even the auto correct function).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested an email I was writing that kept losing focus and found that each time Outlook auto-formatted a dash into an en dash (typed a word followed by a hyphen followed by another word) my cursor would lose focus and causes it to move off the current email...
 &nbsp;then you end up typing in space... ack!</p>
<ul>
<li>looking at Braddik's response above, looks like capitalizing the first letter of a sentence is what sends the cursor to the end of the signature.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Turning off autocorrect / autoformat that changes a hyphen to an en dash .</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing to note... &nbsp;this seems to occur only if you have custom formatting (for instance, I use a blue font color that looks more like ink).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed all formatting (reverting to default font color) and the issue didn't happen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS, please solve this. I refuse to use Apple Mail, but this is very frustrating...<br />

<h2>            Using Project 2010 for multiple &#40;small&#41; projects</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use Project to schedule/track a series of projects at my work. Currently we use an Excel spreadsheet which has become very tedious to update manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a team of resources who work on our projects - they need to be aligned with their skills and the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During a fiscal year, we run multiple projects - around 40. Each project has one person to lead, one person to oversee and about 5 team members to assist with the project work (knowledge based work - the output is a document - akin to an audit function).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Project designed to have a separate file for each project? Or can I set up multiple projects in one file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would then need to set up a task with subordinate tasks and link them. One project below the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd need to separately input each team members vacation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the work will span one year, the reports look like they will be very cumbersome - our dept manager wants to be able to scan the reports to see the status of each project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my question is whether I can list all the projects in the same Project file (.mpp) - or whether I need to open a separate file for each project (say, 40 files in the year)? If the latter is the correct way to do this, how do I produce a consolidated
 report of all projects and their status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>
</p><p>If your projects are small, in theory you could put all 40 of them together into a single project.&nbsp; That would probably simplify things a great deal, especially with resource management and reporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the projects are longer than a few dozen tasks, then you would probably want create a separate MPP project file for each of them.&nbsp; This is where it gets more complicated.&nbsp; You would need to create a shared resource pool file containing all of the resources
 to be used in all 40 projects.&nbsp; Then you would need to link each project as a sharer file to the shared resource pool file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set cross-project links and to report on all of the projects, you would also want to create a master project, containing each of the 40 projects as a subproject.&nbsp; Once you have created the master project, it is a fairly simple matter to set cross-project
 links.&nbsp; To report on all 40 projects, you could display the Gantt Chart view and collapse each subproject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some thoughts for you.&nbsp; I will bet others in this forum will have some good ideas for you as well.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>As Dale said. I would try all projects in one file first but if the total task count approaches 2000 it is likely time for separate files for each project.<br />
</p>
<p>Note that master and resource pool files requires a higher level of understanding of project and careful use of them. Files mustn't be moved else file corruption will eventually occur.</p>

<p>Yep, this worked for me.&nbsp; I just agreed to the install of 10041 again and it just went away.&nbsp; I then looked for updates and found about 3, including AMD updates for me.&nbsp; This seemed to install but a couple of Window Defenders updates failed.&nbsp; I just made
 another request for updates and now all is good.</p>

<p>Hi Horia,</p>
<p>Can you tell us what the error symptom is? Is the symptom of the issue that when accessing the OneDrive for Business library in the browser, all options are grayed out and you get the error message “This control is currently disabled”? Please capture a complete
 screenshot of the issue for our investigation. If this is the case, can you let us know if general options such as upload documents and create new documents in the
<b>FILES</b> and <b>LIBRARY</b> ribbons work normally or not? To upload screenshots, click
<b>Use rich Formatting</b> in this thread and select <b>Insert/Edit Media</b>.</p>
<p>Also, we recommend you use the IE browser. Some features like <b>Open with Explorer
</b>only works in the IE browser.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<h3> zamzama35  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2007-How to Modify Monthly Sales Report &#40;Total Sales&#41;</h2>
                    I am using Northwind 2007 sample Database for my company. Primarily I am using it for Transport which is hired by customers on payment. I have done some minor modifications-in its tables, queries and reports to meet&nbsp; my needs. I have added a calculated
 field "Total Running". ie the kilometers vehicles have run&nbsp; on a particular order of each customer. I am facing some difficulties in modifying "Monthly Sales Report".I have replaced Total sales with my own calculated field "Total Running which I want to display
 in summary instead of total sales. In Event Procedure of this report I have replaced "Total Sales" with "Total Running" in details section as well as in footer to Sum the Field and Report is displaying the Summary correctly. However I am facing a problem.
 When report is run, a dialog box appears asking "Enter Parameter Value"&nbsp; beneath that There is written "Total Sale",with&nbsp; "OK"&nbsp; and Cancel Buttons. I have tried to find in property where possibly I might have missed to replace "Total sales" with "Total Running"
 but I have not been able to correct. Kindly help me. Thank!!!.<br />

<p>Hi Udubye,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your description, I understand you want to delete the test account using the CSAP portal, not an API. Since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business online services and Outlook client related issues, I recommend you post on our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=partnercenterapi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Partner Center API forum</a> for help. Engineers there are dedicated to answering and will be glad to provide assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I resolved this with some help from the Bookings team. So the issue was I had a group created on Teams that conflicted with Bookings. Removed that group and Bookings started working again.

            I see that the issue was something in your recent file... I'm glad to read that you are now working correctly. I do want to answer your question about how to execute Step 2 in the instructions I gave you because you still should run at least the Disk Repair
 Permissions procedure.

<div>You use Finder, which is the icon with a face on your Task Bar. In your favorites listing usually the Applications folder is listed. If it is not, you can look in the Macintosh HD directory and it will be there in the listing of next level folders.</div>

<h2>            FW Updates. A quick question</h2>
                    Do they need to be "authorized" by your operator?<br />
I have an N82 that i got through O2. I don't use O2 anymore, but the phone is one of their branded models.<br />
i just tried to update my FW to 20.0 and the updater said i was on FW 10. and that that is the most current.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, do i just wait?<br />
Have an other O2 users updated their FW yet?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi there<br />
<br />
Yes unfortunatley branded handsets do not get software as quickly as normal ones do. It is up to your network provider to approve of and customize the software version before you can get it.<br />
<br />
Just hang in there, no saying when they will have it, but keep checking :)

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed this happening for the past couple months and I'm just starting to get concerned about what I might be missing. I log into Outlook.com and see some emails which I know I haven't read on my phone or other device. Then, after a second, they disappear
 - and are not found in Junk or Deleted. Where are they going? Is this an automatic filter to remove likely Junk messages? I would like a chance to review everything that comes to my mailbox - even if it is in my Junk folder first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any rules set up.</p>
<p>

            It seems to have cleared itself now.&nbsp; In any event I do not know what Android I have or where to find it but I am pretty sure I have the latest version of Skype.&nbsp; For me this is not a satisfactory method of problem solving.

</span>Each of the sub forms are based off a query.<span>&nbsp; </span>I want all 3 sub forms to automatically re-query every 30 seconds.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For each sub form in the Properties settings I set the “Timer Interval” to 30,000 and the “On Time” to run a macro that has an action to Requery.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Individually when the sub forms are open they requery works fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It’s only when I insert the forms in another form is when they do not requery.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did notices that if I click within the sub forms they do requery, but I do not want to have to click each sub form every 30 sec.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I there a way I can have all 3 sub form automatically requery at the same time?</span></p>

            You've misunderstood Scott's reply.&nbsp; <em>NameOfYourSubformCONTROL</em> means you put the name of the subform control here, i.e. the control in the parent form's Controls collection which houses the subform.&nbsp; This might or might not be the same name as
 the source form object.<br />
<br />
I would usually tag subforms, i.e. the source form objects, as <em>fsub</em> and subform controls as
<em>sfc</em>, so taking your Discrepancy subform as an example the subform would be named fsubDiscrepancy and the subform control would be named sfcDiscrepancy.&nbsp; The syntax to requery it would thus be:<br />
<br />
Me.sfcDiscrepancy.Form.Requery<br />

            <p>FWIW - many users will find this enormously distracting, especially if they are allowed to edit data in the subforms (since each time you requery they will lose their edits). Of course if you're building a "dashboard" type app, then you can ignore that little
 nugget!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To requery a Subform from the Main Form, you'd do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.NameOfYourSubformCONTROL.Form.Requery</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where "NameOfYourSubformCONTROL" is the name of the Subform Control object on the parent form. This may or may not be the same as the name of the Form you're using as a Subform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note this is for VBA, not Macros. You shouldn't be using Macros for things like this ...</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently begun using my One Note in the classroom and have reached a major glitch.&nbsp; The notes that I take in class for my students are synced to the online notebook, but the writing is all off by a couple of lines.&nbsp; I thought I'd just write in the
 online version to avoid this glitch, but it is not very responsive to editing via using the pen.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this? If so what was your solution?
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jackie, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are sorry about the inconvenience caused by this issue.
</p>
<p>I just checked on my side, hand-writing or editing via pen in OneNote Online could be done smoothly.</p>
<p>This glitch you are talking about might be the browser's incompatibility with Touch mode, please check if the browser is up to date or switching to another browser and check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, if you are a hand-writing user, we would suggest you using OneNote desktop application to sync your works, but per your description, after syncing to the Online version, the position of
 the inks are changed? We are willing to help you troubleshoot on this issue, could you let us know if this issue is occurring in OneNote for Windows10 or OneNote 2016?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen </p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the feedback! &nbsp;I use one note &nbsp;2016 and the one note app to write notes for my students. &nbsp;The issue is that when the students go to look at the notes the ink is shifted up and over. &nbsp;I thought writing in one note online would resolve the issue,
 but it is not very compatible and still shifts the ink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there and update that can be done to resolve the ink shift issue? &nbsp;I am using one course as a trial before upscaling to all course, but if the ink continues to be shifted then i wont be able to continue using one note.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jackie, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update. We totally understand your frustration.
</p>
<p>There was an ink shifting issue reported last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10/ink-notes-shifting-during-sync/44074a6c-39bc-4522-9a7b-93505a24eac2">Ink notes shifting during sync!
</a></p>
<p>The related resources has confirmed and fixed it in our new OneNote for Windows 10 application. So I would recommend you check the updates of this application.</p>
<p>I have performed the test on my side, with version 16001.11629.20028.0, I could not reproduce the ink shifting issue on my side. The ink positions are the same in teacher's side, student's side and
 the OneNote online page. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing need to mention is, after syncing your hand-writings via OneNote for Windows 10, please go to the online page, check if the ink has shifted. Some time, issue could be raised by the students'
 side. In this way, we could narrow down on this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alex Chen</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response and further information about the ink shifting issue.&nbsp; I have checked and the current version for One Note is 16001.11629.20028.0.&nbsp; Yet in the One Note App my notes look like this:
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And in the online version my notes look like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Could it be because I still have one note 2016 on my computer?&nbsp; If the current version should not cause the ink shift, I am unsure why it is still occurring for me.&nbsp; I also tried to delete one note 2016 (in case it was the issue) and my computer would not
 allow it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your timely responses and effort to help me resolve the ink shifting issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Jackie </p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just wanted to clarify ... I am not using the classroom setting.&nbsp; I didn't have time to learn about this feature before my class began, so I am just posting the link on blackboard for students to access the notebook.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jackie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since OneNote 2016 and OneNote for Windows 10 are 2 separate application, personally, I don’t think the OneNote 2016 will have influence on your OneNote for Windows 10.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you simply using the normal notebook, could you create a new notebook via the OneNote for Windows 10, and edit the pages with your pen, check if the ink shifting issue persist under the new
 notebook.</p>
