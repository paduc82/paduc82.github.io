<h2>            I got a phone call from India... event viewer log with errors... is this a scam&#63;</h2>
                    I got a phone call from India (I guess) saying he's a windows tech and that I had downloaded malicious ware. He gave me my computer ID (which is accurate) and guided me to event viewer. There are errors and warnings. Is this a scam? What should I do? Thanks.

            <p>Hi vt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often
 the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be
 good. In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install
 or System Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. <b>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the
 hard drive).</b> If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a></span><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:
</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If so</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If not</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund
 - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities
 and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>

</span><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</span></a><span> This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases.
 I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they
 do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.</span></p>

<br />The WEPHOSTSVC stands for Windows Encryption Provider Host Service.

<br />I would not be overly concerned about it. Other programs, or windows itself may start this service for specific tasks.

<p>
</p><p>I have some Windows 7 product key which are upgraded to Windows 10 earlier. And I also have a Windows 10 digital entitlement purchased from the store. On all these Windows 10 systems, I have linked them with my Hotmail account.</p>

<h2>            Surface Type Cover not migrated</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;The Type Cover stopped working. &nbsp;None of the keys or the trackpad work and the backlight is not on. &nbsp;I went through all the troubleshooting steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Restarted the Surface</li><li>Cleaned the connectors with alcohol</li><li>Restarted using the power button and the volume up to boot into the 'BIOS'</li><li>Uninstalled the driver and restarted the Surface (the driver did reinstall automatically)</li><li>Ran the Surface Diagnostics which resulted in no issues</li><li>Completed a full reset of the Surface</li><li>Downloaded up and updated the firmware and drivers</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking into the Device Manager a bit more and reading the events, it appears that there is an issue with the Type Cover 'migrating'. &nbsp;There is an event in the driver window for the Type Cover that says that it failed to migrate. &nbsp;Has anyone had this issue
 before?</p>

<p><span>Hi gdr,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 icons there but doesn&#39;t display any words - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebeccasyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 icons there but doesn&#39;t display any words</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my computer yesterday and I noticed that while loading I could see the icons but no words.
</p>
<p>Once it had finished loading, every single icon on my desktop is there but no words/labels underneath.
</p>
<p>When I click on my Start Menu nothing appears, When I try to open a program a white screen appears.
</p>
<p>Strangely the only program that will open and has words is my anti-virus, so I ran a Whole Computer Scan and it found some tracking cookies which I deleted.
</p>
<p>I tried to use CTRL ALT DELETE to get the task manager up but all I get the Windows Wlecome screen where I can see the icon to shut down but cant open the drop down box to select SLEEP or LOG OFF</p>
<p>The computer is under a year old, and is running Windows 7 and Microsfot 2010, I have AVG Internet Security and have an external hard drive that has hopefully got my backups on it.

            <p>Hi Richie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my research, the issue arises if there is a chipset driver mismatch after the significant processor change or if the BIOS needs to be updated to the latest version available for your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to try updating the computer BIOS and the chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if that resolves the issue. It would be better to contact the computer manufacturer for further
 assistance with this, because updating BIOS and chipset drivers include risky procedures and if anything goes wrong, that would leave the computer unstable or unusable. Please refer to the following link to update drivers for your HP model:</span></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/readIndex?sp4ts.oid=3232101&amp;swLangOid=8&amp;swEnvOid=4059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Drivers and Software: HP Compaq dc7700 Convertible Minitower PC</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important: </span></em></strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting
 properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, please refer to the following support forum link from HP website to check the solution posted for a similar issue with a similar system model.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p>
<p>Also, try updating the correlated software/drivers to the latest version for your new Intel Processor model:</p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/36503/Intel-Core2-Duo-Processor-E7500-3M-Cache-2_93-GHz-1066-MHz-FSB#@downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Downloads: Intel® Core™2 Duo Processor E7500 (3M Cache, 2.93 GHz, 1066 MHz FSB)</a></strong></em></p>

    <title>Photo viewer app for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3>    say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo viewer app for Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello. So i just recently came up with the windows 10 app about photo viewing. I like how it helps you organize your pictures in albums, date taken, etc. I have a question though about that date thing. Why does it stop at 1969 when you go back? I have
 photos taken way before that and i want to post the correct date on them. I haven't found anyone else complaining about this, so that makes me think i must be the only one with this problem. Thank you.

            File Explorer allows you to do block changes also.  You just select all pics where you want same date, right click &gt; Properties &gt; Now in details tab, if you change for one, it will be applied on selected pics.

<h2>            Can&#39;t copy and paste URL&#39;s after 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since updating to 8.1 on my RT I can't copy (or cut) and paste ad URL's.&nbsp; Before the update I was able to touch the URL and an option to copy and paste would come up.&nbsp; Now (after the update), this option is not available.&nbsp; If I press the URL long enough
 a box does appear, however is disappears as soon as I remove my finger.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div><br />
<div>When you are pasting in Internet Explorer app, can you tap the URL then tap again to have the URL segment light up, move the selection to cover the entire URL, then touch and hold to get the box to appear with the option to Copy / Paste / Cut.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Blocking &#47; Banning Stalker. How to get rid of him for good&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kono h kalantu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blocking &#47; Banning Stalker. How to get rid of him for good&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There is a Xbox live player with a account called <strong>&nbsp;[Mod Edit]</strong><br />
<br />
This individual has gone above and beyond to find ways to contact me and my friends on xbox live , simply to continue harassing and threatening us.<br />
<br />
Lets make a long story short as we can , Almost a year ago now <strong>[Mod Edit]</strong>&nbsp;was part of our lil friends group on Xbox Live , After some harsh actions , and very harsh words towards two other friends [on multiple occasions] We decided enough was
 enough and told him we were done with him and his additude. While this should have stopped there&nbsp; it only escalated , Thor decided to send his remaining friends into our parties to cause more trouble . We blocked them&nbsp; assuming this would end this rediculous
 child's play and life would move on. <br />
<br />
It did not, in fact quite the opposite became the case , Thor went ever further in his anger , and decided the because he could he would have one of his friends whom had not bugged us join in on one of our games ans some how get out ip adresses from it. When
 this failed to bother us much . He then somehow obtained one of our friends Social security number and email adress this , using this he managed to&nbsp; [temporarily] lock him out of his own bank account and email adress. Finally after 4 months of this we blocked
 everyone who was friends with him and thought it was over and done . after so many threatening messages and all the crap.<br />
<br />
low and behold though that yesterday Thor somehow managed to find out about a new person who had just joined our xbox live group and proceeded to threaten them with the following message " well well well , welcome to hell I hope you know what you've gotten
 yourself into , I'm going to kill all of you" , he then relayed all of our adresses to this friend and say he was comming for us . As he has said this before we highly dought he will . However i would like to have his account ban , or at least blocked from
 being abel to view us at all as the threats are now getting old , never stop and no matter how many times we report him for them his account remains active and he continues to find new ways to track us down and come at us again.<br />
<br />
This has become a obsession of<strong>[Mod Edit]</strong> and he has stalked us for a year if not more at this point . yet Xbox live has done nothing and i can not imagen they have not seen this as we are well aware that he has turned on other friends and gone
 as far as to approach one that lives close to him in real life to a point there is now a restraining order in place.</p>

<p>That right there is a police matter.<br />

<br />
For now there are a couple of things you can do.</p>
<p>Set all levels of communication to friends only and set online status to friends only. Also make your friends list viewable by friends only.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, as for the police though, That right there is a joke to the authorities. Last time we reported him for this stuff even with audio and text of him having said it the officers responce was</p>
<p>"Unfortunately there's not much we can tell you, He lives in another state so it's out of our hands. The best we could do for you at this point is help set up measures to keep him from contacting you, I personally would just let him sink in his own lil despair
 pit and move on with my day"</p>
<p>while i agree it sounds like a good idea and that not all cops are the same and yadah yadah , fact is even if they could do anything when it was brought up as a case , it's info from the internet , he plays innocent long enough and he can just walk away
 with someone looking at him and saying " now you go be a good boy and don't bug them kids again ya hear"</p>

<p>[quote user="Kono H Kalantu"]"Unfortunately there's not much we can tell you, He lives in another state so it's out of our hands.[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">State Laws vary slightly but here's the basic idea.
<br />
<br />
Most States consider a "Threat" to be credible. This meaning if someone yells at someone else they're going to kill them, this is not credible because there is no "means" to do so. Now if someone yells I'm going to kill you while they are holding a deadly weapon,
 that's credible and would be something to taken seriously as a credible Threat.<br />
<br />
Short story, people "talk" all the time and there's no Law against that. Talk is "talk", credible is another thing all together.<br />
<br />
Sorry but why haven't you simply adjusted your Privacy Settings? If you don't want to hear someone over Xbox LIVE, it really is that easy. I'm no Attorney but then again if your seeking Legal Advice from the interweebs, heaven forbid and good luck.<br />

<p>As i'll say again changing settings did nothing to stop him . changing emails did nothing to stop &nbsp;him . heck changing account names did nothing to stop him either. and blocking him hasnt worked i blocked communications with him. He still sent messages ,
 which i did a support report on that by itself , since i know from experience when you block someone they shouldnt be able to message you again.</p>
<p>Some of the *** he's pulled makes me sometimes feel that &nbsp;we could throw him in jail and he would still find a way to send threats.

<p>in any case thanks for all the help everyone , I urge you to avoid him , least till he grows up or has a attitude change .</p>
<p>Figured i'd post this to see if anyone else has had to deal with him , what to do , so on so forth. cause im tired of it and when i finally had him blocked on xbox live he somehow got around it. internet people these days are crazy. and tsome are to smart
 for their own good, almost makes you wonder if he used to work for xbox / microsoft and knows how to cancel blocks and reports.</p>

    <title>Uninstalling with Easy Software Manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sensorydeprivation  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling with Easy Software Manager</h2>
                    I have a samsung laptop with "easy software manager" and instead of uninstalling the universal scan driver through the icon, I went to the hard drive and deleted it. Now when I went to the manager to check on it the icon says installed. If I try to uninstall
 it I am told uninstall failed. How do I fix this? I have windows 7 home premium. It is just an icon, but my computer is brand new and I don't need to start out with a glitch. Thank you.

            <p>You dont delete anything via explorer (other than data) without first uninstalling the program via Programs &amp; Features.</p>
<p>Otherwise you will soon trash your new PC.</p>
<p>And if system restore doesnt revert your 'fiddling' go to Samsung site and reinstall the app, before then correctly uninstalling it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This could be because the “uninstaller” of the program was also deleted when you have deleted the program’s files.<br />
Here are a few suggestions to fix this issue. Try doing a system restore to a point in time when the program was working fine and then you can uninstall it.<br />
System Restore<br />
Please perform the System Restore in order to apply the previous changes before changes were done.<br />
How to perform System Restore?<br />

<h2>            How do I fix screen flicker on MSI GX740 laptop&#63;</h2>

<p>My screen on my laptop keeps flickering for no reason. I did a virus scan and also checked the drivers for any problems and also did sfc/scannow and found no issues. I am running ATI HD 5870 graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have this same problem on MSI GE70 laptop. Does your screen flicker all the time or just sometimes? My screen flickers only sometimes and it flickers mainly on the right side of the screen.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello merhghf45.&nbsp; My laptop flickers a little bit all the time and the whole screen shakes if I watch a youtube video for example. This all&nbsp;started when I updated the ATI graphics driver to to current version.
</p>
<p>I wonder if one of the software companies has a fix for this.</p>

            Go to your device manager and select your gpu, click properties and roll back driver of your gpu and you have the driver which worked and that should remove the flickering if you didn't have it before.

            I have an MSI GE70 as well and just wondering if you fixed the problem. I haven't changed drivers or anything, but my entire screen flickers sometimes, usually when I turn it on or if I move the lid up/down. Is this the same problem or am I experiencing
 something related to damage? I've not dropped my laptop or carried it inappropriately so I'm just a bit confused. Thank you.

            Thank you for such a quick response. I already did what you just suggested. I also reinstalled the windows completely. My notebook gets connected to all other wi-fi except my university one. When I click the connect, no option for user name and password
 appears as it should for a wpa2 enterprise. It tries to connect to the wifi without&nbsp;giving me the option to write user name and password&nbsp;and fails after some time.

<p><span>Please reply, have you tried installing legacy network driver and connect to the network?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before performing the below method, create a
<strong><span>System restore</span></strong><strong> point</strong> by following the steps from

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that
<strong>System Restore</strong> does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring. During
<strong>System Restore</strong>, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to download and install the legacy version of wireless network driver from the manufacturer’s website and check if you are able to connect to university Wi-Fi. After installing
 the driver, connect to the university Wi-Fi before connecting to any other Wi-Fi connection on the computer.</span></p>
