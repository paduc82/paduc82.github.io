<h2>            ACCESS 2016- Public Publish on Web</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to build a simple database.&nbsp; My guess is on Access 2016.&nbsp; The database would be a simple table with fields just as job title, description, city, pay rate, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to publish this table via a database (not excel) onto my website that anyone can view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I would add some functionality to it.. simple stuff... things like asking the job seeker a few questions and the ability to send me their resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am not using powerapps is because I believe that software only allows you to share this with your organization.&nbsp; I want to share my database with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help... which software should I use... and if it is Access 2016 can you help me do this?&nbsp; I have built some test databases but it wont allow me to place it on sharepoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

    <title>form wont update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayhyde  say:</h3>
<h2>            form wont update</h2>
                    <p>I have a form with a subform based on a table.</p>
<p>The table has three fields an autonumber index, a foreign key, and a part ID served by a lookup from the parts list.</p>
<p>The form fills in the foreign key based on a field in another subform the a master child link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a third subform to requery based on what record is selected in the second subform. .</p>
<p>The auto number index and part number are hidden and only the part ID appears in the form, which is presented in datasheet view,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Part number fled has a click event, but when I click on that field the event is not triggered.</p>
<p>If I open the two hidden fields, then&nbsp;the click event on the Autonumber ID column works, and I can requery my third form to &nbsp;match the part ID selected on that row.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does the click event work on the autonumber ID Column but not on the other two fields?</p>
<p>Why does "On Selection Change" &nbsp;not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I requery my third table/form &nbsp;based on the row selection in the second table/form?

            <p>Where is the third subform? Is it on the "main" form (where the first subform lives), or is it a subform of that subform?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's on the main form, then you can generally do this by adding a hidden textbox to your main form and use that as the Master Link for the second subform. Use the Current event of the First subform to set that value:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.Parent.YourTextbox = Me.SomeField</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mention a Combo, which sometimes means you must refer to a specific Column in your combo. Without seeing your database, we could not tell you which one, but if you must refer to a Column in your Combo you do it like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Me.MyCombo.Column(0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Columns are zero-based, so referring to Column(0) gets the value from the FIRST column.</p>

            <p>All three forms are on the main form.&nbsp; The third "form" could be either a list box on the main form or a listbox in its own subfrom.&nbsp; I have a button on the form that simply issues the requery command, and that works, but it is a sorry workaround, if I can
 find some event tied to the second form to issue the requery command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use hidden text boxes on the main form to link the subforms. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not in a position where I can share the database, but this ought to be pretty easy.&nbsp; The situation is something like this.&nbsp; I have a main form with some header information where you can select a workorder&nbsp;( and the hidden text boxes.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first subform has allows the user to create line items for the work orders. the fields in that from are linked to the work order through the hidden textboxes.&nbsp; This form works as expected. If the user changes the work order on the main form, then only
 the line items for that work order appear on the second form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second subform works similarly. When a user selects any field or any line item (row) in the line item subform, then the second subform allows the user to select the parts associated with that work. Changing line items cuses the second subform to show
 only those parts associated with that line item. The parts table has only three fields: an ID field, an external key that links it to the line item&nbsp;and the part field, which is fed by&nbsp; a lookup table of available parts.&nbsp; This works exactly as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only to repeat this for the third sub form, such that when a user selects a part on the second form&nbsp;it is linked to a third subform which allows the user to select different categories of the part. The categories are selected by a dropdown list which
 is filtered according to the part chosen. It is essentially the exact same process as the previous form, except the fields in the part table do not issue a click event EXCEPT the ID field, which normally would be hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do not understand is why I can click on any field or record on the first subform and the second subform will be filtered correctly, but I cannot do that on the second subform to control the third.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>The parts form is the second subform. It&nbsp;based on a parts table. The form is presented as a data sheet.. If I click on any field in the data sheet (except the ID field it does not execute any of the events (Although if I inspect the control, it says that
 events are available). Same thing if I present it in single form view. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I present it a&nbsp; datasheet then the click event works at the form level, so if I click pan the tiny row selector at the far left the click event fires and I can use that to execute a requery command. So, using that as a work around, everything now
 works. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a third form that works off of ( is linked to the second form and&nbsp; it refreshes properly so all the nmaster and child fields link properly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I have a fourth subform. It contains one control which consists of a listbox with two columns, a part column and an attribute column. It is driven by a query that returns all the possible attributes for each part.&nbsp; All I want to do is have that listbox
 refresh when the user selects (or adds) a different part on the parts form. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have the query refresh on the click event on the parts form at the form level, so if the user selects any row in the parts form, the available attributes appear in the list box, or I can requery using a command button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for using the list box is so the user can select multiple attributes for a given part. After the user selects the desired attributes he presses a save button which executes code to cycle thrrough the list box and writee out all the attributes
 to a table which is linked to data saved in another table&nbsp;created from selections on the parts form.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this woks perfectly, EXCEPT I cant figure out how to trigger the requery when the user clicks on a part in the parts form. I do not understand why I have fields on the form which have a&nbsp; click event that does not function,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The form the listbox is on has no master and child set up. The listbox has the part name as one column. If I can use the column in the list box as the child field, &nbsp;then I could link that to a master field, but I have not been able to make that work. Is
 there a trick to addressing one column in a list box so it can be the child field?</p>

            <p>I put a message box on every event I thought would work. none of them trigger, except the one at the form level, and the ones on the ID field, which are no use if the ID field is hidden. There is no code otherwise. All I need is one line, to requery the
 listbox, and that code works if I out it on a command button.&nbsp; After all the user interface takes place there is a save button, with code the read the selected items on the list box, but that has nothingto do with this behavior. That is it. Everything else
 depends on plain database functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a mystery to me why form1 uses a table as a record source, and it behaves as I would like,&nbsp; Form2 is identical in all of its settings, except it uses a different table as a record source, but form two just sits there and acts retarded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next move is to copy the form that works and then change the record source.

    <title>how to get excel NOT to insert file path when linking to other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rock hammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to get excel NOT to insert file path when linking to other files&#63;</h2>
                    I have a file "my main file.xlsm" which links to 3 other files "my ext file 1.xlsm", &nbsp;"my ext file 2.xlsm" and "my ext file 3.xlsx".
<div>All 4 files sit in the same folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the live environment, the files are in "s:\filepath1". In my development environment, (a copy of) the files are in "p:\filepath2" or when I work from my laptop "c:\filepath3". Regardless of which specific environment, all 4 files remain in the same
 folder. The file paths in the development environment are not accessible from the live environment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question: is there a way to tell excel NOT to insert the file paths into the formulae that link to the external files?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I am in development and put in a cell something like +'[my ext file 1.xlsm]my tab A'!$a$1, excel does not seem to insert the full file path "p:\filepath2" into the formula.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, once I move (just) the file "my main file.xlsm" from p: to s: and then open it up, excel inserts the file path to make the formula 'p:\filepath2\[my ext file 1.xlsm]my tab A'!$a$1. Because p: is not accessible in the live environment, the links
 fail to update (and I get prompted to update the links). And there are hundreds of these cells with most of these cells each containing multiple external file references.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there some option within excel that would let me avoid this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

    <title>Confusing error message when moving tab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric 98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Confusing error message when moving tab</h2>
                    <p>I have two open workbooks. I'm trying to move one tab from one workbook into the other. I'm getting an error message which doesn't make sense in this context:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel cannot insert the sheets into the destination workbook, because it contains fewer rows and columns than the source workbook. &nbsp;To move or copy the data to the destination workbook, you can select the data, and then use the Copy and Paste commands to
 insert it into the sheets of another workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why I'm getting this message. I want to move one complete tab from one workbook into another. I'm not trying to combine tabs or insert one worksheet into another. Why would the number of rows and columns be relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using what I assume to be the standard way for moving a tab: </p>
<p>- Right-click on the tab,&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Select Move or Copy</p>
<p>- Select the "To" book and the "Before" sheet</p>
<p>- Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get around this by doing the Copy and Paste, as the error message suggests. But I'm puzzled why I'm getting the message in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Eric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to copy a sheet from an xlsx workbook into a workbook in xl97-2003 xls format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In such case, the destination workbook would be limited 65536 rows x 256 columns while the source workbook's sheet would have 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to perform this operation but, if I were to do so, the error message which you have encountered would not surprise me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>===</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Norman</p>

<h2>            Multiple recipients-email error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to send an email to multiple recipients. However, I received an email from Outlook saying that two (out of five) of the recipients' email addresses could not be found so the email wasn't sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it mean none of the recipients got the email, or just those whose address wasn't correct? Should I send the email to everyone again? I don't want them to receive multiple emails from me, just one each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks or your help!</p>

            Hi Le Bris,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting. According to your description, some emails sent from you were undeliverable for the not founded recipients‚Äô email addresses after you sent an email to multiple recipients. In this way, the recipients are able to receive the email you
 sent, except those recipients whose address weren‚Äôt correct. So, you don‚Äôt need to send that email to everyone again.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

            Then you should consider a clean install of Windows 10. Sounds like something is corrupt in your system and that may be the easiest and quickest way to get back up and running.

<p>Per the tenant info you provided, we found that Planner has been added and provisioned to your subscription. So could you double check if you can access Planner successfully now?</p>

</p><p>Same problem here. I deleted, reinstalled and tried to reopen a spreadsheet and excel just crashes. I added excel to the iphone and can open and edit same spreadsheets. Problems started a couple days ago when i installed the latest excel update. Updated<br />
to IOS 11.02 about a week ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA: I also cant open a blank spreadsheet in the ipad version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ETA: Apparently it did not update to 11.0.2 last week like I thought it did. Still in 10.3.3, though I swear I remember seeing it said I succesfully updated to 11.0.2. Phone did update to it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Photos sent from cell phone no longer showing up in Hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesz87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos sent from cell phone no longer showing up in Hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>I have a simple non-smart, flip phone. It can take photos. For years, I have been able to send photos taken by my cell phone to my Hotmail e-mail account. I would send a Picture Message to my email address, and the photos would always show up as an attachment
 in my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But about a week or so ago, I tried sending photos from my cell phone to my Hotmail email account, but the email only shows up as a simple text with no photos attached. This happens every time now (i.e. I can no longer send photos from my cell phone to my
 Hotmail e-mail account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've verified that my phone is working because I can still send photos to other, non-Hotmail email accounts (the photos show up in those accounts). But Hotmail seems to no longer allow text with pictures to be sent to my Hotmail email account here.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Thank you. But I have made no changes whatsoever to my account. I've always used Mozilla Firefox to access my Hotmail. Nothing has changed there either (though I get the same results of no picture file sent to Hotmail with other web browser). But tonight,
 I tried sending another picture message from my phone to my Hotmail account. Again, I still get the same, plain text without a picture file attached, even though I did that on my cell phone when sending the message to my Hotmail account. I sent the same picture/text
 to a Yahoo email account that I set up as a test, and the attached picture DOES show up there. So the issue seems to be with Hotmail...Hotmail seems to no longer allow me to send pictures to my Hotmail email account, It makes no sense!&nbsp; H. Allen<br />

            Thanks, but I did the steps that you say here, and still, no results. I still only get a simple text message minus attached photos from my cell phone. It's as if Outlook will no longer allow me to send photos from my cell phone to my Hotmail email account.

            <p>Sorry to hear that did not work. I knew it had to be an issue with Outlook and I was also convinced that it had something to do with the fact that when I went to the&nbsp;<em><strong>Filters and reporting&nbsp;</strong></em>section under the

<p>
</p><p>It wasn't until a few days later when I tried again to change/save the settings (<strong>NOTE</strong>: The settings already selected were the ones I wanted but I just wanted it to save and confirm it) that it actually saved them
 it's still working and it is!</p>

            This is still happening.&nbsp; It is a problem with Outlook/Hotmail.&nbsp; It seems there is possibly a problem with embedded files.&nbsp; If I send a pic from my cell phone to gmail it works just fine.&nbsp; If I forward the message from gmail to outlook I get the photo.&nbsp;
 Ever since the Outlook upgrade I have had this problem with Outlook not receiving photos from cell phones.&nbsp; The message will come across but not the photo and all that shows in the email in the word Photos and the text from the message.&nbsp; Can someone please
 tell us how to fix this or have Microsoft fix it ASAP?&nbsp; This is very frustrating! &nbsp;I have all the latest upgrades and it doesn't matter which browser I use to check outlook from, I still can't view a photo sent to me via cell phone.&nbsp; Thank you!

<h2>            rich text field in a subform cannot be formatted&#63;</h2>
                    Using Access 2007. I have a form with a subform. In the subform, I am referencing a field in a table that is defined as Memo/Rich Text. When you open the subform by itself and highlight some text in that field, the mini toolbar appears so that you can
 format the text. Now when I open the main form with that subform and attempt to highlight text in the Rich Text field, the mini toolbar does not appear. Therefore I cannot format the text. Unfortuantely, the database is designed so that you must use the form
 (which includes the subform), you cannot use the subform. Also my design hides the ribbon so formatting commands are not available. Any cluse as to why rich text fields in subforms do not show the mini toolbar?

<p>Well, it DOES work in subforms in datasheet view. The OP is hiding the ribbon which is his downfall. He/she may want to reconsider that, and the users can format rich text memo fields to their hearts' content.</p>

<p>Tom,</p>
<p>The form in question opens in modla/popup mode. I restored the ribbon, but becuase of the popup/modal nature, you cannot click the ribbon. Is there a way to add a formatting toolbar to the field itself? (much like what you see on these forums when you compose
 a reply...there is a toolbar with Bold, Italics, Underline, etc... icons).</p>

<p>Alternatively you can remove the modal/popup setting and hide any other open forms.<br />
This will give the benefit of being able to use the format buttons on the ribbon.</p>
<p>The user will need to close that form to go back to the previous form that was open (your code just makes the hidden form visible again).<br />
You may also need to hide some buttons on your ribbon if you are using a custom ribbon that has buttons to open other forms.</p>

</p><p>The last 30 days of your conversation history are also stored in the cloud, so you can access it when you're signed in to Skype on any device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you are signed in on the correct account on your computer. Click your Profile on your mobile, check if the account on the computer matches with the account you are signed in on your mobile. If the account are not the same, sign out on your
 computer and sign in using the correct credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the account are the same on both devices. Follow the basic troubleshooting steps below to refresh your Skype for Windows Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;To delete the shared.xml file: </p>
<ul>
<li>On your keyboard, press the Windows key and R at the same time. The Run window opens.
</li><li>Type %appdata%\skype and click OK.</li><li>Locate and delete the shared.xml file</li><li>Open your Skype Name folder and look for config.xml. Delete this file as well.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;To Re-name Skype Folder</p>
<ul>
<li>On your keyboard, press the Windows key and R at the same time. The Run window opens.
</li><li>Type %appdata% and click OK. </li><li>Locate Skype and Rename it to SkypeOld</li></ul>

<p>Hello CesarKiyono,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
To further investigate, what is your device's operating system and the exact version of Skype you are using? Are the messages not syncing on your devices? If yes, have you checked if you are signed in to the same account on both your devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. <br />
Thank you!</p>

</p><p>I have skype registered on my phone - I receive all new messages on my phone but on Skype these messages don't appear (it's not only that the notification is missing, they are just not pushed to the Desktop-app). Usually, closing and restarting Skype helps,
 but only until the next message arrives. Do I need to stop the android app or what is the problem?</p>

<p>Same issue here with Skype for Business (6.21.0.17) on Android 8.0.0 phone and Windows 10 PC (fully updated). Messages appear instantly on phone but not on computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the general architecture of Skype for Business is pretty much corrupt. Core functionalities that build the Skype empire has been dismantled in favor of "something new". Now we have a chat program that doesn't show the chat history (I need to
 go to Outlook to look at what looks like emails!?!?), doesn't sync automatically across any platform instantaneously, and has a user interface that is very much compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to cancel Skype and let it be reborn without Microsoft?</p>

    <title>Dcount not working with blank number field in Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ossiemac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dcount not working with blank number field in Access</h2>
                    
<p>I have the following formula in a TextBox on a form.</p>
<p>=DCount("[Invoice]","[MyTable]","Nz([Invoice],0) = 0")</p>
<p>Invoice field in the table is Number and Long Integer.</p>
<p>If the number field is blank then the formula always returns zero. However, if I change all of the blank fields in the table to 0 (zero) then the formula works.</p>
<p>What am I not understanding here? Doesn't Nz function work in the above formula?</p>
<p>I have worked around the problem by changing all of the existing records to zero and making the default value of the field zero but&nbsp;I would still like to know why the formula does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's because you're counting the Invoice field - that still contained Null values, and Nulls aren't counted. This should work:</p>
<p>=DCount("*","[MyTable]","Nz([Invoice],0) = 0")</p>
<p>* counts records, not values.</p>

<h2>            5800 contact bar</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 5800 on VF UK on latest available firmware. I had handset connected to laptop via usb and was using the Nokia communications centre via PC suit when the phone locked up. I closed pc suit down and disconnected my handset.</p>
<p>Since then the contact bar is greyed out. no contact details are visible and there is no functionality to it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a factory reset and reinstalled the FW but still there is 4 grey empty boxes on my home screen. Any suggestions on what the issue is or how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, Crud&nbsp;</p>

<p>ok in this case and only after you do a proper back up i would suggest option #3. this may not be what you want to do but it will clean everything off and hopefully get your phone back in shape. read the whole thing carefully before deciding to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data)<br />
Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for all operations listed here is 12345<br />
<br />
2. *#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
hard reset - hold the following buttons *, 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding
 all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, GREEN/RED/CAMERA keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. )<br />
<br />
<p>If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
