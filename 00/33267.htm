<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - Synaptics Touchpad driver resets itself everytime I start the PC frsh</h2>
                    I found a strange issue with my Synaptics Touchpad on Windows 10 Pro release. With the upgrade the driver was updated and I lost some functionality, notably the 4 finger gestures. I am cool with that as these gestures have been replaced by three finger
 gestures, however, the sidebar scrolling and chiral scrolling has been automatically disabled. It allows me to change it back and it works absolutely fine, but if I shut down and start again these setting are once again reset and not working. It seems all
 my settings are reset as the icon also disappears from the taskbar if I select it to appear there. Certainly this can't be right and to be honest, I find it quite annoying as I like to use my mouse that way. The old driver keeps my settings if I restore it,
 but I decided to stay on the new one as I am sure it has some benefits that are not immediately visible.

            Hi @Kronos316. Thanks for the suggestions. I read through all the suggestions and&nbsp;tried all of it and one my newer HP Envy Touch 15 it keeps on resetting my settings but it has an option where I can save profiles. On the older HP Pavilion, some of my settings
 are still reset with the same driver but it retains some. So at the moment I have decided to stay with the solution to select the profile every time I start from a cold boot or restart as I get awesome results from the touchpad with the drivers installed and
 I mostly just hibernate. If they introduce a new driver I will just stop selecting the profile. It seems that different hardware reacts differently and t may well be that one certain PCs you will not have the same problem. I noticed one person saying that
 his clunker worked fine and I noticed that my older PC somehow didn't have the same issue. I have a feeling that Windows imposes some settings on he driver and while you are allowed to change it, it resets it next time you start.

            Your right Wern, it don't solve it. I'm having the same problem.. I had to keep clicking the box to disable touchpad when exernal mouse is plugged in and avoid typing problem. But hey, you know what was my solution to this for now?? I had to open the laptop
 and pull the ribbon for trackpad. Volia.. its off. :P

            <p>That's a bit drastic. I hope you will be able to get it back together again 😵.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the profiles loaded I am fine now. I had a lot of issues with my Bluetooth mouse as well but that was sorted by switching off the power option that allows the device to be switched off by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now apart from the fact that I need to select the profile at every restart both my mice are working together like a charm and in fact I have never experienced such a fine performance from a trackpad apart from Apple. This comes really close and I would
 even in certain instances prefer it to an external mouse.</p>

            <p>Thank you @zme-ul. Finally a solution that actually works. I tried it on both my laptops but it only worked on the new one. I guess it is hardware dependent. The other one is no worse off though. I will however check to see if I can copy the control-panel
 across as I can't find it on my older Pavilion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, thank you this fix works for the HP Envy Touch 15.</p>

            <p>No Sugarz, it's not a stupid question. There are hundreds of different Synaptics drivers. Some are published by your PC vendor and others by Synaptics. It seems that in my case, the driver that Windows automatically selects for me every time there is a major
 upgrade has the feature to save a profile. I can then set it up in a certain way and every time I restart my PC (which is only once every blue moon), I can then select the profile that I previously saved and it would return my settings to what I saved for
 the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Synaptics drivers remain problematic however. I have played around until I found a driver that suits my specific needs best. At one stage I found a driver on the HP site that retained its settings, but I didn't like its supported functionality, so I
 returned to the one that loses its settings but gives me a profile option. It sucks, u it is still a better option to enable the profile once in a while than having horrible functionality all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it seems with Synaptics you are sort of on your own to find a suitable solution that you like. The good news is that there are a good number of drivers available that you can play with if you are happy to experiment. I have been able to find
 reasonable compromises for most of my laptops by playing around with different drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you come right.</p>

<h2>            up and down arrow keys don&#39;t work properly.</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Lenovo Think Pad with Windows 10 operating system.&nbsp; It is working well except for scrolling.&nbsp;On Windows Explorer Edge,&nbsp;I find that the up and down arrow keys are often jerky or non operational then I go to the scroll bar and the left click
 area of the touch pad for a while, then I may find that it no longer wants to work properly, so I go back to the arrow keys again, which may or may not work.&nbsp; I have tried to correct the problem by pressing on the Fn button while using the arrow keys, which
 may work but not all the time.&nbsp; Is this a systemic problem or operator error?</p>

            I have not received an answer to this question.&nbsp; However, I have down loaded some updates and tried some other techniques, using a combination of the arrow keys and the touch pad and the Fn key that seems to make things work better. I also notice that
 some sites work better than others.&nbsp; The arrow keys for scrolling still do not work as smoothly as my old Dell, but I am adjusting to that.

            <p>Hi granan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are known issues with computers with touchpads and Windows 10......</p>
<p>
</p><p>uncontrolled zooming - page resizes/zooms for no apparent reason while typing</p>
<p>uncontrolled scrolling - page scrolls for no apparent reason...</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... you could have described it as .... you just have to wave your hand over the touchpad and the page scrolls/zooms uncontrollable.....</p>

Fix touchpad problems in Windows 10
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>If your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Start,</strong> enter <strong>Device Manager,</strong> and select it from the list of results. Under
<strong>Mice and other pointing devices,</strong> select your touchpad, open it, select the Driver tab, and select
<strong>Update Driver.</strong> If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li><li>If those steps didn't work, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open <strong>
Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) the touchpad driver, and select Uninstall. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li><li>If that didn't work, try using the generic driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in
<strong>Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) your touchpad driver &gt;
<strong>Update driver software... </strong>&gt; <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong> &gt;
<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer,</strong> select
<strong>HID compliant mouse,</strong> select <strong>Next,</strong> and follow the instructions to install it.
</li><li>If changing your driver doesn’t help, there may be a problem with the touchpad itself. Contact your PC’s manufacturer for help.
</li></ul>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so it appears that the updates you have installed included updates for your mouse/touchpad drivers.........</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However, quite often, you may see your web pages zoom in and out, for no apparent reason.... while you are typing.......</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>this is because (by default) your touch pad also has multi-touch features for zooming and turning pages.... Multi-touch gestures...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To correct the problem (if you see it occurring.... your typing style may not place your fingers or thumbs over the touchpad)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>select the Search charm (on your taskbar) and type in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>and select it... then select Mouse, then the 'Device Settings tab',</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Settings button on Device Settings tab, you should see something similar to</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/408fa49f-0c59-4d9b-88c8-faf55af2402d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/408fa49f-0c59-4d9b-88c8-faf55af2402d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Uncheck the 'Multi-finger gestures' checkbox ---- this will disable the multi-touch zooming and scrolling features of your touchpad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you will still be able to scroll and zoom with your touchpad's mouse functions....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            I am down loading&nbsp;two updated drivers for my Audio and Wired Networking from the Intel web site.&nbsp; The Intel Driver Update Utility only ID'd those two drivers as needing updates.&nbsp; I did not see a section that checked my BIOS.&nbsp; How do I check to make sure
 my BIOS is updated.&nbsp; I have a DP55WB Desktop Board.&nbsp; Once I verify my BIOS, what is the program to check my memory?

<p>The files are corrupt, generally once you see a green overlay on image files, they are corrupt. Sometimes you will be able to see the top portion of the image and the rest is green, this also indicates corrupt files . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though, I have seen where most applications will not open these files and Windows Picture Viewer did view them, I then took a screen capture of them in Windows Picture Viewer and was able to have a copy of the images that way . . .</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 battery life issue, 91&#37; battery says I have 1 hour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yolandanelson2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 battery life issue, 91&#37; battery says I have 1 hour and 31 min of battery left&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    In a 6 hour period I loss 32% battery while in sleep, using the Sleepstudy to check it out. I have tried every option I found on the internet of getting the option to hibernate working on my Surface Pro 3, does hibernate actually work on the Surface Pro
 3? I've tried changing the option in gpedit, using powercfg to turn hibernate on, regedit (which only succeeded in turning off my Sleep option in the power options). I used a command line that is suppose to make my computer hibernate after it has been sleep
 for more than 2 hours but there is no visual way to know if this change will work. I'm tired of waking up with a dead battery every morning. I would much rather use hibernate for all overnight idle time. I even tried using the command shutdown /h, it does
 not work either. In case the question is buried too deep in my message: Can the Surface Pro 3 go into hibernation? if so how? Even willing to&nbsp; write batch files if necessary lol

<p>According to the SleepStudy report my computer does not go into hibernation at all. It stays in what Microsoft calls Modern Standby (I see nothing modern about it) I have attached a section of my sleep study in which my Surface stayed in stand by for 19
 hours and loss 93% of my battery while doing nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first link: I do not have a Sleep &gt; Hibernate in Power Options, I have tried everything I could find to turn on hibernation with no success. I have attached a pic of my Power Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through all the steps on link 2.</p>

<p>I figured out how to fix the hibernation problem, apparently my computer hibernation was defaulted to reduced. So I had to run this command as administrator: powercfg /h /type full.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why my computer was set to reduced hibernate file size since I have never used Hibernate since I bought it. Being able to look at the Powercfg response that I posted helped. I still don't know why my battery reports the wrong amount of time
 left on battery. At 91% it says 1 hr 31min, at 49% is says 1 hr 24min and at 28% it says 1 hr 38min. Not sure if it's a glitch but I have it set close to the Best Battery and I use the Darker monitor setting.</p>

            Hi Yolanda,
<br />
<br />Try to remove your battery driver
<br />
<br />Step 1: Plug in your Surface.
<br />Step 2: Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap or click Search.
<br />Step 3: In the search box, enter Device manager, and in the search results, tap or click Device Manager.
<br />Step 4: Tap or click the arrow next to the Batteries category.
<br />Step 5: Double tap Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, tap the Driver tab, tap Uninstall, and then tap OK. (If using a mouse, right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery, and click Uninstall.)
<br />
<br />Later update system.

                    <p>Mostly the App works fine but when I click on achievements on a game it crashes. Every time. Just freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to clear its cache?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it simply be updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Shadowbanned from Halo 5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chogun rua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shadowbanned from Halo 5</h2>
                    <p>I have been shadowbanned from h5. xbox support confirmed this on twitter and said theres no timetable for when my shadowban will be lifted. I have a brand new computer so the only thing i use my xbox for is Halo 5 and if i can't play that and am not going to be told when its lifted then i'll cancel LIVE and have to sell all of my xbox stuff because theres no point. i see this "shadowban"&nbsp;system they have as a scam to be able to keep banned players on the hook and paying for more xbox live since they never know when their ban will be lifted. Does anyone know any way around this or has my 10+ year relationship with xbox finally ended?</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Troubleshooting connection problems can be a challenge because there are so many possible causes. If your computer is having problems connecting to the Internet, or to other computers on a network, try using one of the networking troubleshooters to fix
 the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Open networking troubleshooters</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Let’s follow the below steps to enable IPv6:</div>
<div>1) Right click on the network icon and select ‘Open Network and Sharing Center’.<br />
2)&nbsp; In the resulting window, select Change adapter settings.<br />
3)&nbsp; In the Network Connections window, select Local Area Connection for the onboard NIC [Network Interface Card], then Change settings of this connection or file&gt;properties.<br />
4) In the connection property page, check the box for Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).<br />
5) Close all the windows and reboot your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the above method doesn’t fix your issue, we might have to enable each and every service that is dependent on Home group that includes the service that is dependent on ‘Peer Networking Group’ and ‘PNRP Machine Name Publication Service’.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step1:</strong>Let’s first start the ‘Homegroup Provider’ service and check if you get any error message.</div>
<div>‘Homegroup Provider’ service depends on the following system components. Go to each of the inter-related service and try to start them.</div>
<div>1. Function Discovery Provider Host.<br />
a. HTTP<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.<br />
2. Function Discovery Resource Publication<br />
a. HTTP<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.</div>
<div>3. Network List Service.<br />
a. Network Location Awareness<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step2: </strong>Peer Networking Group’ and ‘PNRP Machine Name Publication Service’ depends on the below components, try to start them first and then check for the issue:</div>
<div>1. Peer Name Resolution Protocol<br />
2. Peer Networking Identity Manager</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>As a work around you may try the following steps and check if that works fine:</div>
<div>Try deleting the file “idstore.sst” under the location: C:\windows\serviceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Get back to us with results.</div>

    <title>Window mode games resizing problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ezodagrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window mode games resizing problem.</h2>
                    Recently I installed Windows 7 (used Windows Vista previously). Everything is working fine except one small problem...<br />
I have a few games that I prefer playing in window mode instead of full screen, but since those games have limited resolution options, I have to chose&nbsp;a resolution like&nbsp;1280x1024 and resize the window (my screen resolution is 1440x900).<br />
In Windows Vista had no problems in resizing, but since&nbsp;I installed&nbsp;Windows 7 the graphics get somewhat distorted after resizing the window. It's more noticeable in letters.<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Ezodagrom ,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As you are using very high screen resolution, it will you give a distorted resolution.
 The screen resolution which you have set is higher than what is required by the application. Let’s change the compatibility settings manually and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.Right click on game, click on Properties &gt; Compatibility tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.Put a check mark in the following options:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Disable visual theme.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Disable desktop composition.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Disable scaling high on DPI settings.</span></span></p>

            Didn't work. :x<br />
If I open the game at a resolution smaller than my screen, for example 1280x720, it looks fine, but if I resize the window, if I make it smaller or bigger, the graphics get distorted. Also, this game resizes like windows games (solitaire, minesweeper), it keeps
 the aspect ration, so it's not possible to change only the height or only the width, both change at the same time.<br />
I wanted to open the game with the resolution 1280x1024 and make the window smaller so it fits my desktop. It worked well in Windows Vista, but in Windows 7 the result is the distorted graphics.<br />
<br />
This also kinda happens in games like solitaire, but only happens when I'm resizing the window. Unlike the game I'm trying to play,&nbsp;solitaire (and other windows games)&nbsp;refocus themselves&nbsp;once I stop holding the mouse, once the resize is complete.

<p>Hi&nbsp; Ezodagrom,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to play the game in Vista compatibility mode&nbsp; and check if that help.</p>
<p>To play the game in Vista SP 1 compatibility mode, let’s follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.Right click on the game, click properties, click compatibility tab, under compatibility mode, check mark “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” and select “Windows Vista(Service Pack 1)” from the drop down list. Click Apply and then click ok.<br />
<br />
2.Under “Privilege level”, click “Run this program as an administrator”, click apply and then click ok.<br />
<br />
3. Install the game successfully and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
<br />
4. Launch the game and check for its functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also reduce the screen resolution while playing those games and check.</p>
<p>Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.
<br />
Under Resolution, move the slider to the resolution you want, and then click Apply.<br />
&nbsp;Refer the links given below:</p>

<p>Vista or even&nbsp;XP&nbsp;Compatibility mode and changing the screen resolution didn't work either (sorry for taking so long to respond).<br />
<br />
On Windows 7 this is what happens:<br />
Game in Window Mode (1280x720)&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4206/psuwin71.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4206/psuwin71.jpg</a><br />

            <p><strong>@Putertut: </strong>Support for your computer would be through the manufacturer of the PC.&nbsp; If you purchased a retail copy of Windows 7 you have 90 days of support from the date of activation.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;materials with a retail version will be support
 contact information.&nbsp; Window mode would be set in the program, usually in the video\display settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>@Ezodagrom: </strong>I see that you stated you have the most recent drivers.&nbsp; I would check with ATI and verify that is still the case, just to be sure.&nbsp; Also make sure all your other hardware drivers are up to date as well. &nbsp;I run WoW and am able to
 put it in window mode and I can resize it without a problem.&nbsp; It does keep the ratio when I resize (the heigth\width can't be changed independantly) but the graphics stay the same.&nbsp; Have you checked with the game maker to see if there are any updates\patches
 that are needed with Windows 7?</p>

            Found another game where this is also happening, Sims 3. :x<br />
First I'll wait until the end of the month, the ATI Catalyst 10.1 drivers should be released until then. I'll try those drivers to see if something changes.
<br />
If the issue continues, I'll try asking in the AMD forums.<br />

Thanks for the help.

Also, my brother bought a netbook recently with Windows 7 Home Premium, he also has the same issue. His netbook is using the NVidia Ion platform, it uses different graphics drivers, so I think the problem might not be related to graphics drivers. x_x

<p>===============================<br />
You'll have to do screen captures/screen shots <br />
while the video is displayed in a media player.</p>
<p>Screen Captures:<br />
<br />
If you can import the video clips into Movie <br />
Maker it has a Take Picture option.<br />
It's quite simple to do screen caps with <br />
Movie Maker. At the bottom of the view <br />
screen you will see an icon that looks like <br />
a camera. <br />
<br />
Advance to the frame you want and click <br />
the icon (known as the "Take Picture" button)... <br />
you will be prompted to save the screen cap. <br />
<br />
In Vista Movie Maker...Try the following:<br />
Go to...Tools / Take Picture from Preview.<br />

try the following steps...<br />
<br />
Open Media Player Classic and go to...View /<br />
Options / Playback / Output...in the right pane...<br />
tick...System Default / Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Now play your movie clip and type...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alt+I<br />
to do the capture. You do not have to pause<br />
but it makes it easier to get the frame you want.<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/</a><br />
<br />
To setup for your screen captures...open VLC and<br />
go to...Tools / Preferences / Video button / Video<br />
Snapshots section.<br />
<br />
In the directory field...Browse to and select a folder<br />
to save your captures in. (for example...you could<br />
create a new folder on your desktop and select it)<br />
<br />
At...Prefix...check the box...Sequential numbering.<br />
<br />
At...Format...choose JPEG or PNG.<br />
<br />
Finally.....left click the 'Save' button.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 8 Upgrade Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewheaston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Upgrade Key</h2>
                    I purchased two copies of Windows 8 at the beginning of 2013. They were purchased through the windows upgrade option (from windows 7). I recently had to reformat one of my machines and reinstall the operating system. It was through this that I found out
 that my Windows 8 key would not allow me to install Windows 8.I was told that the key was for upgrade only, implying I needed to install 7 and then upgrade. This seems unnecessary and I am curious if there is any readily available solution here. Seems like
 those keys should be good for a fresh install.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I cannot proceed past step 2, as my key is flagged as upgrade only and the install is halted.<br />
<br />
I tried entering the keys and activating them on an install of 8 and the pics below are the same messages I receive when doing a clean install.<br />

            From user Bianrylnk at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-pro-upgrade-product-key-cant-be-used-to/1726d238-98fb-4634-a468-04645a8ee097">
this thread</a>. Worked for me.<br />
<br />
The work around for this, while probably not officially supported for obvious reasons (they want more money), is to change a registry key. This was posted for Windows 7 update keys doing the same thing on a forum (though I had an update version AND did a clean
 install MULTIPLE times without having to do this) but worked without an issue on my laptop running Windows 8 regardless.
<br />
<br />
1. Run the registry editor (regedit) <br />
2. Find the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE
<br />
3. Change the value for 'MediaBootInstall' from 1 to 0 <br />
4. Open an elevated command prompt (run as admin) <br />
5. Run the following command: slmgr -rearm <br />
6. Reboot<br />
<br />
If you already entered your key, check the activation: for me it was already activated and I needed to do nothing more. If not, type in activate windows and type in the key; it should work. Also, do yourself a favor and export this key from regedit and save
 it somewhere if you ever are required to do another clean install. I know I did.<br />
<br />
I had the same issue here, and it's simply asinine. Have the INSTALLER check for a copy of Windows 7 or lower on a hard disk before INSTALLING Windows 8; that way, we can have a clean install LIKE IT LETS US DO. Either that, or remove the option altogether.
 Most importantly: inform your customers of this limitation (because telling them that they can do a clean install using update media, while true, is&nbsp;VERY misleading when the product license won't allow it).
<br />
<br />
In short, it's bull-poo (I wanted to use a word that rhymes with 'trap' but obviously that's too vulgar. Enjoy "bull-poo" because what it implies is actually worse) like this that leads to pirating. If I hadn't found the registry edit, I had 3 options as I
 saw it:<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall Win8, reinstall Win7, upgrade Win7 to Win8 (makes a lot of sense, right? Especially seeing that I didn't know my key wasn't activated until hours after entering it, and had already installed drivers and software)&nbsp;<br />
2. Buy a 'full' Win8 product key (There's an extra couple bucks that I didn't need...)
<br />
or 3. Pirate it <br />
<br />
Hint: I was leaning towards 3. I already paid, I had every right to use the software I just purchased without having to jump through hoops or repurchase Win8 for both my PCs (not to mention, I own so many Microsoft products: from some of their mice to their
 phone to an Xbox...).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
(I'm in no way endorsing pirating, just saying simply that this is generally the root cause--aside from pricing--and it's time that companies begin to realize that. Restrictive DRM generally leads to more frustration from your customers and more pirating results.
 Period. Rather than muddying the legal waters through lobbying, take preventive action and serve your customers...) &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Annu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the solutions, unfortunately the Film &amp; TV app still has the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2016 and it now controls my firewall, could it be blocking the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the icons in the Start menu randomly stopped displaying images, could that be related?</p>

            You could try temporarily disabling Kaspersky and see if it makes any difference.&nbsp; There have certainly been "clashes" between the two products since the launch if Windows 10

 also two for some reason. Ive searched up many similar problems but theyre never like this and the resolution they found didnt work for me. Please help :(</p>

            Hi Ian,<br />
<br />
We would like to know when did this issue start. Since you've done a lot of troubleshooting steps and the issue persists, we recommend contacting your device manufacturer for assistance.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            This has probably been going on a couple months now. The laptop has suffered no traumas either (i.e falling on the ground) so I don't think anythings broke. It seemingly happened out of nowhere, I can't think of any software that was installed that might
 of caused this issue either. Also the laptop that is having this problem is a Dell Latitude E5420.

<p>Hi Nancy,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can download <strong>Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Express</strong> from the <strong>
Microsoft Download Center </strong>on this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=42299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. You may also search for the rest of the applications there. If you still encounter issues after installing them from that source, I suggest you create a new topic in the
<strong><a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MSDN forum</a></strong>, where fellow programmers can provide input regarding your concern.<br />

</p><p>There has never been an option to use Skype Translator in the older version of Skype for Linux. You might have used Skype for Web before where this function has been made available, unfortunately, the option to use Skype Translator in Skype for Web has also
 been removed as communicated on this post: <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_other-skype_translator/skype-translator-calls-no-longer-supported-on-some/4ef366f4-568d-4f4d-b42b-1828a3d7a41f?tm=1516708787310&amp;auth=1">Skype
 Translator no longer supported on some Skype clients - 22 January 2018</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the new Skype, you need to follow the steps below to use Skype Translator:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on your contact and click view profile or you can go to your chat with them and click their name at the top.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start translator</strong>. A new translated chat will be created.</li></ol>

<p>No sir..It was in the beta version on Linux and I used the translation by clicking on the icon automatically.</p>
<p>The current method of translation is not good and uncomfortable hoping to add this tool in the releases leaders</p>

<p>==========================================================<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total
<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -
<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -
<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue
<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose
<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded to
<br />
Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />
<br />
When you insert a CD or a DVD, Windows Vista may not recognize the disc<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD
<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others
<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some
<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.
<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the
<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course
<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as
<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD
<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />
