<h2>            Epson scanner V550 does not work in Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago, and realized my Epson scanner (Perfection V550) does not work anymore. &nbsp;I uninstalled all the &nbsp;V500 software, and then downloaded Epson scanner driver and other utility programs for Window 10 from the Epson site.
 &nbsp;But it still does not work. &nbsp;It displays an error message saying the driver is not compatible. &nbsp;Are any fix for V550 available anywhere?

            <p>I unistalled Epson Scan and other utilities and then installed the version listed as Windows 8.1 64 bits from the Epson site. &nbsp;That is 13936.exe, but didn't work either, just like 15918.exe. &nbsp;The message was "cannot communicate to the device". &nbsp;What else
 can I do?</p>

            <p>I called Epson customer service and they said it may be the Norton security system is blocking the scanner to work, so try to deactivate firewall in Norton. &nbsp;He said the 15918.exe is the right version to work in Windows 10. &nbsp;It wasn't easy to find out how
 to deactivate the firewall in Norton, but I managed, but did not make any difference. &nbsp;However, after I gave up, then thought just to make sure that I have the correct version of scanner software to install 15918.exe. &nbsp;Then after I restarted my PC, the scanner
 worked. &nbsp;I just don't know why since at this point the Norton's firewall was back ON. &nbsp;In any case it is working now.</p>

            I also found last night that the Epson Scan utility for my V550 Photo would do a preview but a full scan resulted in a blank file. If I use the WIA interface then the image transfers. I 'll try uninstalling, cleaning the registry with CCleaner and then
 reinstalling to see if that works. Epson Support is also looking at the problem.

<p>Hi. After a lot of Googling I found a solution that worked. The issue is that the migration to Win10 is not accurate for this application. What worked for me was to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall the application</li><li>Remove any remaining folders that the uninstall missed</li><li>Use CCleaner or similar to clean the registry and remove any settings that are left behind as installers don't always clean up properly after themselves :-(</li><li>Do a clean install of the latest version of the software from the Epson web site</li></ol>
<p>Good luck with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had same problem with my Epson Perfection V550 Photo - work just fine in Windowws 8.1 but in Windows 10 Pro (new installation on new notebook so also new instalation of epson drivers) dont work at all. I tried everything. Every tip or steps you can find
 - uninstall the drivers, install them again, install them in compatibility mode, check the WIA, run the Epson SW in compatibility mode or not... nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing was VueScan SW work as a charm so no problem with the scanner or USB (as windows 10 tried to convince me when I run the&nbsp;troubleshooting and it just said that its usb2 device incompatible with usb3 - what a hoax any usb2 device must be compatible
 because usb is backwards compatible!!). So in one different SW I got error that driver is not installed - hmmm weird because it seems installed and ok. Then I realize the driver is probably not signed by MICROSOFT because there is enforced driver signature
 verificaton in Windows 10 (what a insane&nbsp;idea!!!!). </p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you turn off this signature verification (I used cmd and command: &nbsp;bcdedit /set testsigning on &nbsp; and after rebbot to testing environment and installing the drivers again and go back with command: &nbsp;&nbsp;bcdedit /set testsigning off &nbsp; and reboot<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">)</span>
 the driver and SW start to work just fine! BINGO! But there is still one problem - seems its not permanent, I didnt reboot my computer just put it to sleep and then wake it up and the verification was again on because the SW wasnt working again..... its quite
 annoying to turning off the verification (it needs a reboot). So I tried different command (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">bcdedit -set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS</span>) and reboot and again its working but who knows if this
 would be permament solution.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>So question for our dear Microsoft - why the **** you must&nbsp;complicate people's lives, will you pleas SIGN those Epsons drivers? And if not, WHY NOT????? And in this case please send us HOW TO DEACTIVATE DRIVERS SIGNATURE VERIFICATION FOR GOOD - FOR ALL TIMES
 NO MATER OF REBOOT OR UPDATE. Thanks.....</p>

            <p><strong>I STRONGLY SUPPORT YOUR APPEAL TO "Dear MICROSOFT"!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved similar problem turning off signature verification during computer SETUP procedure. This way I have no further problem with an unsigned driver after next reboots).
</p>
<p>So you may try this way (please take into account that I don't remember exact English translation of all names of individual steps):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 symbol - click left bottom corner of screen</p>
<p>1) Restart computer pressing key SHIFT and follow next menu,</p>
<p>2) Choose option &nbsp;&gt;&gt; Solve problems</p>
<p>3) Solve problems &gt;&gt; Advanced options</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;Advanced options &gt;&gt; Startup settings (fifth box on screen)</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Startup settings &nbsp;&gt;&gt; T<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">urn off signature verification&nbsp;</span>(fifth option)</p>
<p>5a) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &gt;&gt; Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now install the unsigned driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next, repeat the procedure described above changing only step 5:</span></p>
<p><span>5)&nbsp;Startup settings &nbsp;&gt;&gt; T</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">urn
 on signature verification.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I do not remember, if the above last step is really necessary.</span></p>
<p>Good luck!<br />
</p>

            <i>"I have the same problem as slick... </i><i>except for the fact that it says something about Direct X fail code 15"</i><br />
<br />
slick ?<br />
If you have a different error then you have a different problem, not the same.<br />
You need to find out your system specifications, particularly the graphics card.<br />
JC2 will not run on a graphics card that is not compatible with Direct X 10.<br />
<br />
If you are stating the error about not having enough storage correctly then it may just
<br />
be that your Hard Drive does not have enough space left to install the game ( the game<br />
requires 10GB free space, and your HDD also needs to maintain 15% free space beyond that for defragmenting ), or it may just be that your Temp folder is too full.
<br />
Running&nbsp; <i>Disk Cleanup</i> may clear the Temp folder enough to allow for installation.<br />
<br />
If the error is relating to memory it may be you have Integrated Graphics and do not have
<br />
enough system RAM allocated to run the game. The game needs a minimum of 256MB to run,<br />
and some older laptops only allocate 64 - 128 MB.<br />
Also, some older versions of Integrated graphics may not be capable of running the game.<br />

            I'd say your problem is with the GMA X4500 Integrated Graphics. <br />
<br />
While JC 2 is not bench marked below it is not an integrated graphics friendly game.<br />
Some games have very low minimum settings, but they are limited, particularly with more<br />
recent games, as you can see in the review for your graphics chip.<br />
<br />
I know JC 2 will run on Intel HD4000 and probably HD3000 integrated graphics, but the GMA X4500 probably has too low specs for the game.<br />

<h2>            wczdlg.dll and netshell.dll missing and unable to start my Windows firewall</h2>
                    <div>Hi All</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope someone will be so good as to help my with this situation I have been trying to resolve (unsuccessfully) for that past week or so.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have lost my firewall,l and network connections. &nbsp;As advised I checked state of the Wireless Zero Configuration. &nbsp;The state was "stopped" and there was not a solution for this. &nbsp;I keep typing requests for the a solution ot wczdlg.dll and netshell.dll missing.
 &nbsp; I can now sign on to BT.openzone - this is the only way I can use the web.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also I am unable to start my Windows firewall. &nbsp;I have not idea why my system has become so corrupted - the only situation I had was that my charger stopped working and crashed my laptop. &nbsp;I also lent my laptop (HP compaq nc4200 Xp) to my daughter. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not have a recovery disc and the disc I have with drivers does not download. &nbsp;I would be grateful for any resolution to this issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am only a moderate user ad do not have knowledge in relation to the actual system so will need step by step guidance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many Thanks</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows Update Failure with error codes 80070543 and 80070436</h2>
                    I recently purchased two Windows 8 Pro upgrades with media to upgrade a Windows 8 basic 64 bit laptop and a Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit laptop. Both machines are subsequently having problems with Windows Update. The Windows 8 basic to Pro upgrade shows
 2 important updates, but when "Install Updates" is clicked, the progress bar shows no progress and soon throws up the error code 80070543. &nbsp;The Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 Pro upgrade shows 42 important updates, but clicking on the "Install Updates"
 button shows zero progress and soon throws up error codes 80070543 and 80070436. Working my way through the 31 pages of problems with Windows Update in this "community" I have tried the clean boot method, the running of DISM ...Scanhealth and RestoreHealth
 method, the renaming of the specified folders with the extension "old" so that the folders are rebuilt, the running of the troubleshooter on Windows Update - all to no avail. Windows Pro is running fine on both machines, but t

            Normally when you reinstall as the Administrator, a data drive like that will issue permissions when you click on it.  It just takes awhile for it to permission the whole drive to the new Admin.  
<br />
<br />If not then did you install as a Standard User?  
<br />
<br />You can always install the Take Ownership shortcut to your right click Menu to permission any file or folder except C entire folder.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>

            <p>The correct link (see next paragraph) works for me.&nbsp; Are you using Internet Explorer?&nbsp; This doesn't seem to be as absolutely required as it was not too long ago, but it's still probably best to use IE rather than someone else's browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you probably have an old link that went directly to a download rather than searching for it.&nbsp; The Microsoft Update Catalog has changed recently (see my comments in the last paragraph) and if your link was from prior to that change, I suspect that's
 why you're getting the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the home page and search for what you want:&nbsp; </p>
<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx</a>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I won't pretend that I know what an "USB Ethernet/RNDIS Gadget" is, but I do see multiple entries in the Microsoft Update Catalog for very similarly-named items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search for</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; USB RNDIS Gadget</p>
<p>
</p><p>you get 9 hits, two of which have Windows 7 drivers.&nbsp; One is small (1/13/2010 21KB) and the other is larger and is dated later (5/31/2010 103KB).&nbsp; Both descriptions say they are for both x32 and x64.&nbsp; The larger file says it's good for XP and Vista in addition
 to 7 and later (perhaps XP and Vista drivers are what is in the added space).&nbsp; The smaller file says its for 7 and later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file you linked to is for Vista only.&nbsp; Is that what you need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that if you remove the word "gadget" from the search, you get many more hits, including drivers applicable to systems other than Acers.&nbsp; I haven't looked at the USB VID/PID info for "supported devices" in all of these downloads, but you need
 to make sure that you're getting the right thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I see that the Microsoft Update Catalog appears to have changed recently.&nbsp; When you click on the "Download" button, the window that pops up used to ask you to select a location in which to save the file and issue a UAC prompt.&nbsp; Only after you had
 responded to the UAC prompt and picked a location could you actually start the download.&nbsp; Now, the popup has a link that when clicked gives you the options to open/save/save as (depending on which browser you're using).&nbsp; And there's no more UAC.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2017 I5 4G RAM 128G SSD extremely slow SSD performance</h2>
                    <p>Got the newest surface pro 2017 , however was very disappointed&nbsp;with its SSD performance.&nbsp; I tried to extract a large zip file with lots of small files in it ( .js, .html , .css etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;It took more than 6 hours to extract 70% of the 9&nbsp;gb file. I did some
 research and realized the problem is with write speed of small files ( &lt; 4k ).&nbsp; The AS SSD bench mark showed 0.39mb/s for 4k file write. It kind of match real world situation where speed is actually lower , &lt;100kb/s at certain times. I have attached two screen
 copies to show the speed. 300kb/s is the speed&nbsp;in floppy drive era. I have turned off search indexing and bitlocker and that did not help. There are older threads&nbsp;on similar issues. The solution would be to install Samsung NVM express driver or Samsung Magician
 tools. However the latest version of driver or software would not work with my surface pro, apparently the windows 10 is too new and the 128G Samsung KUS020203M SSD is too old. I have spent more than 24 hours on this thing and next steps would be firmware
 upgrade or take it apart to&nbsp;replace SSD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did lots of research before buying this surface pro. So far I liked everything else except for the slow SSD. 300kb/s is not acceptable as I am a developer and I deal with lots of small files. Unless there is a reasonably feasible solution to solve the
 SSD performance issue this surface pro is going back to the store.&nbsp; Also forget about 13.5 hour video play time on single battery charge, my fully charged battery dropped to below 20% trying to extract one zip file.
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>

There are several possible causes for your device to have slow performance. One possible resolution is to ensure that your device has the latest updates. To ensure that all updates are installed in your Surface, you may click this link:

<p>I contacted support on this issues.&nbsp; I let them on my new Surface Pro i5 2017 with 256SSD to correct the problem. He was one click away from WIPEING my Surface clean to factory defaults before I stopped him. &nbsp; He had no clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through all the diagnostics and driver checks ...&nbsp; And nothing seems to correct it. I will call into Microsoft support tomorrow and talk to a manager.&nbsp; I paid WAY too much to get a drive that writes slower than my micro sd card.&nbsp; Seriously Microsoft?</p>

</p><p>This is the performance I am getting across the write size range.&nbsp; Clearly there is an issue with the configuration.&nbsp; With only a 4k allocation unit, the small file write speeds should be much faster.&nbsp; instead of 349 at 500 k file size I should see something
 like 12000+.&nbsp; This is slower write speed than the Micro SDXC in I have in this unit.&nbsp; My SDXC is more than twice the write speed up to 16meg file size.&nbsp; A similar Samsung SSD in a USB 3.0 external Enclosure is getting 35 to 45 times better speed with small
 files.&nbsp; So the unit can support the transfer speeds and it is reasonably fast with larger files peaking in excess of 260 meg write and nearly 600 megs read.&nbsp; The problem is not the drive itself or the controller, it is the software or configuration.&nbsp; It feels
 like the write cache is turned off. If I turned off the write cache on my external SSD the performance would drop closed to what I am getting with the internal SSD.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to get this fixed.</p>

<p>I have reset my Surface Pro to Factory default wiping it clean.&nbsp; The performance is&nbsp;the same.&nbsp; I was back on a call with Microsoft support and now waiting for a specialist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran tests just now using CrystalDiskMark and the results are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/544519ab-fcf3-4e4a-8d2a-b562c292efa7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/544519ab-fcf3-4e4a-8d2a-b562c292efa7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>These are number closer to what I would expect.&nbsp; Could it be that benchmark software we are using is not working correctly with Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, before I reset, I turned of bitBlocker and allowed it decrypt the drive to see if it made a difference and it was minimal.&nbsp; So bitblocker is not the problem.</p>

            So it turns out the SSD on my Surface is super fast.&nbsp; You can see via the CrystalMark results. As it turns out, the test software I was using (ATTO Bench) does not appear to be compatible with the NVM Express Controller.&nbsp; Those of you having what you think
 may be slow disk writes should try other test software to see if you get different results.

    <title>windows 1809 disabled brightness controls for taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c0mand3r c0dy11  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 1809 disabled brightness controls for taskbar</h2>
                    so I just updated my laptop to 1809 only 4 days ago and notice that my brightness control from the battery icon on the bottom right of my desktop (right side of&nbsp;taskbar) is now missing when I press the battery module. I thought it was the drivers but I
 just uninstalled and reinstalled my display&nbsp;adapter drivers using the auto install as well as the official page of the manufacturer. I can actually still adjust my brightness by going to settings&gt;search&gt;display&gt;change brightness so it definitely&nbsp;is not a display
 issue. more so that the update just removed controls for the battery brightness adjuster of the taskbar. I replicated this by installing the update on my sister's laptop and the same exact thing happened. can you please request a patch to fix this issue? the
 update number is 1809 and OS build is 17763.195

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:

<br />Perform a repair upgrade

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers. 
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller 
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr</a>... 
<br />
<br />Then install the desired driver you previously downloaded. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

            There is no confirmed fix for it yet.  Currently our best guess is to replace the current video driver, with an older one, a newer one or one from the video maker (Radeon) ...
<br />
<br />UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER 
<br />- In start menu search for Control Panelâ€™ (icon view) 
<br />- Right click on Device Manager 
<br />- Select Run as Admin 
<br />- Expand Display Adapters
<br />- double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall to display the Driver Properties dialog
<br />- You have buttons for 3 options: 
<br />- if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the â€œRoll Back Driver buttonâ€ 
<br />- or you can try the Uninstall button 
<br />- or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update â€œmanuallyâ€ is better) 
<br />- restart Windows 
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to the web site for the video card maker and see if they have a newer driver for the specific video card.  Also ask the same question there to see if they can come up with a better answer.

            Customers with AMD Graphics card in their system are encountering similar issues...
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />The next step would be to block Driver updates from Windows updates. For this,

<h3> matrixman_2117  say:</h3>
<h2>            My PSP Memory Stick doesn&#39;t work&#33;</h2>
                    After updating my PSP to version 6.60 i took out the memory stick, now i put it back in and it doesn't read! my PC detects the PSp but not the Memory Stick... Formatting isn't an option either, since i can't lose what i have on there! but even if i could,
 it's not being detected...&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Now Formatting isn't an option, other forums say it could be a corrupted Memory Stick, that just went bad over time...&nbsp;
<div>Another says it could be the Motherboard or WiFi card... Now i drop it rather frequently(about 1-3 times a month)... i don't know if that would or could dislodge contacts or welds in the boards...&nbsp;</div>
<div>everything works perfectly fine, but it just doesn't detect the card.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other thing i did was download Monsters by Pixel Junk Demo right after i connected to the internet for the first time...&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tried to download the demo for LittleBigPlanet but it went for about 5 minutes calculating the time for the download, it eventually went up so far as to go to 1077 minutes before i canceled it. and when i did try it lagged for about a minute with the
 circular loading sign in the bottom right corner. then it went back to the Playstation store. after which i tried to play the game, but had to activate the system in order to. I did so and when i went back to play, it couldn't detect the stick.</div>
<div>I've tried everything except formatting at &gt;<a href="http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/threads/78420-no-memory-stick-inserted!!!!/page2?s=297f1e58992671fbb65f8657671d50d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/threads/78420-no-memory-stick-inserted!!!!/page2?s=297f1e58992671fbb65f8657671d50d3</a>&lt;
 nothing really works... i'm thinking it could be a factory error, or maybe my error singe the stick had about 80mB of space after i deleted the Update installation package.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Someone said i just need a card reader to copy it onto another stick and i'll be fine with the new stick...</div>
<div>Or to just take it to a shop because it's a simple fix...</div>
<div>Please help me... I'm sad without it:'(</div>

 no one else knew those numbers besides employees at Microsoft and myself.&nbsp; He then&nbsp;told me a bunch of different things to do on my computer and the Windows 8 account number that he had originally given me showed up on my computer.&nbsp; After he proved to me that
 the account numbers matched up, I actually assumed that he was a legitimate caller from Microsoft.

 necessary in order&nbsp;to remove the thousands&nbsp;of viruses that my computer had supposedly&nbsp;accumulated).&nbsp;I was told that there were so many viruses on my computer that it would crash hard if I didnâ€™t get them removed soon.

</span>He told me that the only way that the problem could be fixed was if I updated to Windows 10 and bought an antivirus from Microsoft that cost $199 for silver and $259 for gold.
<span>&nbsp;</span>While we were talking, some software that was supposed to have been Windows 10 was downloading to my computer.<span>&nbsp;

</span>After I told him that I didnâ€™t have the money, he told me that all of my computers, tablets, and phones would crash because of the viruses.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I continued to refuse him and after a while he told me that I could have Windows 10 for free.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We were suddenly disconnected.<span>&nbsp; </span>At that very moment I knew that I had been had.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I turned my computer off right in the middle of downloading the program that was supposed to have been Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I was afraid to touch my computer all night.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I finally turned it on this morning, everything seemed to have been fine except all of my backgrounds were black.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I noticed too that when I went to Word, I had to click on an agreement just like I did when I first got the software. The only thing that Norton found were a few medium threats that were quarantined.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>recycle bin not available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithbrucexb  say:</h3>
<h2>            recycle bin not available</h2>
                    I tried to restore the desk top icon by right clicking on the desktop and following the normal steps to restore the icon fro the recycle bin. This did not work despite several attempts. I could see that the recycle bin was listed but it showed it as being
 full. I am still unable to access it which is why it is full!

            I have tried this - all that happens is that the recycle bin shows up on the available desk top icons but when it is selected and OK is clicked the icon fails to apppear on the desk top. That is my problem!<br />

<p>
Prueba a hacer un power cycle de la consola, a veces puede ocurrir que se queda como trabada a mi tambien me ha sucedido eso que describes en ocasiones, entonces este mÃ©todo ayuda a resolver este detalle. Sigue el link que dejo a continuaciÃ³n.<br />
<br />
https://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console<br />
<br />
Si esto no llegase a funcionar, pruebe quitando el cable de alimentacion de la consola por 30 segundos y luego reconÃ©ctelo de nuevo. DespuÃ©s de esto, trate nuevamente.<br />
<br />
Espero que soluciones tu problema. Un saludo

<p><span>It would be helpful for us to identify the problem if you could upload the dump file.</span></p>
<p><span>You can use the Sky-drive to upload the dump file, refer the following link for the steps on how to upload
 file to Sky-drive. The location of the dump file is â€˜C:\Windows\Minidump\â€™.</span></p>

<p>I for some reason could only upload these ten dump files. I will continue to try to add the other 15 files located in my minidump file on my C:// drive. hopefully these are the ones you asked for.</p>

            <p>Ok I tried to apply the hotfix and it came up incompatible to my computer. I also had complete system failure this week. I just today finally got my pc to boot up. It wont allow me to upload any other dump files even though I changed all the permissions
 for the files to public. I am at a loss. I am ready to switch back to my other OS (Vista) its buggy as well but my pc atleast worked for the most part.</p>

            <p>Hi Kretinburger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to set 5.1 channel in VLC and check if it helps. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>+</strong> to bring up preferences.</li><li>At the bottom of the right-hand navigation select the <code><strong>All</strong></code> radio-button under the
<em><strong>Show settings</strong></em> area (bottom left of the interface).</li><li>Now expand the <em><strong>Audio</strong></em> tree, select <em><strong>Out Modules</strong></em> and select
<code><strong>DirectX</strong></code>.</li><li>Select your "<strong>Output device</strong>" and "<strong>Speaker configuration</strong>" from the drop down menus.</li><li>Restart VLC.</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still persists, you may contact <a href="https://forum.videolan.org/viewforum.php?f=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VLC forums</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need any other assistance on Windows. </p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>
