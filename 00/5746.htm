<h2>            BANNED CONTENTS ALERT when trying to send an email from my Hotmail account into recipient&#58;&#39;&#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have recently noticed&nbsp; whenever I have sent an email including a attachments into the following recipient: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I faced 'BANNED contents from you (.exe,.dll,gmpopenh264.dll)‏'.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the entire message from the Postmaster:(<span> <strong>Content-filter at gate.cmul.net</strong> (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<pre>Message-ID: &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;<br />Subject: RE: IDM Support Request: Internet Download Manager sometimes capture<br />  openh264-win32-v1.1-Firefo[...]<br /><br />Delivery of the email was stopped!<br /><br />The message has been blocked because it contains a component<br />(as a MIME part or nested within) with declared name<br />or MIME type or contents type violating our access policy.<br /><br />To transfer contents that may be considered risky or unwanted<br />by site policies, or simply too large for mailing, please consider<br />publishing your content on the web, and only sending an URL of the<br />document to the recipient.<br /><br />Depending on the recipient and sender site policies, with a little<br />effort it might still be possible to send any contents (including<br />viruses) using one of the following methods:<br /><br />- encrypted using pgp, gpg or other encryption methods;<br /><br />- wrapped in a password-protected or scrambled container or archiv

<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Firstly:</strong> I don't know what <span>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' </span>
stopped delivering my email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><strong>Secondly: </strong>Does this <strong>'</strong></span><span><strong>Content-filter at gate.cmul.net</strong> (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span> ' belong to Microsoft?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Finally:: </strong>I don't know why I am receiving such the BANNED CONTENTS ALERT. I really have a problem with Internet Download Manager, which IDM sometimes catches downloads without permitting me for instance this one below:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75285749-bb4e-4013-a72e-17972b56d3bd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Thus, I have downloaded that file and then sent a message to ' *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' to explain them I have a problem with their program IDM.<br />
</p>
<p>AFter that, I have attached that file and screen shot below with my message sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, Postmaster replied to me with delivery of my email was stopped to send to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay as we were investigating on the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Postmaster is a term used to identify the administrator of a mail server.</span><span>Nearly every domain will have the e-mail address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** where errors in e-mail processing are directed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Delivery failure comes from the same domains postmaster which you are using to send the emails. In your case the delivery failure is by Microsoft.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems like tonec.com domain is not allowing the content you are sending in attachment (could be their policy restriction)</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the issue I would want you to reply to the following questions:</span></p>

<h2>            Create a floor plan with Visio 2007.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I want to draw a floor plan. It says, "go to File, New, Floor Plan", but there is nothing listed as "Floor Plan" when I try that? Can't I draw a simple floor plan -- for my deck -- using Visio 2007? I used to do so with Visio 2003 many years back.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm limping along using an Office Floor Plan Templete -- it ain't right! Help get me started on how to do simple straightforward drawings - 2D is all I really need.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 Mac triggers macOS Mojave bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gctwnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Mac triggers macOS Mojave bug</h2>
                    <p>I've one new Mac (a Mac mini 2018) running macOS Mojave which I have set up by migrating from an older iMac that was running macOS High Sierra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office 2016 is installed on that machine. The old one is no longer used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble (or to be precise, a family member is having trouble) with an Excel spreadsheet that when she works with it produces unexpected behaviour. For instance, changing colour of part of a text in a cell also changes the font (so, might the font
 stuff be corrupted)? And a few times she has had the nasty problem that Excel completely trashed the macOS many. The menus were still there, but no text was displayed in any item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That at least is also a Mojave bug (triggered by Excel, but intermittently), but rather then become a pingpong ball between Apple and Microsoft I'd like this issue to be solved so my family member can reliably use Excel on the new computer (the old computer
 is no longer in use, but there is also a laptop with Office 2016 installed on it, which she can use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to reinstall Office 2016 to see if that solves the problem, but I can't find information on how to do that. There are all these different ways in which Office could have been installed (purchased through university/school discounts, but not coupled
 to a school/university account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe another tip I could use is how I can let Office recreate all caches etc. because maybe that could help.</p>

<p>OMG. I think you've been led astray.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I strongly advise against uninstall/reinstall at this stage of troubleshooting. DON'T DO IT!
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By far the most common cause of trouble with Excel in Mohave is that Office needs updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very first thing you should have been told to do is to determine which version of Excel you currently have. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Go to the Applications folder. Right click on Microsoft Excel.app icon and from the pop-up menu choose Get Info.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty easy, yes? </p>
<p>
</p><p>You posted to the Office 2016 forum, so I will assume you do have Office 2016. The current version of Office 2016 can be either 16.16.6 or 16.16.7
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a version other than the two I mentioned, please disregard ALL the previous advice you were given. Here's how to install updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><strong>Download a fresh copy of the current version of AutoUpdate from this link, install and then run AutoUpdate to bring your installation to current update level, then restart your Mac.</strong></span></p>

    <title>What will happen with my email account after Windows Live Domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alkonusa teknik inti  say:</h3>
<h2>            What will happen with my email account after Windows Live Domain service has been shut down&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Admin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised with the decision of Microsoft to shut down the windows live domain service.</p>
<p>I want to know what will happen with our current email with custom domain name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I still can login to the adminstrator site (domains.live.com) but cannot remove a user.</p>
<p>At first I thought it's just a problem in your side. But after I read your message in domains.live.com;</p>
<p>I think you've started a war with your user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case I had to pay and choose between 365 and G-Apps, I'msure i won't ever choose 365.</p>
<p>It's not impossible for me to experience this kind of treatment, which I called "unilateral termination",<br />
AGAIN in the future when Microsoft feel that 365 is not profitable...???<br />
<br />
I hope this matter can be solved without further problem... And I will see other alternatives service for the moment.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tony</p>

            <p>At the moment, I have no budget to subscribe to either Google Apps and Office 365. Especially the later one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time I used Google Apps, they promise the user that the account will always be active. Microsoft cannot make this same statement... It is (in my perspective) is like a threat, to force the user to use the premium product. I really think, this will be
 the last time I'm using Microsoft Email service...</p>

<p>Shortly, we put data in&nbsp;data:application/pdf and use window.open() method to open the pdf in browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This function works normally before this week, it in fact works for almost one year already in both IE/Firefox/Chrome browsers with pdf add-on or viewer plugins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this week on, &nbsp;all IE versions does not work any more, error shows as following, can anyone help me to find out the reason?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I guess this is the problem of IE or Adobe, but since Adobe is not updated before, IE is set to update automatically, so i first come here for help, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not tell me to reset IE or enable/disable IE, all these methods have been tried by us but didn't work.</p>

<h2>            ASHA 303 custom POP3 setting</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with custom email setup. When I try to setup a new email account, I have option to input email address and password but no POP3 and SMTP server. When I click on sign-in, I get some error message (something like: login is not possible, please
 try again later). I expect to get some wizard to setup POP3 and SMTP server.</p>
<p>BTW, internet connection and my Gmail account are working properly.</p>
<p>Is there any solution for my problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Nenad</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;nelezele,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you setup an e-mail account, the server will be detected and if recognised it will download the settings automatically. However, if the server is not recognised, the setup feature will give you the option to enter the settings manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have an error message while tryinig to set up your e-mail, I advise you to perform a soft reset: type *#7780# on the keypad. Original lock code is 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, perform a hard reset. First of all, back up your data using&nbsp;<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/product-support/nokia-ovi-suite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite</a>. Once your data is fully backed up, &nbsp;type *#7370#
 on the keypad.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you may also check for updates on Nokia Suite (by going to Tools &gt; Updates). If no updates are available, reinstall the current version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Astra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, thanks for quick response!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve tried soft restart but with no results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I contacted NOKIA’s contact center for Europe (by e-mail and later by phone) and I asked them for my problem. The answer is something I can’t believe:</p>
<p>“If you want to make any other e-mail account (none of predefined), you will have to contact us and we will make it for you. You are not able to do it for your safety and your comfort.”</p>
<p>Is it possible?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>They said me that process of opening new account may take 1 day to 1 month! <em>
“… for your comfort…”</em> Also they asked me for all POP3 and SMTP settings and my username and password for that account (I did not give my username and password).</p>
<p>If this is true, my privacy is threatened and functionality purchased (e-mail) is denied!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Astra, you have NOKIA sign next to your name, so I suppose you are some NOKIA authorized moderator. Could you check this, please? (url I have used:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody have similar problem?</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. Nokia is currently working on it to find a solution. Mailserver information is not accepted. Also when setting out port on fe 26 nokia 303 switches it to 25 . No deal this is not good!</p>

<p>I too am having a problem and am unable even to set &nbsp;my Gamil account working. I have three POP3 accounts that I can get up and running on everything else I have except the 303 that I received today and am considering returning it to Amazon as not fit for
 purpose.</p>

<p>There is a workaround. Point your PC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mobyware.net/nokia-asha-303-device-2389/email-tag/pico-get-free-139044.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mobyware.net/nokia-asha-303-device-2389/email-tag/pico-get-free-139044.html</a>&nbsp;and download
 the app to your PC. Then connect your Asha 303 in Ovi mode to the PC. Use Windows Explorer to go to the folder in which you saved the PICO file and double-click its filename. Nokia suite will offer to install &nbsp;it on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can use PICO to set up your email accounts. I've managed to do my POP3 accounts but my Gmail one is proving a bit tricky. You have to know all the email account parameters as the automated setup just doesn't work and the program itself is not all
 that intuitive but it does seem to function properly.</p>

<p>Easiest way around this is to use an included email account service (with mine it included&nbsp; BT - British Telecom - pop3 email which came with the SIM free version in the UK, and if you have a provider version your provider would probably include what's necessary
 for their e-mail?).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I hijacked that and used my own details and server addresses, it works a charm, and&nbsp;is even listed with my e-mail address&nbsp;rather than a BT label. Took literally a couple of minutes to set up.&nbsp;Literally just done it, and I notice now I have to find out
 how to make emails not disappear from view in the inbox once I have read them. :)</p>

            Hi Matthew,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, my understanding is that you want to use your new account to activate Office on your home computer.<br />
If so, I suggest you try the following steps to deactivate Office, then activate Office with your new account:<br />
For Mac: <br />
a. Go to &lt;YourUserName&gt; Library &gt; Group Containers <br />
b. ctrl+click or right-click each of these folders if present, and then click Move to Trash.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UBF8T346G9.ms<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UBF8T346G9.Office<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;UBF8T346G9.OfficeOsfWebHost<br />
Warning: Outlook data will be removed when you move the three folders listed in this step to Trash. You should back up these folders before you delete them.<br />
<br />
For Windows:<br />
1. Sign out of the Office applications and close all of them.<br />
2. Windows key + R -&gt; type cmd to open the command prompt window<br />
3. Input the following command: <br />
cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16. <br />
If you can't find the path, type cd C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16 (If you are using Office2013, change Office16 to Office15)<br />
cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus (copy the last five digits of the product key)<br />
cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey:&lt; the last five digits of the product key &gt;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a061aeb-4639-4587-b435-d24cc302b92a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a061aeb-4639-4587-b435-d24cc302b92a?upload=true" /></a><br />
4.Restart computer and reactivate Office.<br />
If this is not your situation, could you please provide the detailed description about the requirement?<br />
Besides, please provide the OS version and Office version.<br />

<p>Hi RobertCallins,</p>
<p>In Outlook Web App (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa</a>), it is not feasible to resend an email from the
<b>Sent Items</b> folder directly.</p>
<p>If we want to resend an email there, we need to right click the email and select<b> Forward</b>, then add the recipient address and change the email content accordingly.</p>
<p>I understand it would be nice if we have this feature in OWA. Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding your experience helps us to make our product and service better for you and others. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>As a workaround, we can resend an email in Outlook client (for Windows) directly. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. In&nbsp;<b>Mail</b>, in the Navigation Pane, click&nbsp;<b>Sent Items</b>.</p>
<p>2. Double-click the message that you want to resend.</p>
<p>3. On the&nbsp;<b>Message</b>&nbsp;tab, in the&nbsp;<b>Move</b>&nbsp;group, click&nbsp;<b>Actions</b>, and then click&nbsp;<b>Resend This Message</b>.</p>
<p>4. Click&nbsp;<b>Send</b>.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<h2>            Retrospectively adding a subsite to the parent&#39;s &#34;subsites&#34; quick launch</h2>
                    
<p>considering adding a subsite to a site in sharepoint:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a178a58b-c29a-40ff-91fd-05ff84640262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da178a58b-c29a-40ff-91fd-05ff84640262" /></a><br />
<em><strong>private information masked by moderator, thanks for understanding.</strong></em></p>
<p>further down this page is the following option to "display this site on the quick launch of the parent site". this is set to "no" by default but in this case, i've remembered to change it to "yes":</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e90dedba-6bbc-4ff3-a0c2-38aa2a2b2970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de90dedba-6bbc-4ff3-a0c2-38aa2a2b2970" /></a></p>
<p>on saving this page and opening the parent site, you see this very nice "subsites" menu has been added to quick launch:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c2716af2-8123-4040-8390-359e3bdd4fad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc2716af2-8123-4040-8390-359e3bdd4fad" /></a></p>
<p>let's now create a second subsite called "project #2" but forget to change that option to "yes". not surprisingly, it doesn't appear in the parent's quick launch subsite.</p>
<p>however, i've looked high and low for the option to retrospectively add in the new subsite into the parent's quick launch menu. the obvious place might be in site settings, quick launch:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=eb741c68-7560-4494-9a60-1dddb4399d3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3deb741c68-7560-4494-9a60-1dddb4399d3f" /></a></p>
<p>but whilst one can manually add the new subsite, it doesn't appear under "subsites" and i can't for the life of me work out how to create nested menu items like that under "subsites".</p>
<p>i've been through all the options of the new subsite in this area but nothing jumps out at me:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3021e319-e0bc-4522-a1f0-4fd139299b76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3021e319-e0bc-4522-a1f0-4fd139299b76" /></a></p>
<p>so how do you retrospectively change that option from "no" to "yes" or manually add another site
<em>under</em> subsites with indentation?</p>
<p>thanks, rob.</p>

<p>hi rob,</p>
<p>we can go to&nbsp;the parent site&nbsp;&gt; <strong>site settings</strong> &gt; <strong>quick launch</strong> &gt;&nbsp;
<strong>new navigation link</strong> &gt; type in<strong> /sub2</strong> in the <strong>
type the web address</strong> box and <strong>sub2</strong> in the <strong>type the description</strong> box, select
<strong>subsites</strong> in the <strong>heading</strong> section &gt; <strong>ok</strong>.<br />
(replace <strong>sub2</strong> with your subsite name.)</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6323e4bf-8182-4842-ada2-7914b4b0f2a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6323e4bf-8182-4842-ada2-7914b4b0f2a8" /></a></p>
<p>meanwhile, to make it convenient for you to go back to the parent site from the subsite, i also suggest you add the parent site link to the
<strong>top link bar</strong> of your subsite, in your subsite, go to <strong>site settings</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>top link bar</strong> &gt;
<strong>new navigation link</strong> &gt; type in the url of the parent site, give it a description name (xxx) &gt;
<strong>ok</strong>.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<h2>            Unable to attach photos and can&#39;t access documents in Outlook.com Windows Update.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Took some Windows critical updates and updated to IE 10 yesterday....resulting in some trouble with Outlook email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Took some Windows critical updates and updated to IE 10 yesterday. Since then,&nbsp; I can no longer attach a document/or photo in&nbsp;email thru my&nbsp; Outlook.com email.
</p>
<p>In Outlook, I click attach and it takes me directlt to&nbsp;my Windows 7 Library/Documents Folder&nbsp;but the 'My Documents Folder' is no longer appearing there.
</p>
<p>Additionally, I cannot access the info in My Documents&nbsp; Folder in any manner thru my Outlook email? This was not a problem prior to the updates yesterday!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since tried to restore my PC to an earlier date prior to the suspect updates (4-11-13) with no success as I keep getting an error message that the restore was not successful as a security program is likely on and to turn it off..(it by the way was
 already turned off) .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP! It's 2013 and one ought to be able to attach a photo or document using Outlook.com without all this nonsense.</p>

<p>No none of what you responded with helped this situation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You see I DO NOT WANT IE 10, the update was taken in error...and as a result of that update outlook.com&nbsp; no longer&nbsp;allows me to navigate to MY Documents and attach files/photos to my emails</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no such issues in IE9. So, I have since restored my windows programs &amp; settings to an earlier date (a date well prior to the&nbsp;IE10 update).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>After the restore to an earlier date completed, my computer indicates it is once more running&nbsp;IE9.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still&nbsp;the&nbsp;problem exists with outlok.com (my email program)&nbsp;whereby it no longer allows me to attach or even access files that are in the MY Documents folder. It's as though I have no access to my own folders!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. ASAP. I really need outlook to properly&nbsp;work with explorer and windows.</p>

<h3> ceesar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste into username &#47; password fields in Windows Account login pages when using Safari on iOS</h2>
                    Recently, I've been unable to copy and paste into the email address and password fields on outlook.com when using Safari on iOS devices (iPhone 4S and iPad 3). Both are running the latest version of iOS v6.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is frustrating, as it prevents me from pasting my password from my password manager app, LastPass, and prevents me from logging into Outlook mail on the iPad / iPhone via Safari.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pasting into other web sites works with no issues on iOS Safari - the issue appears isolated to only outlook.com / Windows Account sites.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone else experiencing this, and any workarounds?</div>

<p>Hi Chesca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As of the moment, the Microsoft Planner app is available for iPhone and Android phones. There is no information yet if this application will be available for desktop. The good thing is, you can forward this as a feature request to our product team as a consideration
 for future Planner release. If you think that the app needs some tweaking to make it more efficient, then we highly advise that you make a comment in our Feedback page. Our developers are collating suggestions for the improvement of your experience in using
 the Planner. The features and the visuals of apps are updated with the help of users' feedback. Click this
<strong><a href="https://planner.uservoice.com/forums/330525-microsoft-planner-feedback-forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to proceed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to message us again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Not sure it would be worth the wait. From where I sit, it appears Asana integrates as well as Planner into Teams and Flow. from what I've seen online, both Planner and Asana take some work to add contacts and don't seamlessly integrate with Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I am wondering if I get serious about a Project-Management-driven management approach, whether Outlook's days are numbered and I manage directly from PM communication tools, calendars and infrastructure...</p>

<p>I find it embarrassing, to say the least, that people need to file a feature request in order to get
<strong>Microsoft </strong>Planner as a desktop app for <strong>Microsoft </strong>
Windows. A very hacky and unsatisfactory workaround is to use Chrome's "Add to desktop" feature in order to pin Planner to the taskbar. Also, every time I visit a new website I'm asked to allow or block notifications. A desktop app and web notifications are
 default features for any common sense platform (especially for a big dinosaur like Microsoft) and you should not have to rely on feature requests in order to decide if they should be implemented.</p>

<p><span>Hi Glen,</span></p>
<p>I understand that the add-in created in the Visual Studio doesn’t work correctly in the Outlook desktop client. As our forum focuses on the Office 365 cloud services and this issue is related to the both Outlook desktop client and development. I suggest
 you post in our dedicated <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?forum=outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>The issue is not how to make a connection between "Outlook-contacts" and "LinkedIn-contacts" (I succeeded in doing that), but the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">mismatch</span></strong> between the number of contacts synced form LinkedIn to Outlook (299) and the number of contacts in LinkedIn itself (311).</p>
<p>Why are "the 12" not synchronized?!</p>

<h2>            office 2016 file cannot be opened in any other office versions</h2>
                    <p>hi, I have a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run ms. office 2016 in my notebook and everything goes right until I found myself cannot open ms. office 2016 files like word (docx), excel (xlsx), etc. in all PC's which run ms. office 2013, 2010 or even ms. office 2011 for mac. When I try to open the
 file, it said ".... cannot be opened because there are problems with the contents. Details : The file is corrupt and cannot be opened". Vice versa, when I change the format file into word 97-2003 (doc. xls.), the file could be opened.</p>
<p>this problem was coming out since 5 days ago and previously everything was fine.</p>
<p>I think the problem was coming from my ms. office or notebook. guys, do you have any suggestion?</p>

                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincde trhe last build (as above) I am unable to open my excel files from a desktop short cut. I now have to open a new version of excel and then open the appropriate file from there. Is anyone else having this problem. The workaround works but it is a bit
 of a pain as well as a worry. I have tried deleting the short cuts anhd replacing them, but this makes no difference.</p>

            Some files are crashing Excel regardless of whether I use a shortcut, double click the file itself from Explorer, or even opening Excel and opening the file from there (which works for some other files as mentioned earlier). Interestingly, if I open the
 Excel file from Visual Studio, it launches Excel and opens the file just fine. I'm on Windows 10, with Office 365 version 1803 build 9031.2004. I see you're on build 9100.2002. Excel is showing that there's an update available, but every time I try to install
 it it fails with an error saying "Something went wrong".

<p>
</p><p>My question is about the pop-up notifications of meetings getting focus and displaying on top of other windows...and staying there until I acknowledge them.&nbsp; I have set SKYPE to be always on top, which works, but it does not appear to affect the popups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's Skype for Business 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the inserted ABOUT pop-up did not display.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to attach it to this message?</p>

<p>Hi Yonaga,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I totally understand that you want to make the mintute warning pop-up appears in front of other progam's windows, such as, if you are using Microsoft Edge, and at this time, the Outlook meeting notification reminder is coming, you want this reminder pop
 up in front of the Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this need, it may couldn't meet you need. And let help to explain the&nbsp;theory of Outlook meeting reminder for you:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When you are using Outlook client, and the meeting reminder will pop up in front of Outlook window, you can see the notification.</li><li>But when you are using other programs, if the Outlook meeting is up, this notification/reminder will not show in front of other programs, you will see it when you focus on Outlook (switch to Outlook).</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, when you are using other programs, and you don't want to miss the meeting reminder, you can check the task bar like below, if the meeting reminder is coming, you can see the task bar of Outlook will show as orange to remind you, at the same
 time, you will also hear the sound of the reminder.</p>
<p>
