    <title>Win 10 Defender Full Scan Causes BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 10 Defender Full Scan Causes BSOD</h2>
                    <p>When using Win 10 Defender full scan I get the BSOD and the system reboots. I have tried the custom option as I have a SSD as well as a&nbsp;HDD.&nbsp; The problem occurs with the SSD only. Quick scan works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;There is no other virus scan malware installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any advice on a fix would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>1. Nov 2014, professionally built, not by myself.</p>
<p>2a. It was a week before the UK MS Win 10 free&nbsp;upgrade offer was due to expire (can't remember the date).</p>
<p>2b. Online update via Windows.</p>
<p>3a. Not aware of an anniversary update??</p>
<p>3b. Ditto</p>
<p>4a. Virus and spyware definition 1.233.2933.0</p>
<p>4b. 21/12/2016</p>
<p>4c. Defender downloads and installs.</p>
<p>5. 24.0.0.186 installed however I had active x filter on and had to remove this to enable system to see the version installed. I have left active x disabled for the time being.</p>
<p>6. Firefox Chrome no other browser installed other than IE and MS Edge.</p>
<p>7. No.</p>
<p>8a. No it happened with Win 7 as well.</p>
<p>8b. The SSD (120GB Samsung 840)&nbsp;is installed internally and has the entire win system installed on it. Also has a&nbsp;reserved inaccessible partition (Q drive).</p>
<p>8c. Yes, if I choose custom (F drive) only,&nbsp;I'm able to 'full scan' the HDD drive.&nbsp; If I select&nbsp;the SSD (C drive)&nbsp;only, or with (F drive) then defender starts up and then somewhere further down the process I get the BSOD, the same as in standard full scan
 mode.</p>

<p>6. Your reply tells me you accessed that adobe.com link using Internet Explorer. ActiveX controls are not supported in Edge - so let me ask you this: Is Edge working properly when you intentionally choose to use it (instead of IE)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not aware of an anniversary update??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you upgraded to Win10 at the end of July 2016, Win10 Version 1511 was installed. A few days later (I assume),&nbsp;Windows Update (I assume)&nbsp;offered &amp; installed the Win10 Anniversary Update - which is how you got Win10 Version 1607 installed. Installing
 cumulative update KB3206632 last week took you to Win10 Version 1607 OS Build 14393.576.
<em>Yes, it can be very confusing!</em></p>

            <p>The Microsoft security applications such as Defender are known to be highly efficient due to all scanning occurring in RAM, which often results in high processor utilization that can cause overheat, system shutdown and occasionally a restart as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's difficult to know if this is the problem without temperature monitoring or knowing exactly what's causing the BSOD, but some quick questions can probably determine whether this might be involved in your issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, does the full&nbsp;scan cause the fan(s) to operate a higher speed and do the BSOD and restart happen only after these have been running at high speed for some time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then open Task Manager and watch the processor utilization while scanning the HDD and then the SSD to see whether the utilization is significantly lower during an HDD scan.&nbsp; Since this can often peg the processor at near 100% during an SSD scan as
 there's virtually no disk read latency, it's much more common for overheat issues to present themselves while scanning this faster drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own Dell&nbsp;laptop has an SSD I added myself, but though the fans operate at high speed from shortly after the scan starts to just after completion, it's never had any shutdown or restart issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's relatively common for non-commercial "white box" systems to have such problems though, since they aren't typically built or tested to the standards that a large manufacturer uses with their systems.&nbsp; However, another common issue here can be that settings
 in the BIOS aren't correct to allow the processor to shut down individual cores or the Virtualization Technology is enabled, which locks out the ability for the SpeedStep Technology to disable or reduce core speeds as required to prevent overheat.</p>

            <p>1. Win 10 is installed on the C (SSD) drive</p>
<p>2. Win 7 was installed on the C (SSD) drive - I'm assuming this has been removed in a following update since I can no longer&nbsp;revert back to it. Windows properties creation date&nbsp;16 July 2016&nbsp;indicates no previous versions are installed on C drive.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; As 2 above</p>
<p>4. I mainly opted&nbsp;to do a quick scan&nbsp;but did try the full scan in Win 7 and it caused BSOD.&nbsp; Same with Win 10 when I first did a full scan it caused BSOD.&nbsp; It is not new behaviour, although on the last occasion I had to reboot the system whereas before,
 the system rebooted automatically.</p>
<p>5. No third party software&nbsp;ever installed on Win 7 or 10.</p>
<p>6. No problems with Edge when active x control is on. I&nbsp;have to disable&nbsp;the&nbsp;active x filter in&nbsp;IE to show certain contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes security updates KB 3176936 through to KB3206632&nbsp; are installed and thanks for the clarification of the Win 10 build but&nbsp;non-the- wiser as to what they actual do!</p>

    <title>Realtek audio on 10041 plays through headphones but speakers don&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 192pcp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek audio on 10041 plays through headphones but speakers don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I know there are a number of existing threads relating to Audio issues, and I couldn't find one that exactly matched my situation so have created a new question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running on an ASUS N55SF notebook with Realtek audio. Plugging headphones or external speakers into the headphone jack works fine, but the internal speakers do not produce any sound although the level indicator when testing sound does behave normally.
 I have tested the hardware by booting to the alternative partition with Windows 8.1 and everything works OK still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver is RTKVHD64.sys</p>
<p>Version 6.0.1.7458 (2/3/2015)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed Windows 10 from a build 9841 DVD, then updated again to 10041. The problem was there through all three build installed yesterday - 9841, 9926, 10041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, and let me know if I can provide more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How to address an account fraud&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hello all, i am reaching out for help on an account fraud issue. I am in the IT department of our hospital and am assisting an executive in our organization who has had her identity being mimicked using a live.com account. The person doing this started by
 setting up a live.com email using the exact name of one of our Vice presidents. They then used that to setup a Facebook account with that email as the contact and used a picture taken from our internal site as the Facebook photo. We are trying to work through
 Facebook processes for reporting fraud but i also wanted to tackle this as the root contact address being used and see what we may be able to do to get it removed.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

To report abuse<br />

<div><strong>This solution article provides information on how to report abuse and SPAM in Outlook.com</strong><br />
<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<i><u><br />
</u></i><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the
 spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming
 account.</em><br />
<br />

<p>Is it considered fraud and abuse when Microsoft bills you every month but claims&nbsp;to have no record of you? Here's my complaint of fraud and abuse. Please spread the word.
</p>
<p>This took place today:</p>
<p>I have been dealing with Microsoft's horrible service now for a very long time, years. BUT today, it's been over two hours. I have been transferred from Billing and Accounts, put on hold and told I would be helped when the line was disconnected, given&nbsp;many
 800 numbers to call for help and absolutely NO ONE has been able to assist. Normally, I would avoid dealing with MS via phone because that's pretty much a dead end. But the online options leave me no choice. There simply seems to be no way to find my account
 online. YET, Microsoft has no problem billing me every month. Does anyone actually work there? Are the multitude of 800 number designed to be circular in the attempt to get the consumer to give up? Is it fair if Microsoft compensates me for my time fixing
 their broken system that I'm paying for? Is it fair to say that Microsoft wouldn't exist without the consumer?
<br />
Right now, I'm on hold, listening to an automated voice that I've heard many times today. Yet, Microsoft (MS) is still billing me. How do I cancel? What do I do? These are questions that even MS can't answer. That said, just got off the phone with Bill dept
 (for 4th time). They had no previous notes that I called, no previous info that I'd given them, only 20 minutes before and 20 minutes (approx.) before that. I told them I was on this site, filling out a complaint and magically they were able to pull me up
 in their account. Should MS compensate me for my time? I'm paying them for a service. Put it this way, THEY are billing me for a service that I have NO WAY of canceling because they can't find me in their system. Yet when I tell them I'm filling out a complaint,
 MAGIC, they find me and now have all the info. Is that fair? Is that justice? Shouldn't MS be responsible for my wasted time? Mind you, my issue still isn't resolved. They put me on hold again. And now, the automated message just disconnected me, again. Is
 this justice? Is this allowed? Who will be held accountable for this? What will you do to be sure that this isn't happening to everyone?

<h2>            Removing .ical files from Outlook 2010 calendar</h2>
                    I imported one file, but then I found another version I liked&nbsp;better.&nbsp; I don't want to just remove items, want to delete the entire file.&nbsp; In past versions, I could list the overlay files and just delete the one I want.&nbsp; I don't see that option in 2010.

            <p>Did you import the ics or open it as a calendar? If you opened it as a calendar, it should be listed in File, Account Settings, Internet Calendars - delete it from there.
</p>
<p>If you imported it, you need to use a list view and&nbsp;sort&nbsp;by Modified date - everything in that ics should have the same modified time.
</p>
<p>I have a tutorial with the method here - <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook/calendar/remove-duplicate-holidays-from-the-outlook-calendar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            No, sorry, you can't undo an import. If it was opened as a separate calendar, you could delete the calendar.

<h2>            spam filter allow list doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question about the spam filter setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added "pxxxal.de" in the list of allowed domains. But I still get emails from PayPal in my Spam folder. The sender address is: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. The same happens for example for emails from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. They end up in the
 junk folder even though I have the domain baxxxxxxxxxca.com in the allow list. These are only two examples. It happens to me with many domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set this up in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Exchange admin center -&gt; protection -&gt; spam filter -&gt; default&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added the domains to the allow list in the default rule</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why do those emails still go in the Junk folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Enrico</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks for your private message.</p>

<p>From the message header, we can see the

Bulk Complaint Level (BCL)</a> value is <span style="font-weight: bold">7 </span>which depents on the set threshold in Spam Filter. Both of them have a large value which is the reason why Exchange Online Protection (EOP) marks this email as spam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    My skype mic has been disabled or something. I checked the privacy and that's not the problem. It works fine when I wear headphones with a mic attached but not without the headphones and I've done the test calls and it doesn't work either. Idk what's wrong
 with it.

<p><span>If it works with the headphones, does the issue happen with your built-in microphone?&nbsp;Can you try recording&nbsp;sound/audio on your device&nbsp;to check if the issue is with the

check this FAQ</a> on how to use&nbsp;the Sound recorder app for Windows. &nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If after recording and no audio output is received, then the issue might be with the device's microphone itself. You can try to bring your device to your manufacturer so they can check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you can play the recorded sound then the issue&nbsp;could be with the application. If so, please do post back so we can check further.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Section Break &#40;Odd Page&#41; not working&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello all, I have a final report in a 45 page document and am trying to set up the pages so a new section will start on the right side of a double-sided document. My understanding is that by inserting a section break (odd page), this will happen but the
 page number at the bottom does not reflect this. There are some occasions where it's doing what I want but many where it just continues the page count as if there's a "next page" section break. It doesn't look different in print preview either. Someone please
 help me with this because I'm getting really frustrated and can't find an answer online.

            In Page Setup, enable "Different odd and even" or "Mirror margins" (or both of these options) and you will be able to see so-called filler pages in print preview.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 not synchronizing with Office 365 - moved emails lost</h2>
                    <p>We have recently changed over to Office 365, and we are using Microsoft Outlook 2016 on our desktops. We set up three email addresses with Office 365 and all our machines are running the same Office suite. Set up the Outlook 2016 the same way on all of the
 machines. After backing up with .pst files, we installed Office 2016 and set up outlook via IMAP accounts on Office 365. Then we imported the emails from the .pst files and let everything sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked well for a couple of days. One of the email accounts has started losing emails that are filed into the respective folders. When we go online to find the emails in the same folders in which they were filed, only one is where it is supposed
 to be, but the rest are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online for similar issues, but no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help. We get a lot of emails daily, and we need to be able to organise them.</p>

<h2>            Investigation&#58;  Build 14901 Not Showing as Available</h2>
                    <p>***Edig 2016.08.12 - 2:10pm PST***</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the targeting is still rolling out.&nbsp; This is longer than the originally provided time estimate, and I apologize for that.<br />
<br />
If your machine still has not received the update, hold tight.&nbsp; It's still underway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Edit 2016.08.12 - 10:45am PST***<br />
<br />
Good news!&nbsp; Looks like we've uncovered the cause.&nbsp; We're making a few additional targeting changes on our side and this should fix any users who are "stuck".&nbsp; These changes may take up to 60 minutes to flow out to your various machines, so please bear with
 us while we finish this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone who reached out to assist.&nbsp; It is VERY much appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Hello Windows Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday we launched the first release from our newest series of Development branch builds, build 14901.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we knew there would be an initial delay for users due to targeting updates from the build change, there are many users who are still not receiving this new build.&nbsp; We are actively investigating this and need your assistance with information to investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a quick review, please check the following on your machine:<br />
- Is your ring set to Insider Fast?</p>
<p>- Is your MSA connected/registered?</p>
<p>- Does your machine say "You're all set to get Insider Preview builds"?</p>
<p>- Are you running an approved language?&nbsp; (Some of our initial investigations have shown users did a media/ISO install from a language not supported by the Insider Program).&nbsp; You can check the list of supported languages here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://insider.windows.com/Home/GetStarted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Supported Insider Languages</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of the above are good, please make a note in this thread.&nbsp; We'll want to reach out to you and get your machine ID so we can research on our end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users have also noted that changing from Fast ring to Slow ring, rebooting, and then switching back to Fast ring has allowed them to receive the build.&nbsp; You may also try this step.&nbsp; May take ~30 minutes to receive a build notification after a ring change.</p>
<p><br />
You may also pull the following machine ID which is what we will need for investigation.&nbsp; Please DO NOT post it publicly in this thread, I'll reach out privately to ask you for it.
<br />
<br />
- Right-click the Start button</p>
<p>- Select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>- Click Yes</p>
<p>- Paste this command:&nbsp; reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SQMClient /V MachineId</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post in this thread or reach out to me via Twitter (@NorthFaceHiker) so I may contact you privately for the ID of your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Jason</p>

<p>My Surface Pro has received the build, but my Pro 3 has not. It is set to the Fast ring, and has been for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I should note that the MateBook hasn't received it, but in fairness, it didn't receive any Rs1 builds after 14383, and Rubino had the same problem.</p>

            Yes to all questions.&nbsp; Still not receiving this build, even after changing to release candidate, rebooting, changing back to fast.&nbsp; Also tried disabling insider previews, reboot, then rejoining.&nbsp; One thing I'm noticing is that update is installing Bing
 Bar 7.0 (KB2626804) over and over again...&nbsp; Looks like about 25 times today in my update history.

            <p>Jason, all of your check these were a go for me.</p>
<p>This AM I tried the switch rings trick. I did not have to wait.</p>
<p>When I first clicked Check for Updates after the switch I got</p>
<p>a 0x80246019 error with Retry button.</p>
<p>I clicked Retry, it went to 100% install then reverted back</p>
<p>to Download and all progressed fine from there.</p>
<p>If you want my machine ID please message me.</p>

            I finally got 14901 after following the advice someone gave on Dona's twitter to switch to slow, reboot, check for updates, switch back to fast, reboot, check for updates and after 10 minutes received the download. Usually here in So. Cal. I used to get
 the builds immediately after release, but I understand that the change in the roll out due to users still not getting the Anniversary Update.

            - Is your ring set to Insider Fast?
<p>- Is your MSA connected/registered?</p>
<p>- Does your machine say "You're all set to get Insider Preview builds"?</p>
<p>- Are you running an approved language?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes to all. HP Spectre 360 and SP3, both remain in Fast Ring and neither sees(saw) the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Spectre 360, I executed the&nbsp;'Stop receiving insider builds', rebooted, then put back in Fast ring and rebooted again - it then saw the new RS2 build, downloaded and applied it successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have *not* performed the same operation on the SP3 - it still does not see the new build.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Health App &#40;on Android&#41; log me out every morning. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It's more or less a week that Microsoft Health App on my Samsung S3 Android phone automatically log me out every morning. It has never happened before, I logged in when I bought the band and I cannot remember a similar problem. I did not change anything
 on the phone, I have always updated the App when required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does somebody have the same problem?</p>
<p>Does anybody know a possible fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

    <title>Windows Store Build 10122 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray a h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store Build 10122</h2>
                    I upgraded from build 10074 to 10122. I noticed on my task bar that Windows Store Beta icon was on the task bar and worked. With the upgrade the icon does not show and leaves a blank spot. However when I click the sport the windows store works. Tried different
 color schemes same thing.

    <title>Problems with Outlook after resetting my AOL Password. Can no longer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Outlook after resetting my AOL Password.  Can no longer access Primary AOL email address but can access sub Aol Email addresses where passwords have not been changed.</h2>
                    
<p>I have accessed my AOL primary account and sub accounts through Outlook for several years.<span>&nbsp;</span>I changed my password on the main account with AOL and am no longer able to access this through Outlook.<span>&nbsp;</span>I continue to be able to access
 all my sub AOl accounts and RSS feeds through Outlook. (Passwords have not been changed).</p>
<p>After several failed attempts to input the new password in Outlook I deleted the account and endeavored to add a new account using my primary email address and password.<span>&nbsp;</span>I meticulously checked that all information inputted was correct several
 times and with AOL tech assistance (which was a joke, to say the least).<span>&nbsp;</span>I am still unable to set up the account and cannot access my emails through Outlook.<span>&nbsp;</span>I use windows 7 and Outlook 2010.<span>&nbsp;</span>I did on one occasion get
 the message “an encrypted connection to my mail server is not available”<span>&nbsp;</span>I also checked if an unencrypted connection would work but to no avail.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> For the most my error message is that “there is a problem with my mail
 server”</p>
<p>Both AOL and Comcast advise me that the problem is a Microsoft issue.<span>&nbsp;</span>Endeavoring to access my Windows live account last evening I was unable to do so with my registered email address which is my AOL primary email address.<span>&nbsp;</span>I had
 to complete a new registration with a different email to get access to the forum.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I thank you in advance if you can shed any light on the problem I am encountering.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>So you need to look at what the charger is designed for. 12 Volt just means it run from a 12 volt car battery. If you look at the charger it should say what its "output" is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as an aside, a 12 volt charger designed for a laptop would not work on a phone. That is why the connectors are different (to avoid blowing the circuits).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who makes the charger you have? Is the connector the one that fits on your phone? Can you post a pic?</p>

<h3> rborgmas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2016 will fail to upload to Sharepoint online when new file format is used</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Sharepoint online to store all kinds of Office documents. Word and Excel works just fine, but with Visio, there are problems uploading files to Sharepoint online if the file format used is the new one (.vsdx). Using the old format (.vsd for
 Visio 2003-2010) works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a new document and save it to Sharepoint online, I am able to check it in successfully when using the old format .vsd and I can thereafter check out the document again to update it. No issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the new .vsdx format, I can save the document to the Sharepoint online site but when I try to check it in, I get UPLOAD FAILED and the reason presented is that the file is locked (by myself even...). Somehow the file actually does get updated on
 the server though, because I can successfully resolve my situation by discarding the open version of the document and refresh it from the server. If I do that, I can see that my changes are present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually made a video of the entire flow to show you how strange this is. This must be related with a bug of Sharepoint integration in Visio.</p>

<p>In case someone lands on this page and have the same issue, I can now share that my issue was resolved by completely removing Office and Visio from the computer and have them reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The root cause was that I had remaining files from Visio 2010 installation on the computer which caused some kind of conflict with Visio 2016. Some failed upgrade in the past seems to have caused this.</p>

<p>Hello Mil gracias,</p>

<p>It’s not feasible to export contacts as CSV file in Outlook for Mac. It’s recommend that you vote for this feature via this link:

https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/8819446-ability-to-import-and-export-contacts</a></p>
<p>Also, you can refer to E for Excel’s suggestions and try the workaround. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since this is an English forum, we recommend that you post in English.

<p>Thank you very much for your sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Can you try signing out of excel under File-&gt;Account. Then restart your computer and open excel and sign back in. Does that fix it?

<p>No, you cannot use Nokia Suite with a Nokia X.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia X series phones are not compatible with Nokia Suite.</p>
