    <title>When i export emails from a folder in Outlook 2010 into Excel 2010 the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avanthelpdesk  say:</h3>
<h2>            When i export emails from a folder in Outlook 2010 into Excel 2010 the body of the email is blank.</h2>
                    <p>I have a user who wants to move all emails in a specific folder in Outlook 2010 to a spreadsheet for easy sorting and filtering.&nbsp; I am using the import feature and exporting to a file (the only excel option is "excel 97-2003" but i have tried tab delimited
 file (windows) also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It pulls over data but the "body" portion of the emails is blank on the new spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wracking my brain as to why this would happen, but am stumped.&nbsp; All of the other information from teh emails seems to be coming over just fine, except the body of the emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am i missing???</p>

            <p>Was the body field exported but blank or was it not&nbsp; included in the export? </p>
<p>Why isn't the user using search folders or instant search to sort and filter their mail? CSV / Excel are great for compiling email stats but do very poorly with message bodies.

            <p>Thanks for replying Diane.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The body field was exported because one out of 50 emails actually has the body content in the spreadsheet, but the other 98% of the fields that I would expect the body to be exported into are blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for not taking advantage of search folders is that the executive that requested this functionality has thousands of emails from this specific client and wants to be able to put them into a spreadsheet to take advantage of filtering and sorting
 to show/hide specific data based on formula criteria or a drop down menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has information on why Outlook doesn't like it's cousin Excel and can tell me why this issue is happeneing it would make me feel better to tell the executive that it is just a flaw in a piece of poorly designed software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Micsosoft Access 2013 propery sheet display updates very slow</h2>
                    <p>The property sheet in the design view of any object (tables, forms, etc.) are updated / painted very slow. I have this issues on multiple computers with different hardware, running 32 and 64 bit office versions. Although all are running Windows 8.1 but not
 sure if that is related. Tried the suggestions as mentioned in a similar posting "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-access/microsoft-access-2010-very-slow-when-property/2168272d-d444-48c9-9b1b-5dc653e01b68">Microsoft access
 2010 very slow when property sheet diplayed. Really annoying</a>.", such as reinstalling, disable graphics hardware acceleration, shutting down all non-essential services, etc.&nbsp;but nothing seems to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms are the same as mentioned by others, when just booted all works fine for a while, but there is a moment after which the property sheet display updates become really sluggish again. It looks like the property sheet is first slowly&nbsp;cleared, then a
 small pause&nbsp;and finally the property sheet is slowly repainted pixel by pixel. It will take more than a second for just one property sheet display refresh on a fast machine (WinSPRLevel: 8.2) which is, as stated by the author of the other posting, really annoying...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to reproduce the steps that will trigger the sluggish display updates, after a clean boot it works fine for a while, even when I open other office applications, but as stated above, after a certain moment in time it becomes sluggish
 again. So whenever I have to develop something in MSAccess I currently first reboot my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anybody has additional tips or tricks to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>Using Windows 8.1, the property sheets in MS Access 2010 often get into a mode where they loop around constantly trying to redraw without end. Once I fixed this by repairing Access, but it came back the next time I went into design mode on the same form.
 I tried repairing it again, but the second repair attempt had no effect. Neither did forcing a recompile. Rebooting didn't either. Still haven't solved the problem. However, when I copied the database to my Windows 7 PC, it didn't have the problem - at least
 not so far. Several other things don't work in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; For example, I can't get on-line deposits to work with my Windows 8.1 PC.&nbsp; The help desk at USAA banking said that was a common problem and recommended that I use a different machine. or different
 browser than Firefox&nbsp; He said even a smart phone works better than Windows 8.1 for this purpose.&nbsp; Funny, I thought Windows 8 was designed to be multi-platform and especially to work on Windows phones! I've been looking pretty seriously at alternatives to Microsoft
 Access lately. Apple,&nbsp; Alpha Anywhere and Unix all offer interesting possibilities. Google doesn't have their act together for user designed databases yet. So far, nothing seems as good as MS Access used to be. If anyone has suggestions, I would like to hear
 them.</p>

            <p>Bare - what Daniel is asking is whether you have a split database backend (storing the tables) on a local drive or somewhere on the network. &nbsp;I think the point of Daniel's question is whether the property sheet display lag is affected by network speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To respond to Daniel, network speed is not the issue. &nbsp;I have an HP Pavilion dv6, with Windows 8.1, Office 2010, with completely updated Windows and Office. &nbsp;I develop my solutions locally first, and I am experiencing the same thing whether the tables are
 within the database or split out and the BE is on a local folder. &nbsp; I started noticing this late last year. &nbsp;If I had to guess, it would be October/November 2014. &nbsp;It is an annoying problem, and one that hinders the development process. &nbsp;I've been developing
 Access solutions for 15 years, and I don't think I've had something this bothersome in the Access development environment until now. &nbsp;The properties window takes about 5-10 seconds to refresh. &nbsp;Visually, the object and properties window repaint from left to
 right. &nbsp;I think this is what the others are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Between developing my solutions, I've tried to pinpoint this issue, without success so far. &nbsp;Restarting the computer, then opening Access first, works
<p>
</p><p>Is there a forum to post these types of issues to Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for the explanation. I can confirm that this is a very simple database and is all running on one PC. Nothing is split, or being fetched from the network.</p>

            <p>Since posting I have found a workaround. Not a solution, but it's something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start Access, right-click on the icon and select properties.</p>
<p>(If Properties is not visible, try shift-right-click)</p>
<p>- Select the compatibility tab</p>
<p>- Select 'Reduce color mode' and go for the 8-bit version</p>
<p>- Then exit and run Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will look like **** but will work at normal speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To automated this you can then play the game that I did, searching the interwebs to find the registry settings required so that you can create two batch files to turn it on and off easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this helps and if you want the reg settings.</p>

            <p>Depends on what you mean by n, m and g.&nbsp;&nbsp; If for a given row, it appears you need one formula dependent on the value in column m
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so in the column for g put in the formula for row 2 as&nbsp;&nbsp; =7575.76*m2*220</p>
<p>
</p><p>where we assume the value represented by m in your formula is in cell M2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are&nbsp; using a table, the formula will be filled down to all rows of the table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you needed an intermediate value for n, then you would just put a formula to calculate that in a column in the table.

<h2>            What about Spartan browser&#63;</h2>
                    Hello everybody! I heard a lot of rumors, and even some official presentations about Spartan browser, and i went really disappointed seeing IE after installing Windows 10 Tech preview. I searched for it in the store, on the web, but there was no big DOWNLOAD
 button, like for Windows 10 was. Am I blind, or does anyone have an idea about the release date? Also, is there a beta/alpha version of it? I would be very happy to try it.

<h2>            Can&#39;t print files, keep saving .prn files that nothing can open</h2>
                    This started in the last 2 weeks - when I try to print a file (.pdf or .doc, it doesn't matter), the dialog box asks to save a .prn file. So I tried saving it but I don't have any program that can open it. How can I stop this &amp; go back to printing files
 like normal?

<p>If you un-click Let Windows manage my default printer then the last one used is set as the default.&nbsp; You can print with another and it will not become the default.</p>

<p>Acrobat Reader</p>

<p>
</p><p>I resolved it by removing the printer, restarting, and then adding it back in Printers &amp; Scanners. It would appear that it's not an app function since I printed using Chrome, which had been trying to create .prn files.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installed on my Daily Driver</h2>
                    <p>Yes you heard me right, I installed this Test windows 10 on my Daily Driver, Why you may ask, because if you want to test something out fully. then install it on the machine you use the most.. Thats how I look at it. Yes I got back ups of my old system before
 the install. And yes, I installed on a fresh 0-out formated 1 TB harddrive. From what I see. it works great. but I dislike the start menu. The listing of metro apps must go. I only wanna see what I have installed and the normal windows programs. I dont want
 to see metro apps. they seem to hog up my Screen with useless apps I will never use.. I did uninstall most. but it still shows them in start menu. &nbsp;Also. Video and sound quality are great. I have a HP ENVY dv7. I am not a game player but I did try a few simulators,
 and the gfx look good.</p>
<p>the game worked with no glitches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use NERO 2015 to do all my burning, Worked great no problem there. Had issues with Touch pad mouse ext menu settings.. Kept crashing with Common Dll crash.. then closing.. I couldnt set the scroll mode because of it.. Somehow I was able to fix that problem.
 After I went out and bought a wireless mouse.. (Go Figure). &nbsp;Some but not many on web browsing Google Chrome. I dont use IE. you couldnt pay me enough to use IE........ &nbsp;Webpages will Freeze up here and there.. but that could just be chrome and nothing to
 do with Win.. but I was thinking NETwork connection. I have a 90mb connection. I shouldnt have any problems.. but I seem to get network freezes here and there. &nbsp;Specialy my Linux system downloads at 11mb/s and uploads at 5mb/s compare to windows that doesnt
 seem to want to go past 1mb/s and I will say I have 5 systems. 2 are running Gnome-Ubuntu 14.10 Linux and 1 runs windows 7 while the other runs windows 8.1 and this one windows 10.. I know how my network runs.. and windows doesnt seem to support high speeds
 so well..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All and all, This windows 10 seems pretty stable. but I know it has a long way to go before its really ready. I dont like the fact that it looks and acts too much like windows 8+ . For Microsoft to say they want to start fresh with a whole new design, (
 I cant tell. It looks so much like windows8+ that I forget I am running windows 10) I used several diffrent start menus for windows 8.1.. I liked them better then the start menu that comes with windows 10..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, This is just my take on the windows 10. that I have put to a real test.. Yes I had to hard reset many times. &nbsp;but im sure that will come to an end when M$ releases updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scale 1 - 10: I give it a 6&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hey Eliminator74!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't wish to see Live Tiles on your Start Menu, simply&nbsp;<strong>right click on them individually, and select "Unpin from Start. Then resize the Start menu to whatever size feels right.</strong>&nbsp;Live Tiles can be very useful, giving you info on news,
 weather, sports and more. But if you don't want to see them, then just follow the above instructions, and they'll be out of your way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad you're using Windows 10 on your daily driver - it really helps with the development process, giving the OS a real-world test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my solution helps, and thanks for joining the Insider Program!</p>

<h2>            The MS page on the double-click event seems to be incorrect - it makes no sense</h2>
                    <p><span>I‚Äôm slowly learning Excel VBA.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One of my draft macros tested the value of a cell when it was selected.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I worked, but it was irritating because the macro triggered whenever the cell selection changed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I searched on the double click event and found the page at:</span></p>
<p><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/213612/how-to-run-a-macro-when-certain-cells-change-in-excel</span></p>
<p><span>Editing the sample code got the macro to do what I wanted, but I really don‚Äôt understand the as-written description or sample code.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I entered a comment on the page, but I don‚Äôt know if those comments are treated as questions or only feedback.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So:<span>&nbsp; </span>. . . </span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Andreas Killer, JP Ronse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both for your replies, but I'm still confused (I'm a rank beginner with VBA).&nbsp; The cited page states that the Intercept code will only trigger if a value is entered into the target cell.&nbsp; I have a semantic problem here:&nbsp;
 I'd interpreted "change the cell" as meaning the same as the page asserted:&nbsp; A new value was entered into the cell.&nbsp; But the code seems to trigger only when I double click on a different cell -- that is, change to a new target cell.&nbsp; That's the part that seems
 incorrect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It is indeed not the best formulation that is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing any cell will trigger the Worksheet_Change event. It is the code within the event that determines if something should be done or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the cursor before Set Keycells and hit F9, that line has no a red background (breakpoint in the code).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change a cell outside the KeyCells range and you will see that the code stops as the breakpoint. Hit F5 to continue.</p>
<p>Do the same within the KeyCells range. The msgbox will now pop-up because the condition is true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, the Worksheet_Change event is bound to the sheet were the code is placed. Changing a cell in another sheet will not trigger this event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A general change event that works on all sheets is Workbook_SheetChange in ThisWorkbook.</p>
<p>

            This error message usually means that unfortunately your motherboard has developed a fault and needs replacement. Please try the suggestion from HDcoffeeko, however if it does not work you need to take your handset to your nearest authorised service facility
 to have it repaired and I hope it is still under warranty, otherwise the cost of repair would be higher than buying a new phone.<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Candy</strong>,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you have noticed any error messages when trying to access the said option in Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'd suggest launching Outlook in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>. This will help in disabling add-ins that may contribute
 to the issue. If the issue still persists even in safe mode, you may try repairing your Office application by following the instructions on this

I have tried 2 different PCs and tried on IE, Chrome, and Edge; also my iPhone's Safari browser. Happens consistently across all devices and browsers. My phone's email app is not impacted, however. Given this, I have to wonder if it's a Microsoft issue, as
 it's clearly not a browser or device. Please advise.

    <title>Microsoft Access Lending Library template. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marksb_7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access Lending Library template.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've used the Access Lending Library template to set up a simple database for construction tools and equipment loaned from our store.&nbsp; No problems with compiling the Contacts (staff), Assets lists or checking items in and out, however I'm having problems
 with listing items checked out to individuals.</p>
<p>When I bring up the 'Contact Details' form and go to the 'Current Lending' tab, the list shows ALL the assets checked out to ALL the staff, not just to this specific contact (individual).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Design view under the 'Data' tab, the box fields show the Control Source as 'Asset', the Row Source as 'SELECT [Assets].ID, [Assets].Item FROM Assets;' and the Row Source Type as 'Table/Query'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't modified the tables in any way (yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the Current Lending record under the individual's Contact Details to only list what this specific person has checked out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a new user and very much an amateur, so please keep it simple&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Mark&nbsp;</p>

            Not even sure how to keep that simple.&nbsp; But I'm thinking the easiest way is to create a brand new form with a brand new recordsouce (query) that includes the contacts ID (Primary Key) which you can then pull up from the Contacts List or the Assets list.&nbsp;
 Is that simple enough?

<p>No, sorry Gina.&nbsp; Not a pop-up error message as such but an error within the template.</p>
<p>The template's available when starting any new Access database (File/New/Available templates), but maybe limited to the 2010 version(?).</p>

            Hmm, well going to have to go look at that but can't do right now (sorry, really do have a *day* job).&nbsp; Though I am thinking it's the way it was designed and not intended for search by contact.

I bought a new laptop.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows Live Mail on my old laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Office 365 for my new laptop, which includes the full version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set up message rules, so that the first time I download my email, it goes into the right folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look up how to set up message rules, and the sight says go to the file tab, and click on the message rules and alerts tab.&nbsp; There is no such tab there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on file, I get info, open &amp; export, print, office account, options, and exit.&nbsp; Nothing about rules and alerts.&nbsp; I looked through some of the options I have, and can't find anything about rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to use a web app?</p>
<p>

            Hi. Yes, this can be done, but we'll need to know the relationship between the rows. Is there a primary key we can use to determine which record should be compared against another? You can learn some of the techniques for comparing records in a table by
 searching for "running sum" or "running total."

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            To compute the difference in days between a date in a row and in the same column in the previous row in date order you'd use a query which joins two instances of the table.&nbsp; The following is an example using a Transactions table:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.TransactionID, T1.TransactionDate,<br />
T1.TransactionDate - MAX(T2.TransactionDate) AS DateDifference<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1 LEFT JOIN Transactions AS T2 <br />
ON (T2.TransactionID&lt;T1.TransactionID OR T2.TransactionDate&lt;&gt;T1.TransactionDate)<br />
&nbsp;AND (T2.TransactionDate&lt;=T1.TransactionDate)<br />
GROUP BY T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionID;<br />
<br />
Note how the primary key Transaction is brought into play as the tie breaker in the event of two or more transactions taking place on the same day.&nbsp; Where this is the case the date difference for the second and subsequent rows of the same date would be zero.<br />
<br />
BTW do not use <em>Date </em>as column name.&nbsp; As the name of a built in function it is a reserved keyword and should not be used as an object name.<br />

<p>Hi Ken, many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must confess I am a beginner in access programmer. It took me a few hrs to try your method. I copied your formulate in a query to hopefully understand how to do it.</p>
<p>I noticed that the query shows to tables, T1 and T2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done was to create a TABLE, with your information.</p>
<p>My table consist of 1. TransactionID, AUTO number and Transaction<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b7a0d0d-f037-4477-bbf3-0ef05025086b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b7a0d0d-f037-4477-bbf3-0ef05025086b?upload=true" /></a>Date.</p>
<p>Question-1</p>
<p>Should I design also two tables with same information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a query with both tables</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results are shown in table.&nbsp; The date diff are based from earliest date and not from the next date. I do not know how to program your formula</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There is only one Transactions table.&nbsp; What the query does is join two <em>instances
</em>of that single table, giving them aliases of T1 and T2 respectively.&nbsp; There is no way you can represent my query in design view however, because the join expression is too complex to be represented in design view. Let's look at it in more detail:<br />
<br />
(T2.TransactionID&lt;T1.TransactionID OR T2.TransactionDate&lt;&gt;T1.TransactionDate)<br />
&nbsp;AND (T2.TransactionDate&lt;=T1.TransactionDate)<br />
<br />
A join expression at the end of the day is no more than a Boolean expression which returns TRUE or FALSE, returning a row where the expression returns TRUE for that row. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first line of the above requires that the TransactionID value in the second instance of the table is less than the TransactionID value in the first instance OR that the TransactionDate values in both instances are not the same, i.e. where there are two
 or more rows with the same date they are only joined where the TransactionID value is lower in the first instance.&nbsp; This is how the TransactionID value is used as the tie breaker when two or more transactions occur on the same day.<br />
<br />
The second line requires that the TransactionDate value in the second instance is before or the same as that in the&nbsp; first instance.<br />
<br />
The two rows are tacked together with the Boolean AND operator.&nbsp; This requires that both lines must evaluate to TRUE for the rows to be joined.<br />
<br />
The number of days between transactions is simply the TransactionDate in the second instance subtracted for the latest (MAX) date in the first instance which satisfies the above join criteria.<br />
<br />
With my table the following is a subset of the rows returned by the query:<br />
<br />
TransactionID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;TransactionDate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DateDifference<br />
26&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 01/01/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05/01/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 06/01/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
27&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 01/02/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05/02/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4<br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 05/03/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 28<br />
6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05/04/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31<br />
19&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 05/04/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0<br />
8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 10/04/2009&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
<br />
The dates are in UK short date format of dd/mm/yyyy.&nbsp; Note how for the second transaction on 5 April 2009 the difference is zero, because the dates in the two rows are the same.&nbsp; The primary key has broken the tie, and arbitrarily put TransactionID 6 first
 because it is smaller that TransactionID 19.<br />
<br />
Provided that your Transactions table has an autonumber TransactionID as the primary key, and a TransactionDate column of DateTime data type, you should be able to paste my query's SQL statement into the query designer in SQL view, and open it without any further
 amendment.&nbsp; If you do want to show other columns in the result table, e.g. a TransactionAmount column, you can simply add these to the SELECT clause, qualifying each with T1.<br />

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to convert a powerpoint slide to a PDF document but when I do so, my heading boxes disappear.</p>
<p>PDF option is not coming up for 'save as' method so have been using 'export' option.</p>
<p>No issues with headings when exporting to JPG except quality is not preserved and text becomes blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips on how to save as either PDF (with headings preserved) or JPG (with resolution preserved)?</p>

<p>Hi Rox88,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the image quality issue, we got several reports from other users before. The issue should be fixed with 16.15 version of PowerPoint 2016 for Mac. If your Office suite is not the latest, please first update it. And then re-export the presentation to check
 the outcome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the heading boxes disappearing issue, could you capture screenshots for it in the original presentation and the result in exported pdf file? Meanwhile, is the issue related to all presentations? If you create a test presentation, insert heading box and
 then convert it to PDF file, will it run into the same issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            I guess you have ever agreed to access your Hotmail account via Nokia Messaging Services. Is it correct?<br />
<br />
I too had the same problem for a while though after that I am able to login to access my email via Nokia Messaging.<br />
<br />
If you can confirm your Hotmail credential is correct by successfully logging on at outlook.com from a PC, also try running Nokia Email Wizard and don't accept the terms and conditions to use Nokia Messaging and choose the option to "create a separate mailbox
 that uses manual delivery". Let us know if your Hotmail account works this way.

                    <p>I had to reinstall Windows 7 on my laptop which meant I lost my Office 2010 software. &nbsp;I have the product key and I wonder if there is anywhere I am able to download and reinstall the software I have already bought. &nbsp;I have tried going to the setup page
 on the microsoft website (https://officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com/) &nbsp;and entering my product key, but it tells me
<em>"The Product Key entered was not recognized as a valid Product Key. Please check the characters entered and try again. If the card with your 25 character Office 2013 product key references a PC manufacturer, please use www.office.com/getoffice to download

<p>

            Hi Bill,
<br />
<br />I would place the prompt in the report's record source query where you will actually get prompted. Better yet, you should have a form that allows the user to select a year rather than use a parameter prompt.

<p>I tried that and that won't work. The one report I am trying to correct is all summary numbers just totals on the report. The report is made up of all DCount functions&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The report does not use a query (as I couldn't figure out how to make a query that would give me just totals out of 5 or 7 other queries).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The summary report has the following DCount Functions in it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Total Members</p>
<p>Total Active Members</p>
<p>Total Members Paid</p>
<p>Total Members not paid</p>
<p>Total Expired Members</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to have the total members paid prompt for the current year.</p>

            Have you considered opening the report from a form with a text box that allows selecting/entering the year? You can then reference the value on the form in your DCount(). Otherwise I think you might be able to add a text box to the report that prompts for the year. In any case, please pull the parameter out of the DCount().

<p>I went to my dues paid query and changed the criteria for "Dues Year" from Year(date()) to [Enter Dues Year].</p>
<p>when I run the query I get a prompt to enter the dues year and when I enter the year I get the correct results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my report I have the text box to due a count which doesn't work. What would I enter in the control source for the text box to prompt me for the dues year and then give the total number only of the dues paid for that year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>right now the control source is:&nbsp;=DCount("[MemberID]","Dues Paid") which you told me I should not use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can get the expression to enter in the control source for dues paid than I can change the rest to match it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that I have no Idea how to get just the number in the text box. I am not a developer and my experience is very limited which is why I used the DCount functions in that one report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help will be greatly appreciated. My database is completed and ready to distribute once I get this last thing fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            If you report doesn't have a record source, give it one like: 
<br />
<br />SELECT TOP 1 msysobjects.Id
<br />FROM msysobjects
<br />ORDER BY msysobjects.Id;
<br />
<br />This will return just one record. You can then try use: 
<br /> =DCount("MemberID","[Dues Paid]","[Year Paid]=" &amp; [Enter Dues Year])
<br />
<br />This assumes your table or query is named [Dues Paid] and [Year Paid] is numeric.

<p>Under control source in the report properties it says: Membership Report</p>

<p>No. I either get a syntax error or a message:&nbsp;<strong>#Type!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After thinking about this overnight I tried both the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I entered the following in the report control source: </p>
<p>SELECT TOP 1 msysobjects.ld FROM msysobjects ORDER BY msyssobjects.ld;</p>
<p>and then go to report view first I get a window to enter an ID number (which I don't want to do) and when I enter a random id number or no number at all I am then asked to enter the Dues Year. After entering the dues year I get the correct results.</p>
<p><strong>What I need to know is:</strong> Is there a way to not get the prompted to enter a member ID?</p>
<p>If That can be fixed my problem will be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a note the text box control source to get the total members paid is as follows:</p>
<p>=DCount("[MemberID]","Dues Pd mem","[Year Paid]"=&amp;[Enter Dues Year])</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>To see what would happen I also changed the expression in the report control source you gave me to the following:</p>
<p>SELECT TOP 1 MemberID.ld FROM Dues pd mem ORDER BY MemberID.ld;<br />
This gave the following result when I went to report view:</p>
<p>Report won't open and I get the following message:&nbsp;<strong>Syntax error in FROM Clause.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed the expression back to the one you gave me. Now is there a way to get rid of the prompt for the member id?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            I don‚Äôt know how/why you being prompted for memberid. Does the record source prompt you or just the report. You somehow reversed the last ‚Äú= which should be =‚Äú.

<p><u><em><strong>Do not suggest me to:&nbsp;</strong></em></u></p>
<p>Call Nokia technical support - they won't help **bleep**</p>
<p>Boot my Lumia -&nbsp;<span>Doesn't help</span></p>

There is nothing Nokia support can do about an issue with Microsoft software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have Realplayer installed? if so I'd suggest you remove it. Not only is it hopelessly bloated and totally redundant nowadays, it is also known to interfere with, amongst other things, the update processes for Zune..</p>

<p>How are you going to help out people who do not understand common sense, who seem unable to find any information themselves, who walk into their car dealership asking why they have a problem getting the new Justin Timberlake CD to play in the car stereo,
 and who quite simply do not show any intention to even try and behave in a normal manner and ask questions but instead go on a pointless rant on a user to user support forum where all the information they need has been posted a gazillion times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people would just start and try oh..say &nbsp;Google search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you _really_ want 7.8 _now_ it is _VERY_ easy to fnd out _how_. For everyone else you are delivered into the hands of the Microsoft update process for WP7.x phones and there is nothing anyone here, including Nokia, can do to change that once the update
 has been processed into that channel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, 7.8 is nice, but not that big a deal really. Again getting it on your phone tomorrow takes about 10 minutes to figure out but it's something we can't discusss here. OP started a thread, got a proper answer, started an other similar topic and went
 off on a rant .. how's that gonna help anyone?</p>

            @paulheu: Jimmy has a habit of brushing people off who bring up problems with Nokia. Given: they may vent out of frustration, I have done the same. But to just blow someone off is not what the discussion boards are about. hahhuli said he had a problem
 and got an error. The link he gave didn‚Äôt help. It does happen. I have had Nokia updates completely wipe the Maps app off my phone. Sometimes things don't go according to what should have happened. hahhuli was obviously frustrated. Why not offer something
 to help instead of blowing him off? As a ‚ÄúMobile Overlord‚Äù I would think Jimmy would have a little more patience.

<p>@<span>&nbsp;Jimmy:&nbsp;</span>Sir, you are just full of **bleep**, are you some hired **bleep**tard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;When I buy a new mobile phone, I INDEED DO NOT EXPECT IT TO FAIL IN ONE **bleep**ING SIMPLE UPDATE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think I have not tried Googling around the web and trying to find a solution for that error code even Microsoft don't know what it means?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even tried this fancy trick where you put your phone in offline mode, connect it to Zune, search updates, turn your internet off, wait a few seconds, start your internet again, and hope it updates. Like if updating a phone is tricking around like that
 I would rather give up and buy some other phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every friend of mine who has Lumia 800 has this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E: And what makes this even more fun is that my phone offers a new update every single day, which what I of course can't install due the common problems.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t call to Pricenton numbers despite the ability to call to other American Numbers.</h2>
                    I bought a subscription for unlimited calls to the US. I've been successful in terms of calling to American numbers, all of them were good. Except for numbers from Princeton. Specifically Princeton University. I've tried to call these number from both
 the Phone (Wi-Fi and mobile Internet LTE) and PC (Cable). It connects, starts ringing and the eventually calls end in the message "Your connection is too weak, please try again later. Try for yourself if you have a subscription like me +16092583361 +16092583363
