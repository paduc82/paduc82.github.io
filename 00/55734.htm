            Thanks Karthik,&nbsp; AT&amp;T help me set up my password for my AT&amp;T account. I tried to use the new password to open up my Microsoft Account but it wouldn't accept it. I open a new Microsoft Account using same ID&nbsp;and password I use with AT&amp;T but it didn't work.
 The only thing I can think of is that my Microsoft Account&nbsp; password&nbsp;was open up under Administrator. This is the first time for using Windows 8 and I am getting pretty aggravated. I appreciate any help right now.&nbsp;I am about to&nbsp;throw my computer out the door.

            <p>Windows 7 highlights newly installed programs which is enabled by default. You can choose to disable if you find it to be a distraction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable it&nbsp;in Windows 7 right-click on the Start Menu and select <em>Properties.<br />
</em>The Taskbar and Start Menu Properties screen open. <br />
Click on the Start Menu tab and&nbsp;then click on Customize button.<br />
In the Customize Start Menu screen scroll down and uncheck <em>Highlight newly installed programs,
</em>then click Ok.<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

            ok i followed the ShellExView instructions as Ramesh stated above and disabled the following shell extension pictured below.&nbsp; after i disabled the one circled in red, it seem to have stop causing the windows explorer to stop working and restart.&nbsp; hope
 this is the one.<br />
<br />
incase you guys can't see it, the extension name is called "GraphicsShellExt Class" under the company "Intel Corporation" with a description of "igfxpph Module"<br />

<p>Right-click crashes are caused by third-party shell extensions. To identify the culprit, you need to use an utlity like ShellExView, and disable non-Microsoft context menu handlers one by one (or disable items in a batch) and observe.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Conflict Resolution Dialog Confused&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.p.rx.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Conflict Resolution Dialog Confused&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time user here, with a bit of an odd question perhaps, but could someone please tell me why, at times, the files that are presented to me in the File Conflict Resolution Dialog appear to be the same in file size and date after all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, when you copy a set of files that are already present on the destination, Windows allows you to take a specific action for those files. It shows a dialog and highlights the differences in bold font (for example, if the source file is larger than
 the one that already exists on the destination, its file size is highlighted). However, when backing up my photos for example, I regularly get the conflicts which seem te be "false": there appears to be no difference, at least in size and date. So my question
 is: ARE they different after all (perhaps in other properties of the file(s))? Or are they the same? Can I know for sure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p />

            <blockquote>
<p>So if I'm understanding what you're saying, the OS basically selects files - for example,
<strong>really big ones</strong> - that it won't compare, whereas it will compare other files (the ones it counts in the checkbox above -
<em>the ones it's confident of are identical</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, this is where you seem to be confused. The OS is <em>not</em> 100% confident that
<em>any pair of files</em> is 100% the same <em>content-wise</em>. Small or big files, 10 or 1000 pairs, doesn't matter. It will only compare names, dates and sizes for all file pairs, that's it, because retrieving those is not resource intensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that we aren't just talking about copying/moving between internal disks here. It could be internal to slow external, between two systems over a slow network and so on and so forth. Basically, the OS will just not waste precious resources or the
 user's time doing a content comparison. It will just blindly show the user <em>all</em> the files with name conflicts, and of those the user can choose with the checkbox to skip 2.a. files that he's
<em>personally</em> sure are content-wise the same. Consequently the user's left only with 2.b. files in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't use 'complaint' to describe your posts, but perhaps 'objection' was a bit of an exaggeration. :) Anyway, I hope your curiosity is sated now? Or are you still left scratching your head and wondering why Windows or OSes in general are so 'dumb'? ;)</p>

<h2>            0x87DD0019 code.</h2>
                    So I keep trying to use my profile on my xbox one and every time I try and sign in I get the following message. "There was a problem We couldn't sign you in. Try again in a few minutes, or check your account by signing in to account.live.com. Sign in:
 0x87DD0019" I am connected to the internet and my xbox connection tests can prove it. My account is in good standing. Gold is paid. I can sign in anywhere else just not my xbox one. I'm very annoyed because I haven't been able to log into my account in days.
 I basically have a very expensive paper weight right now.

<p>Hey guys,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the sign in problems with signing in. Just to make sure I understand correctly, you haven't been able to sign on to Xbox Live on your Xbox One? When you discussed doing the connectivity test it works but when you try signing in you get that error
 message? Are you ensuring that the MSA that you are using is the correct one?<br />

<p>have you reset the router settings? if so try opening up the internet explorer you may be prompted to go through a first time set up if the xbox has forgotten the router settings which can happen if the router has had a reset happen to it. I have had huge
 issues downloading tiles and content and singing in and once i did this it was sorted. (had to pay tech support to sort it out and this is what they did)

<p>Hi all, I am getting the same code (0x87dd0019) in relation to Forza 5 Day One downloadable content (using the code supplied in the box). It says installation stopped, and then gives me this error code.
</p>
<p>Any ideas? Have tried to redeem the code again, but it says it has already been redeemed. Anyway to remove the failed download and start it again?</p>

<p>Hi, I just got the xbox one with COD Ghosts. There is my profile and my son's, i was thinking we could progress separately through the game.</p>
<p>However, when my son was playing he got signed out and the code above resulted.</p>
<p>Because of this he lost all his progress and it seemed whichever one of us is signed in the game has reset to my checkpoint.</p>
<p>Can someone clarify how the profiles work especially when kinect is involved in signing people in and passing the controller? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows endlessly checks for updates-tried suggestions in other posts</h2>
                    I have not been able to get Windows updates since 2/6/09.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am running VISTA SP1 on Dell Precision 490, 2GB Ram, 32-bit OS, Intel Xeon cpu 5130 2.0 GHz<br />
<br />
I have tried most of the items suggested in other posts:<br />
Ran SFC Scan - no problems<br />
Disabled all non MS programs at startup and retried the Windows Update<br />
Could not stop the WUAUSERV, renamed Catroot directory, but was denied access to rename SoftwareDistribution, so did not continue with that process (I am logged in as Administrator and ran CMD with Administrator rights)<br />
Tried to download the latest WU pkg but it said I have the WU already installed<br />
Tried to run the Windows script 5.7 and it said non enough storage to process this command<br />
<br />
I have attached the windows update log from last&nbsp;Sat&nbsp;7/25 through Monday 7/27.&nbsp; The update was still "searching" on 7/28, today.
<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help you can give me.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>IME Simplified Chinese - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithrobinsonzl.  say:</h3>
<h2>            IME Simplified Chinese</h2>
                    <p><span>I had Windows 7 and I updated online to Windows 10. I write and use Mandarin Simplified Chinese. Before
</span><span>Microsoft had an excellent Input Method Editor ( IME) for Chinese but most disappointingly the IME in Windows 10 is incomplete. So now there is no Radical Dictionary function where you can search
 for the Radical and then find all the characters that use that Radical by the number of strokes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Secondly it had an IME pad where you could draw the character with the mouse and it would suggest possible matches for you.
</span></p>
<p><span>So I ‘ve been waiting in the hope that a fix would come to at least upgrade the IME to what it had been but so far nothing. Please can you tell me if Microsoft intend
 to restore the IME and when it might happen?</span></p>

            Hi Taffy087 thanks for reply. No .I have read them but they are not relevant to what I m asking about. I can input the Chinese using the IME but the Dictionary and the IME Pad are completely missing from Windows 10. They were really useful when you want
 to find a character and you don't know it or how it is pronounced.

<h2>            Xbox one mic not picking up my sound, but can hear</h2>
                    <div>

<div>
<p>Hi I started having problems with my microphone 2 days ago. It is a Turtle Beach XO one. I could hear but there was no movement in the circle in party chat which moves if you talk. So I
 figured I’ll buy a new headset. I picked a new headset yesterday and tried it, still no success. I then picked up a new controller. Still no success. I’ve tried the microphones in other devices and they work, even the old one. So I’ve wasted £100 trying to
 fix it and I’ve still had no success. Are there any more suggestions I could try? I’ve already checked to see if my mid was turned off on Xbox, checked privacy checked updates etc and no success.</p>

 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp;

            Probably something you have already tried, but just make sure all your headphone/headset cords are plugged in correctly, and if your controller is connected via cable, then make sure that is plugged in correctly also.

<p>If it's your first time playing, it's downloading all the NBA updated roster data and patches. That could take 5-10 mins unless the servers are down. You just have to wait for the message to disappear. You can usually still go through the menus while it's
 saving. Just don't turn off your system. I had to wait more then 5 mins a couple times, but the message always went away. Don't think there is anything wrong with the game. How long did you wait? If the servers are down, it will eventually tell you that it
 can access the data at this time. </p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 stuck in restart loop after trying to enter safe mode with msconfig</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with Windows 8.1 getting stuck in a restarting loop. Long story short I had a virus, and being unable to get the PC to boot into safe mode with F8 or shift+F8 I went into msconfig and set it to boot into safe mode (minimal) from there.
 I then got a pop-up telling me to restart and my computer now won't boot. From a 'cold start' I first get the BIOS screen, then the windows logo and circling dots, then a blue screen that says restarting, then the logo and dots again and as far as I can tell,
 this loop doesn't end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already read a lot of solutions to similar issues but none seem to work. Things I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System restore (on 3 different restore points)</strong></p>
<p>This seemed to be working fine until the progress bar got to finish and I was shown an error message saying that my files could not be restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Automatic repair</strong></p>
<p>This method shows an error before it can even start. No reason is given but I am directed to a log file. With no bootable OS, i'm not sure how I would access this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refresh your PC</strong></p>
<p>This gave me an error along the lines of my drive being locked. I have tried several methods that other people have found to solve this but none have worked. These give formatting or partitioning errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset your PC</strong></p>
<p>This option gave me an error about my drives not being partitioned correctly or a partition not being found.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Various CMD fixes</strong></p>
<p>I have seen several fixes suggested using command prompt that others have seen work, but these have not helped. Most have ended with issues along the lines of drives/partitions/files not being found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is set up with an SSD and HDD. My SSD contains windows and commonly used programs, my HDD has all my files, larger programs and such. I therefore am not overly concerned with the contents of my SSD, and since this had both windows and the virus,
 this is the one that is likely to see any data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other note is that when I first built my computer, I had to swap the case doors because some LEDs died, and stupidly forgot to note down my windows 8 serial from the sticker. I do have access to another copy via dreamspark but don't want to go through
 the whole process of downloading a copy and creating an install disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I suggest you to perform some troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Are you able to boot to desktop?</strong></li></ol>
<p>If you are not able to boot to desktop, then I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong>: <strong>Boot from the installation Media and boot to Safe mode and then disable Safe Mode from msconfig.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps in order to disable safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Boot from the <strong>installation Media</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Select Safe Mode with <strong>Command prompt </strong>and follow the below steps.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt enter <strong>bcdedit / delete</strong>, but do not press Enter yet.
</p>
<p>4. Now, you need to add the identifier of the Windows Boot Loader with a description. For this scroll down to the Windows Boot Loader display. Right-click and select Mark from the popup menu. It will highlight the<strong> identifier</strong>. Press Enter
 to copy it</p>
<p>5. Go to the command prompt where you typed the command, right click and select Paste from the popup menu. The identifier gets copied after that command.</p>
<p>6. Press Space and type /d "<strong>Windows 8 Developer Preview (Safe Mode)" </strong>
and press Enter to execute the whole command i.e. (bcdedit /copy identifier (copied) /d "Windows 8 Developer Preview (Safe Mode)"</p>
<p>7. The message “The operation completed successfully” appears on the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><strong><strong><span>Booting to Recovery Environment with Windows 8 installation media</span></strong></strong>.<br />
This is an alternate way to boot the PC and run recovery tools when something goes wrong with the Operating system.</p>
<p>Please follow the steps given below. Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart a) After you boot your computer using Windows Installation DVD a&nbsp;black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</p>
<p>b) Select the <strong><span>correct</span></strong> <strong><span>time</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Keyboard</span></strong> type.<br />
c) Click <strong><span>Repair</span></strong> <strong><span>your</span></strong> <strong>
<span>computer</span></strong> in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong> from <strong><span>Choose</span></strong>
<strong><span>an option</span></strong> <strong><span>screen</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span>advanced</span></strong> <strong><span>options</span></strong> in
<strong><span>Troubleshoot screen</span></strong>.<br />
f) Click <strong><span>Automatic</span></strong> <strong><span>Repair</span></strong> from Advanced Options screen.</p>
<p>g) Windows will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below link for reference:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have an installation Media, then refer to the following Microsoft Help article to create one<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Installing device driver software dialogue activates everytime Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tekxan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing device driver software dialogue activates everytime Windows 7 starts &#38; tries to install items already installed</h2>
                    <p>An annoying issue has recently started on my windows 7 Pro (64bit) Tosh laptop. When I start or restart the PC the Driver Software Installation dialogue box pops up to Install device drivers for Intel ICH9 Family USB Universal Host Controller
 2934, 2935, 2936, 2937, 2938, 2939 ,293A, 293C and all 5 USB Root Hubs.&nbsp; the installations always fails. I understand that this would be fine if it were not for the fact that these items are already installed and functioning correctly as stated in Device Manager.</p>
<p>All I want to do is to stop this from happening. Clearly something is causing this but what is not clear. Would anybody be kind enough to please assist me with this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
1. Have you made any changes in the computer recently?<br />
2. What is the model number of the toshiba computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expand USB controller in device manager and check if he sees any error mesage or exclamation mark</p>
<p>a. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.‌</p>
<p>b. In the list of hardware categories, find USB Controller and check for exclamation mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may check with the issue after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager. </p>
<p>Note:If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link for assistance–<br />
&nbsp;<br />

&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Please let me know if the issue still persists. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

            Good day Ratandeep and apologies for not responding sooner.<br />
<br />
I've been busy attending to this issue and believe I have found the source of the problem.
<br />
I run my own PC repair business out of Cape Town South Africa and was rather embarrassed to have to ask this support question which in essence is ridiculous as no-one knows everything right?<br />
<br />
Suffice to say I have it narrowed down to one particular Windows Update KB2862330 which wasn't selected by default but I must have inadvertently checked the box. Normally Updates progress with no or very little issues and in truth who has the time to check
 the details of each and every update. Besides, like most people in our business there are a million other things going on all the time.<br />
<br />
I have however, learn't a valuable lesson from this to more mindful of updating Windows. I think maybe, Microsoft should colour code potentially problematic updates rather than expect folk to read up on every issue pertaining to each update before installing.
 After all, a default installation of most flavours of Windows sets Windows updates on automatic download and install (which naturally I change to manual update and install).
<br />
<br />
We live and learn hey.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll update this thread should I find any other issues associated with this problem.<br />
Thanks again for your reply.<br />
<br />
regards<br />

            <p>Good day Ratandeep,</p>
<p>Just a quick update to my previous post.</p>
<p>I decided to install the problematic update KB2862330 taking into consideration the suggested workaround solution outlined in scenario 2 of
<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2862330/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2862330/en-us</a> which related to the issue my PC was having.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sadly disabling the enhanced USB controllers then reactivating as per instruction yielded a negative result and the PC was left once more with the constant driver reinstallation dialogues and failed to install results.
</p>
<p>Sensibly I had ensured an image backup before installing the offending update so restoring it was painless enough. I would use Windows restore if I had faith in it but sadly it has never worked for me in Windows 7 and was patchy at best
 in XP before. So for now, I have decided to not include this update until such time a workable solution can be found. Please advise accordingly.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>If you never made a password reset disk or backup, you may have to resort to a factory reset.&nbsp; But unless your files are encrypted, you can still back them up without the password... although that requires that you either use a disc/USB, or you take your
 hard drive to another computer to get the files first. </p>

<h2>            Svchost.exe &#40;SSDP&#47;uPNP related&#41; ate 99&#37; of CPU</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying (without success, btw) to connect my XBOX 360 to PC to work with Media Center, or DLNA, or whatever. Neither works, but there is another problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Media Center is installed and/or&nbsp;Home Group is configured to share media content, one of svchost.exe processes start to consume all CPU resources. It happens shortly after WMP is launched. It belongs to LocalServiceAndNoImpersonationGroup and hosts
 4 items: FDResPub, SSDPSRV, TimeBroker and upnphost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I force upnphost to shut down through Task Manager, its svchost drops to 0% CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what is the problem with upnphost? As far as I know uPNP there is no way it have to constantly consume 99% of 4-core 4GHz CPU. Still it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to configure it right? Is it a bug? Is there a solution? </p>

<p>
</p><p>Skype does not natively support&nbsp;call recording&nbsp;within Skype application. However, some of our third-party developers have created applications that plug into your Linux, Mac, and Windows Classic Skype clients to achieve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information you can check this FAQ link: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12395/how-can-i-record-my-skype-calls?q=record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">How can I record my Skype calls?</span></a></strong>&nbsp;</p>
