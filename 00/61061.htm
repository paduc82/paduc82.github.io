<h2>            Device Manager bangs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a couple of Device Manager bangs that I can't resolve.&nbsp; The first is "Microsoft Generic IPMI Compliant Device"and the second is Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the IPMI issue,&nbsp; the Device Status is "The device cannot start (Code 10).&nbsp; An invalid parameter was passed to a service or function." &nbsp; I have tried updating the driver through device manager but it says the best driver is already installed. But the driver
 (10.0.17134.1) is from 6/21/2006???&nbsp; I have searched for an updated driver but can't find anything relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the USB issue the Device Status is "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)</p>
<div>
<p>A request for the USB device descriptor failed."&nbsp; But I tried uninstalling all USB devices and the error persists. &nbsp; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been banging my head against a wall on these issues for weeks and especially the last few days. &nbsp; I have installed all updates and have updated all drivers to the latest revisions. &nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is a dual Skylake Server with an Intel 622 PCH. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

<p>Was this response really neccessary? &nbsp;What do you call the yellow triangles with the exclamation mark inside? &nbsp;I’ve always had them referred to as “bangs”. &nbsp;My apologies if this is wrong but it didn’t warrant an off-color, tasteless response. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Missing network protocol windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<p><em><strong>Original title: </strong></em>Missing network protocol windows 10 </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, problem is that about once in a day my laptop loses its wireless connection. I troubleshoot it and it says that "one or more network protocols are missing from this computer". Normally it fixes itself by restarting computer. Its just annoying. Oh and
 if i run troubleshoot it gives me error message 68309.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have literally tried everything - about every command you can do that effects internet.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled drivers and even tried with "wifi stick" - the not internal thing.</p>
<p>I have changed WWAN to automatic (someone said it helps).</p>
<p>Wifi sharing is turned of as recommended.</p>
<p>I even called Microsoft support and this guy I was talking with had no idea whats going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been fighting this issue for 6 days now (Its when I started using my laptop cause I'm not at home)</p>
<p>So I'm open for any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My computer is Asus rog 771jw with windows 10 pro (64 bit) build 1155</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is it common bug that will be fixed with some update or is it some setting or corrupted file thats causing it?</p>
<p>Really need some help with this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 1: I noticed that when I restarted my computer after network protocol error appeared that airplane mode had turned itself on!</p>
<p>And as we all know airplane mode disables wifi, but strange thing is that I dont lose wifi connection, it just gives me yellow triangle on wifi icon. Could airplane mode and network protocol error be connected to eachother? I dont think so atleast but I&nbsp;thought
 it's worth mentioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: People, I have found the source of this issue. Its my phone that I use as wifi hotspot.</p>
<p>Apparently its my location - Im in kinda countryside at this moment and it loses LTE-connection for time to time. I have no idea why windows 10 is giving me this error but it seems not to be an issue. Airplane mode that I mentioned earlier appears to be
 visual bug and its still actually off even when it seems to be on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that you who have this kinda issue gets it solved too. Cant thank you for helping me with this tho, since only one person came for my aid. :/</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was running avast, but I did remove it when trying to solve my problem. That didnt help anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To all people who have this problem, first check your modem. I had these 20-60 second disconnects - Still think that it was my location that was causing those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot still gives me error 68309, but thats not a problem anymore because it does not affect performance at all.</p>

            They wont say it but I will, I had the same problem w/ my last computer, windows 10 is garbage, seems they try to make it our own fault that windows 10 is not properly. this should have been addressed long ago, their are too many of us w/ the same issue
 for it not to be their fault.

            Know what? nowhere do I find successful procedure to fix "Missing Protocol". I looked at every occurrence of that phrase. I dunno ...<br />
<br />
FWIW/FYI:<br />
<br />
Step 2 in this procedure caused "Missing Protocol" http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-network-connection-issues<br />
It was recommended by @WindowsSupport.<br />
Nobody in LiveChat had clue 1; 4 of 6 just streamed BS ****, 2 were decent ... 1 technically capable.<br />
But nobody of any help.<br />
<br />
2nd day trying to fix this.<br />

            My network was working perfectly fine when using a LAN connection - UNTIL this morning AFTER the Windows Update yesterday. I suspect something went wrong during it. I am about to do a Restore back to before the install to see if this remedies the missing
 protocols.

<p>You really do mean returning to the previous OS, right? (What was it, Win7? 8?)<br />
I would gladly have done that but ... that option is only available for a month, and that window had closed for me.<br />

<p>Les trois quart des soucis dont tu parle je ne les ai pas tel que l'ancrage par exemple,et je suis aussi en fibre optique (wifi).</p>
<p>Quand a te faire kické ou autre sur bf4 cela ne vient pas de la one mais du jeu qui est buggé a mort et ce sur tous les supports.</p>

            Bonjour,
Il me semble qu'elle est sortie le <strong>22 Novembre</strong> pour de bonnes raison, les <strong>vrais</strong>&nbsp;joueurs <strong>Xbox</strong> savent pourquoi...
Les bugs de <strong>BF4</strong> n'ont strictement rien à voir avec la console, <strong>le jeu est instable</strong> sur toutes les plateformes.
Critiquer le reeeeste du monde, c'est un peu simple je crois. J'ai eu beaucoup de mal à te lire mais bon je crois que j'ai quand même compris et tu peux être en colère si ta <strong>console est défectueuse,</strong> c'est normal mais il ne faut<strong> pas forcement tout cracher sur le dos de Microsoft.</strong>
<strong>Quand on ne connait pas bien un sujet, autant éviter d'en parler.</strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ajouterais que dire que Xbox One est à ne pas prendre est une extrémité, voire une énormité, simplement parce qu'il n'y aurait pas autant de monde sur cette console en seulement 2 semaines si c'était <strong>réellement</strong> le cas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Que tu rencontre des problèmes est une chose, que tu en fasse une généralité en est une autre, idem pour les soucis de connexion que tu rencontre, dire avoir la fibre, c'est bien, mais cela ne fait pas tout, surtout si le FAI ou la connexion est instable ou mal paramétrée, à savoir qu'il faut être certain que TOUS les ports soient ouverts, au passage, il y en a 5 supplémentaires par rapport à la Xbox 360, (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/fr-FR/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ports réseau utilisés par Xbox Live sur Xbox One</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quant aux problèmes rencontrés sur Battlefield 4, comme dit à maintes reprises, ce n'est pas du fait de Microsoft ou de la Xbox One, mais&nbsp;du jeu lui-même qui souffre de très nombreux bugs reconnus à la fois par l'éditeur, Electronics Arts, et le studio de développement Dice, ce à quoi ils répondent travailler sur un correctif.</p>
<p>Pour ce qui est de Forza 5, hormis ceux disposant de connexions en-deçà du minimum requis en terme de débit ou de stabilité, tout le monde est satisfait de cet excellent jeu, difficile donc de croire que ton cas représente un avis général.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>En conclusion, ton avis reste celui d'un utilisateur ayant rencontrés des problèmes à titre individuel, comme cela arrive à une minorité à chaque lancement de nouvelle console, sans en minimiser l'importance ressentie, il faut éviter d'extrapoler son propre cas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cordialement</p>

            <p>Hello Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion however as mentioned previously I don't have the same problem when I create a new account on my laptop. I also do not want to go through the hassle of transferring all my files and programs to the newly created account.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions, however when I checked the account that has the greyed out problem, it still exists, uniquely for this account.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As issue did not occurred in new user account; this means there are corrupt files in old user account. If you continue using old user account it might cause other issue in future. I suggest you to follow the steps below and transfer files and settings to
 new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that you need to log in to a different account apart from which account you are copying file and to account which you are copying to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Follow the Steps below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Copy User Data: Follow the below steps to copy files to the new user profile
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Log on as a user other than the user whose profile you are copying files to or from.<br />
2.&nbsp;In Windows Explorer, click View, click Options, click the Change Folder and search option, click View tab and Show hidden files and folders, uncheck the Hide protected operating system files check box, and then click OK.<br />
3.&nbsp;Locate the C:\Documents and Settings\Old_Username folder, where C is the drive on which Windows is installed, and Old_Username is the name of the profile you want to copy user data from.<br />
4.&nbsp;Press and hold down the CTRL key while you click each file and subfolder in this folder, except the following files:
<br />
•&nbsp;Ntuser.dat<br />
•&nbsp;Ntuser.dat.log<br />
•&nbsp;Ntuser.ini<br />
1.&nbsp;On the Edit menu, click Copy.<br />
2.&nbsp;Locate the C:\Documents and Settings\New_Username folder, where C is the drive on which Windows is installed, and New_Username is the name of the user profile that you created in the "Create a New User Profile" section.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Edit menu, click Paste.<br />
4.&nbsp;Log off the computer, and then log on as the new user. </p>

            <p>Hello Pavan,</p>

</p><p>I agree that as the one User Account could be corrupt, I should create another and transfer the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having now tried your suggestion, I am stuck on point 3 of your notes insomuch that I can only find a shortcut to "Documents &amp; Settings" and when selected I receive the error message as per the attached screenshot.</p>

<p>I am struggling with this fix as I have followed your instructions and the Documents &amp; Settings is still only shown as a short cut. Also found it a bit confusing that after changing to Administrator under Group Membership- Other (reflecting Administrators)
 is greyed out when rechecked.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 internet connection fails</h2>
                    Windows 10 updated last night (11/13/2015) and now my internet connection fails every 5 minutes instead of the previous and annoying every couple of hours. I can restart the computer or sometimes fix with the troubleshooter by right clicking on the internet
 icon. When using the troubleshooter it works about half the time, the other times I get different (excuses) dialog boxes every time. I am using Chrome as a browser.

            Okay, found the "update driver software" option and ran that. Restarted computer and all was fine for about 10 minutes - then connection failed again. Troubleshooting failed (pop up promps). Restarted computer - still no internet. Shut down computer and
 restarted (complete shutdown instead of "restart"), this didn't even work to get the connection open again. In the past a restart would give a temporary fix but now I can seem to log on at all. Good thing I have a Mac to even post this question.

            <p>Still not working. If anything it is now worse since when I run the troubleshooter it will only fix the problem about 1/3 of the time instead of 1/2 and restarting the computer only works some of the time. Here is when the problem started, followed by some
 of the various messages I get when the troubleshooter doesn't work.</p>

</p><p>Did you fix that part of your symptom?&nbsp; An alternative method of doing it would be in an elevated command prompt window (or Administrator: Windows PowerShell) to enter:&nbsp; net start wlansvc</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, then you could first find its status.&nbsp; E.g. in PowerShell:&nbsp; Get-Service wlansvc&nbsp; (or in a cmd window enter&nbsp; sc.exe query wlansvc)</p>

            <p>I did the above suggestions, nothing helped. Had a tech consultant come and spend a day Thursday to help do all that (since much of it I didn't understand), plus whatever else he could think of. When he left the problem was no better and he said the only
 next step he could think of was to replace my router. But Saturday morning Microsoft apparently ran another update &nbsp;because when I got on my computer I had to re-log on, and whatever the update was fixed the problem 100%. Which just proved to me that it was
 a software bug and there was nothing I could have done to fix it. Just stole a week of my life. Now I have been told it would be a good idea to turn off the updates, since that what caused the original problem</p>

    <title>Windows Startup Having Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Startup Having Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not too long ago, I attempted to use the AI Suite 3 feature of my ASUS Z97-A motherboard to 5-Way Optimize my system, which included an auto-overclocking feature. &nbsp;Nothing went wrong and everything seemed fine, but I decided I wanted to play it safe and
 revert to BIOS defaults and do the overclock myself when I got time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I reset the BIOS back to defaults I get some really odd issues on Windows startup that I've never seen or heard of before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens at random as well, sometimes I'll boot up and everything works normally, other times...well I'll explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll boot the computer like normal, log in screen comes on, I sign in, takes a second to sign in (seems a tad longer than before and sometimes takes a few minutes, even though I'm on an SSD that otherwise runs silky smooth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I'm logged in and Windows 10 boots to my desktop, the only things that load in the system tray are the audio manager, bluetooth connectivity, and occasionally Malwarebytes. &nbsp;The cursor will show the loading circle and then it will freeze, but I can
 still move the mouse. &nbsp;I try clicking on the networking icon, nothing. &nbsp;I click on the date/time area, nothing. &nbsp;I right click on the desktop, and the context menu opens partially, and freezes transparent. &nbsp;Clicking on something in it may or may not open the
 selection and most likely when it loads it will be unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the start menu and get the same general result as the context menu from the desktop, nothing works properly or at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on something in the taskbar, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>But</strong></span>, if I click Google Chrome in the taskbar,
<strong>most of the time</strong>, it will load up and then everything launches like on a normal startup (Razer Synapse 2.0, Skype, CoreTemp, Steam, and so on) and everything works normally after that. &nbsp;Sometimes, I'll click on Chrome and it will open and freeze
 and then the whole computer will do nothing at all, but if I shut it off and turn it back on, it will all happen again, but suddenly Chrome starts up correctly this time and everything else turns on with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas as to whats going on here? &nbsp;Help is greatly appreciated.</p>

 try that out today. &nbsp;I'm only hesistant to say this is a fix because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but I will be sure and get back here once I try some more times to see if the USB device drivers is the issue.</p>

            <p>I continued with trying unplugging USB devices and also tried uninstalling a bunch of useless applications, but the issue still persists. &nbsp;Booting to safe mode seems to fix the issue as well. &nbsp;I have not updated the BIOS because I haven't been able to get
 my motherboard to recognize the file type correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still believe this issue is tied with Google Chrome given that everything will start if I launch it, a characteristic that isn't present with the other programs on my computer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Repairing Disk Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brownin329  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Repairing Disk Errors</h2>
                    I know a lot of people have been having trouble with the computers all of a sudden freezing and then going into this ridiculously long repairing disk error nonsense which takes a heck more than an hour to do anything. I need to get my stuff off my computer.
 Is there any way I can bypass this message to get to my c drive? No I dont have a recovery CD. I don't have a usb. esc+power does not work. windows+power does not work. alt F10+power does not work. alt f12+power does not work. taking out the battery and unplugging
 it and then turning it on does not work. holding down the power button only turns it off. Right now it is running. the circle is turning and at the bottom of my screen it says Repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour. It has been 5 hours. I have
 a Toshiba satellite laptop bought in 2015 with windows 10 64 bit. I have to get this to work because I am looking for work at home jobs. Thanks for non nonsensical and realistic help.&nbsp;

            Two options you have and you have to make a little effort to make either one work:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Go to another working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a custom install.
<br />
<br />Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the indicater, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Wait while Setup starts.
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms and click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom
<br />
<br />Select the Primary Partition then click Next
<br />
<br />You will receive the following warning:
<br />
<br />
<br />The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your previous version of Windows.
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart and reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.
<br />
<br />Windows will check if there is an active Internet connection. If it does not find one, you will be presented with the following screen.
<br />
<br />Create a Local Account and click Next
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows finalizes your settings
<br />
<br />Continue to wait while Windows installs modern applications.
<br />
<br />When setup is complete you can retrieve any personal files from the Windows.old
<br />
<br />Browse to C:\ Local Disk and open the Windows.old folder

<h2>            USB devices stopped working with windows 7 home</h2>
                    <div>Hello - all of the USB ports on my computer stopped working suddenly and I can't get it to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 Home Premium Build 6.1 build 7601 service pack 1. 64 <span>
bit</span></div>
<div>Motherboard MSI model ms-7597</div>
<div>Graphics card: Nvidia GeForce 7025/NVIDIA nForce 630a</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So far I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Reinstalling the chipset drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Uninstalled the USB drivers under device manager (which re-installed them and recognized them after I rebooted - it thinks that it's there).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched through forum threads and found that other people had similar problems back in 2009/2010. In one of those threads I read about a "<span>hotfix</span>" from 2009.
 I tried to apply it but it then gave me an error message that said "this <span>
hotfix</span> does not apply to your computer"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I start up the computer my USB peripherals start working for a few seconds as the bios boots up - as soon as Windows takes over it shuts&nbsp;down.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone throw me in the right direction to solve this? In a 2012 way?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Thanks in advance...</div>
                </div>

<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:

<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to download and install Microsoft safety scanner and run the scan and check.</span></p>

 definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files

            I tried all of those things and nothing worked. The hotfix for NVIDIA chipsets would not work at all - it said "this fix does not apply to you" as an error message. the hardware and devices troubleshooter recognized that an error was there - but it would
 not specify it nor would it fix it. The safety scanner found nothing. Same with the clean boot and the safe mode boot. I'm more than open to any other suggestions...<br />

<p>Charge you for what ? If this was a cold call I would have no hesitation in calling it a scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone numbers of the real Synaptics corporation regional head offices are in the link below.
</p>
<p>I see the area code -347- for the number in your post is for New York. However, neither the head office</p>
<p>or the Nth American distributors shown in the page below have phone numbers that match that area code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you should ring their head office in San Jose to verify if the number is genuine so they can report it to the
</p>
<p>relevant telecommunications fraud authority if it's not.</p>

<h2>            Parallel and serial ports not working in Windows 10 &#40;Version 1511&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 1511 update myself and my customers have problems with devices connected to COMx and LPTx ports. After a search I found a solution by disabling the ports and then re-enabling them and a script to run at boot time to automated the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As we have more than a 100 customers involved in this and we can not turn off the Windows updates, this is its creating chaos in our support department. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is: Is there a patch available for this and if not when can we expect it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not that the drivers are not installed, in most cases these are "standard" on board serial and parallel ports with windows build-in drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that since the 1511 update, if for example a printer is connected to the ports and you try to print, it immediately goes in an error state. &nbsp;(If you disable the port and then re-enable it, it works fine!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its definitely a bug in Win10 release 1511 with either the drivers or the way it access the drivers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Due to work commitments, including temporarily by passing this problem, I have not had the time to reply to your answer. &nbsp;Which is in general terms a lot of nothing. &nbsp;Why would corrupt ddl/exe files suddenly stop the ports from working, without any error
 message, etc. Secondly why would a disable/enable cycle miraculously make a corrupt file suddenly UN-corrupt?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prove you wrong. &nbsp;I clean install windows 10, then let it update to version 1511. (Please note, no additional drivers from motherboard install. &nbsp;All drivers as supplied with MS Windows.) Same problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am patiently waiting for a fix that solves the problem. Where possible I enabled "Defer Updates", but that only defer the problem "for several months". &nbsp;With NO acknowledgement from Microsoft that there is a problem, that maybe to short. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
