<h2>            Microsoft Money - currency conversion problem</h2>
                    I am trying to&nbsp;import Quicken data into Micosoft Money (Sunset version).&nbsp; The automatic set-up and conversion process works fine until I get to stage where I am asked to enter the currency conversion rate. The Quicken data is in British pounds so I choose
 British pounds from the currency drop down and enter the conversion rate as 1.00.&nbsp; Every time I do so the program crashes and Microsoft Money closes down.&nbsp; Does anyone know the cause and the solution?&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>That being said, I am running Windows 10. Before the last update, I was able to use Photo Gallery. Not Now! Whatever it was that they decided to "fix" on it because they "thought" we would be better off without it, has left me without a SIMPLE photo viewing
 app/program that ALSO makes edits. And PLEASE don't tell me about PHOTOS. It is terrible.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Before Photo Gallery was shoved down our throats, we had Picture Manager, which was a great program ("program" is what us old guys used to call what is now referred to as an "app", which is short for "application", but they are all just programs.)</p>
<p>

</p><p>I also have this same issue, along with many other issues with my new WINDOWS 10! Why change a good app into an absolutely useless app????</p>

    <title>Problems sending screenshots to OneNote 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> npp987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems sending screenshots to OneNote 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have set my Surface Pen settings to "Send screenshot to OneNote 2016" for when I double-click the shortcut button. This feature worked without any problems before, but it hasn´t worked since I installed the Windows Creators Update a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that there could be something wrong with my installation of OneNote 2016, since the function "Send screenshot to OneNote" works. Yet when I open OneNote 2016, go to the "Insert" tab, and click on the "Screen Clipping" button it works without any
 Problem. I simply don't understand what the underlying problem might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Disk Manager Extend Volume Problem in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lacoop48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Manager Extend Volume Problem in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;2 external hard drives:&nbsp; a Touro (1 TB) and a WD My Book (3 TB).&nbsp; I wanted to&nbsp;create a smaller partition on each of these drives. I used Disk Management (Windows 8.1) to do this. I successfully created a new partition on the Touro (Drive E:). The
 new second volume on the Touro is Drive G:&nbsp;.&nbsp; But, this did not work out on my WD My Book drive (Drive F:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that the "Shrink volume" command worked, but Disk Management won't let me create a "New simple volume" (grayed out) of the space it created and shows it as "Unallocated" and still part of my WD My Book (Drive F:).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to reverse this and do an "Extend volume" on Drive F: , but the "Extend Wizard" says that this space is either "cannot be converted to dynamic or...is a boot or system volume."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I re-attach and recover&nbsp;this "Unallocated" space to my WD My Book (Drive F:)?</p>
<p>

                    <p>I have tried below work around:</p>
<p>For Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. C<span>lick on Computer Management &gt; Services &amp; Applications &gt; Services. Scroll down to right-click on "Windows Mobile-2003-based device connectivity" to select Properties &gt; Log On. Switch to "Local System account" with checking
 "Allow service to interact with desktop" then click OK.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">2. Install or configure the .net 3.5 framework</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">3. Added registry entries below:</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RapiMgr\SvcHostSplitDisable , set the value equal to 1</span></p>

<p>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Make sure type is reg_dword for both</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
4. <span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Restart PC</span></p>
<p>

But this does not help connecting wmdc to devices on Windows 10. Any suggestions?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 password issues due to function lock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toddprintz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 password issues due to function lock</h2>
                    If you are having problems entering the correct password in Windows 10 then look at the password you entered using the "eye" feature to the right of the password entry box. Is the password correct in the box? My password was incorrect because my keyboard
 changes so that the function lock is on so when I type a specific letter that is over the calculator functions (blue 1-9 on my laptop) the function alternate number letter symbol is used. Pressing function allows you to type the opposite key letter (main or
 white) which allowed me to type the correct password in. After I restart it still goes into this function lock mode, but I can now login.

            I too face the same problem where I use the onscreen keyboard from the ease of access center to type my pin. I use a HCL-ME notebook with w10 x86 running. I still have this issue after several updates since I upgraded to w10 release in July.<br />

Operating Windows 7 64-bit. New HP Photosmart Premium All-In-One C410a printer. Installed using installion CD. All worked well for a week. Now HP Solutions not working and trouble shooting message saying device driver has not been successfully installed. On
 the phone with HP for an hour. Device driver downloaded and installed. Clean up done. Printer software uninstalled and reinstalled. Still getting trouble shooting message that device driver is missing. HELP!

            <p>I had the same issue when I first installed this printer. Under normal conditions the 64-bit drivers<strong>DID
</strong>install successfully on your machine. I have been using mine for the the last three months with<strong>NO</strong> ill effects. I have used all functions selected during the installation, except the fax; even though the fax test was successful.</p>
<p>The solution was the following:</p>
<p>1) <strong>DO </strong>a clean install as you would normally would, including selecting/deselectings features you want to install.</p>
<p>2) As long as the device is functioning correctly (print, scan, copy, fax) -<strong> IGNORE</strong> the device manager - will explain later.</p>
<p>3) <strong>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TROUBLESHOOT</strong>, this will disable what drivers WERE successfully installed.</p>
<p>4) You should be able to view the device under the DEVICES &amp; PRINTERS panel, which is accessable via the Control Panel.</p>
<p>The problem is a communication malfunction between HP and Microsoft. HP originally notified Microsoft that the 32-bit drivers were compatible and Microsoft's compatibility page shows this. The mis-communication is that HP<strong>DID NOT</strong> notify Microsoft
 that the 64-bit drivers were also compatible, or they did notify Microsoft and Microsoft has not taken any action.</p>
<p>Because of this Microsoft has not updated the DEVICE MANAGER software to recognize the drivers. This is why you<strong>MUST IGNORE THE DEVICE MANAGER FOR THIS DEVICE AND NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN THROUGH THE TROUBLESHOOTING</strong> dialog. The device manager will
 show the printer under two different devices (<em>multifunction &amp; other devices</em>). They will have a yellow triangle over the device. If you attempt to update the drivers via the device manger or the troubleshooting dialog, the drivers that did successully
 install will be disabled and the only way to use the device is completely uninstall the device, recycle the machine, clean the registry, and then do a clean install.
</p>
<p>I have been in contact with HP's product support, who had no idea that this has happened. A product support manager contacted me and after explaining in detail what is happening, he assurred me that it will be taken care of as soon as possible. He is getting
 together with product and software engineers to find out what did/did not occur concerning the compatibility issue. It will not happen over night, but he assurred me that he will be pushing for an escalatiopn in the matter. It could be hurting their sales.</p>

<p>It's tempting to get either of the two CSI titles on this list, however my recent experiences with ebay where I've managed to pick up copies of Fallout 3 and New Vegas for collectively less than a tenner, have shown me that's probably a good starting place...still
 CSI: Deadly Intent for £14.99? Meh, I bought CSI: Fatal Conspiracy brand new a month of so after it's release for about £17 in a shop...not that good a deal. It seems this games on demand service is a good idea but a little too pricey...</p>

                    Windows 10. Faded blue circles on screen not the small spinning blue circle. Have two cursors. One locked in the blue circle at top of screen and the other operational cursor now flashes and very slow. How can I fix this?

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
Outdated, corrupted or incompatible 3rd party software drivers are some of the reasons why you're having that issue on your computer. To come up with a correct resolution, kindly answer the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Have you checked if there are any updated drivers on your machine?<br />
• Do you have this problem in <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong></em> and if not can you isolate the cause via
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong></em> process?<br />
• Were there any changes on your PC prior to the issue?<br />
• Have you tried <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Creating a new user profile</a></strong></em> to check if it's the one
 causing the issue?<br />

            <p>This is an irrelevant answer. The public folders are still present just not listed in File Explorer. I confirmed that by opening a Word file I had kept on a public folder. The only way I have found of getting them to appear in File Explorer is to access:-
 This PC/OS(C:)/Users/Public and then pin Public to the Quick Access list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a better way than this? Public folders should be there by default as in Windows 7.</p>

            <p>The public folder is no longer appear in Windows 10 File Explorer by default. You can go to &nbsp;"This PC/(C:)/Users/Public", and access the&nbsp;public folders there. You can then&nbsp;right click anyone of those public folders and pin them to the Quick Access, so that
 it will appear in File Explorer for easy access.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and found a solution at&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/cannot-find-public-documents-folder-in-windows-10/68a395ed-e791-4516-905f-6e41f840ca14">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/cannot-find-public-documents-folder-in-windows-10/68a395ed-e791-4516-905f-6e41f840ca14</a>.
 Basically the answer is to right-click in the left pane of the explorer on an empty spot and then select "Show libraries".</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?

<p>
</p><p>The issue could have happened due to some third party software conflicts. </p>

<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Stop the Windows Installer service and check:<br />

<h2>            Xbox Audio-&#38;gt&#59;Reciever</h2>
                    
<p>This is My TV. It has Optical Audio output, 2 hdmi, vga. a/v.</p>
<p>http://www.vizio.com/led-lcd-hdtvs/e220mv.html</p>
<p>This is my receiver.</p>
<p>http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR609-Channel-Certified-Receiver/dp/B004O0TRD8</p>
<p>and my xbox is the 250g black xbox.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain the best way to go about hooking up the 360 to the reciever so it has pure quality sound from the receiver. hdmi or optical audio?</p>

<p>It doesn't matter. Both the HDMI audio output and the optical audio output provide the same audio signal. While one is optical and one is electrical, both are digital and contain the same information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing you should worry about is if the receiver introduces any latency in the HDMI video path.</p>

<p><strong><span><span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Both should be fine, as IceStorm has said.<br />
<br />
However I personally would use HDMI for the display and then mute the TV and then use the optical cable for audio in surround sound, as sometimes there might be lag present, depending on your TV/receiver.</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p>Hi Swati,&nbsp; I had already followed all the guidance in Codecs-frequently-asked-questions with no success.</p>
<p>Device drivers are up to date</p>
<p>Media Player 12 doesn't have an option to download codecs automatically. However, it is set to check for updates daily and it&nbsp;reports that media player and all components are up to date.</p>

<p>Mary,&nbsp;&nbsp; my PC is a new Dell Studio 1557 laptop with Windows 7 64 bit Professional. Tuner is AverMedia AverTV DVB-T&nbsp; (this tuner works perfectly with Media Center on my other machine which is running Vista Ultimate)</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain that&nbsp; it isn't a hardware problem. I downloaded the GOM player and&nbsp;it can play the .dvr-ms and .wtv files ok.</p>
<p>Media player 12 and media center only play the audio with no video. Media Center can record tv to .wtv files, but for live tv it only has audio with no video. There are no error messages.</p>

<p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>I have already updated the video driver to the latest level: it made no difference</p>
<p>I downloaded the k-lite codec pack. It made no difference to Media Player or Media Center. However, the Media Player Classic which is part of the k-lite package can play the files with no problem. That's *.dvr-ms and *.wtv files</p>
<p>The tuner is AverTV DVB-T USB 2.0&nbsp; - but I don't think this is a problem with the tuner. Media Center can record tv with this tuner but it can't display the video for live tv, it only plays the audio.&nbsp;A file which has been recorded with Media Center in .wtv
 format plays fine in K-Lite media player classic but won't play in Media Center or Media Player12: I&nbsp; get audio but no video.</p>

<p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>That's all the detail I have on the tuner but let's leave that for now and concentrate on Media Player and take one step at a time.</p>
<p>In folder c:\Users\Public\RecordedTV\Sample Media&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a sample file called Landscapes.wtv.&nbsp; In Windows Live Movie maker the clip plays fine - I get audio and video.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Media Player I get audio but no video.</p>
<p>In folder c:\users\Public\Videos\Sample Videos&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a sample file called Wildlife.wmv&nbsp;&nbsp;The file plays ok in both Windows Live Movie Maker and in Media PLayer- I get audio and video.</p>
<p>So, the question is - why doesn't landscapes.wtv play&nbsp;properly in Media Player?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>

<h2>            FPS for Dota 2 reduced after changing Laptop fan.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Laptop not working the way it used to be after changing for a new fan</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i'm having a problem with my ASUS A53S laptop recently, so i'll start from the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few weeks back my laptop's fan finally got faulty (after 3 years of usage) and i decided to send it over to an IT shop for repairs.</p>
<p>My laptop's fan was spoiled due to dust accumulating in the fan, and a new fan was installed inside my laptop.</p>
<p>Just when i thought everything would be back to the way it used to be, it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having performance issues in terms of graphics and gaming, i was able to run Dota 2 with a stable 30-45 fps(before the fan got faulty).</p>
<p>But now with the new fan im barely running under 15-30 fps, which really annoys me.</p>
<p>The game's default video options calibrated my settings to be on high yet it runs slowly with fps lag, my laptop isn't even hot too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop's specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Core i5-2410m, 2.3ghz</p>
<p>4GB RAM</p>
<p>640GB HDD</p>
<p>Windows 7 Premium 64-Bit</p>
<p>NVIDIA GT540M CUDA™ 2GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several performance fix like Defragmenting the hard disk, Disk cleanup, Updating graphics drivers, scanning for viruses/malware, Cleaning temporary files, Fixing registry with CCleaner, but nothing seems to help.</p>
<p>I feel devastated since my laptop isn't working the way it used to be... is it because the new fan is not strong compared to the previous one?</p>
<p>What should i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Moved from GAming)</p>

<h2>            script error when i open my mouse in &#34;my bluetooth&#34;</h2>
                    When I double click on my bluetooth mouse in "my bluetooth" I get two script errors. The mouse will not work now. If I right click on the mouse and look at the properties, it shows that it is discovered. When I try to add it in "devices and printers" it
 does not show up when I push the connect button on the mouse. What do I need to do here?<br />
