<h2>            808 Pureview doesn&#39;t sync email automaticaly</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>Email doesn't sync automaticaly, only manual (gmail accounts)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I adjust email sync frecuency to every 10 minutes (i.e), it doesn't check the email, only when I open mail app and touch refresh button.</p>
<p><br />
I was talking with Nokia Care Chat, and they told me to delete the accounts, power off the phone and create accounts again, without success. They told me to do a trick, to avoid the automatic email creator asistant, creating a new email address i.e. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 and selecting pop/imap as email type (not gmail). Then I renamed the account and entered manualy the gmail IMAP email parameters without success.</p>
<p><br />
Then I opened another chat with Nokia Care (Nokia Spain), and they told me to wait, and to create the accounts once else, without successs. Then they told me to wait them while they do some tests.</p>
<p>Then they told me they replied the problem with another nokia 808 without success, then&nbsp; they told me they talked with Nokia Systems people who told them that "the service is in actualization and maintenance and in a short time it must be corrected...."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the day after I went to a Nokia Care (hera in Spain there are a lot of them in "El Corte Inglés" stores), and asked to update the phone software. They put v. 112.020.0311 firmware version.</p>
<p>Then I configured my phone, configured email, installed apps, etc.</p>
<p>Then email was syncing correctly, but only for one thay.</p>
<p>Now it doesn't sync automaticaly again, only manualy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't understand that a phone as Nokia 808 Pureview could be without automatic email sync... we are in 2012...</p>
<p>Now I must sync manualy every time I want to know if I have an email, and the email widget is useless...</p>
<p><br />
Please test if you have same problem as me.</p>
<p><br />
Please Nokia staff, tell me when will this issue be corrected.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I have gmail set up as an exchange account, but as I can only have one my other mails are unable to be pushed. I thought Nokia Messaging was used automatically for Nokia Mail? When I configure my accounts, there's only the option
 for 5,10, 15 mins polling etc. There's no longer any "soonest" option. That's on any of the accounts I have set up, using every method possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very frustrating as I came from an E7 which had the mail in perfect sync - feature pack 1 seems to havew broken it, or it's the MS Apps update, as it contained a mail upgrade. Still, I have an Ovi mail account and Nokia cannot push that to my phone?
 Their own mail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two steps forward, one step back as usual. I love the 808, and I can live with the odd crash, but I wish they would release the profile for isync/NMT, and get the mail sorted. Get a bloody notification in the top bar as well Nokia, the lack of mail icon
 is absolutely ridiculous. Whoever took the decision to separate mail from the rest of the Symbian stack should be fired. Probably has been with the cuts mind you. Any solutions welcome, will give them a whirl, as long as they don't involve yet another reset.</p>

            I asked in pureviewclub.com forum and two persons told me they have the email syncing ok. They thought there could be a problem in my phone.<br />
<br />
This morning I made a soft reset without success.<br />
Then I made a hard reset, configuring only contacts (synced with nokia) and email.<br />
The email was syncing ok during two hours.<br />
I was trying if the problem was with any app.<br />
<br />
Then it failed and doesn't sync any more.<br />
I think is a software problem because the facebook widgets sync very well, and every else in the phone works ok...<br />
<br />
Now I am going to the store when I bought the phone to ask for this issue.<br />
Any feedback is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.

<p>No, I have gotten no further. I have set up my GMail account via exchange and it works fine, but I have no option to use Nokia messaging when I set up any other account. Very annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have opened a case with Nokia, but I have heard nothing back.&nbsp;</p>

            The problem remains.<br />
<br />
The gmail account I have configured as automaticaly sync, never syncs, only if I press the sync button.<br />
<br />
<br />
I configured another account with exchange and that account syncs perfectly. The problem is I can not syn email automaticaly, except exchange, and I can only set uo one exchange account.<br />
<br />
I asked for this problem in a forum (pureview.com forum) and others users told me their accounts were syncing troubleless.<br />
Then I think it could be true what Nokia Care staff told me, that there is a problem in the service, and that Nokia Mail is a service and the Nokia mail app doesn't connect with the email account directly, it connects with Nokia servers, and the service is
 not working in some countries.<br />
<br />
Please, solve it soon.<br />
<br />
Also I have a problem with wifi conection, if freezes sometimes and I need to close it to work.

            I'm using BT (yahoo) mail and it worked perfectly on the N8 using "soonest", which as noted above is not available on the 808. However, there is a setting "On notifcation" which I assumed would be equivalent to "soonest". It doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Sync every x minutes does work but that's not push mail which Nokia have advertised as being available for this device. Given the price of this device it's not good enough and that is puting it mildly.

<p>I had thre different calls with a representative about this just after I got the phone, nice guy, but it became apparent very quickly that I knew more about the problem than he did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In effect, they have removed any reason to keep a Nokia Mail account as there's no push service for it, nor will there be by the look of it. A disgrace. Same goes for any account you add via Nokia Messaging. The only reason I was able to keep using a Symbian
 device for work was because I could use the MfE account to sync work and then the Nokia Messaging to push and flag my own mail. Now I can't do either reliably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all sincerity, how can they expect any businessman to use this? No GCal sync either, no mail notification other than unlocking the phone to look at the damn widget. No Wonder Android is a country mile ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. I had a post deleted yesterday so I hope they permit this one to stay.</p>

<p>I don't seem to have any issues with Exchange, seems to be working fine for me. I do have issues with Nokia support.</p>
<p>I've had a 30 minute session on chat which was a waste of time. Soft reset etc. I do agree that we seem to know more about the product than they do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did get a second reply to my original support submission, listed above. This one basically says install Nokia Suite, backup phone, hard re-set and set up mail again. No thanks, that's not going to work. I sent them a very detailed response explaining the
 issues and got another response from them. Exaclty the same as the one before, except from a different CSA. This is the second 808 I've had and it looks like this one could be returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never bought anything other than Nokia phones, and you know what this one has cost. The support is pathetic, the service is worse, its time to look at Android and I don't really want to as I'll miss so many features of Symbian but you can only take
 so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did see your deleted message as I had subscribed. Why on earth would they delete it. Suppose that's easier than facing up to the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edited to add: The service must still be available and working as it works on my N8 so what is going on here. It's about time someone from Nokia&nbsp;with some expertise commented here.</p>

<h2>            How to leave notes and comments on a current page in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using OneNote for MacBook Pro. At the moment, I'm working with some projects, both at university and my own start-up. Thus, I really need to keep track of what my teammates are doing, plus I also want to leave notes as well as comments on what they are
 coming up with. However, I couldn't do it on both online and offline version of Onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any possible solution I can get the feature of taking notes and comments on Onenote, because link my notes page with current project page or section is time consuming, and making another text box next to or below my teammates' work is so messy and
 make us hard to keep track of what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>When using OneNote's math conversion of a handwritten problem my result is displayed in exact, fractional form. I am hoping to be able to have it display my result in decimal form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>The input 45*13=45*8+60x results in an output of x=15/4. I am hoping to have it output as x=3.75.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to see if the input 45.0*13=45*8+60x results in a decimal output and it too outputs a fraction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Novistopub,<br />
<br />
The default math result output for OneNote for Win 10 is fraction. It is not feasible to change it. If you have any concern about that, please click three point button on the top-right corner, then click Settings&gt;Feedback to submit your feedback.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is the best way to improve our products. Appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Neo<br />

<div><span>If you are ONLY using windows live mail (any version) for email and not calendar &amp; contacts you can configure it to work using IMAP/POP.&nbsp; If you do need to sync calendar &amp; contacts ..</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>There is a great replacement for Windows live mail that is free to try (up to 2 accounts) that DOES work with the new outlook mail format called emclient. &nbsp;There is also a paid version. You can get either here</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span><a href="http://www.emclient.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emclient.com/</a></span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>It works with Exchange, POP, IMAP, and looks similar to Windows live mail. &nbsp;Frankly it is the first replacement I have seen that actually works. &nbsp;I have switched.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>They have their own support forums, a decent product, and seem to be the only replacement for WLM that has the look and feel of it.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You can import all your windows live mail into emclient easily by doing a file&gt;import&gt;windows live mail. &nbsp;This will&nbsp;import&nbsp;your current WLM data into emclient</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Out of an abundance of caution I would make a copy of the entire WLM folder and save it to a safe location.</span></div>

    <title>Text Box Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kfr500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text Box Glitch</h2>
                    What is going on with Microsoft's inserting a text box?&nbsp; Everytime I create a new text box, then type in one or two words of text and rotate it slightly, the text inside the box becomes "huge" when printed.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Is this a Microsoft glitch or is
 there a preference I should address.&nbsp; FYI:&nbsp; I've been doing this process for years on my envelopes and after the new update this week, this glitch is happening.&nbsp; Thank you.

                    <p>Does anyone know if Microsoft is close to resolving the issue where an error results in trying to send Emails to a Contact Group? I found the following when researching the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&nbsp;<strong>January 20, 2017: There's a known issue when sending email to a Contact Group results in error "An unexpected error has occurred" being displayed. We're working on fixing this issue. As a workaround, you can click the + icon to expand the Contact

<p>
</p><p>Almost four months later, the error is still there and you still have to expand groups to send Emails.</p>

<p><span>If you have an Office 2010 product already installed in a language other than the one in which you are downloading, please note that your new download
 may open in the previously installed language. For example, if you have Office Professional installed in English, and then you download and install Office Home &amp; Business in Swedish, your Office Home and Business applications will default to open in English.</span></p>

<h2>            I have used Windows Media Player to syncronise music to my Windows phone and suddenly all the Artist and Album information have disapeared&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;HTC 8S and a 32Gb SD card, and I used the Windows Media Player (I have Windows 7 on my PC) to syncronise all my music to my Windows phone. All the Artist and Album information were copied to the phone, including display of all the Album covers. After
 a couple of days all the Artist and Albums information had disapeared&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Phone appart from the Songs list of all the music. The music is still on the phone but only appears on the songs list.&nbsp;This has now happened trwice. The first time I deleted all
 the music from the phone and then syncronised it again using the Windows Media Player. This worked again for a couple of days and then the same happened.</p>
<p>Any Ideas as why???</p>
<p>Any other ways to syncronise music?</p>

    <title>Onedrive not syncing all online files to desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive not syncing all online files to desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have some 2.1GB of data on my Onedrive for Business account. But only about 333MB gets synced to desktop. OneDrive shows that syncing is complete, whereas in reality it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the same result on my laptop and desktop. And surprisingly, it also happens on my completely-unrelated Onedrive personal accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using v18.065.0329.0002, on Windows 10 (version 1803, build 17134.48).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the same issue as:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onedrivefb-mso_winother-mso_o365b/onedrive-not-syncing-files-only-folders/a246c00c-6f92-47eb-8e0c-0991dee4858f</p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've manually checked each folder by tracing unmatching file count and confirm the missing files are in fact settings files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC (the one with more files) have hidden desktop.ini files, whereas my brother's PC (the one with slightly less files) doesn't get those files automatically synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping identify the discrepancy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would like to use the official Feedback App, but it always gives me this error message:#</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To use Windows Feedback, you must be registered with the Windows Insider Preview Program , and connected to the Internet the first time you run the feedback app."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider Hub tells me more or less the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To access the Insider Hub, make sure you’re connected to the Internet and signed in with a Microsoft account that's registered in the Windows Insider Program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am registered and I always log in (with the IE) before I try to use them.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10 Technical Preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the issue description I can understand that you have an issue with using
</span>Feedback App and Insider Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following suggestion and check the issue status.</p>

<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span><strong>Double Click </strong>on the current time on the
<strong>bottom</strong> right hand corner of your screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Then click Change <strong>date and time</strong> settings, then click the
<strong>Change time zone</strong> button</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>Select your <strong>time</strong> zone and tick
<strong>automatically</strong> adjust clock for daylight saving time and press OK</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Then press Apply, and OK<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to Gabriel Aul’s post replied on November 15, 2014 from the following link and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_apps-insider_feedback/build-9879-windows-feedback-app-doesnt-recognize/6fc9b35b-8141-4045-b17a-f53ecd5ca6ae"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_apps-insider_feedback/build-9879-windows-feedback-app-doesnt-recognize/6fc9b35b-8141-4045-b17a-f53ecd5ca6ae</span></a></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>thanks for the answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately&nbsp;none of your suggestions worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time, date and time zone already are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching to local account, then restart, then&nbsp;login as local user, then switch back to Microsoft Account&nbsp;and restart again -&gt; didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't see any other solution in Gabriel Aul's thread other than closing and reopening the app, which was of course the first thing I had tried.</p>

</p><p>Though your steps seem to be for Windows 7 (and maybe 8, I don't own that), I created a new user, logged in and registered it with the insider program.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the result was the same :-(</p>

            To be clear, you need associate your Windows logon user account with your MSA.&nbsp; The MSA you use needs to be the same one you used to register with the Windows Insider Program.&nbsp; If you used a different MSA with Windows logon, the Feedback and Insider Hub

    <title>How do I change section numbers in footer Word2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I change section numbers in footer Word2010</h2>
                    <p>I have a document which I'm trying to auto-number in&nbsp;the footers with Section number and Title.&nbsp; I added two fields to my footer:&nbsp; "Section" and "StyleRef".&nbsp; This works great, giving me a footer like: "Section 2.0 - Title of Section 2" which updates automatically
 as I add new sections.&nbsp; Super-cool!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that my document (a numbered list heirarchy) begins with a cover page and TOC section, before the actual document.&nbsp; This front matter is section 1 per MSWord, so the outlined list which makes up my document copy begins on MSWord's section
 2.&nbsp; As a result, my footer captions are shifted by one:&nbsp; The page which begins with Heading 1.0 shows the number and caption for section 2.0 in the footer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way I can get Word to start caption numbering from zero, or to use field codes for "Section # minus 1"?</p>

            Did you use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;F9&gt; to create the outside braces. They are not manually typed text braces, they are the braces that indicate a field code<br />
<strong>{ = { SECTION } - 1 }</strong><br />
<br />
I had some flakey performance inside the second field code braces. For some reason the calculation wasn't working for me, until "magically" it did.
<br />
<br />
Is the decimal always 0&nbsp; 1.0, 2.0 etc.&nbsp; I couldn't get the formatting to work with the math so I had to hard code the .0.&nbsp; The STYLEREF gets you the text of the heading style. You can define if it displayed the first matching heading if finds from the top of
 the page or the bottom of the page<br />

            Not I know what "just making an OS in PowerPoint" means but ...<br />
<br />
To change the background you need to do two things:<br />
<ol>
<li>Tell it NOT to follow the master</li><li>Tell it what it should do instead</li></ol>
Sub bckG()<br />
With ActivePresentation.Slides(1)<br />
.FollowMasterBackground = False<br />
.Background.Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbRed<br />
End With<br />

                    If I developed the app with Office 32 bit, is there a way for a user to run it using only Office 64 bit? &nbsp;There are some users with 32 bit, and some with 64 bit. &nbsp;

            <p>It not quite clear your problem is affected by x32 or x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A typical Access application should just copy between x32 and x64 without changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted, even with some VBA code and no API code, such an application should transfer and work just fine between x32 and x64 platforms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only exceptions here if you are going to distribute a compiled version – that will not run on either platform -&nbsp; you have to compile to a x64 version if you going to run compiled versions on office x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, no conversion should be required here, unless as noted there is VBA code, and specific api code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would do a compact + repair before any transfer.</p>

<h2>            Bug with cell patterns in Excel 365 Pro plus</h2>
                    <p>I have a file which contains cells that are colored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these cells contains a pattern from Excel: Format cells &gt; Fill &gt; Pattern slyle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I printed this file the cells with the pattern give anonther background color than these without pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the cells were given the same background color and the screen also give the same colors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that the colors that are printed are the opposit RGB values than given on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print give the 'BGR' value :D&nbsp; So red (255,0,0) prints Blue (0,0,255)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue with Excel or is this a bug in my computer (tested on another machine, same problem)?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Matthias,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting on our forum.</p>
<p>I suggest you try printing the file as a PDF to check the result:<br />
1. Open the file.</p>
<p>2. Click File&gt;select Print.</p>
<p>3. Select Microsoft Print to PDF under Printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I suggest you try another printer to check if the color has been changed, I want to confirm if the issue is related to the Printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. The version of Office. (Click File&gt;select Account)</p>
<p>2. Check if all files meet the issue.</p>
<p>3. Try another color to print to check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>Hi Qing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested your suggestions</p>
<p>1) PDF file doesn't have this problem, correct colors with patterns are printed</p>
<p>2) another color has the same problem</p>
<p>3) another computer and printer has the same problem</p>
<p>4) other files has same problem</p>
<p>5) office version 1808 (Build 10730.20262 click to run)</p>

<p>Hi Matthias,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>As you didn’t meet the issue when you print as PDF file, I suggest you save the file as PDF file, then print to check the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I want to confirm the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. Check if you open the file on Excel online, then print it to check the result. It can help use narrow down if the issue is related to Excel client.</p>
<p>2. Can you print it normally before? When did the issue occurred?</p>
<p>3. Which operation have you taken before the issue occurred, such as updating Office?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>Hi Qing</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PDF file give the right result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Excel online the patterns aren't supported I think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because they aren't shown on the screen and I can't customize the cells so they have a pattern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The print of the online Excel gives the right color and also the pattern but not properly. But the colors are still right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We haven't changed anything we know. The computers are from our business which we don't update by ourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The upper part is printed by Excel online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lower part is printed by Excel</p>

<br />
I use the 64 bit browser by default and have configured nearly all my IE icons to use the 64 bit browser, regardless of the title of the icon.&nbsp; When I see a Flash object not working, I copy the web page, open a 32 bit IE browser (I have one Icon which will
 run the 32 bit browser), and paste the link.&nbsp; You will be able to view the Flash object/video in the 32 bit browser.<br />
<br />
In Win7&nbsp;the most&nbsp;certain place to find the 32 bit browser is as follows:&nbsp;click Start, All Programs, then near the top&nbsp;see "Internet Explorer (64 Bit)" and below that "Internet Explorer".&nbsp; The "Internet Explorer" in this location is 32 bit.&nbsp; "Internet Explorer"
 icons &nbsp;in other locations are probably also 32 bit, but since I reconfigured all mine in the other locations I can't be certain what they originally were (32 or 64).

<p>In early 2011, Adobe released a 64-bit version of Flash Player. You can download Flash Player 32-bit and 64-bit or upgrade your current install via the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adobe Flash Player Download Center</a>.</p>
<p>If it's a Win7 64-bit computer, you have two versions of Internet Explorer: IE 32-bit (the default) and IE 64-bit (<em>cannot</em> be the default). Shortcuts to both should be listed in your Start menu.</p>
<p>The executable for IE 32-bit is located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\<strong>Program Files (x86)</strong>\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</p>
<p>The executable for IE 64-bit is located here: </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\<strong>Program Files</strong>\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</p>
<p>See this "sticky" for more details &amp; info about IE 32-bit vs. IE 64-bit on a Win7 64-bit computer:

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vendor set up SP 2013 root collection as team site but should&#39;ve been publishing site for intranet</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We used a vendor to set up our exchange online service as well as set up SharePoint online.</p>
<p>As I have been researching and working on creating a simple custom master page design using oslo.html as the base I was confronted with the fact(?) that I am not able to apply the master page template to our team site root collection.</p>
<p>I can apply the custom master page to a test publishing subsite I created but no matter what I do I can't apply it to the root collection team site.</p>
<p>I have enabled&nbsp;SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure at the site collection feature level as well as at the site feature level.</p>
<p>I have set the custom master page at the Site Master Page Settings and it doesn't use it.</p>
<p>I haven't progressed very far past this point in the configuration of our site because of the limitations of the team site template.</p>
<p>Edit: Our IT department moved their site to SP online from a server and it lives as a subsite of the team site root collection. Would it be possible to recreate the root collection as a publishing site or create a new site collection and move the IT subsite
 to it and then delete the old site? Would this affect active directory and the mysite configuration?</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>I would like to have a quick confirmation first on whether, at Site Settings &gt; Site Master Page Settings, you have set System Master Page to your custom master page. Please specify a system master page if you have not to see the outcome.</p>
<p>In the meantime, could you try configuring another simple master page? We may see if the case is related to the page you are using.</p>
<p>Please post back at convenience and we may discuss teh situation further based on the above.</p>
<p>In addition, yes, it is doable to create a new Team Site site collection or subsite
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-use-site-templates-60371b0f-00e0-4c49-a844-34759ebdd989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
using site templates</a> we have, if this is the case, which has little effect on our AD or My Sites.</p>
<p>When creating a new Site Collection, under Template Selection, choose Custom tab and select "&lt;Select template later...&gt;" to create the site collection &gt; open the team site &gt; upload the template to Solution Gallery.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Rene</p>

<p>Thank you Rene Yu for the quick response. </p>
<p>I set the System Master Page to the custom master page and it applied the changes so I believe customizing the team site is fixed.</p>
<p>If Microsoft makes a significant update to SharePoint and the master pages, will setting the system master page in this way break the update? I am keeping the customization as close as possible to the base oslo.html file to ensure that updates/upgrades go
 smoothly.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,<br />
<br />
SharePoint Online master pages don’t change frequently, and the general GUI changes apply to all master pages. We publish the significant updates in
<a href="http://success.office.com/en-us/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Roadmap</a>, so you can monitor the updates about master pages there.
<br />
<br />
If the updates don’t take effect, please post back in our forum. We will further troubleshoot the issue to see whether it relates to customizations.
<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim<br />

    <title>SharePoint Online news web part on communication &#40;hub&#41; site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kapac  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Online news web part on communication &#40;hub&#41; site displays only one news</h2>
                    <p>I have created a communication site, registered it as a hub site and created communication sites that are associated with this hub site. I would like to show the news from sites on the hub site using a news web part. Each news is created as a copy of existing
 page, that serves as a template. However, no matter which layout I choose for the web part (and I have also selected the news source as sites from the hub site)&nbsp; the news web part displays only one news piece. This seems to be the latest news from the sites
 and a new one from another site always overrides the previous one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a bug in the web part? Or am I doing something wrong in the process? Please advise. Thank you!</p>
<p>

    <title>Footer graphic lines not copying-pasting properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Footer graphic lines not copying-pasting properly</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have a macro that copies the headers and footers from a "base" template into all my other templates.&nbsp; This was working correctly until some changes to the footer and I have not been able to track down why.<br />
<br />
The code basically opens the "source" template and opens the "target" template, goes to the source template, opens the footer and does:<br />
<br />
Selection.WholeStory<br />
Selection.Copy<br />
<br />
Then goes to the target footer and does this:<br />
<br />
With Selection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .WholeStory<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .Paste<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; .Delete (wdCharacter)<br />
End With<br />
<br />
That has worked up until now.&nbsp; The footer contains 2 lines of text and then it has 3 vertical graphic lines and one horizontal graphic line in between the two lines.&nbsp; The only difference in the source template is that they wanted me to change margins and footer
 distance a bit and move the lines a small amount.<br />
<br />
The problem: when I paste the text back into the target document, the text come in fine but the vertical graphic lines are not in the correct place.&nbsp; For each of these, I have them anchored to a paragraph.<br />
<br />
I have looked at a lot of properties but have run out of ideas.<br />
<br />

            <p>Why not do the opposite and set the Range of what is now the Source template to the Range of the Target template and then save the modified "Source" template with a new name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best not to use the Selection is any event; it's always better to use the Range object.</p>

            Hi Doug,<br />
<br />
I can't switch around the documents as they are bound to a document management system and that system "breaks" (and complains!) if you don't stick with the original document.<br />
<br />
As for the range object, can you help me out - what would the code look like to set the range object to the footer as you suggested?<br />
<br />

            Hi Doug,<br />
<br />
Could not figure this out as to why the problem.&nbsp; But found out that if I inserted a blank paragraph at the beginning of the footer and then realigned everything, the problem went away.&nbsp; I figure it had something to do with the graphic lines being anchored
 to the first paragraph.<br />
<br />
Not really a solution but at least I got it going.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>Administrator privileges in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Administrator privileges in Outlook</h2>
                    I'm having trouble using apple icloud with outlook 2007. The icloud app is disabled and when I try to 'enable' it, the message says I need administrator authority. &nbsp;I am the only user on the computer and am listed as administrator in the user folder. &nbsp;How
 do I fix this so I can enable the icloud app? &nbsp;It worked well for several months but I must have deleted a file erroneously.

<p>It would be best if you could provide more details.</p>
<p>Are you trying to enable icloud from within Outlook or from the icloud App?</p>
<p>If you are enabling it from Outlook, then restart Outlook in administrator mode following these steps and check if you can enable it:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Quit Outlook.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to: </span><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office 12\</span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Windows is installed as 64 bit version, then navigate to:
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Outlook.exe</span><span> icon and click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run as Administrator.</span></li><li><span>Now try to enable icloud and check if it works.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
