<h2>            Outlook 2013 spellcheck dictionary won&#39;t add words</h2>
                    When I send an email and run spellcheck, it will catch the misspelled or new words it doesn't recognize. &nbsp;However, I don't have the option to "add" the word to the dictionary. &nbsp;Each time I type a very common word, i.e., my wife's name (unique spelling),
 I have to tell it to "ignore" rather than "add".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can see the button to "add", but it's greyed out where I can't select it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else encountered? &nbsp;How can I fix this?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just figured it out.&nbsp;We need to change default dictionary where we can add our own words.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In Menu go to <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>Mail &gt;&nbsp;Spelling and Autocorrect &gt; Proofing
</strong>&gt; <strong>Custom Dictionaries</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>First check Solution 1:</strong></p>
<p>Here&nbsp;check if&nbsp;default dictionary is CUSTOM.DIC&nbsp;or not. If it is not then make CUSTOM.DIC as default. Save and now check. It should be back.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2:</strong><br />
Still if above is either not working or your default dictionary is already CUSTOM.DIC, then in the same screen (near the bottom) check the default dictionary language and match it with your System Default Language. In my case, the first option didn't work as
 CUSTOM.DIC was already selected. But my System default language was ENGLISH (US) and my dictionary default language was ENGLISH (UK). Switching it back to English (US) did the trick for me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Why All The Hassle About Verifying My Email Before I Can Have Full - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t.18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why All The Hassle About Verifying My Email Before I Can Have Full Access When It&#39;s already Linked To and Is On My Tablet&#63;</h2>
                    I've already verified my email at sign-up last week with several security questions and an alternate email addy. No one alive knows those answers but me. Why is this not good enough for Microsoft? I've also put this email on my BlackBerry tablet and that's
 still not good enough! Now you need to have my cell number in order for me to have full access to my account? &nbsp;What is it about you companies that you're not satisfied until you've gleaned every piece of personal info about us that you can? I'm tired of having
 my privacy invaded! I am currently, in the process of, deleting email accounts that I've had with the Big G for seven (7) or more years because they, all of a sudden, have to have my cell to verify my accounts and now here you go! How is a cell number more
 secure? &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the age of technology! Nothing is too secure for long! I've only been hacked once with AO_ and that was because I was on someone's contact list that was compromised and the virus/trojan &nbsp;was the kind that forwarded to all email contacts but they
 just wasted their time because nothing of importance was left in there and it couldn't be forwarded to anyone. I've never trusted technology because I've known some very intelligent, if not brilliant, ppl and I'm pretty good at figuring out technical things
 myself. Have you never heard of _ _gic _ _ _ _hack or cloned phones or burner phones? I and ppl I know have already had the displeasure of being a victim to these tactics so how is this more secure? I keep my info the old fashioned way mostly now. I don't
 keep contact or other important info in my phone, email, tablet, laptop or PC. I immediately delete and clean them of everything I can after saving to a flash drive to print later so as not to jeapordize &nbsp;myself or anyone else. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What if I move or have to change my number for any reason and forget that I needed to notify you? I was once banned from my ex &nbsp;_ _ _oo account because I'd had it for about a decade and because of family, &nbsp;marriage, work and a concussion, I had moved several
 times, had partial memory loss and I just couldn't remember the exact info that I used to sign up and (at that time) they refused to send a verification email to my alternate address like other providers were already doing. One of the few things I did remember,
 hence, the ex part! I apologize if I sound too...whatever but I just had to go through this with the big G and now you too? By the way, I verified my mobile outlook address last week by signing in from my tablet as requested and it still is not working correctly.
 Why doesn't it sync properly to show changes I made to my account online or aliases etc. and I'm still having trouble sending email? Is that part of the stuff I'm not allowed to access without giving you my cell?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I am so sick of this I can hardly stand it!!!&nbsp; For months now, when I log into my email, I have to verify this and confirm that.&nbsp; I have one email address but now it has forced me to link my work email for security.&nbsp; So, when I am at home, and this bs happens
 I simply cannot log in because I do not have access to my work email at home.&nbsp; it is so ridiculous I want to delete the account,

            Totally agree. Twice this year I've tried to check my email while on vacation and been denied access without having a security code texted to my cell phone. No way in hell I'm giving them my cell phone number, so couldn't get into my email. Looking for
 an alternate email provider now. I've had it with Microsoft!

                    I'm on "Skip Ahead To Next Windows Release" insider 18219_prerelease, so as on build 17741 is released for "Active Development Windows" insiders. They got build with 1809 but I'm on 1803, I think I should be on higher version. Correct me if I'm wrong.

<p>Nothing to worry about. They have not updated the number in skippy yet. That will come down the road. I believe they just changed the number in Fast builds just recently. As long as you are showing Build 18219 in the bottom right corner you are good.
</p>

            1903.&nbsp; 19H1 is just the codename, replacing the use of "cute" words like ski resorts (Whistler for XP, Longhorn for Vista, etc.) and mythical materials from games (Redstone comes from Minecraft).&nbsp; The released versions will still use the year-month combo.

<p>Thanks Colin. Glad you are here, I am having an issue clean installing on a HP Stream Tablet. Seems I can only install within windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the device to boot to the installation screen, but then have no touch, mouse or anything support. I tried using DISM and installed the inf file for touch to the boot.wim file, and still no go. Problem is, there is only one usb-c plug, and that
 is being tied up with a flash card plugged into a OTG cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to go about this. This is all new territory for me.</p>

<p>TRx (Threshold) and RSx (Redstone) are always been MS internal code names for development branches and Year + month combo has been version number for released versions..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That year + month will be replaced with that 19H1, so new releases are not so tightly bound to any month. 1st half of the year give wide time range so that there is no such mess like is was with 1803, April Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next released versions will be 1809, 19H1, 19H2 ...</p>

<p>Some time ago the team commented that MSFT was ending the use of "cute" codenames in favor of more businesslike codenames.&nbsp; "19H1" is a codename but in the new style.&nbsp;<span> The codenames are still used because the release dates are not determined
 officially until late in the cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall the team saying that versioning was changing.&nbsp; Of course, they can do whatever they want but so far I think the year/month is still on for versioning.<br />

            If you are talking about your Skype account, you can use anywhere in the world as long as you have internet connection. You can install Skype on the new PC, login with the same ID/Password combination which you have used on Android phone and start using Skype.
<br />
<br />You can download Skype from following location (For Win 10, this must already be installed, hence no need to download)

            You can use it on any device. Skype is not tied to the device. It is tied to your Skype ID. You can use it on any device whether it is Android, PC, Mac, iOS....You can have simultaneous installations also and use anywhere. 
<br />
<br />I have installed it on my Android, PC and iPad and use wherever I want.

    <title>File extension disappears when saving PDFs from Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File extension disappears when saving PDFs from Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. I have a curious problem with Outlook 2016 for Mac:</p>
<p>When I receive a scanned PDF document in the inbox, it shows up correctly as an attachment with a .pdf file extension. When I right click on the attachment and save it to a local folder on the Mac, the .pdf file extension disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the Mac to recognize the newly saved attachment as a PDF file, I must rename the local file and manually supply the file extension. &nbsp;Until I do that, the usual "Unix executable file" seems to be the file type. Other file types can be saved fine, i.e.
 the file extensions are kept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PDF extension on this Mac is "owned" by Adobe Reader, not Preview. Outlook 2016 was installed via an Office 365 Business Premium subscription. There are no active add-ins in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seen this?</p>

<p>Hi Dynamic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand your situation, I'd like to collect some information as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Can all of PDF documents or
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">scanned</span><span> PDF documents not be saved to a local folder with the file extension?
</span></li><li><span>Can this file be opened correctly before you supply the file extension manually?</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, I will send you a test PDF file via the
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list/"><span>private message</span></a><span> , please check if the issue persists. Moreover, please provide us the detailed Outlook for Mac
 version like 15.34(170515) and the Mac OS like</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Sierra</span><span> 10.12.5.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>Outlook version is 15.30 (170107) on OS X 10.11.6.</p>
<p>I did some more testing and found the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select "Save as ..." on an Outlook attachment and <strong>check</strong> the "Hide extension" checkmark in Outlook "Save as ..." dialogue box, the file extension isn't actually hidden, it's outright removed. Afterwards, OS X does not recognize the
 file type until you manually give it the .pdf extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you <strong>uncheck</strong> "Hide extension", the entire file name is preselected in the File Name field, making it very easy to inadvertently remove the file extension when you give the file a new name. You typically do this when PDF files comes by
 mail from the on site MFP scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you reproduce the situation wrt hide/show file extension in the save as dialogue box Rudy?</p>

<p>Hi Dynamic,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test, when I
can</span> get the PDF file with the .pdf file extension and I can open it correctly. When I
can</span> get the PDF file with the .pdf file extension, no need to supply the extension manually. Even though, I remove the file extension when I give the file a new name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since filename extensions are always hidden in Mac OS X. So, please go to Finder &gt; Preferences, then click Advanced &gt; select&nbsp; Show all filename extensions. After doing it, please check if the issue
 persists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further analysis, I'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Except the PDF files comes by mail from the MFP scanner, Do other PDF files have this issue?
</span></li><li><span>Can you update the Outlook for Mac and Mac OS version to check if the issue persists? Since the older version may not get the best practice.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hello again, and thanks for your replies and testing.</p>
<p>I will do some more testing on my end to see whether there's any logical discrepancies between Outlook's "Hide extension" and Finder's extension handling. When I do your tests I get the same results, so I suspect the client is simply confused (the problem
 is on a client's Mac, not mine).</p>

<p>Hello again Rudy. I got the chance to do some more testing. Here's what I found. Client is using Outlook 2016 for mac v15.35 (170610). Finder is set to NEVER show file extensions. Outlook is set to always hide file extensions. Mac has El Capitan.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>User scans a document on the MFP and sends it to herself by mail. Document arrives as a PDF file.</li><li>User selects the PDF attachment and "Save as ..."</li><li>The entire file name and file extension is subsequently preselected in the save dialogue box, regardless of the setting of "Hide file extension". I.e. the file extension is always shown and preselcted.</li><li>Here's where it breaks down: user types a new file name, thereby overwriting the file extension in the process. PDF document is saved to the local file system, usually a OneDrive folder.</li><li>The PDF file is recognised as a PDF file on the local file system, despite the missing file extension (as it should)</li><li>The PDF document is not recognised as a PDF document on other computers (Macs or PCs) connected to the same OneDrive account, because the file extension has disappeared.</li><li>The PDF document is not recognised as a PDF file when sent to someone by mail because the file extension has disappeared.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that Outlook 2016 behaves in an unexpected way. When you rename a file in Finder, the file extension is never preselected, thus the file extension can't easily disappear. In Outlook's "save as" dialogue box, the entire file name is preselceted,
 and the "Hide file extension" checkbox does not actually hide the file extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short it's technically a user error, but Outlook 2016 for mac isn't exactly helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you verify that you see the same?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You time is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Avoid page break between a heading and a two-column section - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Avoid page break between a heading and a two-column section</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to create a document with a heading paragraph followed immediately by a two-column section but I can't get Word to stick the heading to the content: page break occurs between the heading and the content section although I used a continuous section
 break and the heading paragraph is set to "Keep with next":<br />
<a href="http://hfr-rehost.net/fullsize/http://self/pic/7ec860d4d08dd7354d9d5925c2921db95874a98d.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fhfr-rehost.net%2fpreview%2fhttp%3a%2f%2fself%2fpic%2f7ec860d4d08dd7354d9d5925c2921db95874a98d.png" /></a></p>
<p>I tried another way putting the heading inside the two-column section. Page break is OK but it looks so bad (table columns are not aligned on top):<a href="http://hfr-rehost.net/preview/http://self/pic/5503993d9111fd0ced730a89139721fd75a20535.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fhfr-rehost.net%2fpreview%2fhttp%3a%2f%2fself%2fpic%2f5503993d9111fd0ced730a89139721fd75a20535.png" /></a></p>
<p>Is there a way two have the heading on the same page that the content below it and having columns titles aligned?</p>
<p>Sorry about my English since it is not my primary language.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<div>I've looked at your document, and, in the example, I think you have no </div>
<div>choice but to format the heading as "Page break before." Nothing less than </div>
<div>that will make it move to the next page, and it is clear that neither the </div>
<div>table nor any part of it, because of the way you have cells merged, will fit</div>
<div>on the page after the heading.</div>

<div>&gt; Thanks for answering folks!</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Too bad it doesn't work across a continuous section break...</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; The whole table doesn't fit on the end of the table. Actually, Word is </div>
<div>&gt; right to insert a page break here, I would just want it to send the </div>
<div>&gt; heading on the next page as well.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; If I delete one "Blah" line above, the first super-line (I grouped </div>
<div>&gt; continent lines together) of the table is displayed on the bottom of the </div>
<div>&gt; page:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; What I was excepting is to actually have the page break but for it to </div>
<div>&gt; occur before the heading.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; I guess since the "Keep with next" doesn't work across a section break, </div>
<div>&gt; the is no solution about it... Or maybe there is?</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; It is not a big deal but I like my documents to be neat and it kind of </div>
<div>&gt; bothers me.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Here is a link to the mention document, maybe someone could figure </div>
<div>&gt; something out:Two-column_tables_and_page_break.doc (74KB, will stay online</div>
<div>&gt; for a month or so)</div>

<h2>            Apps not updatingon Microsoft Lumia 950</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Lumia 950 running Windows 10..&nbsp; In the past two months, I have had 3 or 4 apps that would not update.&nbsp; They would attempt to, then pop up an error code 0X80070019.&nbsp; I finally deleted the apps entirely, and reinstalled.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, now the same thing has occurred with the Xbox app, and the Phone app.&nbsp; These apps (to my knowledge) cant be deleted.&nbsp; Any suggestions or is anyone else experiencing this issue?</p>

<h2>            Arranging favorites NOT in alphabetical order</h2>
                    I have always arranged my favorites in the order of importance to me.&nbsp; Yesterday they all appeared in alphabetical order.&nbsp; If I try to move them in the order they go back to alphabetical order.&nbsp; This is especially annoying in the Favorites bar.&nbsp; If I right
 click on an icon in my favorites I have the option of arranging them in Sort by name but no option to just move them where I want them.&nbsp; I do not have that menu on my favorites bar.&nbsp; This just started.&nbsp; in the past I could move any favorite to the position
 I wanted and it would stay there.

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I think the best solution depends on your definition of a "blank cell".</p>
<p>Is the blank cell an empty cell, a cell that contains nothing at all, no formulas, no nothing,&nbsp;or is the blank cell a cell that appears empty but might contain a formula that returns a formula blank (="")?</p>
<p>Also, what type of data will these cells contain?</p>
<ul>
<li>text </li><li>numbers </li><li>dates </li><li>times </li><li>errors </li><li>any of the above </li></ul>
<p>This formula will evaluate empty cells and cells that contain formula blanks as being the same.</p>
<p>=IF(SUMPRODUCT(--(C42:C47="")),"Blank","All Filled")</p>

Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> &gt; <strong>More</strong><strong> info</strong>.</li><li>When did the issue start?</li><li>What other troubleshooting steps you've tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try the steps below to help you turn on or off data roaming:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Swipe left on the start screen.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong>Cellular+SIM</strong>.</li><li>Tick <strong>Data</strong> <strong>roaming</strong> options.</li><li>Choose either <strong>Roam</strong> or <strong>Don't</strong> <strong>roam</strong>.</li><li>Then, restart your phone to refresh it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Think this problem in Nokia 5230 is due to wma files.Just&nbsp;backup&nbsp;n delete the wma files from memory card and try, it should work fine.&nbsp;BTW&nbsp;it was working fine till the last software update.After updating to v20.0.005 only prob came up.In fact there is problem

            Try to restart the phone by pressing both the power and volume down keys for 10 seconds, if the issue persists I recommend resetting the phone by going to Settings&gt;About&gt;Reset my phone.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I just did a soft reboot + installed the newest build .420 + did a hard reset earlier this week and still no cortana reading / alerting me to a text message. Looked into the Settings for phone, cortana, messaging and found no option
 for cortana to read texts, interesting when I asked cortana to read my text messages I get a browser window with links to " read text messages online. or text message apps etc." Brad</p>

                    Is there a way to adjust the vibration intensity!? Im on a Lumia 720. When Receiving calls it only vibrates once and then it only rings. I work with a lot of noise and I don't hear the phone ring. I need it to vibrate all the time. Thanks

            I have a similar problem, the PC signs on to "Other account", even though this account has been deleted. So that requires me to switch user account to my real MS-account at each startup. Very annoying.

            I had a similar issue with that build. When booting it would bring up the other user account that did not show in user management. Very odd. Sometimes it was there and sometimes not. I had many issues so I deleted that and installed 9926 64bit and that's
 working great. I am running in Virtual Box.

            Right now I have 2 installs. One with a MS log in and one local. The MS log in goes smoothly and logs in under my user name as it should. The local account on the other hand shows that it is logging into "Other User" during the log in screen but comes
 up with my log in name when it's done. There is no "Other User" account on either install.

<h2>            Outlook displaying shared calendars cut off</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally when opening a users shared calendar Outlook will cut off and display the calendar is the wrong location. This issue is happening on several of our users computers. The only way we found to correct it is to uncheck the calendar and check it
 again. Then the calendar typically displays correct, and the next time I view this or any calendar it may or may not happen. I'm expecting that this is a bug as its been happening for several weeks now. First on my system and now more users are reporting the
 issue. Office version 1808 build 10730.20264</p>

            It seems like the graphics driver may have fixed it. At the moment I cannot replicate the issue with the updated driver.<br />

            Found it (trial and error): insert a non-breaking space into the custom footnote area, and the fn will be marked by an invisible space in the text and by nothing in the fn. area.

<p><span>Have you enabled “Start recording user and admin activity” on the Audit log search page? If you have just done this, please wait for a couple of hours to let it complete the preparation for you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also note that it takes up to 15 minutes after an event occurs in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business for the corresponding audit log entry to be displayed. And it takes up to 12 hours for events in Exchange Online and Azure Active

            <p><span>Hi LinhNguyen Nhu,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you performed some actions in a site collection library? If you delete some files, then define some specific search criteria like Deleted file and Modified file to try again?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To check if the issue is limited to a specific account, could you try another global admin account to see the outcome if it is feasible in your environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you do the following.<br />
</span><span>1. Check if the Audit Log is enabled.<br />
</span><span>a. Connect to Exchange Online via the steps in </span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</a><span>.<br />
</span><span>b. Run </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">get-adminauditlogconfig&nbsp;to check the outcome and give us a screenshot showing the PowerShell page.<br />
</span><span>To upload a screenshot, click <strong>Reply</strong> and then click <strong>
Insert image</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If it is not enabled successfully, run </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">set-adminauditlogconfig -unifiedauditlogingestionenabled $true</span> to enable it and wait a couple of hours to check the result.<br />
<span>2. If the Audit Log is enabled, run </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">set-adminauditlogconfig -unifiedauditlogingestionenabled $false to disable it and re-enable it by running</span><strong>
</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">set-adminauditlogconfig -unifiedauditlogingestionenabled $true</span> to see the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know your updates at your convenience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

            <p>Hi LinhNguyen,<br />
<br />
Thanks for updates. <br />
<br />
Can you check if entering a user in Users section in Audit log search can generate any records? Also run the following commands in your tenant to check if you can get any audit logs via PowerShell.<br />
</p>
<p>Steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Refer to this article to install/update PowerShell and connect to Exchange Online PowerShell.<br />
Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell:<br />
<br />
<strong>$UserCredential = Get-Credential</strong><br />
<strong>$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection</strong><br />
<strong>Import-PSSession $Session</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
A.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You need to install the Microsoft.NET Framework 4.5 or later and then either the Windows Management Framework 3.0 or the Windows Management Framework 4.0.<br />
B.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use <strong>Remove-PSSession $Session</strong> to disconnect the session after the test.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Run the following command to see if you can get audit logs. (Refer to this article)<br />
<br />
# searches the unified audit log for all events from June 17, 2016 to June 25, 2016<br />
<strong>Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 6/17/2016 -EndDate 6/25/2016 -SessionId "UnifiedAuditLogSearch 06/29/16" -SessionCommand ReturnNextPreviewPage</strong><br />
<br />
# searches the unified audit log for any files accessed in SharePoint Online from June 17, 2016 to June 25, 2016<br />
<strong>Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 6/17/2016 -EndDate 6/25/2016 -RecordType SharePointFileOperation -Operations FileAccessed -SessionId "WordDocs_SharepointViews" -SessionCommand ReturnNextPreviewPage</strong><br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan<br />

<h2>            Protected View splits the page and makes it look weird</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a one pager that I intend to send to people, it looks great when in normal view, but in protected view the document splits into 2 pages instead of 1, and some of the content looks bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, people I send this to will most likely view it in protected view, so I must solve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to keep the document as 1 unsplit page in protected view?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<br />
I think so far the best av for windows mobile is Airscanner Mobile, F-Secure Mobile...<br />
<br />
HTC has yet to announce the upgrade for Cruise user, so just have to wait...<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

            I have done all the updates - and i have skimmed all the older references - my system has been running perfectly for some time - none of the solutions in the above link solved the problem -
<div><br />
<div>i also tried moving the note book locations and that didn't work - eventually was able to get sync back to original skydrive account - we'll see if everything holds up and once stabilized - will troubleshoot more</div>

    <title>Why does IE 8 hang so much&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian kitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does IE 8 hang so much&#63;</h2>
                    I was forced to upgrade to IE 8, because I'm a developer, and I need to be on IE 8 to support users that upgrade.&nbsp; I cannot possibly express in words how disgusted I am with IE 8.&nbsp; It hangs CONSTANTLY.&nbsp; I simply close it, re-open it, and it works.&nbsp; As
 a developer, this is maddening, because of the known problem in VS 2008, where you can only debug 4 times before you have to close and reopen VS 2008.&nbsp; What is going on here.&nbsp; I keep hoping for a fix, but so far, I have not seen a fix for this.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's NOT me.&nbsp; I see people all over the place complaining about how much IE 8 hangs. Does Microsoft test anymore?&nbsp; Over the last 3 years, the quality of software from Microsoft has taken a HUGE nose dive.&nbsp; Office 2007, Vista, VS 2008, and IE 8.&nbsp; All
 4 of these are by far, the worst in their category that Microsoft has ever released.&nbsp; I am very frustrated that Microsoft cannot test more.

            Sorry, none of the above.<br />
<br />
#) I've used Microsoft software long enough to know that you should never change default settings, because then you are on your own, so I don't do that.<br />
#) I've used Microsoft software long enough to know that you don't do plugins that are non Micrsoft, again, for the reason above.<br />
#)&nbsp;I never had this problem with IE7.&nbsp; I just recently put in IE8, and it hangs maybe every 4 or 5 times I bring it up.&nbsp; I only just recently rebuilt my machine to Vista Ultimate POS.&nbsp;<br />
#) I've been a developer for almost 20 years, and to this day, have never had a virus infection.&nbsp; I'm careful, and I always keep anti-virus/anti-spyware active.<br />
#) I normally don't like to keep bleeding edge, because that makes me bleed too much.&nbsp; However, in an effort to fight this problem, I've made sure I am completely current, to no avail.<br />
<br />
There appears to be something that I.E. is doing at startup.&nbsp; I don't know if it's calling home, or what, but it's doing something at startup, where I just get a white page, and no response, EVER.&nbsp; I've let it sit for 20 minutes in the past, and&nbsp;not gotten
 a response.<br />
<br />
I simply close it, reopen it, and it works fine.&nbsp; Nothing is ever reported on the 'windows problems' database, or event log that I can see.<br />
<br />
This is VERY VERY frustrating.&nbsp; I was already frustrated with how poor quality Office 2007 (the stupid connecting printer bug specifically), Vista (all the slowness and hangups) and VS 2008 (tons and tons of bugs).&nbsp; Now I add IE 8 to it, and just get more and
 more frustrated.&nbsp; All I can say, is Microsoft is truly doing everything they can to support competitor software, by taking themselves out of any serious competitive stance.

            I did not try to uninstall, and reinstall, but I will try that today.<br />
<br />
I develop on&nbsp;3 different machines.&nbsp; One XP,&nbsp;two Vista machines.&nbsp; These are not virtual machines, but real machines.&nbsp; I have the same exact problem on all 3.&nbsp; I suppose it's technically possible that I could have somehow had the install fail on all 3 without
 giving any warning on all 3, but since I know of so many other people complaining of the same issue, the common denominator appears to be that IE 8 is just having major issues at start up.&nbsp; It's doing something at startup, that is causing it to frequently
 hang at exactly the same point.&nbsp; Always just giving me a white screen, and locking up my machine.<br />
<br />
Once I'm in it, it's not so bad.&nbsp; But as a web developer, I'm starting and stopping IE sometimes 40 or 50 times a day.&nbsp; When it hangs every 3 or 4 times I start it, that means that I get it hanging 10 or so times per day.&nbsp; So you can see why it is so frustrating.&nbsp;
 IE 7 never did this.&nbsp; For what it's worth, rebooting my machine does help.&nbsp;I've noticed that after it hangs about 5 or&nbsp;6 times, then it starts to hang maybe every other time, rather than every 4 times.&nbsp; So I'll reboot, and then I get back to it hanging every
 3 or 4 times, rather than every other time.&nbsp; So whatever the problem is, it appears to be an accumulative problem.<br />
<br />
I will uninstall and reinstall later today, but I have to be honest.&nbsp; I have more faith that I'll walk to the local Kwik Shop and buy the winning lottery ticket, than I do that uninstall and reinstall will make any difference.&nbsp; I just can't imagine how I could
 have had the install fail on 3 different machines (with no errors), and somehow, uninstall and reinstall will make it right on all 3 machines.

            Brian Kitt, <br />
Do you have any common software running on all 3 of your machines? especially anything with high ram usage or scans?<br />
What happens if you set your homepage to blank, does this alleviate the issue?<br />
<br />
If you open Internet Explorer 8 in several windows without first working in them (building memory usage), do they still hang? or is this only occurring when you work on your browser in sessions?<br />
<br />
Does this occur if you open multiple sessions of the IE with no add-ons? is there any noticeable performance&nbsp;difference with them?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would like you to go ahead and test your Internet Explorer 8 in a clean boot environment:<br />

            I uninstalled, and re-installed IE 8 on my main developement machine last night.&nbsp; It made no difference.<br />
That machine is a Toshiba Satellite X205-S7483, upgraded to 4GB, upgrade to Windows Vista Ultimate 32 bit&nbsp;(I have MSDN).<br />
This is strictly a development machine, that I rarely use on the internet.&nbsp; I do use IE 8 constantly, because I do internet development.<br />
For the most part, I have only MS software, and a few various utilities for doing development.&nbsp; No games, no music, no pirate software, no P2P.<br />
Adobe Reader 9.1<br />
avast! Antivurs<br />
BlackBerry Desktop Software 4.3<br />
VS 2008 (full install, all components)<br />
Office 2007 (full install, all components)<br />
SQL 2008 (full install, all components)<br />
SpyBot<br />
<br />
a few other misc software, but these are the big ones.<br />
<br />
I will do the clean boot tonight and see what happens.

            I did a clean boot, but it still hangs every 3 or 4 times I go into it.&nbsp; I then just click the red x, and start over.&nbsp; It always works the next time.<br />
<br />
I've talked to more technicians about this in the last couple of days.&nbsp; A LOT of people are experiencing this and they just live with it.&nbsp; Truth be told, Windows Vista&nbsp;has people so used to&nbsp;waiting, that people are just living with the hanging problems.&nbsp; Personally,
 I think this is a really sad commentary on Microsoft that the software is getting so bad, that people just expect to have a lot of hanging and waiting problems, and they live with them.&nbsp; I am encouraging people to report these problems.&nbsp; I hope that if enough
 people report the problems, Microsoft will realize that it is not acceptable to have software that is this slow.&nbsp; It's amazing that I can be on a 2+ GHZ machine with 4 GB of RAM, and still have frequent hanging problems with software.&nbsp;

 I start IE after the PC is idle for long enough to invoke monitor shutdown, IE8 is hung.&nbsp; I close with the X, then it starts like usual on another icon click.&nbsp; I haven't tried to kill and restart it to count how many fails vs. opens I get, but sheeesh!&nbsp;&nbsp; I

Same here in HONG KONG using XP Professional SP3 and IE8..... It keeps hanging..... my ctrl-alt-del is wearing out of color.<br />

I guess EVERYBODY including those guys in MICROSOFT knows about this and also complaining about their IE8... I strongly believe that MS already received tons of error report on IE8, but to the benefit of the company of course they&nbsp;do not dare to&nbsp;speak a word
 of it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It does not matter what the hardware config.&nbsp;or Windows version you have, I even tried to view all websites&nbsp;in compatability view, hoping that will use the IE7 engine - no luck at all. The problem did not happen on IE7, the IE8 team did a great job to screw
 up their internet browser product family.<br />
<br />
sigh..... it reminds me the days of IE 3.0

            Well luckily if it's that widespread, hopefully one of those "important update"'s to Internet Explorer will come unassumingly along and get installed without any fanfare and the problem will&nbsp;inexplicably vanish...
