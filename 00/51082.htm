    <title>Remote desktop connection failed but ping successful - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote desktop connection failed but ping successful</h2>
                    I am trying to connect via RDC (Remote Desktop Connection) from SOURCE to DESTINATION.<br />
<br />
I allowed remote connections on DESTINATION and added couple of users who are allowed to connect remotely.<br />
I can ping DESTINATION successfully from SOURCE.<br />
<br />
None of the responses were failed for the command below from SOURCE<br />
C:\&gt; ping -l 512 -f -n 100 &lt;DESTINATION&gt;<br />
<br />
Strange thing is I can remote login from DESTINATION to SOURCE but not the other way.<br />
<br />
I do not remember doing any more settings to other machines that are being connected remotely. Only one(this DESTINATION) machine has the issue.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts are appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Bhachi.<br />

            On the target machine, make sure that Port 3389 is not being blocked by a firewall.&nbsp; If you are using Windows Firewall, go to the Windows Firewall control panel, verify that "Don't Allow Exceptions" is not checked under the "General" tab, then click on
 the "Exceptions" tab and make sure there is a checkmark beside "Remote Desktop".<br />
<br />
You can also make sure that a program is running to accept incoming remote desktop connections by bringing up a command prompt (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and entering the following command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; netstat&nbsp;&nbsp; -an&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find &nbsp; "3389"<br />
If all is well, you should see the following line returned:<br />

<h2>            upgrading a Windows XP home version to Windows 7 or 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a very limited need. &nbsp;I have a Windows XP Home system which, up to now, has worked very well for me. However, I have run into a problem in downloading a new Bankruptcy Software program; and, the representative tells me that their program can't come
 into XP - that I need Windows 7 or above. He says that if I upgrade to Windows 7, then my computer can accept the Bankruptcy Software. I need the software to process bankruptcy petitions and I don't want to hunt for another provider if I can help it. Can I
 upgrade to Windows 7 and, if so, what are the ramifications and how much would it cost?</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; There is no "direct upgrade" from Windows XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; You would have to do a "clean install," which would require you to back up all of your data files to external media and then restore those files after Windows 7 was installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you would have to install all of your application programs, including the "Bankruptcy Software," from original installation media (e.g., CDs, DVDs, or downloaded installer files).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would also have to install Windows 7 drivers for the various bits of hardware in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; There are 2 complicating factors to doing the above:&nbsp; your existing computer may or may not work with Windows 7 (e.g., there may not be Windows 7 drivers for some of your computer's hardware) and it has become quite difficult to find a copy of Windows
 7 from a legitimate source.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft stopped selling Windows 7 on October 31, 2013.&nbsp; Although you may find Windows 7 for sale from online vendors, there is an increasing chance that any copy you purchase will be counterfeit and fail immediately to activate or -- worse -- apparently
 activate only to fail some months later.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if if you purchase from a seemingly reputable source such as Amazon, you may end up with counterfeit software, as some of the reviews here suggest --&gt;
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Professional-System-Builder-Packaging/product-reviews/B00H09BOXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&amp;filterByStar=one_star&amp;showViewpoints=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Professional-System-Builder-Packaging/product-reviews/B00H09BOXQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&amp;filterByStar=one_star&amp;showViewpoints=0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Other than the issue of purchasing potentially counterfeit software, moving to Windows 10 raises all of the same problems as moving to Windows 7.&nbsp; If I were you, I would ask your software vendor if the current version of the Bankruptcy Software is compatible
 with Windows 10.&nbsp; Assuming that it is, I suggest purchasing a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed and then installing the software on the new computer.</p>

<p>Since, this is a Windows 7 x64 Professional system, I am hoping it's not because the log file is full - because I'm unaware of how to clean it and the log file size shouldn't (in theory) be limited to the 32-bit word-length maximum.</p>
<p>Any ideas why I would be getting a "corrupt drive" error/dirty bit flag, when the drive passes the chkdsk test(s)?<br />
How can I manually reset the dirty bit flag, if chkdsk is not resetting the flag?</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;NOTE: Please don't suggest using the install disk, as this is how I have already run chkdsk, and got the returned results, above.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />

 other security program and any third-party firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> Ensure to enable the antivirus software, security
 program and firewall after successful installation. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c. Insert the Windows 7 installation DVD onto the DVD drive.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Photoshop Elements 8 to run in win7</h2>
                    
<p>I have installed (tried) Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 on my Dell studio Laptop which has recently been upgraded to win7.</p>
<p>I have contacted Adobe support and their solutions so far have not worked, eg try installing in windows simplified mode.</p>
<p>Does anyone please have any idea how to solve this problem</p>

<p>I had that problem, and for two days I was unable to solve it.&nbsp; So I upgraded to 7pro thinking I would be able to run PSE8 in XP mode.&nbsp; But then I found the solution to the problem.&nbsp;<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/408/kb408850.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/408/kb408850.html</a>
 I changed the file name from twain to ~twain, and it works.</p>

<p>So what was it that they stumbled on as the solution?&nbsp; I have a new machine with windows 7 64bit and when I load PSE 8 I start it and the first screen shows me two choices "organizer" and "edit"&nbsp; I click on editor and the hour glass starts and then when
 I close the first screen expecting&nbsp; to see the Editor there is just a flash like the editor started and then quickly closes.&nbsp; I have PSE 8 on two other machines. One with windows 7 32 bit and XP Pro.&nbsp; They both work just fine.&nbsp; Do I need to dual the XP think
 under windows 7 to run or is this a 64 bit problem.&nbsp; I built this new machine with a i5 750 processor and 8 gig or ram so I can run some of these Adobe products faster....they are really slow in XP and the Windows 7 32 bit machine is a laptop with limited
 ram.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get this to work?&nbsp; I am getting CS5 Web Premium and do not want to have the same problem.&nbsp; I set myself up as administrator on this machine and it does not make any difference.</p>

<h2>            clean install of windows XP input signal out of range</h2>
                    Hi I recently took out my old xp pc out of the dusty cupboard.<br />
I found out that the os was corrupt so decided to do a clean install of windows xp.
<br />
However after it said press any key to boot of disk, and i press any key then it went to a blank screen and said on the monitor said " Input signal out of Range change to 1280 x 1024 60hrz."<br />
I also did a factory reset of the monitor, and hooked the old pc up to the tv.<br />
So i would like to know how to fix the problem any help would be much a appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>First of all are you using a discrete graphics card or graphics integrated with the mainboard? Changing the&nbsp;BIOS battery (or changing anything in BIOS by whatever method) is not going to change anything to do with a discrete graphics card and not likley
 to do much to onboard graphics either.</p>
<p>What this sounds like to me is that the key stroke to boot from CD is not being recognised and that Windows is actually booting from the hard disk with a resolution not supported by your monitor. But, not being there, I cannot be sure of this so here&nbsp;are
 some diagnostic ideas.</p>
<p>Boot the PC without the CD inserted, do you get the same problem?</p>
<p>Is the keyboard plugged in properly?</p>
<p>If it is a PS/2 keyboard is it plugged into the mouse PS/2 socket by mistake (keyboard sockets are normally purple, mouse sockets normally green)?</p>
<p>Is the keyboard PS/2 or USB? Can you try an alternate keyboard ideally with the other type of interface?</p>
<p>Can you get into BIOS setup by the appropriate keystroke (normally F2 or DEL but I have seen others too, look for the message at boot up)? If you can't this would indicate a keyboard issue.</p>
<p>If you can rule out the keyboard as a problem&nbsp;I would return to my original question about a discrete graphics card. If there is a discrete graphics card, does the mainboard also have graphics? If it does, remove the discrete card and try windows set up
 again. Or even try windows setup again with an alternate graphics card if you can lay your hands on one. Power down the PC and unplug it from the mains supply before removing/replacing any internal components.</p>
<p>Finally, what about the installation CD? Is it the one that came with the PC? Is it genuine manufacturer's recovery CD or genuine Microsoft CD?</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

<h2>            Unable to create new folder. File System Error 512.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been unable to create new folders in my public pictures library lately. Whenever I do, I get a File System Error 512 message.</p>
<p>One forum respondent said that Windows 7 had a hardwired limit of 50 folders under Pictures. Even though I already had 61 folders, which kind of contradicted that answer, I went ahead and tidied up until now I only have 39 folders directly under Pictures.
 However, the problem still persists.</p>
<p>Just for the record, I've also done a registry cleanup, obviously have rebooted, etc.</p>
<p>Any ideas out there would be most appreciated.</p>

 set him up with his real birthday, so when I try to log in with the incorrect email, it asks for a parent to sign in. When I try to log in with the correct email, it sends a verification email. When I follow the verification, it says the email&nbsp;address is incorrect.</p>

    <title>After upgrading to Windows 10 computer falls asleep after 1 minute - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 10 computer falls asleep after 1 minute despite power settings.</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I have found it helpful so far save for the problem in the title. my computer screen will now turn off if left inactive for one minute: inconvenient when watching You Tube videos not in full screen mode. I immediately went
 to the "power and sleep" tab in the control panel and changed the settings so this would not happen. It kept happening. I tried again going through the additional plan settings, to the "change settings for your particular plan" page, through to the advanced
 settings page and the display and sleep tabs, making the same changes throughout. Yet unless my computer cannot tell the difference between 1 minute and 15 minutes it still insists of going dormant despite all the settings I have found having being changed
 to a minimum of 15 mins (3 hours when plugged in).</p>
<p>Does anybody know how I can stop this nuisance from continuing?</p>

<p><br />
What are you loading the dictionary files for (what application?)</p>
<p>You could find your Application Data from a command line in any Windows Xp or later (at least) by using this:</p>
<p>CD "%APPDATA%\"</p>
<p>or the Run dialog box using this:</p>
<p>"%APPDATA%\"</p>
<p>or you could do the following...</p>
<p>Press the Windows Logo Key and the R key at the same time to bring up the RUN dialog box. Erase whatever is typed in and type in this:</p>
<p>cmd /k&nbsp;ECHO "%APPDATA%"</p>
<p>... click OK.&nbsp; This will open and leave open a command prompt where the first line it shows is your APPDATA folder.</p>
<p>It's location in Windows 7 is:</p>
<p>"C:\Users\&lt;YourUsername&gt;\AppData\Roaming"</p>
<p>And you will likely have to type that in as it is a hidden/system folder.</p>

                    <p>I have just been given a laptop that had Windows 10 Home on it. Now I have new Windows 10 pro oem key that I am attempting to install. However at no point does it allow me to enter the key and automatically activates it as 10 home. I have uninstalled the
 home key with&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">slmgr /dlv</span>&nbsp;. Also have gone as far as to pull the hhd and do a full format via another pc. Thats when I noticed that even with no hhd it still had some sort of built in windows repair.
 Although the windows repair failed due to missing files. I tried editing the image but to add a edition id and pid.txt but i did something wrong and that image didn't work.</p>

<p>Iuqy95akd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;How much free space do you have on your USB flash drive? The official page also states:</p>
<p>"<em>On the Xbox 360, in order to help you through your missions, a hard drive with up to 1.7GB free is required for the initial installation. Additional requirements are 192KB to save your game, and up to 256MB of free hard drive space for system updates
 and additional storage for some game features. Storage requirements are subject to change.</em>"</p>
<p>So this leads me to believe you would need a flash drive with at least 1.957 GB free. If you are attempting to use an empty 2 GB flash drive, there may not be enough room as it may only show&nbsp;1.86 GB of actual free space. You should be able to verify this
 by viewing your settings&gt;storage on your console. Can you verify what USB drive you are using and how much free space is shown in the storage pre or post install? Thanks,</p>

<p>I don't have MGS V, but if the initial installation is required to play, shouldn't there be 1.7 GB less of free space on the storage device (flash drive)?&nbsp;So are you having a problem doing the initial install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing you can try is clearing the system cache 3 times then rebooting. Just follow these steps:</p>
<p><b><span>Clear System Cache:</span></b><span><br />
1) Scroll right and go to<span>&nbsp;the </span><b>Settings</b> tab, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>System Settings</b><br />
2) Select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Hard Drive</b><br />
3) Highlight Hard Drive, and press Y (Device Options)<br />
4) Select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Clear System Cache</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and select<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Yes<br />
</b></span>5) Repeat steps 2 thru 4 two more times so that your Cache is cleared 3 times</p>
<p><b><span>*NOTE* </span></b><span>The cache stores such items as game updates, system update installation packages, and gamer pictures of your friends. Clearing the Xbox 360 cache does not remove your Gamertag, content that you have downloaded, game files,
 or console software updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Turn off your console and start it back up.<br />
<br />
Let us know your results.</p>

<p>So it appears that it may not be seeing the flash drive. Did you format the USB Flash Drive to a FAT32 on your PC first? If you haven't done this, put the flash drive into your computer, open up “My computer” (or press the Windows key + E), then right click
 on the flash drive device, and select “Format.” Format the USB flash drive to FAT32. Or verify that it is in fact still FAT32 format. If not, run through the formatting process again.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that formatting the drive will wipe any data on the drive. So make sure to save any files you need before formatting it.</p>

<p>Hi Ahmed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to make sure that you're running a genuine copy of Windows is <span>
to buy Windows or a PC with Windows preinstalled directly from Microsoft or from a store that you know and trust. Try to look for key features of genuine Windows, such as the Certificate of Authenticity (COA), a proof of license label, and an edge-to-edge hologram.
 For other ways to check if you're running genuine Windows, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=397859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What to look for</a> page on the Microsoft How to Tell website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you're seeing notifications that the copy of Windows that's installed on your PC might not be genuine, or that you might be a victim of counterfeit software, it's likely that your copy of Windows wasn't properly activated or is otherwise not genuine.
 To resolve this, click the notification and follow the steps to either repair Windows or—if you've inadvertently obtained counterfeit software—buy genuine Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div><span>Until you correct the issue, you'll receive periodic reminders that Windows is not genuine. In addition, to more clearly display these messages, your desktop might turn black. You can reset it, but every 60 minutes, it will return to black until
 the issue is resolved. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<span>Regardless of genuine status, Windows will still be able to get critical security updates. However, access to optional updates or benefits available exclusively to genuine Windows customers might be restricted.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>For us to take a closer look, can you send us a screenshot of the notification? You may also refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2008385/windows-7-displays-windows-is-not-genuine-with-an-error-code-of-0x8007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Bell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for coming to the forums with the issue of ethernet cable not connecting. We recommend to clear alt mac address. Go to settings&gt;network&gt;network settings&gt;adv. settings&gt;alt. mac address&gt;clear and restart. Leave the ethernet cable plugged in and see
 if it connects after it restarts. Let us know how it turns out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Do you have something else other than the Xbox to plug the cable into and test if that connects?&nbsp; I'm wondering if the cable is good.&nbsp; Testing with another device will verify if it's an issue with the cable.&nbsp; If not, it's possible that it's just too long?&nbsp;
 The effective distance of a CAT5 cable is 100 meters.&nbsp; It can go longer, and most of the time with little degredation, but it can impact and cause issues to your network traffic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that I would recommend logging into the router and checking to see if it recognizes the device via the interface.&nbsp; That way you'll know if it's an issue with connecting to the router, or if it's an issue with the console recognizing the wired
 connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you get, so far, and we can provide some further troubleshooting, as there are very many different directions we can go from here.</p>

<p>Hey there <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/128c8a11-e675-411a-a3ef-a9adeee451e9" title="NoTaBeLL">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting us know that this is happening. </p>
<p>Most people like to use a wired connection as it's usually faster and more reliable, so I can see how a problem like this can be concerning.
</p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking, have you already tried another cable or a different channel on the modem?
</p>
<p>If it does not show up no matter what wire you plug in, you could be experiencing a hardware problem of some sort.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, try another cable or the steps outlined in our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Connection and Network Solution</a>&nbsp;and let us know if they help. </p>

<h2>            windows 10 - messed up Folders locations</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask a question here about the 6 standard folders that are created when installing Windows fresh. They are by default installed on the C: drive.</p>
<p>I believe they are called 'Special Folders' (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">source</a>). If i am telling nonsense, please correct me, because im no Hero in PC's...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal was to move these 6 folders from my small size SSD to my HDD, because i thought that every file (video/photo/download/ Etc.) would end up being placed on my C: drive and that it would get clogged very rapidly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i asked someone on a forum if they could be placed on the D: drive for example. Hey said they can be moved by changing location in properties. But i misunderstood this and first made a normal folder on the D: drive, named it 'MEDIA van PC' and started
 changing the locations of these special folders to this newly created folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first started doing this with downloads and after a reboot this folder in which i placed the path of 'downloads' was gone and only 'downloads' had remained on my D: drive. How's this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried this with Pictures, and when trying to restore default location it wouldnt do it because i think it placed it back in English (Pictures) and originally it was named 'Afbeeldingen' (in Dutch this is). I think this created a conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below in the picture u can see the endresult of me messing things up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>U probably know what my next question is:</p>
<p>How can i completely restore this to default? </p>
<p>(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if</span> reinstalling windows is needed, i would like to do it asap, because there is not much data stored up and till this&nbsp; moment on the drives)</p>
<p>Or can things be repaired with a System Repair? Or is there a bypass or something for this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, would you guys recommend relocating these special folders?? Or should i just empty these folders from time to time by moving its content from C: to D: drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>JDC</p>

            <p>Hi JDC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you mention which 6 standard folders you wanted to move from your SSD to your HDD? I don't really catch what you're saying, but I'm gonna try my best and sorry, I don't understand your picture since it's all in Dutch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can't move some folders in Drive C, I believe some of them are related to Windows installation and if you do that, you'll get messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do reply and give me further info. Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>on this screen u can c these 'special' folders (not my pc):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab54e40e-b6b9-419f-a67a-f88b0952a6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab54e40e-b6b9-419f-a67a-f88b0952a6b4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>here u can see those 6 im hinting at: </p>
<p>
</p><p>its not the same view as my pc (not at my pc right now), but u can see some folders every pc has:</p>
<p>-desktop</p>
<p>-documents</p>
<p>-downloads</p>
<p>-music</p>
<p>-pictures</p>
<p>-video's</p>
<p>
</p><p>are they called special folders ? i dunno what u call them but they are clearly linked to each windows pc i believe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>problem is i messed up locations of these folders, as u can c on my screen:</p>
<p>can i restore this because when i want to restore to default there is a translation problem (DUTCH&gt;ENGLISH)</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example :&nbsp;&nbsp; 'afbeeldingen' means pictures in dutch</p>
<p>
</p><p>D: /.../Afbeeldingen will be restored to english name of this folder=&gt; C:/.../Pictures (which is default in ENGLISH windows OS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>because the names are different then what this relocation option suggests as a solution and due to language issue, i get errors and so it is not possible to restore f.e. :</p>
<p>D:\ Afbeeldingen to C:\ Afbeeldingen because it is proposing moving it to C:\ Pictures,&nbsp; which isn't possibe, cos that is prolly reserved or what not by windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am terrible at explaining this, so if u can try expressing it in ur own words so we can determine we're talking about the same thing ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>kind regards...</p>
<p>JDC</p>
<p>
</p><p>i want to place back 6 folders as if it would have been a fresh install...</p>

            <p>OK. You can change the locations of Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Videos and Music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create new folders on your HDD with exactly the same names.</p>
<p>Then (for example) right-click on Documents, choose Properties, and under the Location tab click on the "Move" button. Navigate to and select the new "Documents" folder you just created and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat with all the other folders I've listed above.</p>

            <p>thx,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will certainly try this when home...</p>
<p>
</p><p>problem is as u can c on my screen, the folders don't have their original name anymore after my clumsiness...</p>
<p>
</p><p>u can c f.e. for pictures:</p>
<p>
</p><p>next to its icon, pictures is now D:\ and the D drive is now called afbeeldingen... (so maybe i switched both or something)</p>
<p>
</p><p>downloads (blue arrow) has now 2 icons (1 probably original, and 1 called Media van PC )</p>
<p>
</p><p>this Media van PC is the (standard) folder i moved the original downloads to on my D: drive. This folder has dissapeared when rebooting and now the blue arrow has taken over that folders name...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i made the error of relocating it into a folder instead of directly on the drive i think, because the folder magically dissapeared...</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe this is all still repairable, but i don't know how to make it right...</p>

            <p>You can untangle this mess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to take a moment to explain the naming issue.&nbsp; These folders get their Display name from the desktop.ini file within each folder.&nbsp; This lets Windows "think" in English while displaying Dutch names.&nbsp; This is why Media became
 Downloads --- the folder is still named Media, but its Display name is Downloads.&nbsp; This can be verified by viewing your D:\ drive from a command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trick to relocating the folders is to remember that you want to redirect the location all the way to the new folder, not just its parent:&nbsp; the location you should have specified for Downloads is D:\Media\Downloads.&nbsp; For Pictures, D:\Media\Pictures, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for untangling the paths, you'll need to edit the Registry.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two keys where these values are stored:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the names are self-explanatory.&nbsp; However, the name used for Documents is Personal, and Downloads is {374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B}.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to help with more detail at any step in the process, but this should be enough to get you started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first&nbsp;step is to make sure none of the folders are pointing to D:\Media, but instead D:\Media\<em>FolderName.</em></p>
<p>We can sort out desktop.ini issues later.</p>

            <p>@ Keith n John, thx....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>problem is John, i should probably elaborate further, when i go to setting&gt; -location , and then try to restore i get that language problem... i get access denied or something like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>its a new pc with 8.1 win installed that i recently bought and i immediately transferred to win 10.</p>
<p>i thought that maybe my 120gb SSD wouldnt cut it when filled with videos n pics n large files n so, so i wanted to move these folders to another drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i just decided, also for my games im about to install to get a big SSD as extra... (1TB model)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so maybe i should postpone the solution till then, because otherwise i will be moving the folders 2ce., which could trigger problems...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so setup that i want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 120Gb with only windows on it and some other programs</p>
<p>- 1TB SSD for fast gaming &nbsp;and these infamous folders</p>
<p>- 1TB HDD for extra storage of movies n photos</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but it would be nice to already determine what to do best next step(s) and how to setup everything the right way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>@ keith: i only fiddled with those 2 folders (downloads n pictures) so maybe the problem isnt that big after all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: after checking: my downloads problem has resolved itself... :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>its now located at&nbsp;C:\Users\JDC\Downloads and the other folder 'Media van PC' is nowhere to be seen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>so only pictures/afbeelding language issue now i guess... luckily i stopped at 2nd folder ... HAHAHA</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS keith: how do i access this drive through command prompt????</p>

<p>Hi JC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with your trackpad can occur due to several reasons, such as, a disconnected device, an outdated driver, hardware issues, etc. Just for clarity, are you experiencing issues with your trackpad or your external mouse?
 Based on the screenshot that you have provided, the error message that you are getting is due to your external mouse being disconnected from your laptop. To learn more about the error code that you received, kindly scroll down, and look for it in this article:

<h2>            Game DVR clips missing error code &#34;0x87c40156&#34;</h2>
                    <p>All of my gameclips on xbox live&nbsp;dvr are missing&nbsp;and when i try to manage captures through the game dvr app,&nbsp;I&nbsp;get a message with an error code of "0x87c40156" saying, "let us know by entering&nbsp;0x87c40156 at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate." When i type the error code at the errorhelp web address,&nbsp;this message appears, "Sorry! No Support articles were found for 0x87c40156." I am very disappointed that this issue occurred since I&nbsp;have had the Xbox One since&nbsp;2013,&nbsp;I am&nbsp;bound to have many screenshots and game clips recorded throughout the 150+ games i own for the xbox one. I cherish these screenshots and game clips greatly as it allows me to relive great memories I have created through Xbox. I sincerely hope this matter&nbsp;gets resolved and for&nbsp;my screenshots/gameclips to get restored.</p>

            <p>I only just got this within the past hour, but judging by the other threads and posts on here and the fact that everyone has gotten it around the same time I'm guessing it might just be a temporary problem with the DVR or Xbox servers right now. Hopefully it will be fixed!</p>

            Could be a defective mouse, since that should not happen with a new mouse.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Right click on the Mouse and click uninstall
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart computer then see if the mouse works.

            Hi  Martin, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Check with the mouse maker as it probably has programmable functions in the software drivers.
<br />
<br />There several places to look for Mouse software and all of these may not reveal the same thing (if any).
<br />
<br />Check the Up-Arrow on the lower right on Taskbar to see if a Mouse utility is loading that allows you to set its functions.
<br />
<br />Also look in Start - Settings - Devices - Mouse       and on far right "Additional Mouse Settings:,
<br />
<br />Start - type in Mouse ........ find at top and click on it.
<br />
<br />Look in Start Apps to see if there is a Mouse program which allows you to set the functions. 
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.       
        </p>

            Hi Rob i checked mouse makers website and this mouse doesn't have software driver, i also tried downloading some mouse softwares but they did not work aswell. And all the other suggestions aslo did not work. Im guessing this mouse is just defective. But
 thank you for your time and if you have some other ideas i could try i would appreciate it.

            Can you email the mouse maker to see if that is the normal behavior? 
<br />
<br />Do other mice do the same thing? If not it probably is the mouse.

            BTW that is a 5 button mouse. Does holding in one or both of the left side buttons change the right click behavior? Did the mouse come with any instructions about usage?
<br />
<br />The maker does say no drivers needed and for right hand users.
<br />
<br />Here are some contact methods if needed :
