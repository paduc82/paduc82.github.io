<h2>            O365 Shared mailbox sent items not copying</h2>
                    <p>Since Friday August 24, when using Outlook 365, emails sent on behalf of a shared mailbox has not worked properly for all users in&nbsp;our tenant.&nbsp; The sent item only goes to the user's sent folder, but is not copied to the shared mailbox's sent folder.</p>
<p>When using the web portal,&nbsp;the sent email goes into the shared mailbox's sent folder, but not the user's.</p>
<p>In both cases, the email shows that it is sent by the user on behalf of the shared mailbox, as it should.</p>
<p>All our shared mailboxes have 'Copy items sent as this mailbox' and 'Copy items sent on behalf of this mailbox' set ON.&nbsp; All relevant users for each shared mailbox have permission to 'Read and manage' and 'Send on behalf', but not 'Send as '.</p>
<p>Until August 24, the sent emails would be end up in the user's and shared mailbox's sent folders.</p>

            <p>Jessen thanks for your reply. I did leave feedback about this ISSUE as both feedback and problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems to me that the powers to be that designed the home page sure found room for all the other sports. My bad they don't consider AUTO SPORTS/NASCAR a sport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought this was the Microsoft Community Forum. Maybe you can provide the correct link for me.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ignore Smittychat's response about clicking on Favorites. Adding NASCAR to My Favorites does absolutely nothing useful. Yes, it will add NASCAR to "My Sports", but "My Sports" is a completely useless bunch of links to pages that can be accessed quicker elsewhere.
 Now if they would make the "My Sports" links show up on the front sports page, that would be something useful which might save you some clicking and hunting around, but the new MSN is all about clicking and hunting around for information you used to be able
 to find "at a glance" on your My MSN home page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the MSN main page, click on Sports. From there, all the links to the major sports, including NASCAR, can be found in the lower black stripe of the top banner. NASCAR/Motor is right between Golf and Tennis, and clicking on this link will take you to
 a page where you can click on other links to choose between NASCAR Sprint Cup, NASCAR Nationwide Series, Formula One and Grand Prix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's a lot of clicking. MSN folks are completely baffled by the whole "at a glance" concept. Furthermore, why they couldn't have just duplicated the black stripe menu and put all those links atop the Sports section of the main page and save us all
 some unnecessary clicking is beyond me. I guess they're afraid we might miss an ad somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for those of you following various soccer leagues or other sports not found on this lower black stripe at the bottom of the banner, you might be able to find what you're looking for in the Sports Index, just to the left of My Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting note, Richard, you can choose to follow Baseball, Basketball, Football or Hockey players by adding them to the My Favorites list, but you can't seem to add any NASCAR drivers; I've tried several without success.</p>

<p>I can send but not receive to the two addresses via the web service of my provider, through Outlook 2016 I have no</p>

<p>I am suspicious of my ISP Spark New Zealand, they currently use Yahoo as a provider ( soon to change) Yahoo has been</p>

<p>When you upgrade to Windows Phone Mango (no official release date yet), this will be possible. I am currently running the Developer Beta of Mango and I can see 5 of my Windows Live calendars on my device ... all from the same Windows Live ID.</p>

<p>MSE updates will install no matter what choice you have made in the Automatic Update settings for Windows Updates -- as long as you have not disabled the services for AU.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>See the following Wiki article:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_updating/microsoft-security-essentials-update-faq/096ed345-2669-4143-9d45-d6ca0e03ac4f">
<font>Microsoft Security Essentials Update FAQ</font></a> </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The MSE updates are presented as optional in Windows Update to prevent you from seeing an alert multiple times daily for available updates. You do not need to install these updates as MSE will do so itself.</p>

<p>I have AU set up to automatically install critical and important updates. They do install automatically. However, the "recommended" updates do not install automatically. In Control panel &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Change Settings, I have the box for "Give me recommended
 updates the same way I receive important updates" unchecked. My "recommended" updates are not installed unless I manually do so. MSE updates are "recommended" updates.</p>

            <p>The key is that MSE updates will install even if you ignore the optional/recommended ones you see in Windows Update. MSE downloads *all* signature updates when it checks for updates once per 24 hours, bringing the database fully up to date.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From the same FAQ article, further down: "The Microsoft Antimalware group deploys updates for MSE (also Forefront and Windows Defender) typically a few times daily. It is not critical for you to check for updates throughout the day because when MSE checks
 for updates, the offered updates will be downloaded and added to the database. Update installations are cumulative."</p>

<p>If what you're saying is correct, the Update tab in MSE should show a current update daily.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then, how come the Update tab shows yesterday as the most current update and there is a recommended update in Windows Updates waiting to be downloaded?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Steve has been telling you <u>how</u> the updating system works, but since you are overly concerned about updating in general I'm going to tell you
<u>why</u> the MSE updates work the way they do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First the daily automatic&nbsp;update performed by MSE itself will only occur after&nbsp;at least&nbsp;24 hours has passed since the last successful update, so any intermediate update packages that exist in Windows Update won't be installed before that time&nbsp;unless done
 manually, regardless of if they are dated "today".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As Steve mentioned there are actually several intermediate (incremental) updates released daily, but only typically 2 or 3 (Delta)&nbsp;releases via Windows (Microsoft)&nbsp;Update.&nbsp; These Windows Update releases are designed to bypass the direct pathway that the
 MSE initiated updates take, specifically for the case where something may be blocking the proper operation of these daily or manual&nbsp;updates.&nbsp; As a bonus, certain configurations of Windows (Microsoft)&nbsp;Update will also apply these automatically, but this isn't
 required and is so "Optional" as Steve has tried to explain.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason that the intermediate updates aren't required is that since its release, MSE has contained an ability called the Dynamic Signature Service (DSS), which will automatically upload a computed signature of any potential malware it detects that it
 can't identify to MAPS.&nbsp; If that signature is known to MAPS, then it will immediately respond with the information required for that PC to download the specific definition designed to deal with that malware, even if that definition hasn't yet been released
 widely via an update package.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are other reasons that the several individual definitions packages aren't released individually including more complete testing processes and packaging into the 2 to 3 packages that are released daily via Microsoft Update, but these are simply operational
 processes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So the reasoning behind the update flows relate more to operational and load based decisions about the back-end systems that support them and the alternate pathway for definitions required immediately that DSS and&nbsp;MAPS allows.&nbsp; Since these remove the need
 to constantly download or install every update as it is released, MSE doesn't attempt to do this since it creates undesired overhead on both the update servers and/or the client PC itself that in most cases will never be required.&nbsp; Most PCs never experience
 the malware that a specific set of definitions provide protection for and even then it's usually days after they were released.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason that people have become so obsessive about installing updates is that in the past this was the only way to keep them current.&nbsp; Since DSS and MAPS can now deal with this issue, the reason for this obsession has gone, but the obsessive behavior
 has not.</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
You are very welcome and, yes, your summary works well. :-) Ignoring the optional update in Windows Update is fine as MSE will eventually download and install it on its own.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>If what you're saying is correct, the Update tab in MSE should show a current update daily.</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It shows you the latest update. The piece you and I cannot control is *when* MSE will check for updates. It is once per 24 hours. If MSE checked for updates within 24 hours or the scheduled check (which can't be changed) it won't check again until the next
 scheduled check or at Windows start if you turn the PC off before that event occurs.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Then, how come the Update tab shows yesterday as the most current update and there is a recommended update in Windows Updates waiting to be downloaded?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you looked today, the MSE check had been less than 24 hours previously, so your system was considered to be up to date. You could, however, download and install the optional update(s) available in Windows Update or by clicking the update button in MSE
 and it will become the current date. Note that this would then affect the next scheduled check. Therefore, it is not at all unusual for MSE to report that it is up to date with a last update of the prior day and available updates if you manually check.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

            <p>Hello kingolaseni:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Windows 7 phone forum regarding your update question.&nbsp; Updates for the phone are delivered by your mobile operator.&nbsp; At this time we have released the update to all operators so it could be delivered to customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that being said, if the update is available in your region for your model of phone, it should be delivered anytime.&nbsp; When it is ready you would be notified on the phone.&nbsp; To ensure your phone is ready for this, go to settings &gt; phone update &gt; check
 the "notify me when new updates are found" and "use my cellular data connection to check for updates" boxes.&nbsp; If you are not being notified on the phone, connect the phone to a computer that has the Zune software installed,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163</a>.&nbsp; Once the phone is connected, click settings &gt; phone &gt; update.&nbsp; If you find that no updates are available it is likely
 your carrier has yet to release the update or your phone will not get the update.&nbsp; For additional details, contact your mobile operator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            Unable to update links or paste a new link</h2>
                    <p>I have my accounts set up in Excel. I use paste link between four different workbooks. I recently upgraded to Office 2016 for Mac (from 2007). The links are no longer working properly. To set up a new FY I copy the files and rename to the new year then update
 the links to the new sheets. When I click on Change Source I get a message that 'There is a problem with this formula, with the following explanation:
</p>
<p>Not trying to type a formula?</p>
<p>When the first character is an equal (=) or minus (-) sign, Excel thinks it's a formula:</p>

</p>
<p>• you type: &nbsp; =1+1, cell shows: &nbsp; 2</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To get around this, type an apostrophe ( ' ) first:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>• you type: &nbsp; '=1+1, cell shows: &nbsp; =1+1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am trying to paste a value from a formula. I tried creating the link anew but I am now getting an Alert: Unable to paste link. This is driving me crazy. I don't want to have to build the four sheets again from scratch.</p>

<p>Hi Kerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, could you record a video for this issue with
<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/quicktime-player/record-your-screen-qtp97b08e666/mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
QuickTime Player</a> (1. click the link to show the result. 2. try changing source of the file, get the error message.)? It will take you some time to record the video. However, it will let us now more details. In the video, please click Excel/Apple icon on
 the top bar&gt;About Excel/About This Mac&gt;let us know versions of your Office suite and Mac OS.

<p>Thanks Tim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to attach files here so I have attached the four workbooks to the previous message. Thanks very miuch for your help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The order they should be opened is</p>
<p>1. Sales Schedule</p>
<p>2. Cashflow Business</p>
<p>3. Cashflow pers</p>
<p>4. Inc Exp</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last of these (inc Exp) has been problematic since I upgraded last year, with the inability to update all links for the 17–18 FY, though they seem to go through on values at least and I have got by. I have been using this system for 18 years and had
 never had a problem until I upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the 18–19 docs they just won't update at all, with the old links remaining and not allowing me to change them to the new FY or even create a new link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with not being able to create a new link is a new one for these docs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created some dummy workbooks Books (1, 2 and 3) and this was able to create a link from Book 2 to Book 1 but not able to change the source from Book 1 to Book 3. I'll send those separately as the message would only accept five attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the original problem, which leads me to believe there is an issue with Excel.</p>

<p>Hi Kerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing with us those worksheets in my private message. Those three dummy worksheets let me understand the situation better. However, based on my test with those three dummy worksheets, I'm able to perform the following operations:</p>
<p>1. In Book2, click Data&gt;Edit links&gt;change source to Book3. (B2 became 930, the formula is related to book3)</p>
<p>2. Open Book1, copy the result, paste specific&gt;paste link to Book2. (B2 changes back to 620, the formula is related to book1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I test with the same 16.14.1 version of Excel for Mac. I also tested with same operations showing in those two videos. From my side Paste specific&gt;Paste link or change source operations work properly. So, it seems it's an individual issue with your specific
 Mac and Office installation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25796?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating a new Mac account</a>, see if worksheets work well with the new Mac account.

<p>
</p><p>So it's not corruption in any of the docs but a problem with the interface between Excel and my Mac? I don't understand why creating a new Mac account would work but I'll try that shortly. Could reinstalling Office be a better solution?</p>

<p>Hi Kerry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I test with those files shared from you and they work well with the same operations in your videos, so my understanding is that these worksheets should be proper. There might be some unexpected issues with the Office installation or your Mac OS. You could
 first check with a new Mac account. If it works, you may keep using the new Mac account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this step, you could decide if you want to perform a completely re-installation for the Office suite on your Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<h2>            How do I remove Trojan&#58; DOS&#47;Alureon.E</h2>
                    <p>My friend has a business PC using Windows XP (SP3). MSE detects the Trojan but can't remove it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried </p>
<ul>
<li>Vipre (Sunbelt Software) rescue disk - did not appear to detect it; did not remove it</li><li>Bitdefender rescue disk (tied for high removal rate with Kapersky according to Top Ten Reviews) - did not appear to detect it; did not remove it</li></ul>
<p>I now plan to try Kapersky's anti-rootkit utility TDSSkiller (<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</a>)</p>
<p>I will post my results back to this forum.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any additional tips for me in getting rid of this Trojan?</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help you can give.&nbsp; I greatly appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Looking for documentation on setting colors and patterns&#47;tints in macros.</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any documentation on how Excel 2007 handles colors and patterns in macros?&nbsp; I have written a macro to format a .csv file.&nbsp; To get the colors for the title panel, I have to record a macro using the colors I want and copy that into my code.&nbsp; This
 makes it impossible for clients to customize the colors without doing what I do.</p>
<p>Here's some of the code</p>
<p>With Selection.Interior<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Pattern = xlSolid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PatternColorIndex = xlAutomatic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorAccent2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0.599963377788629&nbsp; &lt;-- WTCC?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PatternTintAndShade = 0<br />
End With</p>
<p>This one does a gradiant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Selection.Interior.Gradient.ColorStops.Add(0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorLight2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0.80001220740379<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Selection.Interior.Gradient.ColorStops.Add(1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ThemeColor = xlThemeColorDark1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TintAndShade = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever happened to RGB in Hex?</p>

    <title>Child div tag resizing to full width of parent problem in Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dsaravanan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child div tag resizing to full width of parent problem in Internet Explorer 6 </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using the design as follows,</p>
<p>I have a parent div to width 400px; then it has an inner div with the width that can vary based on the content. Something like that in the facebook "to" field in the "send messages". So when the text width varies, the div has&nbsp; to resize, but my div width
 is 400px and that the next div when added to this div causes it to be displayed on the next line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly let me know the way to correct it and also if any hacks to solve this issue. I DONOT WANT TO USE THE WIDTH CSS RULE FOR THE CHILD DIV, it varies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Saravanan</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue that you are experiencing with your phone is due to the changes on your cloud's security. The verification procedure was changed so you have to set up a new two factor authentication, in order for your phone to connect to your cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after you have generated your two factor authentication.</p>

            We have signed up for two factor authentication with Apple but still get the same message when trying to sync the iCloud account on the Lumia 635 in order to keep the calendar up to date.&nbsp; It says the iCloud is "Not up to date". What to do now?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            We now have the answer after spending time on the Apple support line.&nbsp; About a month ago, with no notice that I was given (or made aware of), Apple changed their protocol for non-apple devices signing into iCloud account to require an app-specific password.&nbsp;
 going to the Apple ID website and logging into your Apple ID account, there is a link to generate such a device-specific password, which then needs to be input to the iCloud account set up on your Lumia phone.&nbsp; One unique password for each non-Apple device.&nbsp;
 Hope this helps others who recently encountered this added roadblock from Apple.&nbsp;

            The most reason for this is that the data type of the cells did not match, I guess that the Power Query returns a number but your lookup value is text.
<br />
<br />It is far too complicated to recreate such a scenario. And if it does not match yours, then our solution will not work for you.
<br />
<br />For this kind of requests, please create a sample file with the layout of your original file, filled with sample data and colored cells with the expected result.
<br />
<br />At best make a copy of your original file and anonymize the necessary data. For this please download this file
<br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkfxuh85j5wyj9y/modAnonymize.bas?dl=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/rkfxuh85j5wyj9y/modAn...</a>
<br />Open your Excel file
<br />Right-click on the sheet tab
<br />Choose "View Code"
<br />Press CTRL-M
<br />Select the downloaded file and import
<br />Close the VBA editor
<br />Select the cells with the confidential data 
<br />Press Alt-F8
<br />Choose the macro
<br />Click Run
<br />
<br />Upload it on OneDrive (or an other Online File Hoster of your choice) and post the download link here.

<br />
<br />Then we can look at the file and try to find a solution. Thank you for your understanding.
<br />
<br />Andreas.

<h3> simonkramer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 not saving&#63;</h2>
                    I have a file that is located on the SkyDrive.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I continue working on the file and pressed Shift+F12 to save (i prefer using keystrokes) occasionally the progress bar at the foot of the screen shows saving to the SkyDrive, but not always? &nbsp;Still the Excel pointer changes the circle that usually indicates
 a save.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I re-open the file none of my changes have been saved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this something I'm doing wrong, or is this an interesting new bug in Excel 2013?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best regards,</div>

            Hi Girish,
<div><br />
<div>I just discovered why this is happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I made changes to my file and then selected the option to hide menus/ribbons, a new feature in Excel 2013.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Having tried this again it appears that you cannot save by Shift+F12 in this mode. &nbsp;Is this a deliberate feature or an unexpected bug? &nbsp;I will have to include a button driving a VBA save for some of my clients spreadsheets where I was hoping to use this
 method of displaying a full screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is incorrect or if you have further info please advise.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind regards,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Simon</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens when you try to save the Excel file? Do you receive any error messages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us open Excel in application safe and then open the file by going to File and Open and check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To do that, press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Run open box type in ‘Excel /safe’ and hit ok.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: There is a space between Excel and /.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If application safe mode works, try disabling the add-ins associated with Excel application.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To do that, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Open the application. Click on File and then click on options.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. In the Options Window click on Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Select Com Add-ins in the Manage list in the Add-ins section and click Go. Now uncheck the all the add-ins and click Ok.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the steps mentioned the following article and verify the results.</p>

<p>Hi Dwi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Read Aloud feature is not yet available in PowerPoint 365 for Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you may consider the feature provided by Mac OS. See Apple <strong>
System Preferences </strong>&gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong>&nbsp; &gt;<strong> Speech</strong>&nbsp;&gt;
<strong>Speak selected text when the key is pressed</strong>,&nbsp; click <strong>Set Key</strong> to assign a keyboard shortcut that you want to use to hear text read aloud. The default keyboard shortcut is Option+Esc. Then in&nbsp;your Office file, select the text
 that you want to hear, and then press the keyboard shortcut. Reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Hear-selected-text-read-aloud-CE9FB073-2A4D-44D2-95F7-6A532F0AB112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hear selected text read aloud</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the situation on PowerPoint, if the feature is important to you,&nbsp; I'd like to invite you to submit your idea via
<a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288925-powerpoint-for-mac?query=Read%20Aloud%20feature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PowerPoint User Voice</a>. It is the direct channel for the related team to know your user experience. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on your feedback.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Locking Objects to Pictures in Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi, All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a very large technical document with a lot of photos.&nbsp; Most of the photos have other objects, such as text boxes, arrows, etc.&nbsp; Is there a way to lock the objects to the photos so that if I move the photo, the other objects move with it?&nbsp;
 One time, I found an option that said "save as photo" (or something similar) so I could save the whole kit and caboodle as one object and everything stayed put, but I can't remember what I did.&nbsp; Help!!</p>

            You could group all of the objects with the photo (they have to all have the same type of text wrapping); that alone will keep them together, but you could&nbsp;then right-click and choose Save as Picture. If you don't see the option, then select the whole
 mess and copy, Paste Special in the desired format, and then use Save as Picture.

<p>I would use a screen capture program such as Snagit from www.techsmith.com to create a screen capture of the annotated images which I would create in a separate document, and then&nbsp; save the screen capture as an image (jpg) file which you would insert into
 your document, preferably with the layout options set to in-line with text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mismatched xml tag errors are very likely to occur with documents containing images such as you describe.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Handsfree problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help. I have a bluetooth handsfree kit in the car, and I can pair with it no problem. The phone (Vodafone v1514 - a rebadged&nbsp;HTC Vox running windows Mobile 6) shows the little headphone icon, but nothing comes out of the car speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tested the car kit, and it works fine with other phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>When you pair it, what does it tell you that you can use?&nbsp; Hands free?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any resourse you can get with the manufacturer?&nbsp; Maybe it a WM6 issue with their device.&nbsp; Have you tested it with WM5?</p>

<p>Looks like I have found the answer - Its the car kit at fault, not WM6. Apparently it comes with the wrong lead, and only works with older phones. (Dont understrstand why, but there you go)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, and I will get onto the manufacturer.</p>

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I still have this feeling that it should work ... especially when it does work with other phones.&nbsp; When you go through the pairing process it will tell you what services it offers (or it should).&nbsp; I would expect you will see a Hands
 Free option.

    <title>Microsoft Account Stops Syncing When Text Message Backup Is On - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Stops Syncing When Text Message Backup Is On &#40;Lumia 920&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've always had text message backup on with my Lumia 920 but one day I noticed my Microsoft Account (along with Outlook email, and Twitter, LinkedIn accounts) stopped syncing. I noticed online that a fix was found by disabling text message backup. While
 this is a great temporary fix, I would really like to have all my text messages once I migrate to a new Windows Phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure there is&nbsp;a fix in the works but I wanted to start a thread for those who would also like to have Text Message Backup enabled for future use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just upgraded to GDR2/Amber Update and the problem persists. Perhaps this is a fix that's being baked into GDR3?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello mattmillerwastaken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you said you can sync your Microsoft account when turn of SMS back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is not fix at the moment.</p>
<p>But here are some steps you can try. This is temporary work around, not a solution:</p>
<p>
<b><i><span>Work around #1
</span></i></b><i><span>: Force a full sync on your Microsoft account
</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>1. Go to Settings &gt; Email + Accounts.
</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>2. Tap and hold Microsoft account, and tap Sync.
</span></i></p>
<p>
<b><i><span>Work around #2
</span></i></b><i><span>: Temporarily disable text message backup
</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>1. Go to Settings &gt; swipe to Applications, and tap Messaging.
</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>2. Swipe to turn Text message backup to Off.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>Nokia Maps and UK postcode search problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mosso85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Maps and UK postcode search problem</h2>
                    Nokia Maps - problem with UK post code search.<br />
I am so disappointed with Nokia Maps. (Free with new N95 8GB)<br />
With a map on screen I select ‘Options’/Find place/Address<br />
‘Options’/Select from contacts.<br />
Choose the contact and scroll down to post code.<br />
‘Options’/Search – searches using the WLAN connection to the web.<br />
Response – no results found.<br />
<br />
I need to visit a relative in Hospital.<br />
Find place/Address/City/Zip/type PO3 6AD<br />
Response – no results found.<br />
<br />
You have to know where you are going, find it on the map, mark it and save it as a landmark.<br />
Imagine doing this for the full contents of your contacts list.<br />
If all you have is a post-code, you are stuck, unless you have access to other services such as Windows ‘Live’, Google Earth, or multimap etc.<br />
<br />
My short-cut to success was to buy Navicore Personal. Not perfect, but at least it finds post-codes.<br />
<br />
Tried a free trial with Wayfinder 7, but I preferred Navicore.<br />
<br />
I already have Navicore on my Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, but it is not transferable to the N95. Had to buy it twice.<br />
<br />
My effort to combine mobile phone/camera/sat-nav, is proving to be a costly and time-consuming exercise. I have been a slave to the phone since buying it. Firmware upgrades/Map updates/do it all twice/pay for ‘Navigation’ (voice), in case it improves the basic
 Nokia Maps search function, and it does not.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I’m too early to the market, but the source of Nokia maps is the same old Tele Atlas/Navteq that other, more successful, systems are using.<br />
<br />
If I am using the wrong methods, I’d be pleased to accept advice.

            Hello mosso85, I'm afraid I don't have any advice for you, just a shared dissapointment in the Nokia satnav system, like you I was attracted to the N95 8GB for the in built GPS, but, the mapping system/guidance is 2nd rate - to say the least, I have managed
 to install tomtom 6 on mine - which is far superior, but, you have to use a bluetooth gps receiver, All the best, Blackie, :{

            Hi Blackie,<br />
Thank you for your response.<br />
What we are saying here is that we bought a Nokia product and then started shopping for a fix!<br />
If I worked for a company with a product like that, I would feel apologetic.<br />
Good luck with your Tom Tom software.
