            Works on my system 16199, maybe your best bet is to do a "clean" install, as over the course of using Beta Preview/Insiders I have had to do clean installs to get a system running properly. There is other helpers on the internet you might want to do a
 search and try others. &nbsp;your original posting you saying 199 won't update but this posting is showing 16193 &nbsp;

    <title>Basics&#58; Using Settings to customize Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Basics&#58; Using Settings to customize Windows</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><span>
<p>Windows 10 introduces a revised&nbsp;modern configuration app called Settings. Previously called PC Settings in Windows 8/8.1, Settings features familiar functionality available in the classic desktop Control Panel you have been using earlier versions of Windows.
 Some of the things you can use Settings for include changing window colors, manage installed programs, update Windows, connect to networks, adjust time and language, configure hardware and a myriad of other task.
</p>
</span>
<p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><span>
</span></p><p>To launch Settings, click Start &gt; Settings or press Windows key + i on your keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45d98859-6a28-4708-967d-5c15cfe9b9df" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>For our&nbsp;first customization, we&nbsp;will look at using Personalization to change the look and feel of Windows 10. Click on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57279d97-45fa-488a-9d17-ec45abd9d862" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Color tab and select a color choice you like. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/64f3bc74-ab62-4c74-bb85-d64c9eef93de" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can even have Windows automatically choose a color for you. Scroll down and you will see additional settings you can choose such as the parts of the interface you would like colors to be applied and the ability to make the Start menu and Taskbar transparent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f44270b1-f769-4e6c-9b17-94268d7b8acd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can apply different effects and appearances to your Start menu and Taskbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2abc5e6a-5ca7-4ca7-8ee4-30b970c6e6cb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are more granular options you would like to apply, click the Themes tab and choose from the available options. Here you can adjust sound, icons and mouse pointers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c79e04a5-fc92-485b-b9b5-85dec23382d5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So thats a look at using Settings to adjust the look and feel of your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Finding Settings</strong></p>
<p>If there is a specific setting you are looking for, you can use Find a setting to find it. See below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/284058ec-bf3e-4e16-a4b9-1abf0dff6cd4" /></p>
<p>In the above screenshot, I want add a printer. I am presented with relevant options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Pinning Commonly accessed Settings to Start</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9e94baf-28e8-45e2-b4e1-d3ff2133a119" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an area of Settings I commonly access, I can quickly access it by pinning a shortcut on my Start menu. Just lick the Push Pin icon which will change to indicate it is pinned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3878a536-b73b-454b-af0b-67f5ef485cc6" /></p>
<p>You will now be able to quickly access your favorite Setting quickly from the Start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there certain settings you are not able to find or you still prefer older Control Panel, you can still access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba74c490-ec80-4740-8950-20703904cca3" /></p>
<p>Press Windows key + X<br />
Click Control Panel </p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>From the Search box (Windows key + S)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd773d35-629a-463f-a53e-b28f3c22ab0c" /></p>
<p>Type: control Panel</p>
<p>You can right click and Pin it to the Taskbar or Start menu for quick access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thats the new Settings, go ahead and explore it. </p>

<h2>            How to create a quad diagram with Excel 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a very simple diagram with Excel 2016.</p>
<p>It is based on some values like these:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>X</td>
<td>3,8</td>
<td>6,6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Y</td>
<td>2,2</td>
<td>7,3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So I have 2 points on this chart, but instead of having this show up as 2 points or a line between these 2 points, I want these points to be the opposite corners of a rectangle. How do I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I need to use the X Y scatter chart type, right, or is this only for points and lines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how I can change the minimum and maximum values of the X and Y axis (in this case 1 to 9), but is there a way to split the diagram into 4 equal quadrants (splitting the chart right in the middle, both horizontally and vertically, and giving each quadrant
 a separate color)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcome would look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e1d5403-8da7-4277-b4a5-f8e7f25e0a55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e1d5403-8da7-4277-b4a5-f8e7f25e0a55" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>If it is not possible with Excel 2016 standard features, then I'll look for another solution for this.</p>

<h2>            Auto Logout Users for DB Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded the code for the auto logout users for DB maintenance found at: <a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/msaccess/article.php/3548586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.databasejournal.com/features/msaccess/article.php/3548586</a>; however, I cannot get the feature to work.&nbsp; It will display the message on my machine and auto log me out but other users in the database do not see the message and their use is not impacted.&nbsp;
 I thought it may be related to the version number that is assigned in the table because I am using Access 2010.&nbsp; I changed the version&nbsp;number&nbsp;but it is still not working.&nbsp; Any ideas or suggestions?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

            <p>You probably just got another Form_Open event already in the code window.</p>
<p>Do this:</p>
<p>While in the design view of the form open the properties sheet if it isn't already open. Select Form from the dropdown at the top of the properties sheet. This will select the form object itself.</p>
<p>Press F7. That will open the code window to the form's Load event. Use that event instead of the Open event. The result will be the same in this case.</p>
<p>In the emplty line between: </p>
<p><strong>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />
<br />
End Sub</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paste in my code:</p>
<p>On Error GoTo Err_Handler</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmLogoutTimer", , , , , acHidden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Exit_Here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
Err_Handler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_Here</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it ends up looking like this:</p>
<p><strong>Private Sub Form_Load()<br />
</strong></p>
<p>On Error GoTo Err_Handler</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmLogoutTimer", , , , , acHidden<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Exit_Here:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
Err_Handler:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox Err.Description, vbExclamation, "Error"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resume Exit_Here</p>
<p><br />
End Sub</p>
<p><br />
Save the form and try again.</p>

    <title>Not all contacts sync to Blackjack II - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not all contacts sync to Blackjack II</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
Most of my contacts show up on my phone when I sync but not all of them. I have deleted the contacts from the phone and re-synchronized, deleted the mobile device and recreated the connection and synchronized. Each time the same contacts seem to be left out
 of the sync. <br />
Any ideas???<br />

&nbsp;I even disabled my firewall, antivirus shut down other running programs, disabled my VPN, disabled my internet connection other USB connections and anything I could think of that might interrupt the TCP/IP stack. The contacts that do not sync are no different
 then the ones that do. I have 1125 contacts and only 101 of them sync. <br />
Any ideas?

<p>I am having a similar problem and have found that the reason for the items (this includes tasks, notes, and contacts) not syncing is some are saved to my main pst file and others are saved to the Livemail pst file (or whatever it is that is
 on my pc and used by Outlook for Livemail). The sync is successful with items in the main pst file but does not sync with the Livemail folders. The OP may be having the same root cause. I would like some way to by default save all items to the main pst file
 but if I am in the Livemail folder when adding an item it is saved to the Livemail folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to force all new items to be saved on the main pst file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Blackjack II, Outlook 2007, Vista Ultimate, Windows Livemail and Outlook Connector, and the latest WMDC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I have done as suggested without any changes. It will still sync the same 101 contacts. I have had the phone for about 3 or 4 months now. When I first got the phone and set up the sync it worked well, all of a sudden, it started having problems. I cannot
 corrolate the problem with any setting changes or software additions.<br />
Any other ideas?<br />

            I too of RECENT am having issues Sync Activesync4.5 with Windows Mobile 6 HTC Phone.<br />
It seems that many others are all over the last month or so which tends to make me believe its a software upgrade/patch with something.<br />
<br />
I am a techie and am pulling out my hair as I have reset (hard) the phone and uninstalled and CLEANED my registry and system files to no avail.<br />
<br />
I was hoping that it might be DAYLIGHT SAVINGS (which ended 2hrs ago) but again, no result!<br />
<br />
This is so frustrating as I need my phone for business<br />

<h2>            How do I stop Skype from using HTTP or HTTPS&#63;</h2>
                    I installed the Apache web server on my Windows 10 machine and I'm unable to start it because Skype.exe is already using HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443.<br />
I need Apache and Skype to co-exist on the same machine. How do I configure Apache to use other ports, or prevent Skype from listening on these ports?<br />

    <title>Array Sum formula using wildcard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jendingbat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Array Sum formula using wildcard</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>How does one use a wildcard in an array formula?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is the formula I'm using.</p>
<p>{=SUM((L2:L207=$B22)*(M2:M207=G$19))}</p>
<p>
</p><p>The values in column L are 6A, 6B, 6C, 5A etc to 3C</p>
<p>So B22 in the example is the reference to one of the above .</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if the value in colum L is 2A, 2B, or 2C, In an other cell I want them counted in one go because the breakdown isn't necessary.</p>
<p>Using =SUM(L2:L207="2*").... is not working neither is =*2?")....</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>
                </div>

<p>Thank you Vjay, </p>
<p>Worked perfectly.</p>
<p>couldn't get the ,"2?" to work with SUMPRODUCT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice on using =SUMPRODUCT for array formulas. Saves the ctrl + Shft + Entering.</p>
<p>Which is better =SUMPRODCUT or =COUNTIFS? (apart for the wildcard issue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SUMPRODUCT will not work for "2?". Would need other way to get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding which one is better,</p>
<p>Then COUNTIFS is much faster than SUMPRODUCT. So in case you are able to get desired results through countifs, then you should always use countifs only, otherwise SUMPRODUCT.</p>

            <p>I have resolved the problem, namely why no incoming emails to my Hotmail account that contained attachments, were received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that&nbsp; some how "auto protection" software has populated the rules within Hotmail to delete attachments together with a range of other incoming email addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore to correct -</p>
<p>1) Go to "more mail settings"</p>
<p>2) Select "Rules for sorting new messages"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and reviews the rules that have been set up. As mentioned, I did not set up the rules and some how, these got in there.</p>

<p>Good day:</p>
<p>I am planning to migrate our office to Office 365 Enterprise E1 and i'm currently testing the trial E3.</p>
<p>I want to know what does it take to migrate away, the cost implications in comparison to what we have now, the benefits for increasing cost if required and where the data will be stored, etc.</p>
<p>I need answers to all this information so that i can make an informed decision and demonstrate the advantages.</p>

<p>Hi OdunayoArifaga,</p>
<p>Based on your description, do you mean to migrate from your E3 trial plan to E1 plan?</p>
<p>If yes, you can buy the E1 plan under your E3 plan and then assign the E1 license to the users directly if you want to keep your E3 tenant. To buy more plans, please sign into
<b>Portal</b> (<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com</a>) with your admin account, navigate to
<b>Admin</b>—<b>BILLING</b>—<b>Subscriptions</b>, click <b>Add Subscriptions</b> to buy the E1 plan.</p>
<p>After the E1 plan is purchased, assign the license to the users via the steps below:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assign-or-unassign-licenses-for-Office-365-for-business-997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc</a></p>
<p>However, if you want to cancel your E3 plan and register a new tenant for E1 plan, I would like to explain that there is no directly way to migrate from one Office 365 tenant to another directly. We need to manually to do this. To migrate the mailboxes,
 you can use Outlook client to export the data a .PST file and then import it to your E1 account.</p>
<p>Here are the steps for your reference:</p>

<p>The data of your Office 365 accounts will be stored in Exchange Online server and SharePoint Online server.</p>

<h2>            Variable length horizontal line&#63;</h2>
                    This is hard to describe. &nbsp;I'm making a list that I save as a web page in Word 2007 to post online. &nbsp;I need horizontal lines to separate sections of text. &nbsp;But if I put a line in with a finite number of characters it will wrap on smaller resolution screens
 and not be long enough on high resolution screens. &nbsp;I want the line to be just long enough to go to the right end of each screen. &nbsp;Sort of like a page break I guess but it will be on the same line as some text (don't want to waste a line as screen real estate
 is valuable). &nbsp;I've never got page breaks to work properly in Word (I'm a nuubie user) so I'd like to use something else if possible. &nbsp;

            <p>Well, this is not a page border but a paragraph border, which is applied from Home | Paragraph | Bottom Border (the default state of the Borders button at the bottom right of the Paragraph group).</p>
<p>If you click the arrow beside the Borders button and click Borders and Shading at the bottom of the menu, you will get the Borders and Shading dialog. The Horizontal Line button is in the bottom left corner. This opens a dialog which allows you to choose
 among various types of "dividers," plain and fancy. The first one offered is a simple horizontal rule.</p>

<h2>            Several Questions About OneDrive URLs</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I am a managed service provider evaluating options for distributing files to my clients with my remote management software.&nbsp; I had a few questions about using URLs to download files from OneDrive.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use a URL to download a file directly as opposed to the link bringing the user to a page where the file can be downloaded?&nbsp; I need to be able to use a direct link to a file.</p>
<p>Do these links ever change or expire.&nbsp; I need to be able to set the link in a script and not worry about the link changing or expiring.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

to get a direct download link in onedrive for business, you can consider the following workaround:<br />
1. select the file in your onedrive for business, and then click <strong>get a link</strong> on the ribbon.<br />
2. click the drop down menu and select <strong>view link – no sign-in required</strong> or
<strong>edit link – no sign-in required</strong>.<br />

<h2>            my product key for visio will not work</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to install Visio 2013 Pro that I downloaded from Dreamspark. After resetting my computer to get back the Office 365 trial that was apparently necessary to install Visio, I now have Visio installed. However, it won't accept my product key
 that came with it, insisting that I sign in with an Office 365 account, which I do not have. Somehow or another I now have my Microsoft account linked to it, which I do NOT want, but even when I try to sign in with that one, it kicks it back because it is
 not an Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I activate my software?</p>

    <title>Word in Microsoft Office 2000 fails to install in my laptop with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kilovatio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word in Microsoft Office 2000 fails to install in my laptop with Windows 10. All the Microsoft classic programmes have installed correctly.</h2>
                    I have installed Microsoft Office 2000 in my laptop with Windows 10. All the Microsoft classic programmes have installed correctly. However, Word appears not to be installed. I tried to reinstall it but the same issue appears all over again. The strange
 thing is that when I click on 'Start' Word is on the list. That mean I can open Word and create a new document. But if I try to open a document which has been saved in the old Word version this cannot be converted to Word but only to Notepad or Word pad. Why
 is that? I have tried all possible ways to resolve this problem butnone of them worked. Hence I am now here asking for any suggestions. Thanks.

            Right-click a *.docx file in File Explorer and choose Open With; in the next window, choose the option to browse for more applications and specify Word (winword.exe) as the new default. Repeat this action for *.doc files, if necessary.<br />

            I don't believe Word 2000 can open .docx files, certainly not without the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. And even that may be iffy: on my system, Word 2003, with the Compatibility Pack, was perfectly happy to open .docx files until about a month
 ago when it suddenly started throwing an error.

    <title>All apps view below start screen view by choices when selected should - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tharok2  say:</h3>
<h2>            All apps view below start screen view by choices when selected should display ONLY that group</h2>
                    <p>I love windows 8/8.1 10 Preview, but I have an issue with the way the all apps screen works. Whenever you navigate to the all apps view, with touch or mouse, you have the option to view this list by category, date installed, most used etc etc. And you can
 also pinch or click down to category view of what ever sorted list options you choose. This is great. Except that when you select one of these options you are taken to a general area on the same apps list where this category of apps is located. Example, if
 I am viewing the list by category I can pinch to zoom down to a list of categories of apps I have installed. Then I can click on a category such as GAMES and it will take me to a general location on my apps view where all my games are located. The problem
 with this is that since all the other categories are&nbsp;NEIGHBORING the one&nbsp;GAMES group&nbsp;and&nbsp;that group&nbsp;is never displayed in a predictable location on screen, you still have to HUNT the list of apps for what you are looking for amongst the surrounding groups.
 This&nbsp;makes finding things with this feature&nbsp;harder than it should be. When I choose a category, GAMES for instance, the only thing that should be displayed is the list of games, minus the neighboring app groups. This way the only list I have to look through
 is MY GAMES, which would be a much shorter list, making&nbsp;the sorting feature much more useful. Of course I could just type the name of the&nbsp;game to find it right, true. But what if I can't remember the name of the Game? I think that is the reason this feature
 exists in the first place, to help locate apps you know you have installed but may not remember its exact name. It just doesn't work as well as it could. Hopefully this can be fixed in the final version of windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok that's my 2 cents. Thanks for listening.</p>

Thank you for posting in the forum!</p>
<p>For resolving issues with third party apps I could only have recommended the steps in this article:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could not find an email address. Therefore I can only recommend you ask a friend that may have a facebook or twitter account to submit the question or try another Calendar app.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please let me know if you have any further questions. </p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

    <title>spoofed email missing antispam report headers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            spoofed email missing antispam report headers&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently received a spoofed/phishing email that was received by EOP and delivered to my on-prem Exchange. &nbsp;When I used the Message Header Analyzer the spoofed message didn't have the usual section with the Forefront Antispam Report Header and Microsoft
 Antispam Header. &nbsp;These sections usually breakout the SCL, filtering verdict, IP filter verdict, bulk complaint level, and phishing confidence level. &nbsp;This message had none of that. No&nbsp;X-Microsoft-Antispam, X-Microsoft-Exchange-Diagnostics, or SpamDiagnosticMetadata.
 &nbsp;How is this possible? &nbsp;Did it somehow bypass the EOP scanning? &nbsp;</p>
