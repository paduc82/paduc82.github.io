<h2>            Setting up email using office365 free accounts and my own domain name</h2>
                    How do I set up the free email accounts that come with office 365 for educators?&nbsp; I want to use my domain name to do this and am having some challenges figuring out how to go about setting it all up.<br />
At this point, I'm not seeing where I go to set up the email accounts, let alone how to create them using my domain name... been looking and reading help posts for about an hour and still not seeing anything remotely helpful.<br />
<br />
Once this is all set up, my understanding is that I can use exchange to set up email and calendar synch on my android device...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Wendy<br />

            <p>You can set up your domain on the outlook.com/Hotmail servers at domains.live.com.&nbsp; You'll add the account to Outlook as an Outlook.com account type, using the server name m.hotmail.com and on the android as a Hotmail, &nbsp;ActiveSync or Exchange account (which
 type depends on your mail app). </p>

    <title>Hotmail being hacked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hotmail being hacked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that my junk folders have few emails which sent from my own email address in different languages which I didnt know/speak.</p>
<p>I believe that my email has been hacked/compromised and I have changed the password.</p>
<p>But now after few weeks it happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change the password but I didn't get the verification code, same like the first instance.</p>
<p>So, I went through the long process of confirming my own email through certain verification of email sent, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read an article before which explained that if I don't get the verification code to change my password, it means the hacker still have access to my email although I have reset password?&nbsp;(kinda like a thief who has access from the back door?)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyone know why and how can I stop this hacker from doing that/accessing my email?</span></p>
<p><span>I found that my hotmail has more issues/being compromised compares to gmail.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone experience the same? I use my email mainly for work purpose, not for signing up some "dodgy/weird website".</span></p>
<p><span>Please help me to solve this issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Any feedback or kind advice will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>JB</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no migration needing to be done. You may have an</p>
<p>accountname @ Hotmail.com address but you're using the outlook.com interface on the outlook.com website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the spam being sent to you that appears to be coming from your account, you should simply delete these messages. They will eventually stop or come in much smaller numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These aren't really being sent from your account. The spammers are simply putting your address in the From field. It's a common practice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a mail rule to delete these or send hem to Spam will be more that&nbsp;it's worth and reporting these as Spam or Junk might result in legitimate mails from you being blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing your password is a good idea. As for the verification code you didn't receive, is it in Spam/Junk?</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I will change the password again and hopefully it wont get hack again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, the verification code didnt go to any spam or junk, and it was the second time happened to me in the last 2weeks after I firstly noticed the junk email.</p>
<p>I had to verify my own email through the process like confirming the recent email address I have sent etc, subject, etc. and wait till Microsoft confirms that email belongs to me. It was kind of long process, but I will do it if I still dont get the verification
 code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the history of unaothorised purchase if there are any and thankfully there was none.</p>
<p>Also, no mails forwarding set-up to any other email address. So, next time I will just delete those junk. Thank you everyone, it was great to know someone out there do care. I really appreciate it. I thought I might be in this hacker loop forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(To those hackers anywhere in the world, please use your knowledge for something constructive, dont just take advantage from plain user like me or someone else out there for your personal gain/game/fun)</p>

    <title>Bug with O365 Video playback freezes when skipping along timeline - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug with O365 Video playback freezes when skipping along timeline</h2>
                    
<p>I have come across a problem where if and O365 Video is skipped greater than 10 minutes along the timeline (say move the playhead to 10:38 of a video), it freezes and won’t play (although the playhead and timer keeps moving). Seems to happen in Chrome, Firefox
 and IE11.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to solve this problem or are Microsoft working on it?</p>

<p>Yes it seems to be a cloud transcoding issue, I uploaded the troublesome video again and it was fine. &nbsp;It was a large file over 1Gb so maybe that was the problem. &nbsp;I did upload a different video and it didn't fully upload and never finished transcoding.
 &nbsp;I had to delete that one and upload again.</p>
<p>So far my experiences with Office 365 video have been rather mixed, I am used to uploading massive files to YouTube and never experience an issue and the transcoding rate is at least twice as fast Office 365 video. It would be nice if there was a processing
 progress bar. </p>

    <title>Decimal data type - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Decimal data type</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have Decimal data type listed in Excel's data type , but we cannot dim a variable as Decimal&nbsp;. There is also a function which converts&nbsp;a number to Decimal CDec() . It seems Decimal is kind of mixed with variant data type in VBA ( not the case in .net)
 .</p>
<p>I couldn't find any atricle explaining the reason we have this data type listed in Excel and having a conversion function but not being able to dim a variable as decimal, or a technical discussion on the advantage&nbsp;or disadvatage of converting a number using
 CDec () vs. using a double data type, beside the speed.</p>
<p>For a highly accurate calculations these details are important and someone should have some sort of explanation for it ??</p>

            Actually, Decimal is not a data type... it is a sub-type of the Variant data type. Here is a combination of two posts I given in the past may be of some help<br />
or interest to you...<br />
<br />
You could cast (you can't Dim) a Variant variable as a Decimal type (96-bit number) and get some 28 or 29 digits of accuracy depending if there is a decimal in the answer or not. Simply Dim a variable as Variant and CDec a number (any number will do) into it
 to make it the Decimal type. Thereafter, that variable will track 28/29 digits of accuracy. For example the following function will calculate factorials up to 29 digits of display before reverting to exponential display.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Function BigFactorial(ByVal N As Integer) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If N &lt; 28 Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BigFactorial = CDec(1)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Else<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BigFactorial = CDbl(1)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For x = 1 To N<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BigFactorial = x * BigFactorial<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next<br />
&nbsp; End Function<br />
<br />
However, you have to watch out for overflows with Decimal data types -- once over 28/29 characters, they will produce an overflow error. So, if you tried to use the above function like this<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Debug.Print 10*BigFactorial(27)<br />
<br />
you would get an overflow error but<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Debug.Print 10*BigFactorial(28)<br />
<br />
would work fine (the difference being in the first case BigFactorial has a Decimal subtype and in the second case the subtype is a Double).<br />
<br />
More generally, if a Variant variable is assigned a value that was cast to Decimal, any calculation involving that variable will be "performed" as a Decimal; and then the result cast back to the variable receiving it. If the result is assigned back to the variable
 that was originally cast to Decimal, that variable continues to contain a Decimal type value. &nbsp;For example,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X = CDec(135.6)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X = X - 135<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X = X / 7<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Print X &nbsp; ==&gt; &nbsp;0.0857142857142857142857142857<br />
<br />
You have to be careful with this though . . . all VB functions return non-Decimal data.and assigning *that* back to the Variant that was cast as Decimal "collapses" it back to a less robust data type. For example, continuing the code above<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X = Sqr(X)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Print X &nbsp; ==&gt; &nbsp; 0.29277002188456<br />

<p><span>Okay thanks. it seems we can achieve higher accuracy and avoid round up errors if we cast variant variable to decimal in financial calculations ( as long as the number –including
 its decimals – has less than 28 digits) <span>&nbsp;</span>. I think this is very important especially is simulation code which potentially round up errors can occur. In a simple loop of 1M iterations Decimal is 2.5 times slower than Variant or Double.

<blockquote><span>&nbsp;In a simple loop of 1M iterations Decimal is 2.5 times slower than Variant or Double.</span></blockquote>
That sort of makes sense if you think about it... when processing a Double (whether stored in a Double or Variant data type), VB is basically processing 32 bit memory space&nbsp;per number; however, when processing a number that is a Decimal sub-type, it has to
 process a&nbsp;96 bit&nbsp;memory space&nbsp;per number... 96 is 3 times larger than 32. Since to process a Double requires VB to breakout the mantissa from the exponent (stored in that 32 bit memory space) and combine it into a "real" number,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;guess it might&nbsp;take
 slightly longer process than if the number were a straight integer value (which a Decimal sub-type is, sort of), so instead of taking a full 3 times longer, it should take slightly less... 2.5 times longer seems like a&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;factor to me.

            <p>What twitter application are you using? Have you gone through the OAUTH procedure to approve the application so it can be used with your twitter account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Twitter changes&nbsp;its approval procedures from time to time and the 3rd party developers usually have to update their software to continue working...this means the end users are required to update the software.&nbsp; Have you checked to see if you are running
 the latest version of software on your phone.</p>

<h2>            UPDATE&#58; Audio issues in Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 9879</h2>
                    <p>Hello Insiders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We received a lot of great feedback concerning audio problems with build 9860. We have been working to understand and resolve these problems, and I wanted to provide you with an update on two of them for Build 9879.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the first problem audio would stop working, however everything looked fine with the system. If you investigated further you would find that the audio meters in the volume control would not move even when audio was playing, and the Windows Audio service
 (audiosrv) had stopped and needed to be restarted. We believe we’ve fixed this problem in Build 9879.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second problem seemed similar in that no sound could be heard, however in this case the audio meters would move when sound was played and the Windows Audio service was running correctly. In some variations of the bug audio would work from some outputs
 but not others (i.e. headphones would work but not speakers, or vice versa). In most cases this problem was fixed by downloading and reinstalling the audio drivers from your OEM’s web site. We believe we understand this problem, but we need to collect more
 data to fully solve it. If you experience this problem we would really appreciate your help. Here’s what you can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. While you seeing the problem, run dxdiag.exe<br />
2. If asked to check signatures click "Yes"<br />
3. Click "Save all information" and name the output file “before.txt”.<br />
4. Download and install the audio drivers from your OEM and confirm that the issue is resolved.<br />
5. Create a second DxDiag.txt and name the output file “after.txt”.<br />
6. Send both DxDiag files and a link to the new driver that you installed to "mediaq at Microsoft dot com".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more examples we can find, the more complete our fix will be for this audio problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, we appreciate your help in making Windows a better product!</p>
<p>
</p><p>John W [MSFT]</p>

            Build 9879 killed my High Definition HDMI and DisplayPort audio outputs. Using&nbsp;2 external Asus PB278 monitors&nbsp;connected to&nbsp;Dell M3800. One connected with DisplayPort the other with HDMI. Audio meters are showing sound going out but no sound on the monitors.
 Only notebook internal speakers can play sound. Restarting audiosrv does not help.&nbsp; Installed latest Intel HD Graphic 4600&nbsp;drivers with audio driver and latest Nvidia Quadro K1100M but nothing helps. Any remedies to try out?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Fixed my problem by switching to 24bit audio and doing some other things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disabled Nivida Quadro K1100M in Device Manager, because when enabled it causes the mouse to freeze for up to a second when opening IE 11 and scrolling.</li><li>Right click speaker icon in taskbar &gt;&nbsp;Playback Devices &gt; Asus PB278 &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; switch to
<strong>24 bit, 96000 Hz.</strong></li><li>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Display\Screen Resolution &gt; Select one monitor at the time and&nbsp;then &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Monitor &gt;&nbsp; Screen Refresh Rate:
<strong>60 Hz</strong> &gt;&gt;&gt; make sure all monitors are 60 Hz and not 59 Hz</li></ol>
<p>The most important thing was to <strong>switch to </strong><strong>24 bit </strong>
<strong>96000 Hz audio</strong>, because in 16 bit audio would only show the meters moving but no sound output through HDMI or DisplayPort. At 24 bit and 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz the sound would fail (with meters moving) when one of the external monitors was unplugged.
 In addition,&nbsp;flash video playing&nbsp;in IE 11 would change to&nbsp;slow motion (50%)&nbsp;and the sound would go away until&nbsp;I switched&nbsp;sound output back to notebook speakers. In this setting, plugging the monitors back in would not bring the sound back, enabling, disabling
 would not help either. Only a system reboot would bring the sound back with 24 bit 48 khz and 24 bit 44.1 kHz.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However <strong>24 bit 96 kHz&nbsp;gives no&nbsp;problems</strong> with sound or slow motion video&nbsp;when unplugging external monitors. Audio&nbsp;can be switched form notebook speakers to HDMI to DisplayPort&nbsp;and the flash video plays fine. When monitors are plugged back
 in while the flash video plays the sound switches back to HDMI or Display port depending on the last configuration. Everything works as expected and no slow motion video problems occur. Its crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Intel HD Graphic driver is 10.18.10.3907 (the most recent driver that can be installed on&nbsp;Build 9879)&nbsp;and my Intel Display Audio driver is 6.16.0.3155 (installed manually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps someone.</p>

<p>Hey Betty, in classic Microsoft Fashion, the link you provided doesn't work. &nbsp;Below is Screen Shot 1, which clearly indicates that I should be paying $150 per User, and have 19 Users. &nbsp;(4150.00 X 19 = $2,850)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/09ed9c08-b1c2-4e0c-a86a-d38e633f1fc1?upload=true" /></p>
<p>Screen Shot 2, indicates that you've received Payments totaling $2,492.31.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2cc1f09-3447-408f-a7b4-1b645fc634eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2cc1f09-3447-408f-a7b4-1b645fc634eb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Screen Shot 3 is an Email, letting me know my Credit Card expired.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc588451-f1cd-4633-abe2-2572eb1f4c70?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc588451-f1cd-4633-abe2-2572eb1f4c70?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Screen Shot 4, shows that you've sent me an Invoice for $412.90.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5edf681e-112a-4e8d-b59b-b648ce0a2ad4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5edf681e-112a-4e8d-b59b-b648ce0a2ad4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>$2,492.31 + 412.90 = $2,905.21</p>
<p>
</p><p>$2,905.21 - $2,850.00 = $55.21</p>
<p>
</p><p>So clearly, you are attempting to over charge me for my 19 Licenses. &nbsp;I am hesitant to update my Credit Card to facilitate this over charging scheme ad it is impossible to connect with an actual human being and once you take my money, I'll never get it back.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia C3-00 firmware update v8.70 problems.</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hello, I found some problems in my Nokia C3-00 after updating it into v8.70. I can't open/play any application except those original applications from Nokia like Bounce, etc.. I am not also able to open the Store application.
 Whenever I try to open it, it says that there is a conflicting application which is itself. I asked here before and someone said that I must try to reinstall the firmware. I tried to reinstall but the same problems happen. What should I do now? Please help
 me to fix this problem. Happy Valentine's Day to all of you.&nbsp;:heart:&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</font></p>

<br />
thanks for the valentine's day wish ;).<br />
<br />
if you have tried re-installing your current firmware, your only other option you can try is to Restore your phone to factory settings. Failing that, you will need to take your phone to Nokia Care for inspection:

            v8.70 and v8.71 contained the same number of features and improvements in the update, but differed in versioning number due to region. Check via Nokia Suite if there are any firmware updates for your device, otherwise what is stated is the latest firmware
 version for your phone.

            This error code has nothing to do with ramdisk. 0xc0000017 means <em>not enough virtual memory
</em>available. VM is the sum of RAM memory&nbsp;plus the size of the paging file, in your case VM is larger than 16GB. If this occurs during update, do as Joe suggest and remove all AV programs,&nbsp;else, post back here.

            <p>I have windows defender as my constant on AV, I have Spybot search and destroy installed but not running actively, I use its passive mode.&nbsp; The immunization function to protect agents malware, and have for about 10 years.&nbsp; Other then them I have malewarebytes
 though it is never run passively or actively, it is set to just be their when I need it, updated of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as I said above I did take every thing out of my usb ports save for my mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; As for VM, you mean where it says in task manager committed?&nbsp; I know back in the 486 days how to tell that but now I don't exactly know any more.</p>

            <p>Yes, Committed x/yGB, where x is the amount in use,&nbsp;and y is available.&nbsp;x+y is total&nbsp;VM.</p>
<p>When you have AV's installed they are not passive. AV's operate at the kernel level, they are implemented as Filter drivers that get injected in the IO driver stack (File System, Network, ...), they aren't passive when injected in the driver stack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore uninstall all but Defender and your 0xc0000017 will be gone.</p>

            <p>First off I am not mad or in any way thinking less of anyone just annoyed at ms.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling everything I have that is AV/antimalware or just antimalware then redownloaded the update and shot for another install and nope got the same error 0xc0000017.&nbsp;
 Also I did disable windows defender too.</p>

            <p>So I fixed my&nbsp;own problem. &nbsp;For anyone having this&nbsp;try this instead.&nbsp; 1)Check and update&nbsp;_all_ drivers and&nbsp;firmware.&nbsp; Try the beta ones if necessary.&nbsp; 2)Make sure if you tried&nbsp;uninstalling your&nbsp;anti-virus that it&nbsp;completely uninstalled.&nbsp; I found a task scheduler&nbsp;task
 still lingering and a registry entry related to the task.&nbsp; 3)Open&nbsp;the settings panel &gt;&nbsp;update &amp; security&nbsp;&gt; advanced options and&nbsp;untick the sign me in after update. &nbsp;4)Completely remove&nbsp;every file in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution folder.&nbsp; When it tells you
 that it can not delete a file you will have to temporally stop some of the windows services.&nbsp; 4a)Stop: Background intelligent transfer service,&nbsp;Update orchestrator&nbsp;service for windows update, and windows update. &nbsp;_Remember_ _only_ Stop them not&nbsp;disable or
 change the start up. &nbsp;4b)Try again to delete the files it said&nbsp;it&nbsp;could not&nbsp;before.&nbsp; This will completely remove the&nbsp;update and all traces of any attempts.&nbsp; 5)Run clean disk, and/or Ccleaner by preform, to clear up as much space as possible.&nbsp; 6)Optional,&nbsp;run
 all the windows trouble shooter as admin, and&nbsp;go to device manager select view &gt; Show hidden&nbsp;uninstall old devices that you have removed. &nbsp;Also while your their you can also update&nbsp;some drivers right from here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is every thing I did other then doing a clean install of my graphics card.&nbsp; That I got&nbsp;the update to work.&nbsp; Also I had&nbsp;Malwarebytes and Spybot Search and destroy&nbsp;fully up and running when I got it to work so I put little&nbsp;credit to the your&nbsp;anti spyware
 and&nbsp;anti virus had anything to do with a memory&nbsp;issue.&nbsp; The 0xc0000017 has to do with either bad memory on your board or in your device.&nbsp; Or the update, as this one dose, require a continuous amount of&nbsp;free space in memory.&nbsp; Meaning&nbsp;it can not be: &nbsp;{program}&nbsp;[free
 space]&nbsp; {program}&nbsp;[free space]&nbsp;ect.&nbsp; Hope that helps.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows Phone vulnerable to FREAK ATTACK&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin dob&#237;k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone vulnerable to FREAK ATTACK&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am puzzled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I visit&nbsp;<a href="https://freakattack.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">freakattack.com</a>&nbsp;from my Windows Phone (updated to latest updates; Lumia 820), it tells me that my browser (the Internet Explorer) is vulnerable to FREAK ATTACK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, the Microsoft <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/MS15-031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
security bulletin</a> does not mention anything about it! What is worse, there is no hope for any update coming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I miss something? Or are the Windows Phones not meant to be secure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody explain please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With thanks in advance for any clues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martin</p>

            <p>First, don't panic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FREAK requires a middle man, an infected network, to forcefully reduce the encryption on the connection to vulnerable servers. I believe the attacker also needs both the server and the client to be vulnerable for this to work. Even though the carriers prevent
 patching of Windows Phone faster than actual Windows, as long as the server is patched, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're also good as long as you're not connecting to random, untrusted WiFi networks all the time.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I was using the phone for banking. I will refrain from doing so. Until an official statement is published, at least. Unfortunately, untrusted wifi networks are not the only way to get in-the-middle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also understand that a good practice is to not to publish information about vulnerability, if there is no patch available. That is probably the reason why we didn't explicitly hear about it. Though the bulletin talks about all supported Windows versions.
 While in the list some of them are skipped (Windows Phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, if the freakattack.com would tell me I am safe I wouldn't panic. I am afraid, this way most of the users will think they are safe. But most of the hackers now know that there is an easy prey out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other worrying thing is the speed of patching the Windows phone.</p>

            <p>If you were explicitly made aware of every security vulnerability computer devices had, most average users wouldn't understand what it meant and freak out completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Banking on your mobile would be fine on your home WiFi unless you have reason to believe your home network is compromised.</p>

            <p>That's true. I was perhaps more upset about the lack of information/information hiding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that very good picture of TLS security is given on Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also states that Windows Phone IE is vulnerable to FREAK. So I am not the only one who noticed. It is vulnerable to few other things too, like POODLE. It also prefers to use cipher suits that do not provide perfect forward secrecy. My trust is getting
 lower :(</p>

            <p>Martin, you are quite right about this (your initial thoughts) - its very lame and shows that Microsoft isn't taking the security of WP and its users seriously. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the only major mobile OS that isn't patched and there's no word on it (iOS, Android and BlackBerry all patched it). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to fix this - waiting till Windows 10 comes out at the end of the year isn't a viable solution. &nbsp;Microsoft also needs to come up with a way to roll out security patches to WP users quickly without interference from mobile wireless vendors.</p>

<p>The environment in question is Server 2012 R2 Standard with Active Directory Domain Services. I have set up DirSync primarily for Office 356 population (completed) and password sync. I now need to add additional email aliases, but with DirSync live, I need
 to edit objects through the in-house instances.</p>
<p><br />
How can I add additional email addresses to user objects through Active Directory? We have no Exchange server. Do I need to remove the sync an manage all through the Cloud?</p>

    <title>IE11 display &#34;disconnects&#34; from window even though process - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bimmerdriver  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE11 display &#34;disconnects&#34; from window even though process seems to be operating</h2>
                    <p>I posted about this in the&nbsp;technet forum and was recommended there to post here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using IE11 on an HP ZBook 15 G2 which has built-in Intel HD 4600 and NVidia quadro k2100m graphics. The OS is windows 7 enterprise 64 bit. I've tried configuring ie11 to run using the intel and the NVidia graphics, but it didn't make any difference.
 I've also tried numerous versions of intel and NVidia driver versions and there was no difference. There has been a full OS reinstallation along the way and that didn't make any difference either, so I'm assuming this is a problem with IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the display area within the window freezes, eve though the IE11 process seems to be operating. I assume that because if I refresh the tab, I can see the address bar update. I can also see the task manager thumbnail update. Occasionally,
 if I suspend and resume the computer, the problem goes away, but usually, I just kill all of the IE11 processes and reopen them. This is very annoying and I'm wondering if there is a fix.</p>

            <p><span>Hello, </span></p>
<p><br />
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that you’re facing issues with Internet Explorer on your PC running Windows 7 enterprise. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It might be caused due to changes in Internet Explorer settings, some add-ons also may cause this issue. If the issue is specific to some websites then it might be due to compatibility.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to run the fixit provided in the following article and see if it helps you to fix the issue. This fixit diagnose and repair IE problems that make IE slow, not secure, unstable or
 crash, caused by add-ons not working or inappropriate security settings. </span>
</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Fixit doesn't help, let’s try these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There could possibly be a problematic add-on which might be causing the problem. Let’s try the following to see if an add-on is causing this issue. We can do this by running Internet Explorer
 in <strong><span>No Add-ons</span></strong> mode. If the problem is not present in No Add-ons mode we can diagnose that it is an add-on that is causing the issue, and from there we can take steps to locate and disable
 the add-on. To open <strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong> in
<strong><span>No Add-ons mode</span></strong>, please do the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open the desktop, and then tap or click the Internet&nbsp;Explorer icon on the taskbar.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click the
<strong><span>Tools</span></strong> button, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Manage add-ons</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under <strong><span>Show</span></strong>, tap or click
<strong><span>All add-ons</span></strong>, and then select the add-on you want to turn off.</span></li><li>
<span>Tap or click <strong>
<span>Disable</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<strong><span>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</span></strong></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more clarification you may refer to the link provided below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the browser cache and check. Follow these steps to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Start Internet Explorer 11.<br />
b. On the <strong><span>Tools </span>
</strong>menu, click <strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>. If you can't see the Tools menu, press Alt to display the menus.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.<br />
d. Under <strong><span>Browsing History</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Delete</span></strong>.<br />
e. In the <strong><span>Delete Browsing History</span></strong> dialog box, click to select the following check boxes, and then click
<strong><span>Delete:</span></strong><strong><br />
<strong><span>Temporary Internet Files , Cookies , History</span></strong></strong><br />
f. Click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong> to close the
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists and the issue is specific to some websites then&nbsp;I would suggest you to open that websites in compatibility view and see if it helps.

            <p>Last night, I tried to run the performance tool. It didn't tell me anything conclusive about IE so I decided to take another step.&nbsp;I deleted the entire internet temporary files, removed add-ons and reset IE to default. I'll provide an update after I use
 it for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered an issue doing this. It appears that Microsoft in its infinite (lack of) consideration of its users, gutted the website where the accelerators used to be. I can't find the accelerator for google maps or google translate. If anyone knows where
 I can find them, I'd be most appreciative.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Further to the previous update, the problem is still occurring. It happens mostly on a few websites, such as my bank and also yahoo mail. I tried using the Windows P function to switch between different outputs. Occasionally, switching to the duplicate
 mode causes the window to refresh. In one case, it was set to 640x480 resolution. I could not get it to switch back. This must be a bug in IE11.

<p>
</p><p>I have a Lumia 550. Out of the blue the Outlook email has stopped working. Soft reset doesn't improve things. Opening Outlook gives a full screen of emails. If I try to open an email it reverts to the Outlook icon on the start page.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel v16.11 Crashes When Typing Formula</h2>
                    When I open a fresh workbook and type '=' in a cell the program crashes. I've fresh installed Microsoft Office (9 gigs because I can't install just Excel on its own) without luck. I'm using&nbsp;Mac OS High Sierra version&nbsp;10.13.2 (17C88). Please help, I am
 a university economics student and have homework due.

            No luck. It's a fresh project, none except one of the suggestions within the link you provided apply: "Open in the latest version of Excel". I am using a Excel version 16.11.

            Hello Dylan,
<br />
<br />Try the following troubleshooting from this link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/975724/excel-for-mac-error-the-application-microsoft-excel-quit-unexpectedly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/975724...</a>
<br />
<br />If not help ill suggest to do a rollback version
<br />
<br />Lately  Office 16.xxx version has been released and some features not working, you can try to rollback Office version to a previous one version that was working fine, take a look to the following link: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-go-back-to-office-2016-for-mac-15-xx-versions-from-16-xx-e88ed6c8-6fb4-40a1-9540-529000d3d20f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>
