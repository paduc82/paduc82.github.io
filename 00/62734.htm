            Hi RD.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Are you doing a Clean Install or Upgrading from Windows Update or Media Creation Tool?  When exactly does this error appear?  Are you trying to insert a Product Key which is not used for a Digital LIcense?  
<br />
<br /> I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. This is the most stable method to change versions and avoids buggy Windows Updates and Update Assistant.  
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't run the Upgrade, this can mean your install is corrupted and would have problems.  What we've found in Windows 10 is that everything depends upon the quality of the install.  You can follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to wait then if it is pushing itself you can block the Version Update until the next one and then try installing it the same way.  The latest version 1903 should be released any day now:  
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Confusing Network connection problems in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Confusing Network connection problems in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just this week got a new computer whch runs Windows 7 as opposed to XP on my old system. &nbsp;I am using the router that I used with my old system and when I set it up first time it worked perfectly, recognising the network and accepting my secure key
 and connecting to the internet no problem. &nbsp;However, I switched off to do other things and when I logged on again it did not automatically connect to the network as it should but instead my network shows but has a red cross next to it and the error message
 'the settings saved on this computer do not match the requirements for the network'. I have not changed anything about my settings (like the password) since I set it up so I don't know what that means. &nbsp;I phoned TalkTalk (my broadband provider) but they could
 not help.</p>
<p>I looked for some advise online and found various pieces of advice about changing my settings to Open (this did not work) but without much success.</p>
<p>The confusing thing for me is, if I remove the wireless network and recreate it, it suddenly works. &nbsp;The reason this is confusion though, is that after I have connected (by pushing the button on the side of my router) I get a message saying the network was
 not recognised but then it connects me anyway. &nbsp;My network still shows with a red x next to it with same message about the settings not matching but at the top it says currently connected to TALKTALK-80552E and it shows the same in Network and Sharing Centre.</p>
<p>I am confused as to why I am connected to the internet if the computer doesn't recognise the settings and I don't really want to have to remove my connection everyday to use it. &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions? &nbsp;Should I get a new router? &nbsp;Should I go
 back to an ethernet connection? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not very tech savvy and I am worried that I am connecting in a way that I shouldn't or is harmful to my computer. &nbsp;Apologies for the long post. &nbsp;I am stumped</p>

            <p>Hello Lynsey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, I understand that wireless internet connection on your computer disconnects and reconnects after recreating the wireless connection. Also, the network connection status indicator at the system tray always have a red x even when the
 computer is connected to internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you get any error message when wireless internet connection disconnects?</li><li>Does the wireless bar icon at the system tray shows red X or the Ethernet cable icon?</li><li>Were there any significant hardware or software changes made prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wireless network router has a limited broadcast range. The further the computer is from the router, the weaker the broadcast signal. Solid objects, such as walls, metal furniture, and electrical appliances might interfere with the signal and decrease the
 usable range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For testing purposes, move the computer closer to the router and minimize interference from electrical devices. If testing the connection with the computer near to the router proves that the wireless connection does not disconnect at a significant interval,
 you can move the computer to determine the range of the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possibly, the wireless connection reset itself after a certain interval and in the process internet connection disconnects and reconnects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to run Windows in-built network troubleshooter to get the problem automatically detected and fixed.</p>
<p>Refer the article below to run network troubleshooter. </p>
<p><strong>Using the network troubleshooter in Windows 7.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>This issue can also be related to network adaptor, resetting, updating driver, disabling, re-enabling, uninstalling and reinstalling network adaptor may help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps in the article below to fix network adaptor problems.</p>

            <p>Hi Rajesh</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Once connected to the internet the connection seems to remain ok. The problem is establishing this connection in the first place. &nbsp;Instead of connecting automatically every time I log on the system tray on the toolbar shows my network (TALKTALK-80552E)
 with the red x and the setting message I described before. &nbsp;If I remove the wireless network and go through the connection process again, it does connect to the internet. &nbsp;I get a message saying that the computer could not find the network, but then it connects
 anyway. &nbsp;Once it is established the connection seems to be working fine. &nbsp;All lights on the router are as they should be and I can access web pages. &nbsp;I have to remove the wireless network and reconnect again every single time I log on in order to get connected
 to the internet</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;The error is in the system tray for wireless connection. &nbsp;I have not attempted to connect using an ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;I have not added any significant software or hardware since I initially set the computer up. &nbsp;The system went through some windows updates the first time I logged off and the next time I logged on was when I started to have problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried the troubleshooter but no problems were detected. &nbsp;It was also suggested that I change the adapter security settings to Open but this did not work. &nbsp;They defaulted back to what they should be</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached two screenprints to show what I see on my computer. &nbsp;The red x can been seen in the system tray but it also says I am connected to the network and the Network and Sharing Centre in Control Panel stays the same but I only got it to this by
 removing the network time and time again</p>

            <p>Hello Lynsey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for quick response and keeping us updated about the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try connecting through wired network and check if it connects? Was the result same?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>This issue usually occurs on wireless network connections. I suggest that you turn off any security feature of wireless by following the steps below.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong> and access <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Double-click on <strong>Network Connections</strong> </li><li>Right click on the <strong>wireless adapter</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>Choose <strong>Wireless Networks</strong>, click on <strong>your wireless network name</strong> and
<strong>choose properties</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Network Authentication</strong> choose Open to turn off the <strong>
wireless security</strong>. </li><li>Please try to <strong>connect</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I suggest that you delete the connection, and recreate the wireless network connections. The following website may help you on creating the wireless connection.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Setting-up-a-wireless-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Setting-up-a-wireless-network</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest to reinstall the wireless adapter driver, and re-create the connection again.
</p>
<p><strong>Steps to&nbsp;remove the adapter driver</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.</li><li>Expand "Network Adapters", double-click on the entry of the wireless network device.</li><li>Click the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".</li><li>Click Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. </li><li>Remove the entries related to the wireless network adapter.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then reinstall the driver with your driver CD of from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. After installing, re-create the connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also access the link and try to follow the steps to troubleshoot network related issues on computer:</p>

<p>&nbsp; I would like to suggest a few methods and enquire some things!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are connecting using a PSK Connection(I mean you enter the 8 digit no. right?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; You should either try using your WPA/WPA2-PSK/WEP password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Open network and sharing center --&gt;Manage Wireless Networks --&gt; </p>
<p>Delete your current network and then try adding it again.</p>
<p>Does this happen if you try connecting to some other network?</p>
<p />

<p>I've just got the Microsoft Surface Pro and I can't find the bird wallpaper with the black background anywhere, the one that was on the adverts. I was wondering where it is, I've scrolled through all of the themes and I can't find it.</p>

<br />I am not sure which one you are referring to, but I do remember these two. You can just download the images and make them your wallpaper if you like.

                    <p>I have several computers in use at home.&nbsp; My office workstation has Windows 7 Pro and is used everyday.&nbsp; I encrypted three flash drives of different makes and&nbsp;capacities&nbsp;using&nbsp;one of my&nbsp;Windows 8.1 computers intending to be able to use them on all my computers.&nbsp;
 These drives will unlock successfully in all my computers (Windows 7 Pro, Ultimate, 8.1 Pro&nbsp;&amp; 10 Pro)&nbsp;except my office workstation.&nbsp; The error states "BitLocker Unlock Wizard has stopped working" and upon closing this dialog box, the unlock&nbsp;wizard box closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time the unlock fails, an event is recorded in Event Viewer.&nbsp; Two alternating errors are recorded (one each time the unlock fails).&nbsp; They are copied below.</p>

    <title>Rocketfish Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauladunagan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rocketfish Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have a rocketfish blue tooth keyboard that suddenly quit working. I have changed the batteries. No help. I changed the batteries again. Still no help. I moved the usb receiver to a different usb port, still no help. I went into my bluetooth devices and
 it shows the keyboard is connected. I disconnected the keyboard and reconnected to it. Still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In looking at the rocketfish manual, it states that if it is flashing green, your keyboard is pairing. If it is flashing red, the battery power is low. I can't find anything in their manual that says anything about flashing red, then green, alternately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love some help on this? I am clueless at this point. Thanks so much</p>

<p>Hi Paula, </p>
<p>
</p><p>One common reason why your third-party mouse doesn't work with your computer is due to compatibility issue. To have this checked, we suggest that you use a different bluetooth-enabled mouse to your computer. Also, try connecting the mouse in question to
 different computers and observe if they do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after the suggestions given.</p>

<p>Thanks John:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually my third party mouse (logitech) was working just fine and have never had an issue with it. I did, however, disconnect my mouse to see if it would pair again and it worked fine each time I tried it. My issue was the rocketfish keyboard. I have had
 the rocketfish keyboard for over a year without any issues until it just started acting up a week or so ago. I would lose my bluetooth connection and reboot the compuer and everything would be fine. About 10 days ago the keyboard just quit working altogether,
 so I tried disconnecting the device several times and reconnecting, changed the batteries 3 times, The dongle turned blue like it was working, but the pairing would never happen. Gave up today and bought a new Logitech keyboard and mouse that came with it.
 Done in a about 3 seconds. Everything working great now. The keyboard has a strange feel to me, but I'll get used to that. At least it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for trying to help me out. I do appreciate your help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the link for ThinkPad T400 drivers:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/Laptops-and-netbooks/ThinkPad-T-Series-laptops/ThinkPad-T400?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/products/Laptops-and-netbooks/ThinkPad-T-Series-laptops/ThinkPad-T400?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to check if the driver is compatible with Windows 10. If not, then you may try to install it in compatibility mode. Right click on the downloaded driver package file and click
 on<strong> Troubleshoot compatibility </strong>and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know the results.<br />

<h2>            Black loading screen before login on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get into my windows 10 Lenovo&nbsp;computer but I cannot get any further than the loading screen before the login screen. Heres the chain of events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I turn the computer on</p>
<p>2. the start screen shows with the Lenovo&nbsp;logo in the middle and the spinny loading&nbsp;thing at the bottom.</p>
<p>3. The screen goes black and shows the loading spinny thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have kept the computer on in this state for over an hour without anything happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to get into safe mode but the same thing happens. Sometimes the recovery thing happens but after it says it has repaired&nbsp;the disk, the same thing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I have a virus, what is wrong?!!</p>

<p>is it updating or upgrading, could take a long time with slower system</p>
<p>
</p><p>if not, do this on link</p>
<p>
</p><p>restore back to before this happened</p>
<p>
</p><p>now I show the Feb 2018 update, you can go to update page and get the March update and manually install that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you most likely have 10 64bit, get that update. no Delta updates, just cumulative.</p>

<p>I don't know, maybe call OEM for a look at it, it will take forever sending ti and getting&nbsp;it back. LOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>maybe it is just you doing something on it or as usual, windows 10 is severely flawed and causing this, the newest update the other day is suppose to fix some of these boot issues.</p>

    <title>Switch Window mouse macro no longer works on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switch Window mouse macro no longer works on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a simple Switch Window macro I've used for years on Windows 7. Here is the contents of the
<em>mhm</em> macro file produced by <strong>Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center</strong>:</p>
<p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;Macro&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;KeyBoardEvent Down="true"&gt;56&lt;/KeyBoardEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;DelayEvent&gt;10&lt;/DelayEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;KeyBoardEvent Down="true"&gt;15&lt;/KeyBoardEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;DelayEvent&gt;10&lt;/DelayEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;KeyBoardEvent Down="false"&gt;15&lt;/KeyBoardEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;DelayEvent&gt;10&lt;/DelayEvent&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&lt;KeyBoardEvent Down="false"&gt;56&lt;/KeyBoardEvent&gt;<br />
&lt;/Macro&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, it's a simple Alt+Tab sequence. This works fine on Windows 7 (and in a Windows 7 VM on my new Windows 8 machine), but does nothing on Windows 8. I've tried the "Next Window" option, with mixed results (it has a bad habit of jumping to the
 wrong window, as if cycling through every open window; and it does not work with new Windows Store apps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>How can I get the simple Alt+Tab functionality working on Windows 8?</em>&nbsp;Thank you!</p>
                </div>

            <p>I just bought a <strong>Sculpt Comfort Mouse.&nbsp;</strong>Sadly,&nbsp;I couldn't replicate&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3cc93d14-7ea4-4e4e-8f32-f1f1976d8fa7" title="nubi2k">nubi2k</a>'s macro&nbsp;on
<strong>Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess mapping <strong>Alt+Esc&nbsp;</strong>like <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f7bfe7c5-0772-4521-8765-deb1870672a7" title="S3rgio">
S3rgio</a> suggested, will work for most people. You can do that on&nbsp;<strong>Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3&nbsp;</strong>(without using AutoHotKey), though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with Alt+Esc is that it doesn't work with Metro applications and you cannot toggle between two applications, as one can do with Alt+Tab. So, I ended up doing an AutoHotKey-Script to try to emulate the behavior of Alt+Tab and mapping the mouse
 to that Hotkey (Win+N in my case):</p>
<p>
</p><p>#n::<br />
</p>
&nbsp; AltTabTimeout := 2000<br />
&nbsp; SleepBetweenKeys := 10<br />
&nbsp; DesktopClass := "WorkerW"<br />
&nbsp; if (A_PriorHotkey=A_ThisHotkey &amp;&amp; A_TimeSincePriorHotkey&lt;AltTabTimeout){<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; WinGetClass, activeWindowClass, A<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; if (activeWindowClass=DesktopClass){<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reverse := 1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; } else{<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (%reverse%=0){<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AltTabCount := ++AltTabCount<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; } else{<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AltTabCount := --AltTabCount<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (%AltTabCount%=0){<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reverse := 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp; } else{<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; AltTabCount := 0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; reverse := 0<br />
&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp; Run C:\Users\Default\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\Window Switcher.lnk<br />
&nbsp; Sleep, %SleepBetweenKeys%<br />
&nbsp; Loop, %AltTabCount% {<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Sleep, %SleepBetweenKeys%<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; SendInput {Tab}<br />
&nbsp; }<br />
&nbsp; Sleep, %SleepBetweenKeys%<br />
&nbsp; SendInput {return}<br />
&nbsp; return
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps...</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t adjust screen brightness in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mahboob hussain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t adjust screen brightness in windows 10</h2>
                    Previously I could adjust my screen brightness using the F11 and F12 keys but now I cannot seem to be able to do so. Pressing them does display the bar with the slider but the brightness does not change. I have tried updating the drivers for the display
 adapters (AMD Radeon (TM) R5 M330 and Microsoft Basic Display Adapter) but it continues to not function. I also tried adjusting it from the action center and the battery options but to no avail. I have a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 series, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB of hard
 disk space and 64 bit processing system. Can anyone suggest how I could solve this problem? The brightness is too much and is stinging my eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            This issue might be related to the following:
<br />
<br />We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters. The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for all versions of Windows 10 to delete the 22.19.128.0 driver from the system and recover the recommended driver version (8.970.100.9001):
<br />Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon, and then select Device Manager.
<br />Expand Display adapters, right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab and verify driver version is 22.19.128.0.
<br />Select Uninstall Device.
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.
<br />The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen Device Manager.
<br />Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />Recheck the driver version.  If it still reports 22.19.128.0, repeat steps 4 to 7 until the recommended driver (8.970.100.9001) is re-installed.  If this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here.  If a different driver version is installed, follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.  
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<h2>            Windows 10 on HP Stream 7 screen rotation not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>I successfully installed Windows 10 on my HP Stream 7 and everything appears to be working as it should except, the screen wont auto rotate. I can change orientation in display setting but would be much better if it happened as I rotate the tablet.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I had same problem of no autorotation&nbsp;in an ASUS tablet Transformer T100TAF (has a screen which is detacheable from keyboard). My Graphics Properties also did not include an "enable" feature, though the display would rotate if set to the various degree settings
 manually. i.e. just no autorotation.</p>
<p>Solution for me: Problem was in the driver for the tablet's rotation sensor.</p>
<p>1. Go to Control Panel, select:</p>
<p>2. Hardware and Sound</p>
<p>3. Device Manager</p>
<p>4. Sensors</p>
<p>5. InvenSense Sensor Collection</p>
<p>6. Driver</p>
<p>7. Disable (not uninstall)</p>
<p>Then Enable it again and click Next to save, and close Control Panel.</p>
<p>After those steps, mine worked fine again. Hope this is a help.</p>

<h3> jorge_guedes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 problem</h2>
                    <p>Updated to latest available windows 10 version 1607 on my PC that is used for backups. The PC has the following components:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Asus P8Z68-M Pro motherboard</li><li>intel core i5 processor</li><li>4 gig RAM.</li><li>3TB hard-disk disk where all software is loaded</li><li>3X 4TB disks configured as dynamic as I use this for all my backups from other laptops and PCs.</li><li>Nvidia Geforce GT 520 graphics card</li><li>The monitor is a samsung S20C300L with DVI and vga connections and I have tried both the connections to the graphics card.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The PC had some problems ever since I moved from windows 7 to windows 10 but i could deal with them as I just switched off the graphics card. The problem was that the login screen did not display the background picture, and once I logged in, the app icons/tiles
 on the left of the mobile screen did not appear. Also the settings facility did not display the options correctly where characters seemed to be super-imposed over others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my other devices are working properly in Windows 10, including a laptop with the same type of graphics card and also has an intel i5 processor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 1607 version of windows 10 update, everything looked good and all my problems disappeared, but once i restarted or rebooted the PC it has never even got to the login screen. &nbsp;I have switched off and restarted a number of times and all i get is
 as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The Asus motherboard startup screen</li><li>the screen that displays the hard drives and RAm&nbsp;</li><li>The windows screen with the 4 blue panes and the revolving dots below it</li><li>The windows image disappears, the windowsstart-up sound is heard and stops, and that where it stays</li></ul>
<p>I have this black screen with the revolving dots pepetually on the screen</p>
<p>

            <p>Tried to repair, restart, even waited for 48 hours on two occasions to see if it was processing an update, etc. The only thing I did not do was create a bootable windows 10 disk or usb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I was pressed for time as I use the machine for all my device backups and also as an assistant to create videos, using Adobe production premier, so i restored to a previous update of windows. It's now working as normal with flickering windows
 when minimised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try again another day after creating a bootable usb drive. Right now too busy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feel though is that there is something in the Nvidia graphics card that is incompatible. Will disable card next time. Should have tried that in safe mode but forgot.</p>

            <p>I have the same issues with the Windows 1607 update and NVIDIA graphics on my laptop (Lenovo Z570). It started when 1607 was launched and the Microsoft updates automatically tried to install 1607 but at the final launch it would fail and revert to the previous
 version of Windows 10, this happened several times with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to do a clean install of 1607 onto a new hard drive, again it failed freezing at the final login screen, I tried several time but it just failed every time at the same point. I then searched the net for known issues and there appeared to be a common
 thread of issues with the NVIDIA chip set and 1607 (GeForce GT520M)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not an IT professional but I discovered that I could disable the NVIDIA chip set in the BIOS reverting to the standard Intel Graphics, this allowed the laptop to boot OK, I have installed all updates and then tried to re-enable the NVIDIA graphics but
 the same issue results failing at the login screen. There seems to be No solution, the graphics adaptor is part of the motherboard so not changeable, surely either NVIDIA or Microsoft should have a solution by now?</p>

            <p>Just thought I would let you know that i have resolved my windows 10 problem. After all the fuss, i found an asus program on my machine that was gaming software. I deleted it to check what would happen and wham, problem gone. It was pre-loaded by the supplier
 and I had no idea that I had it until I went through all the program directories.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Gamertag Problem&#47;Question</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys just a quick question on my Gamer-tag, ok so i want to change my Gamer-tag to DeadDisciple. Currently it's DeadDisciple2, the 2 is annoying and i would like to not have any numbers in my tag, so i got the points to be able to change the tag to DeadDisciple
 except it says the tag is already in use. I went to my friends list and added the tag as a friend just to be sure that it's already in use and the message i keep getting is that the tag does not exist on Xbox Live, so i should be able to change it then right?
 This is frustrating, hope somebody can help, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vernier is right. If it says it's taken, then it is being used somewhere on Microsoft's servers even if it's not an Xbox gamertag.</p>

<p>Turned computer on &amp; it reads: 'System32\Drivers\isapnp.sys file is missing or corrupt. You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows setup using original CD-ROM.'</p>
<p>I put Windows XP Home Edition CD-ROM (the original CD). Boots up, Welcome, I press 'R', them ADM. Pswrd(i press enter..no password. I enter: ren c:\windows\system32\drivers\isapnp.sys isapnp.old &amp; hit enter. At the c:\wWindows prompt I type: EXPAND D:\i386\isapnp.sy_c:\Windows\System32\Drivers.
 It won't expand the file. It says cannot expand.</p>
<p>HELP!! This computer is my Dad's. He's 86 today. He is a writer, so all of his work is on that computer. I suspect he has been on some questionable Websites &amp; he may have let a random "Anti-Virus Program that told him that the computer was infected. I installed
 Windows One-Care last week and I'm not sure if it was running or not. Also, he has no "Recovery" disk &amp; diskette's. There is no Floppy drive either. Is there any way to repair this file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;thank you in advance, Mary</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows update error 80242006.</h2>
                    <p>OT: 80242006 and 17 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a question about this earlier, but it seems to have been marked as answered.</p>
<p>These updates are not happening and I have tried all suggestions to date.</p>
<p>I have tried installing them one at a time,</p>
<p>tried Windows Troubleshooter many times</p>
<p>tried disabling Kaspersky and updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had any problems with Windows Update before. The only software installed recently has been Kaspersky and that seems to be working fine. I have no idea or suggestion as to what is going wrong I am sorry to say. The error code showing is 80242006
 and I have tried everything on the Community to help reconcile this error. Things seem to have reset and paths followed have advised no errors found.&nbsp;But the problem still persists&nbsp;............. aargh! I would be most grateful for any more suggestions on resolving
 the problem please. I am still managing to avoid the, "Throw the laptop against the wall" solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to anyone who can help,</p>
<p>John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
