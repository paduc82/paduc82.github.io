<h2>            Why is starting a new topic relegated to a menu you have to click on to make the option appear&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First you have to click on the three straight lines icon, then you have to click on "Participate", then you have to click on "How to participate", then you get presented with a list with some entries that are unclear as to how they relate to participating.
 The only two that seem relevant are "Ask a Question" and "Start a Discussion", the function of which is duplicated by elements below the post. There should be a "New Topic" at the top and if you really need to differentiate between a "question" and a &nbsp;"discussion"
 put the selection above the post not below.</p>
<p>Take a look at these forums for examples.</p>
<p>http://www.qb64.net/forum/index.php</p>
<p>They have sections divided into "boards", but once you've decided which board you want to be in, if you are logged in, a "New Topic" button is at the top of the board.</p>
<p>http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/0/</p>
<p>IF you are logged in, there's a "Start a New Discussion" button at the top.</p>
<p>They have subdivisions similar to the question and discussion divisions at the bottom of the post, but then the part of the post that is visible at any time is small so that the subdivisions are likely to be visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even Wikipedia has their edit pages control immediately visible and they allow for IP-tagged non-registered changes.</p>

            And another thing... Why are the icons to the right? Pretty much everything else we use have the icons to the left... *checks the new pinning technique that I don't know when it got introduced where* Alright, so it's a bigger usability problem than I realized.
 Pins should go to the left, like the icons and the checkboxes,and so should the subscribed envelope icon, or at least trailing close behind the text. I have no idea how many people would have trouble noticing them, but I feel like it's a lot. When's the last
 time a usability study's been done?

<p>Check your router's Wi-Fi configuration, this may have a country code based upon where your router thinks it's located, since this determines which frequencies are used due to regional restrictions.</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />In the back or bottom of your Router is a sticker with a UserName, Password and IP address (something like 192.002.005.001) printed on it
<br />
<br />Note those down
<br />
<br />Go to your PC and open a Web Browser
<br />
<br />In the address type the IP address and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will bring up your routers configuration page
<br />
<br />Somewhere on that page you will find settings
<br />
<br />From there you should be able to access that setting . . 
<br />
<br />Before you can change that, you will need to enter the UserName and Password you noted down from that sticker on the router
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the query you encounter in our forum. According to my test, we are able to sign into Skype for Business in two devices with the same account, but just one of them can
 connected to the Skype meeting, the other one will be on hold. Given this situation, I suggest that sign into Skype for Business with a different account when you want to have a skype meeting with your staffs. If you have further concern about this, please
 just let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

    <title>Office Pro Plus 2019 Key Keeps Downloading&#47;Installing Office Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikefleck1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Pro Plus 2019 Key Keeps Downloading&#47;Installing Office Pro Plus 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a Pro Plus 2019 license, and the Key is successfully recorded/registered in my Microsoft account.&nbsp; I used the "download now" button associated with the Pro Plus 2019 Key, but when the installation completes it always installs Pro Plus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the Microsoft Office removal tool, deinstall, reboot, etc.; no matter what I try it always ends up installing Pro Plus 2016 (this is the branding that shows everywhere, including the various Office apps, Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running Word and activating the license manually (not using my MS account), but when I enter the 25-digit key it tells me the key is for "another product" (or something to that effect).&nbsp; It even offers me the option to install/upgrade to Pro Plus
 2019; but when I click to agree to installing the 2019 version, the update window shows for a moment and then dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new Dell computer that came with the standard Dell pre-packaged image.&nbsp; It did see "click to run" icons in the Start Menu for Word, Powerpoint, Excel, etc; but I went to each of those and chose "uninstall" before I started.&nbsp; When I viewed installed
 programs from Control Panel, there were no Office products showing before I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I also tried the MS Office removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my Key bad, or am I missing something in the process?&nbsp; It seems that the Key is valid but not working because it keeps installing a 2016 branded version of Office and not the 2019 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Mike,
<br />
<br />Which version and build do you have installed?  See File, Account for the information. 
<br />
<br />It sounds like the windows store version may have been preinstalled. Run the powershell at <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-store-app/#uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/outlook-store...</a> to make sure all bits are removed. It won't make a difference with the initial problem, but will make sure all bits are removed.

<br />Where did you purchase your key? They may have given you a key for the wrong version.

<p>Hi...&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Diane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the key from my Office account, it shows that it's for product Pro Plus 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But every time I click the "Download Now" button (associated with this product key) I always end up with Office products branded as Pro Plus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See redacted screen shot below</p>

<p>Below is a redacted screen shot of my Office / Word version.&nbsp; It's Version 1906 (build 11727.20230 click-to-run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that there is something still in the Registry causing the installer to believe I'm running 2016 or Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried clicking the "activation required" box and entering the same Key is used for the download, but not surprisingly it says it's not valid (you can't use a 2019 product key for version 2016 of office).</p>

<p>How do you know it is Pro Plus 2016? </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has been very sloppy about differentiating between 2016 and 2019 and 365. And I have seen many similar questions here, people with one bundle seemingly suddenly having a different one or different version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to confirm what you have is identify a recent new feature that is limited to 2019, not 2016 and check for it in your installation.

<p>Thanks Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you view the screenshot I posted a few posts above, Word (and the other Office products) identify themselves (under File -&gt; Account) as "Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I go into Control Panel and view the list of installed programs, it shows as Prod Plus 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also opened a Support ticket with Microsoft, but they have yet been able to provide a solution.&nbsp; They asked me to check if I had previously installed Office 2016, and they provided me a link to their office removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since de-installed and used the removal tool a couple of times, but when I re-install from my account (using "Download Now" button) I end up with the same 2016 version of Office showing under file -&gt; account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to suspect something in the registry that isn't getting removed or cleaned that makes it think I'm running 2016.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp; the product key does not activate this apparent 2016 download that MS keeps foisting on you, you need to get the 2019 installer. I find it ... "passing" ... strange that the MyAccount page would be giving you the wrong installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the HUP page, scroll down to the bottom to the Contact Us link. Talk to HUP support. They can give you a link to download the 2019 installation file. "Normal" MS Support is clueless about HUP.

<p>In looking at the screenshot from word again - it says monthly channel- that indicates its a subscription version. Non-subscriptions are blank there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do you have more than one office suite linked in your Microsoft account?&nbsp; Did you use the fix it to completely remove office *and* the powershell i linked to, to make sure the windows store version is gone?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Diane.&nbsp; I appreciate all the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Office removal tool (provided by Microsoft).&nbsp; I didn't use powershell because I'm uneasy about 3rd party products (sorry, but it's my ultra-conservative nature).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect there is some portion of the "trial" Office 365 version that was still lurking somewhere in my registry.&nbsp; This was a new Dell desktop that came with their standard "image" that included some "trial" version of Office (I think 365).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I did (however) fix the problem.&nbsp; I downloaded the Pro Plus 2019 ".img" disk image from the appropriate microsoft site.&nbsp; After uninstalling and running the office clean-up tool, I installed 2019 successfully from the .img image.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's now working, and I was able to activate the license using my Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Woo-hoo, I'm now up and running with a properly licensed (non 365) version of Office 2019.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thanks to everyone that offered their assistance.</p>
<p>

            The fact that you were able to uninstall the individual apps tells me the store version was installed (click to run would uninstall the entire suite at once) and for whatever reason, simply uninstalling did not get rid of all of the bits from Dell computers. We needed the powershell to clean it. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />  I didn't use powershell because I'm uneasy about 3rd party products (sorry, but it's my ultra-conservative nature).
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />FWIW, powershell is not 3rd party software. :)  The script on my website came from Microsoft support, when i first discovered the store version on a client's computer and wanted to get rid of it.

    <title>How to permanently save the Undo, Redo info in microsoft office word, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohammady  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to permanently save the Undo, Redo info in microsoft office word, even after closing it&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the Name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the Ever-Merciful</p>
<p>Salam and congratulations on the birthdays of the Prophet Muhammad and Imam Sadiq, peace upon them and the Household.</p>
<p>I just wonder if there is a way to save the undo and redo info in an office word document after it has been closed. I mean, sometimes we need to have a history of the changes, the procedures, and all the activities from the beginning of the first day when
 the file was created. I know there is a review and tracking option in office word but I need more than that as it only saves a one time revision and if the revision is revised once more, it will not display the first revision; rather, it will overwrite the
 first revision in favor of the second one.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to permanently save the undo information in order to teach my next year students how and with which stages I created and developed such and such translated text with lots of pictures, revisions on pictures, on words and text, etc.</p>
<p>I surfed the net a lot and the more I searched, the less I found.</p>
<p>Is there any place in windows 10 where that transient undo info is found and can then be manually saved?</p>
<p>Thanks a million.</p>
<p>Mohammad from Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

            Unfortunately, no, there is not. Using Track Changes (and saving multiple versions)&nbsp;is the closest thing you can get to that history.

<p>Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Office or Word macro language to enable a macro to list the Undo actions in the list. Microsoft's programmers probably could add that ability, if Microsoft's managers consider it to be desirable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you can do at this time is to post your suggestion at&nbsp;<a href="https://word.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://word.uservoice.com/</a>, which is the official site for asking Microsoft to add features.</p>

<p>Salam and many thanks, dear Ms. Barnhill and Mr. Freedman.</p>
<p>Although my problem has not been solved yet, I do appreciate your kind replies.</p>
<p>I will, Allah permitting, post my suggestion as you suggested on the user's voice.</p>
<p>Yet still I wait until others come and suggest a solution.</p>
<p>Maybe some non-Microsoft programmers, like those who designed TabForOffice become interested to plan a third-party software for the undo permanent saving. Who knows?!</p>

<p>One reason this option is missing is that you have Hyper-V enabled. Then you must use PowerShell to change network profile:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open PowerShell As Administrator and give commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS C:\WINDOWS\System32&gt; <strong><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Get-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp;</span></strong>(Check Name)</p>
<p>PS C:\WINDOWS\System32&gt; <strong>Set-NetConnectionProfile -Name </strong>(Name)<strong> -NetworkCategory&nbsp;Private</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">PO</span></span></p>

            Here is a tip as posted many times on the forum and the feedback hub, Insider Beta builds have had issues when using 3rd party virus/malware programs, this is because the makers of such programs haven't had the time or axcess to the beta builds to update
 the code for the programs.

<p>I have two W10 Pro installed,&nbsp;firts without Hyper-V second&nbsp;with Hyper-V and this is what you can see when select "Change connection properties". On second case you need PowerShell to change network profile.</p>

<p>I test this issue by deleting External virtual switch from Hyper-V leaving only Default Switch (using NAT to external connections) and then it was possible to change connection profiles directly from settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that&nbsp;when you create External virtual switch: vEthernet (External)&nbsp;as it had to be done on older versions of W10 you end up to this "problem".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Default Switch&nbsp;appears in some build of W10 1703 (?) this "problem" was solved.</p>

<br />
<br />Check your password
<br />
<br />The most common cause of an out-of-date account is an incorrect password. Select Fix account in the notification bar at the top of the Mail or Calendar app. If your password is incorrect, you'll see a message asking you to update your password. Enter the new password and choose Done.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check your security certificate
<br />
<br />If your password isn't the problem, you may have a certificate error. If so, you'll see a message that says, "There is a problem with the server's security certificate. The security certificate is not from a trusted certifying authority."
<br />
<br />This error often happens when you don't use SSL to secure your email account. To fix this error, use the following steps.
<br />
<br />1. Choose Settings &gt; Manage Accounts.
<br />
<br />2. Choose the account that's out-of-date to display the account settings dialog.
<br />
<br />3. Choose Change mailbox sync settings &gt; Advanced mailbox settings. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see Advanced mailbox settings.
<br />
<br />4. Check the boxes for Require SSL for incoming email and Require SSL for outgoing email and then choose Done &gt; Save.

<h2>            s.yimg and s.tyimg problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Somehow my PC got infected with something called "s.yimg"&nbsp; Apparently it is a You Tube virus/malware that severely slows page loads and on some websites pop ups for Java updates and Flash updates appear. When trying to close them, they move all over the
 screen.&nbsp; Have run several different malware programs, deep virus scans etc. and cannot get rid of it.</p>

<p>Since you didn't tell us what antimalware program is installed on your computer, what browser is being used or the names of the scanners you have used to search for malware we're rather limited as to what we might suggest as a potential remedy.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I assume you are using Firefox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not completely uninstall Firefox (do not save any settings) and then install a fresh copy? &nbsp;That
<strong>should </strong>eliminate your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better suggest remove Firefox and install Google Chrome - I now use it as my primary browser and have far less freezes and similar issues than I did when using Firefox.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64 bit</p>
<p>Dell 64 mb ram</p>
<p>&nbsp;Internet Explorer 11.0.12</p>
<p>Primary scanner is Norton 360</p>

<p>Java is up to date. I have blocked S.yimg and s.tyimg in Adobe Flash.</p>

<p>Can't use Firefox at all, it's overrun with popups.</p>

<h2>            PowerShell &#43; SharePoint multi-factor authentication</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I thing it would make SharePoint Online more secure if you could get PowerShell "SharePoint Online Management Shell" to work with SharePoint multi-factor authentication? So if I use a command like</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect-SPOService -Url site-admin.sharepoint.com/ -credential *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;you also need addition authentication.</p>
<p>At work I need to connect to the company SharePoint online site using PowerShell on different company computers. I am always worried the computer I am using might have hidden spyware or a virus on.</p>
<p>Using PowerShell with SharePoint multi-factor authentication would make the connection more secure. Even if someone was able to get the App Password they would also need access to my mobile for the text password (multi-factor authentication)</p>
<p>I think it would be more secure if a future addition of PowerShell ISE would have Office 365 Multi-Factor Authentication capabilities.</p>
<p>What do you think?<br />

<h2>            How to delete records from &#34;Many&#34; side in Delete Query without deleting &#34;One&#34; side</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 tables (these are fake names):</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblMain</p>
<p>&nbsp; MainID</p>
<p>&nbsp; Comments</p>
<p>tblManySide</p>
<p>&nbsp; ManySideID</p>
<p>&nbsp; Location</p>
<p>&nbsp; ManufacturedDate</p>
<p>&nbsp; MainID_FK</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to create a button on a form that will delete the records from a query.&nbsp; To begin I built a select query that has both tables because I need the [Comments] field from tblMain in order to filter out records that do not say "Do Not Destroy Can".&nbsp;
 The select query is showing the correct records.&nbsp; When I change this to a Delete query I get the "<strong><em>Specify the Table containing the records you want to delete"
</em></strong>message.&nbsp; I have looked this up and I realize it is because delete queries are meant for deleting records from a single table (which I want to do (the records from the tblManySide) but I need to have the "Do Not Destroy Can Criteria" in the query
 so I need to have both tables in the Query builder (which adds the join in the SQL statement).&nbsp; Is there a way to specify that I want to delete the records that match that criteria from the tblManySide?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            A LEFT OUTER JOIN is pointless in this case as you cannot delete a row which does not exist in a referencing table.&nbsp; You can either use an INNER JOIN and specify the table, or, as I would do in this context, restrict the query by means of the EXISTS predicate
 against a correlated subquery:<br />
<br />
DELETE *<br />
FROM tblFragranceInventory<br />
WHERE EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT *<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM tblFragrance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE tblFragrance.FragID = tblFragranceInventory.FragID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND InventoryComments LIKE "*Do Not Destroy*");<br />
<br />
Note also that testing for IS NOT NULL is also superfluous as the LIKE operation already presupposes a value in the column.<br />

            I would use a Subquery here, not a joined query. You have your select query. So use:
<br />
<br />DELETE * FROM tblFragranceinventory WHERE FragID_FK IN(SELECT FragID FROM qryRecordstoDelete);

<h2>            Remove or clear Combo box filter in form</h2>
                    <p>I have a combobox which filters customer invoices; displayed in a listbox. By default,&nbsp;no customer&nbsp;invoices are showing at all and only relevant invoices show when I choose customer via the combo box. How do I clear all filters to show ALL records in the

<h2>            Display dock HD500 not showing in gadgets</h2>
                    <p>Display dock doesn't shows up in gadget app, so my first problem is that i cannot upgrade the firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly whenever i connect the dock to my lumia 950xl, it shows me a usb error 43, popping a messege that driver repository is not recognised. Though i can see the extended display on my screen when i connect my phone with the dock, but no usb devices work
 when i connect them to the dock, like bluetooth mouse, wired keyboard, pendrives etc. My lumia 950xl detects other pendrives with an otg usb adapter normally, plus my Bluetooth headphones, except this display dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating becuase this problem is bugging me since many days. I have done endless resets with windows device recovery tool, but with no hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am running build 15063 version 1703. My gadget app version is 4.4.1609.2000. Pls help me get rid of this prob.</p>

</p><p>Hi Debjit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that your Lumia phone detects other devices, while your adapter does not work with any accessories through the USB, it is best that you have your adapter checked with a store technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest bringing your receipt and the box that comes along with it and have the adapter checked for any issues with its port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share to us what the store technician advises you about this.</p>

                    When I was using IE 10 I had no problems. Since installing IE 11 the web pages take a long time to load, and when one clicks on a link the page freezes and a message says that IE needs to recover the web page. Can any one help with this problem or should
 I return to IE 10. I have Windows 7 64bit running on a Toshiba lap top.

 using my account and when I try to go through all the steps to get back into my account I can't complete enough information. This is an old account and I never entered billing information, I've only ever used one password for it, and I haven't logged into
 it for so long that I don't know any subject boxes. This person is emailing friends, family, and teachers and I would like to kick them off the account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know how to share a site and share documents on our Sharepoint Online team site. &nbsp;There is a lot of documentation showing how to do this. &nbsp; One thing I cannot find is how to remove someone from being shared to. &nbsp; In addition, I have not found any info
 on how to change someone's shared permission. &nbsp;If they have Edit level permission and I want to change them to Read Only, how is that done? &nbsp; Or if I want to remove them from accessing that file, how is that done? &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi berkjackson9051,</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>. to remove someone from being shared to (stop sharing a document with a user), we can follow these steps:<br />
1. select the shared document &gt; <strong>share</strong> &gt; <strong>shared with</strong> &gt;
<strong>advanced</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e5ef75cf-bb3d-4fb3-a76d-68b9b4045a0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de5ef75cf-bb3d-4fb3-a76d-68b9b4045a0b" /></a><br />
2. select the user &gt; <strong>remove user permissions</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=49a80de0-11e1-452b-96be-eb938c8f6ff4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d49a80de0-11e1-452b-96be-eb938c8f6ff4" /></a><br />
3. after doing that, click <strong>check permissions</strong> &gt; type in the user name &gt;
<strong>check now</strong> to make sure he/she has no permissions to this document.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=673196e8-c6a9-4197-be20-1395ec473a39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d673196e8-c6a9-4197-be20-1395ec473a39" /></a><br />
here we should <strong>pay attentions to</strong> whether the site is shared with some users, if yes, the shared users will also be able to access the documents in this site. we need to delete these users via clicking
<strong>xxx members</strong> &gt; select the users &gt; <strong>actions</strong> &gt; <strong>
remove users from group</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fc3fabab-1eb6-494d-aa89-e32e011ef59c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfc3fabab-1eb6-494d-aa89-e32e011ef59c" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fb7fef9b-dca7-4ea9-9294-36cafaa662d5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfb7fef9b-dca7-4ea9-9294-36cafaa662d5" /></a><br />
4. go back to the <strong>shared with</strong>, the user <strong>joke la</strong> is no longer listed there. if he tries to access the document library where the shared document stored, he will no longer see or access the document.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e66f67fe-eb75-4720-b2ee-70b6f1d2e1fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de66f67fe-eb75-4720-b2ee-70b6f1d2e1fb" /></a></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>. to change the user's permission to the shared document to <strong>
read only</strong>, in step 2, select the user &gt; click <strong>edit user permissions</strong> &gt; select the permission
<strong>view only</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0efa696f-cef5-457d-82a4-fe0fa65204ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0efa696f-cef5-457d-82a4-fe0fa65204ff" /></a></p>

    <title>Counting different choices from a drop down list on a column on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dorindam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Counting different choices from a drop down list on a column on repeating table.</h2>
                    <p>I have an infopath form with a repeating table.&nbsp; I have a drop down list in the table.&nbsp; In another section I want to keep track of the count of each selection from the drop down list.&nbsp; I thought I had this correct but if the user goes in and changes their
 choice on a line it just adds 1 to the total count of the new choice but does not delete the count from the previous choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the user is listing new servers to be added on the network.&nbsp; Some are physical, some are virtual, and some have databases.&nbsp; I have a list of options for the user to choose for the type each server will be.&nbsp; Because there is a different cost
 involved in each type of install, I have a summary which I list out how many physical servers (text with count)&nbsp;times the install cost (text with cost times count), then a row with the virtual servers count and cost, etc, then a total cost of all server types.&nbsp;
 I put the condition and rule in the drop down box if this was the choice then add 1 to the correct text box.&nbsp; However if they change to a different type, it leaves the original count in the first text box and adds the new count in the second text box, messing
 up my numbers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I either change the condition and rule to remove the added count if the user changes their choice, or put code in the text box to count for each drop down list in the repeating table, to add 1 for each different type in spite of how many times the
 user changes their choice?</p>

            <p>Again, it sounds like with your setup, the best approach will be a "default value formula". This is not hard to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example form is simple to create:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank form.</li><li>Insert a repeating table.</li><li>Change the first box in the repeating table to a drop-down list box.</li><li>Add "Choice1", "Choice2", and "Choice3" to your list box.</li><li>Add a text box to the view.</li><li>In the Text Box Properties, click the Formula button for the Default Value.</li><li>Insert the count() function (Under "Field").</li><li>Double-click to insert field--select your repeating drop-down field (don't click OK yet).</li><li>Click Filter Data.</li><li>Add filter where the selected field = "Choice2".</li><li>Click OK five times to close all dialog boxes.</li></ol>
<p>Now preview the form, and add some rows to the repeating table. Make selections. For each "Choice2" you select, the count will increment. For each one you change or delete, the count will decrement.</p>
<p>You should be able to apply this technique to your solution with success.</p>

<h2>            Sending myself spam</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awhile ago, while I was emptying out my junk mail, I noticed I had sent myself spam mail. I deleted it and went about scanning my computer for viruses and all that. Once it was clean, I went about changing my password for my account and it seemed like the
 problem was solved because such a thing did not occur again until today. </p>
<p>I checked my sent folder, and I does not show that it was sent through my account though it has my email address as the sender. I am scanning my computer for viruses and spyware and do plan on changing my password again.</p>
<p>Is there a more permanent way to avoid such a thing from happening again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How do I migrate email from Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Microsoft Outlook 2000 or Microsoft Live Mail to Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011&#63;</h2>

 migrate a copy of the email into Microsoft Outlook 2000 and Microsoft Live Mail so I have three copies of the same mailbox on one computer in three different programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">I managed to export the mail into a .pst file only to get the message from the Outlook for Mac: "</span><span>Outlook for Mac can only
 import Unicode-based .pst files which are the standard format for Personal Folders files for Outlook (for Windows) 2003 and later versions. ANSI-formatted .pst files, also known as Outlook 97-2002 Personal Folders Files, were the standard personal folder format

<p><span>All third party software that I have seen that might be able to accomplish this task seems to require some version of Outlook more recent than 2002. &nbsp;Of course if I had Outlook 2003 or later then

            <p>Check if you can get hold of a computer running Windows 7 or later by which you could download and install office 365/ 2013 and then import the old pst file to the same and then migrate it over to the Mac as unicode pst file.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other option would be to setup a gmail account as in outlook express and move the mails to folder&nbsp;/ folders &nbsp;created on gmail account and then setup the same account on your Mac and you would get them downloaded.

            The possibility of obtaining a Windows 7 computer is none.
<div><br />
<div>The gmail option works(!) with two caveats.</div>
<div>1) I had a few large email messages that Google's servers didn't want to accept (no problem, just transfer the contents as files because it is a very small number)</div>
<div>2) there does not seem to be an automatic way of copying the whole file structure so I have to copy folder by folder. &nbsp;This would be a problem if my folder structure was more complicated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks. &nbsp;I spent days researching possible options for transferring email and I saw no reasonable options that would work for me until I got your suggestion.</div>
