<p>CSV files behave differently depending on how you open them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open them from Excel's File &gt; Open menu, you'll get a wizard that lets you parse the data.</p>
<p>If you double-click or right-click&gt;open in finder, you Excel tries to figure it out for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which way are you opening the file?</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1520 does not support Bluetooth Keyboard &#40;HID&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I would very much like to buy a Lumia 1520 as it would spare me from carrying both a phone and a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">However</span>, I am <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> going to as, for reasons which utterly defeat me, the Bluetooth stack does not support a keyboard. The

<p>
</p><p>I am utterly baffled by this simple omission. From my Nokia N95 through to my N8 I was able to use a keyboard. I even still have a Nokia one which folds.</p>

            coming into the now, away from Symbian, there will be some frustrations initially.<br />
<br />
Symbian was far advanced functionality-wise, but ancient, UX/UI-wise.<br />
<br />
its a "**bleep**-for-tat" where in order to go one direction to get better, some is left behind. BUT, it gets better over time.<br />
<br />
as psycho said, tell it to MS as they are the writers of Windowsphone, not nokia.

<p>I agree that technically it is the software that prevents the connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, HID is a driver for the hardware. Nokia make nearly all of the Windows Phones sold. Nokia should therefore know the answer as they have the most immediate interest in making their hardware work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I fear is that Nokia have not changed and that therefore they will not bother to read this thread and thereby give any real feedback to, and consideration for, their customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I have indeed posted the issue on the relevant MS site.</p>

            You won't get any feedback from Nokia on this here because their hands are tied by Microsoft on this matter. Things may change once the Microsoft and Nokia merger completes when software teams from both work closely together to improve the OS for all.

<p>Agreed on all points -</p>
<p>1. Lack of HID support is a glaring omission that needs to be fixed</p>
<p>2. Microsoft is responsible for omitting HID support (which existed in Windows Mobile 6.5!)</p>
<p>3. There is hope for the future when Nokia/Microsoft collaboration is tighter after the merger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a WP device can see a bluetooth keyboard - it can even perform the pairing handshake.&nbsp; It generates a random code, you enter the code on the BT keyboard, the two become paired.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can add a little insight to this conversation: If you were to ask Microsoft folks, the answer would probably go something like this: "We have a finite number of resources.&nbsp; So to support one feature, we'd have to cut something else.&nbsp; What feature would
 you be willing to lose in exchange for HID support?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am basing this on similar conversations I've seen on MSFT discussion boards about support for entire-device backups - not piece-meal app-supported "in the cloud" data storage, but total backup/restore functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally think it is embarassing that Windows Phone does not support the HID profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we're getting close.&nbsp; The code is already on Windows RT for tablets.&nbsp; So I sure hope it's in the pipeline for WP.&nbsp; Time will tell I suppose.</p>

            Sadly time has not told as yet.<br />
<br />
From the information I have and the reading elsewhere BT HID is not in the BT stack for Windows Phone 8.1. That is despite all the talk about convergence of the three Windows platforms.<br />
<br />
I find it very hard to buy into the argument that these companies have such limited resources for WP that they cannot include something as simple as HID. One is led to suspect some opaque and misguided security or commercial reason. Not that I can fathom what
 they might be.<br />
<br />
These people would not seem to serious about B2B.

            I put this question forward on either pocktnow, wpcentral or wmpoweruser (can't remember which). A commenter commented on my remark of wanting HID certificate support added to the bluetooth stack as an update. Rumours are going about that bluetooth HID
 will come to the lumia phones accoording to a blog recently this year on wpcentral. The commenter mentioned that nokia could easily do this on demand if you send nokia an email. I will try this. Otherwise still keeping my fingers crossed. I own a 1520 now
 and the screen is big! Office would be quite okay to use on this screen with my microsoft bluetooth keyboard seriess 6000.

            I own a 1520 and was vey disappointed that the Windows 8.1 update did not support Bluetooth keyboards and mice. My sisters was ready to buy a 1520 when she saw mine. She wants to use Microsoft Office and not cary a tablet. She did not get the 1520 because
 it won't connect to Bluetooth keyboard or mouse. She went with the new IPhone.

            Since you just got the computer 1st contact the retailer. If they can't or won't help contact HP which is the manufacturer for your computer. Since it is a new computer they should help you with support.

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>Usually if an Office program is included, pre-installed on a new computer, it will be a trial version. This means that you will need to purchase a retail copy of the software to get a product key, when the trial period expires.</p>
<p>Open Word and clck the Office Button. At the bottom of the menu, select Word Options. Click Resources. Click the About Button and you will see the license information there.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>MS Project 2013 Calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> astco  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2013 Calendars</h2>
                    <p>Please advise on whether it's an issue with my copy of MS Project Professional 2013 or I'm missing something as Project doesn't update a task finish date when I modify Standard base calendar&nbsp;back and forth that is&nbsp;used by my the project&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps to replicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario 1 using Standard base calendar:</p>
<p>1. Open a new project </p>
<p>2. Select Standard base calendar.&nbsp;Schedule options are not modified (&nbsp;&nbsp;Workday Start/End: 8am-5pm,&nbsp;&nbsp;8hrs work day&nbsp;,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;40 hrs work week)</p>
<p>3. Create a 2-day manually scheduled task:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start Date&nbsp;- Fri&nbsp;, 3/4/16&nbsp;at 8:00am , </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Finish Date pops up as Mon, 3/7/16 at 5:00 pm</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Task doesn't have any assigned resources&nbsp;and uses Standard calendar </p>
<p>5. Go Project-&gt; Change Working Time and&nbsp;for Standard calendar create an exception for Sat., 3/6/16&nbsp;&nbsp;and set is a Working<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;day</p>
<p>6. Go back to Gantt chart. The &nbsp;Finish Date should be changed to Sat., 3/5/16 5:00 pm which is correct.</p>
<p>7. Now go back to Change Working Time screen and&nbsp; delete this exception&nbsp;from exception list in Standard calendar&nbsp;
</p>
<p>9. The expectation is that the Project should change the Finish Date back to its original value of Mon, 3/7/16. 5:00pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with my copy of the Project it didn't do this. The Finish Date remains on Sat. 3/5/16 5:00pm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario2&nbsp; &nbsp;with&nbsp;using&nbsp;&nbsp;task calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Schedule task the same way as in steps 1 through 4</p>
<p>2. Go Project-&gt; Change Working Time and create an new Calendar (via Copy&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;Standard calendar)&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Create and exception for Sat. 3/5/16 as a Working day</p>
<p>4. Link this new calendar to your task</p>
<p>5. It's expected that the Finish Date should have been changed to Sat. 3/5/16. But on my computer it's not as it&nbsp;and still remains &nbsp;to be Mon. 3/7/165:00 pm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time if I delete the exception for&nbsp;Sat. 3/5/16 and instead add it to the Work Week &nbsp;tab, the Finish Date get changed correctly to &nbsp;3/5/16 5:00pm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will greatly appreciate if&nbsp;anybody&nbsp;&nbsp; replicate these scenarios and let me know what is the solution to theissue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Resource calendars "over ride" project calendars on assignments. &nbsp;Set the resources' base calendar to "Copy of Standard". &nbsp;As long as you haven't assigned task calendars you should be all set.

            <p>You would need to make the developers tab visible on the ribbon. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can do that by clicking on the office button, then on the lower right border, click on Excel options.
</p>
<p>In the general section is a checkbox which when checked, shows the developer tab in in the ribbon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then go to the developer tab and click on controls.&nbsp; the top controls are the Forms controls. The second set of controls are the ActiveX controls.&nbsp; Click on the checkbox in one of these sections, then go to your worksheet and click where you want it&nbsp; and
 while holding down the mouse button, drag to show the shape you want the checkbox, then release the mouse button and the checkbox is placed on the sheet.</p>

<h3> muffburg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook keeps automatically endlessly copying appointment</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I create a new appointment in Outlook (desktop) in a certain (hotmail.com) account, it gets endlessly copied until I shut it down and restart. If I don't do this, it will keep creating copy after copy, I had thousands created for some appointments
 before I realised what was happening. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Outlook and the mail account, but nothing has helped. It's driving me mad! At this point I'm close to ditching the account but I've had it for 20+ years, so it's connected to so many things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only clue I have to what's happening is that the copies have the category 'moved' automatically added. This is not a category I have created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got a solution?</p>

            Did you try a macro at some point - one that could be copying (or moving) the appointment? 
<br />
<br />The behavior sounds a lot like a macro I have on my website that moves or copies appointments to a different calendar - it adds a category too. If the calendar it is supposed to move or copy to doesn't exist, it creates it a copy the current calendar.

<h3> icekeep10  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the best way to Save&#47;Create OneNote Notebooks for Office 365 for business with Sharepoint integration with OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to figure out in a business environment what is the best way to create OneNote notebooks, so that they are backed up online and can be accessed from any computer the user signs into.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The business environment uses a mix of Windows 7 and Windows 10 computers (Currently moving to Windows 10).</p>
<p>Sharepoint 2013 is in use</p>
<p>Office 365 2013 products is in use</p>
<p>OneDrive is in use and is connected to SharePoint</p>
<p>Multiple users like to use OneNote</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>See link:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_onenote-mso_win10-mso_o365b/onenote-switching-to-an-archived-format/9a196c88-2a6f-430a-9879-05dc96a45f5a?rtAction=1519161648950</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2933738/restrictions-and-limitations-when-you-sync-sharepoint-libraries-to-you</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/OneNote/Error-with-OneNote-Notebooks-in-OneDrive/td-p/50771</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I want to accomplish is for end users when they create a new notebook can it be created through the desktop OneNote application and be saved to this sharepoint/OneDrive location. For this to be setup does the SharePoint manager have to set it up a certain
 way so a user can access this location?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When they create a new OneNote Notebook is gives them:</p>
<p>Sites - company name (SharePoint)&nbsp; (Can't save here, does this need to be adjusted)</p>
<p>OneDrive - company name (should not be saved her according to Microsoft because it will cause the archive issue and sync issues)</p>
<p>Computer - (saves a local copy, but this will not be backed up online and can't be access from another computer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know you can create new OneNote notebooks through office 365 online and then edit it and it will bring it down to the desktop app. I was wondering if it was possible to create new notebooks through the desktop app and get it to properly save to the new
 location Sharepoint/OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have local notebooks (in my documents) what would be the best way to move them to this sharepoint/OneDrive location? Also, is there a mass way to move multiple notebooks?</p>

<p>Hi Icekeep10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean is you can do that by sharing the notebook to the online location or uploading to OneDrive for Business Online or SharePoint Online site instead of using OneDrive sync client to do so. It seems you figured out. If you still have further questions
 you can post back anytime when you are free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Icekeep10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your research is correct. Notebooks can’t be synced with OneDrive sync client. However, here are two ways you can save local created notebooks from desktop to Online location.</p>
<p>1. Open the notebook from desktop client, File &gt; share &gt; select the Online location &gt; move. This will save a copy of the notebook to the online location.</p>
<p>2. You can drag the *.one* files from the local notebook folder to a folder of OneDrive for Business Online or SharePoint Online to upload them. After that, you can open the notebooks online or choose to open the notebooks in desktop client. Please see the
 screenshots below:</p>
<p>Open the notebook folder, see some *.one* files. Drag them to a folder of SharePoint Online library or OneDrive for Business to upload them.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50d75b2-0ef1-43c3-9aac-8e56dd82220d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50d75b2-0ef1-43c3-9aac-8e56dd82220d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you create a folder, so you can know which *.one* files belong to the specific notebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7bc3287-aa3d-4552-9ff9-6067c8a075ec?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7bc3287-aa3d-4552-9ff9-6067c8a075ec?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Click the three dots collapse button and choose to open in OneNote desktop client or open in OneNote Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

    <title>I want out of windows insider preview mode without having to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wes writes code  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want out of windows insider preview mode without having to re-install windows 7 &#40;my original operating system&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When will the next major release be published that allows this? I've been waiting since August (it's November now) and it hasn't happened yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long do I wait before I can exit this unstable operating system option? I don't want to reload my original operating system because it's windows 7 (I upgraded to windows 10 home during free period) and losing all I have including the HP specific applications
 and drivers I currently have. That's all I see as options. This OS is a prelease preview with a finite expiration date. I really want out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a horrible situation that makes my computer virtually useless. It's unstable, essential components often fail where they work on other computers using more stable OS builds. I thought getting to see the new stuff would be fun but that fun is easily
 overshadowed by the loss of full-use availability of the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a crystal ball and can read when the magic update is released that changes the "Stop Insider Preview Builds" options from:</p>
<p><strong>1 day</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 days</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 days</strong></p>
<p><strong>7 days</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>to:</p>
<p><strong>1 day</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 days</strong></p>
<p><strong>5 days</strong></p>
<p><strong>7 days</strong></p>

<p>The best way to get out of the insider program is to install the public release 14393.xxx and in Settings, Updates, Windows Insider program make sure you are not getting Previews.</p>
<p>Make sure you backup you data.&nbsp; Look at the Download folder and if it has a bunch of files make sure you copy this folder to your back up were you can reinstall your programs.</p>

<h2>            Feedback for missing features from Outlook 2016 Mac</h2>
                    <p>I recently moved companies which required me to give up my windows laptop and use a MacBook. Two very important features that were available in Outlook 2016 Windows are now missing from Outlook 2016 Mac.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to flag an email for follow-up when drafting. If I do so and then send the email, the flag and reminder are removed.<span>&nbsp;It seems silly to have to go back into the Sent Folder in order to flag it.</span></li><li><span>Ability&nbsp;to recall a message. You can't even do it in the Mac version of this app. Frustrating.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I wanted to provide feedback, but the link provided to me buy the community moderator did not lead me there - instead it was the product page for Office for Mac.</span></p>

<p>Hi Sara McMichael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft online support number is illegal and don't trust it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the two features you mentioned, they are not feasible in Outlook for Mac but&nbsp;available in Outlook for Windows. Regarding the two features, there are also many users who want to have them. For the first one "Ability to flag an email for follow-up when
 drafting", you can vote via&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/15174165-enable-follow-up-flag-when-composing-a-message" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enable Follow-up flag when composing a message</a>. For the
 second one "Ability to recall a message", you can vote your feedback via&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/8012202-add-recall-this-message-function-and-support-mes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add "Recall

<h2>            Microsoft or Outlook.com blocked my Hotmail account</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp; A challenge to all you Technichians/engineers and experts!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FACTS: - Microsoft/Outlook.com blocked my Hotmail a/c., insisted I verified my security by repeating a code, which they had sent to my Hotmail a/c., which I could not access because they had blocked it! X??!!&nbsp; Where's the logic in that?&nbsp; After 55 hrs., 14
 days - countless chats with Microsoft a/c., Support - longer than 'War &amp; Peace' it seemed the only solution&nbsp;was to open an Outlook.com., much against my wishes. My reasoning - they took it away - they give it back&nbsp; -&nbsp; I submitted to the bullying - to open
 an Outlook.com a/c. During that time, chat people freely accessed my Hotmail a/c., allowed me to enter - they obviously had the tools. Since then - I cannot access my Hotmail a/c. and they refute that they have the tools or the answer.&nbsp; Being a life long troubleshooter
 - my phylosophy is - "Go back to the person who caused the problem - solve it - not take it to the neighbourhood."&nbsp; So now I am bullied to enter a 'Forum'.&nbsp; No disrespect. Again, not my choice.&nbsp; With respect, I am 70yrs. old, very poorly and have been trying
 to contact&nbsp; my people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>URGENT - All my emails are still in my Hotmail a/c along with my contact list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please can anyone help.&nbsp; My emails &amp; contact list were not transferred to the new Outlook.com a/c., which I was forced to open.&nbsp; In fact, every account, my telephone bill etc.,
 is in my Hotmail account.&nbsp; Do I have to change my email a/c for all my business - from Hotmail to Outlook????&nbsp; So many questions I have to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies - I am not too good at this, but as a 'Poor Man's&nbsp;Lawyer for 40 yrs., Never lost a case, I am happy to have my case investigated by Microsoft.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>

 Simple computer literate and logic.&nbsp; Tell me I am wrong. I am happy to learn.&nbsp; I used the heading 'Outlook.com' because they were the closest to my problem and caused the problem.

    <title>Audio stops working when rebooting or waking my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sickmetal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio stops working when rebooting or waking my PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a Creative X-FI Titanium sound card. When it was installed and I upgraded to Windows 10, there were no audio issues if I shut down, rebooted, or woke my PC. Last week I removed the sound card then replaced and then there was no audio. I installed
 the latest supported audio driver for Windows 81, rebooted my PC and I had audio. The issue is that now if I shut down, reboot, or wake my PC, there's a very good chance that there won't be any audio. I've played around with the audio properties, checked for
 driver updates, etc., to no avail. The only thing that works is if I reinstall the audio driver and reboot then I have sound again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any else has a solution, I'd love to hear about it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. We are looking forward to improve it and provide the best possible customer experience in the latest coming builds.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to use the Windows Feedback app to send your thoughts directly to the team building Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-winipp/how-to-share-feedback-on-windows-10-technical/5e501781-a580-43e3-8926-40ae19343805</a>
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Trying out an early build like this can be risky. That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to stop using Windows Technical Preview and return to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC—typically a DVD. If you don't have recovery
 media, you might be able to create a USB recovery drive. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>

            It usually isn't a good idea to move the actual document file to the desktop -- it's too easily deleted. You can put a shortcut to the document on the desktop, which is safer.<br />
<br />
Right-click the document file in the library. Click <b>Send To</b>, and then click
<b>Desktop (create shortcut)</b>.<br />
<br />
To open the document in Word, just double-click the shortcut icon on the desktop.<br />

            <p>Jay gave you a great solution, but if you still want to just move the document to the desktop, just open the folder the document is stored in, then just click&nbsp;the document and drag&nbsp;it to the desktop. You can also open the document and save it to the desktop.</p>

    <title>Copying Colors from a Website - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellen finkelstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying Colors from a Website</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />This article will teach you how you can copy colors from a website to your presentation.&nbsp; It's important to brand your presentations and getting the colors right is a great first step.
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can easily take colors from a website. Perhaps you want your presentation to use the same colors as your company's Web site. Or you might simply find a color that you like on a Web site. HTML uses hexadecimal codes to define colors,
 but these codes are still in the familiar Red-Green-Blue (RGB) format that PowerPoint uses. All you need to do is to change the hexadecimal codes to decimal equivalents.
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p>The shortcut is to use the eyedropper in PowerPoint 2013.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/2-powerpoint-2013-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>I explain how to use it here.</strong> </a>If you're using an earlier version, you can use a colorpicker application like
<a href="http://www.iconico.com/ColorPic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ColorPic</a>. But if you want to get the colors directly from your website, here are the steps:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Open the web page.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. In your browser, right-click the page and choose View&gt;Source (or the equivalent in your browser). The HTML source code opens in Notepad.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. From Notepad’s menu, choose Edit&gt;Find.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. In the Find What text box, type color. Click Find Next. You’ll see a code segment that looks something like this: bgcolor="#E1EAF3". Write down the 6 characters between the quotation marks. (Bgcolor stands for “background color.”)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Click Find Next again to find other instances. If you don’t know HTML, you may have trouble figuring out which code relates to the color you want, so just write down all the hexadecimal codes you find.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/315db9df-5da5-43ab-b8b7-c04a0d4976b4" />6. Now go to
<a href="http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dtp-aus.com/hexadeci.htm</a>, which is a hexadecimal to decimal conversion table.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7. Look up the first two characters of your color code and write it down. In the example above, look up E1, which is 225. This is the red value.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. Look up the second two characters and write it next to the red value, leaving a space. In our example, this is 234, the decimal value for EA. This is the green value.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">9. Look up the last two characters and write it next to the green value, leaving a space. In our example, this is 243, the decimal value for F3. This is the blue value. So the result would be 225 234 243.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10. In PowerPoint, insert any shape. Right-click the shape and choose Format&gt;Shape.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">11. Click the Color drop-down list of the Fill Section and choose More Colors.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">12. On the Custom tab, make sure that the Color Model is set to RGB . Then enter the red, green, and blue colors.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">13. Click OK twice to return to your slide. Your shape now has the color you saw on the website. If that’s not the color you want, retry with the other hexadecimal codes you wrote down.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can use this color as a background, to fill a shape, or to color your text.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This original article,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.ellenfinkelstein.com/pptblog/copying-colors-from-a-web-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Copying Colors from a Web Site</span></a></strong>, is on my website.</p>

<h2>            Not receiving updates, had to do a clean install of build 10240 due to a Critical Program Died error</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a registered Insider, since February of 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on build 10565 when my computer received a really bad error, (Critical_Program_Died....or something to that effect). The computer would not even complete a boot cycle without going into a BSOD. The only way to fix it was to reset the Windows 8 partition,
 then from&nbsp;within Windows 8&nbsp;activate the Windows 10 update, this created a bootable USB drive with the Consumer version of Windows 10 loaded. This was used to rebuild the Windows 10 partition, which is now running fine on build 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how do I get back in to the preview builds? </p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Activation Settings says that my Windows 10 verison&nbsp; is Activated. </p>
<p>- I did not use a product key when I installed Windows 10 from Windows 8. </p>
<p>- I have turned on the 'Get Insider Builds' and clicked 'Fast'.</p>
<p>- I have verified my account from the Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been just over 24 hours since the reinstall of Windows 10, no Insider builds have shown up. I have been checking with the update service in Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a long wait, or have I missed a setting somewhere??</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Something is different about how preview builds are being sent via Windows Update after the RTM release in July.&nbsp; Many have had to wait hours or days before being offered the build.&nbsp; For some it is never offered.&nbsp; There has been no clear direction as to
 how to resolve or troubleshoot what is wrong when a build is never offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could have used the ESD file generated during your last Windows 10 build 10565 install to create a 10565 ISO to do a clean install.&nbsp; I also installed it a few times by using DISM to apply the ESD file to replace the contents of my C: drive without making
 an ISO.&nbsp; Once you get a build it can be beneficial to keep a copy of this ESD file for use when things quit working.&nbsp; It is generated during Windows Update at C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources.install.esd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did to get the first preview build after RTM was fire up a Hyper-V VM running Windows 10 and put it on the Fast Ring.&nbsp; I had to leave it running about 12 hours, restarting several times throughout the day before the Insider Preview build was finally
 offered in Windows Update.&nbsp; Meanwhile I could go about my day on my main Windows 10 RTM install.&nbsp; Since then, I use the Hyper-V to "fetch" me the next Insider ESD file and create an ISO from it.&nbsp; Usually it is offered almost immediately since my Hyper-V VM
 is already on the Insider builds and has not been modified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, ensure that all Privacy settings are set to maximum info going to Microsoft or no build will be offered.</p>

            <p>@Don Cuthbert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately I do not have an ESD file, so I had to re-install Win 10 from within Win 8.1. As mentioned above the version installed is now 10240.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell the computer is set to receive insider updates. I'm just trying to find out how long it will take before the insider builds start to show up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now well into a day and a half with no updates showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has suggestions, or knows how to trigger the update builds then please write a comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all.</p>

            <p>It helps to have a running Windows 10, so that the System and MSR partitions don't need to change. Then take your official Windows 10 install USB and copy the install.esd you want to apply onto it.&nbsp; Right at the root folder would be easiest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot the computer with the normal Windows 10 USB but choose Repair your computer.&nbsp; Navigate the menus to a Command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to use diskpart to determine your current drive letters. I normally make the Windows partition C: and the System partition S:.&nbsp; In diskpart type list volume to show the current lettering.&nbsp; "Select volume" 'x' (use the number)&nbsp;and use "remove"
 to remove a drive letter and "assign letter=S" or just "assign" to assign the next available letter to a volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To format the Windows partition, select it in diskpart&nbsp;and use "format quick fs=ntfs"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM command is</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">DISM /Apply-Image /ImageFile:E:\install.esd /Index:4 /ApplyDir:C:\&nbsp; &lt;--- assumes your USB is E:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then run bcdboot to set the BCD to the new Windows install:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">bcdboot C:\Windows /s S: /f UEFI /c&nbsp; &lt;-- for UEFI BIOS mode computer (assumes System partition&nbsp;is S:)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">bcdboot C:\Windows /s S: /f BIOS /c&nbsp; &lt;-- Legacy BIOS mode computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type exit and then exit the command prompt.&nbsp; You should then see a menu option to launch Windows 10 to complete the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's easier to make a bootable ISO with the ESD Decrypter 4.7 script, but you have a chance to learn more using DISM and commands to build the System and boot volumes, if that is of interest.</p>

<h2>            Installing Office Home and Student 2007 on Windows 8.1</h2>

 the program that I can find. &nbsp;Any suggestions?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify whether this issue is causing due to conflict in printer driver, uninstall and install the printer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X</strong>, select <strong>Device Manager.
</strong>2. Expand <strong>Print queues, </strong>find the printer right click and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <span>
Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once completed, restart your computer.&nbsp;Printer Drivers will automatically install.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: You may also logon to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest drivers and get it installed.</span></p>
