<h2>            Locked out of Skip Ahead</h2>
                    <p>My pedantic whine of the day :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I immediately joined the Skip Ahead way back when.&nbsp; I had to rebuild a clean system due to issues and of course was subsequently dropped from Skip Ahead for doing that rebuild.&nbsp; Now I read that Skip Ahead is once again the approach going forward (17101/17604)
 with the twist that Skip Ahead is already full because all the former Skip Ahead users were automatically entered into the next round.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is how they populate Skip Ahead for each future round, it seems we will always be locked out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could try this: (Worked for me)&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Switch to skip ahead - even though it says closed</p>
<p>2. Run Windows Update troubleshooter</p>
<p>3. Go to Windows Update and click check for updates and see if you get 17604<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d7a9fe0-b7db-4167-aeb2-87b0702d929f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d7a9fe0-b7db-4167-aeb2-87b0702d929f?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Last week, when I selected Skip Ahead, I got the message that Skip Ahead was closed, etc. etc., but the selection remained on Skip Ahead. This never happened before, it always reverted back to Active Development. I tried an update, and got 17604. Try that
 and se what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like MS needs to do some work on its Skip Ahead interface.</p>

<p>Running Build 17101:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried it - switched to Skip Ahead, ran the troubleshooter, and then tried Windows Update - no success in getting build 17601.&nbsp; Would be nice if those of us that had initially enrolled in Skip Ahead did not lose this status if we had to reinstall Insider

            I don't know if Skip Ahead branch is associated with our Microsoft Account, or if it is limited by the number of devices.&nbsp; But I have always been able to enable it, even after a clean install, by a simple registry edit.&nbsp; Part of getting the registry edit
 to work may be to not access the Insider screen in Settings before checking Windows Update for the next Skip Ahead build.&nbsp; But maybe it only works because my Microsoft Account is registered in some way.

<p>I want to say it's device (won't say why), but that wouldn't explain</p>
<p>the weird things that are happening with those that are getting</p>
<p>Skip Ahead on devices that were never registered for Skip Ahead.</p>
<p>But some of those their MSA's were.</p>

<p>I actually suspect that it is neither the device nor the Microsoft Account.&nbsp; If half of the current Skip Ahead devices were to stay turned off for 48 hours when a new Skip Ahead build is released, maybe that would open up some spots for more.&nbsp; But later
 on, if those existing Skip Ahead devices were to log on, they would still get the new build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a device is accurately configured as a Skip Ahead, it doesn't get kicked out, especially if it already has a Skip Ahead build installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, at any time, some Skip Ahead users might decide to put their PC on Active Development branch, while someone with a Skip Ahead ISO could add an unlimited number of new Skip Ahead branch devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning, they open it up to a limited number of devices, but the actual number of Skip Ahead devices could vary pretty widely as time goes on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dropped off Skip Ahead on all devices, as soon as the Fall Creators Update came out.&nbsp; But I had no trouble adding a VM back into Skip Ahead a couple of days before the current build came out.</p>

<p>Hmm,&nbsp; back when I originally had the issue, I was configured as Skip Ahead and had not experienced any problems signing up for it.&nbsp; I did however experience problems&nbsp; receiving new builds and I followed the recommendation to start from a clean build.&nbsp; I
 believed that I could simply re-enable Skip Ahead since I had successfully registered for it prior.&nbsp;&nbsp;However at that point I could no longer enable or join Skip Ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have waited these past months and when I saw the other day that Skip Ahead was coming I figured that's great, I can finally rejoin.&nbsp; As I read on, I learned that Microsoft just preregistered all the existing Skip Ahead users making the pool filled and
 I was (again) unable to enable or rejoin the Skip Ahead group.<br />
</p>
<p>So yeah, even though I was one of the earliest joiners, I have been both "kicked out" and effectively "locked out", regardless of the mechanics.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the end of the world but it is supremely annoying.<br />

<p>Try changing the following in registry:</p>
<p>(Assuming that you already have Fast Ring selected in Windows Insider Program page)</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\Applicability\ContentType to
<strong>Skip</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsSelfHost\UI\Selection\ContentType to
<strong>Skip</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now open Settings - Update &amp; Security - Windows Update and Check for updates.&nbsp; Do not access the Windows Insider Program page.&nbsp; Once you have checked for updates, you can check the Windows Insider Program page to see if it is locked into Skip Ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you start downloading 17604, you are in.&nbsp; If not, check the registry again to see if it reverted back to Active and change it again.&nbsp; Check Windows Update for the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all I did to get back onto Skip Ahead on a Hyper-V VM.</p>

<h3> lily az  say:</h3>
<h2>            SetFocus Does Not trigger a GotFocus Event</h2>
                    <p>The code below works just fine if the user clicks on the TopCatCodee control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Private Sub TopCatCodee_GotFocus()</p>
<p>&nbsp;If Me.IntTopSzeCode = 3 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;Me.txtFullness = 60</p>
<p>&nbsp;ElseIf Me.IntTopSzeCode = 4 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;Me.txtFullness = 80</p>
<p>&nbsp;ElseIf Me.IntTopSzeCode = 5 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;Me.txtFullness = 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;ElseIf Me.IntTopSzeCode = 6 Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;Me.txtFullness = 120</p>
<p>&nbsp;End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However that is not the normal way the user gets to the control.&nbsp; Instead&nbsp; the following code runs when the user closes the SelectTopStyle form.&nbsp; The last line sets the focus to the control but the above GotFocus code won’t run.&nbsp; Is &nbsp;there a solution?&nbsp; I
 have tried the lost focus event too but it didn’t make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set ctrl = Me.lstTopDesc</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(ctrl) Then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Error Resume Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms.orderentry.OrderDraperyLineItems.Form.Controls("TopDescCode") = ctrl</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Forms.orderentry.OrderDraperyLineItems.Form.topcatcodee.SetFocus</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End If</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub</p>

            <p>Hi Lily,</p>
<p>That is by design. When doing things with VBA no events ever fire. 99% of the time this is a good thing; the other times you simply call the event procedure yourself:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms.orderentry.OrderDraperyLineItems.Form.Controls("TopDescCode") = ctrl</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Forms.orderentry.OrderDraperyLineItems.Form.topcatcodee.SetFocus</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Forms.orderentry.OrderDraperyLineItems.Form.topcatcodee_GotFocus</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to make it a Public Sub:</p>
<p><strong>Public</strong> Sub TopCatCodee_GotFocus()<br />
&nbsp; Me.txtFullness = 20 * Me.IntTopSzeCode</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p />

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have emoji icon in the TouchBar when using Skype 8.13, but my colleague does.</p>
<p>I checked the iMessenger, the emoji in Touchbar does work, but not in my Skype.</p>
<p>Anyone have the same issue or knows how to fix it?</p>

<p>The Access Point menu under Settings is also missing on my new Lumia 920. Bought sim free and unlocked from Phones4u in the UK, but MMS refuses to send or receive. I've reported to Nokia Care and they have referred it to second line support as a software
 bug. The problem appears to be, not so much that Access Point is missing (although a problem in itself) but that Virgin Mobile UK'S MMSC Url setting uses a colon and four numbers at the end of the url instead of a forward slash. So, if you try to add/edit
 the mms apn under "mobile network" in Settings, with the correct MMSC url like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://mms.virginmobile.co.uk:8002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mms.virginmobile.co.uk:8002</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the phone saves it incorrectly like this instead:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://mms.virginmobile.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mms.virginmobile.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(please note, the MMSC Port is correctly saved as 8080).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The difference above, is what won't allow mms to be sent or received, while all other settings in the APN are being saved correctly. Virgin Mobile UK insist this is a software bug, which must be rectified by Nokia/Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone here, help replicate this bug (even if your on another network), by just editing your apn's MMSC url, with the digits in the first example above, and then try to save it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks very much!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>And here's the fix .... finally !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1) Delete any existing Internet &amp; MMS APN profiles stored in the handset, by&nbsp;tapping: Start, Settings, Mobile Settings, and scroll to the bottom of the screen and remove each apn manually by tapping edit, then tap the delete icon (looks like a waste bin)
 at the bottom right of the screen (you might need to tap "..." to reveal the option.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2)Once all Apn's are removed, make sure the phone is connected via wifi,&nbsp; and open the following URL in Internet Explorer in the handset: (it may be easier to email yourself these links so you can simply open them on the handset).</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ce3895c7-01d0-4daf-a4c3-25c10463942d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?</font><font color="#0066cc">appid=ce3895c7-01d0-4daf-a4c3-</font><font color="#0066cc">25c10463942d</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the instructions on screen to install the Nokia update.&nbsp; This will add a new settings menu to the handset "Access Point", which is missing on phones bought from Phones4u or the EE companies&nbsp;in the UK (like mine!).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3) Following the above instructions again, but this time for the following app - "network+".&nbsp; Again, this is a Nokia settings update downloaded through the handset's Windows App Store/Marketplace:</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=62f172d1-f552-4749-871c-2afd1c95c245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?</font><font color="#0066cc">appid=62f172d1-f552-4749-871c-</font><font color="#0066cc">2afd1c95c245</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4) And the final step is to download the app called "extras+info" :</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=2377fe1b-c10f-47da-92f3-fc517345a3c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.windowsphone.com/s?</font><font color="#0066cc">appid=2377fe1b-c10f-47da-92f3-</font><font color="#0066cc">fc517345a3c0</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once all the above are done, the phone must be rebooted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5) Now go to the settings menu, and scroll to the bottom. You should now see a new menu called: "Access Point". Tap it and you'll end up with a screen listing any APN's the phone has already found from the sim card (or previous sim cards inserted).&nbsp; Crucially,
 Virgin won't be listed at first, and even if it is, you'll need to amend the apn details..&nbsp;because&nbsp;if you try adding a new apn named&nbsp;"Virgin", you'll get a message saying "Virgin already exists", even though it's not showing in the list of apn's. So the workaround
 here, is to name it virgin with a small v. Then enter the APN settings for both internet and MMS found here:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://virgin.wdsglobal.com/phonefirst?step=phone.vm&amp;phoneId=5143&amp;captchaEnabled=true&amp;contractId=289&amp;networkId=84&amp;countryId=36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://virgin.wdsglobal.com/phonefirst?step=phone.vm&amp;phoneId=5143&amp;captchaEnabled=true&amp;contractId=289&amp;networkId=84&amp;countryId=36</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(on that link:&nbsp; References to "Wap Gateway Address" and "Wap Gateway Port"&nbsp;means "Proxy address" and "Proxy Port"&nbsp;as shown in the handset!)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>I recently followed the instructions provided in the thread. Everything worked great... For a little while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, I simply created a new profile in 'access point', switched to that new profile, and switched back to the real profile, and it all started to work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new temporary profile need not be complete, as long as it can be saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just thought I'd share in case it saves someone some trouble.</p>

<h2>            Outlook losing access to .pst file</h2>
                    <p>I have Outlook 365.&nbsp; I used to have no issues leaving my email up and going 24/7.&nbsp; Now, Outlook loses connection to my .pst file about every 4-5 hours and I need to restart.&nbsp; I have admin permission.&nbsp; I have multiple email addresses.&nbsp; I archive regularly
 so the email file is not too large.&nbsp; This is a recent development.</p>

            This is for a POP account? Do you get any error messages? 
<br />Is the pst stored in onedrive? (it should not be - its not supported and can corrupt the data file.)

<p>Hi Diane,</p>
<p>No, the .pst file is stored locally.&nbsp; I do have it backed up, but that won't cause any issues.&nbsp; It is not just one .pst file.&nbsp; There are multiple.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are POP accounts.&nbsp; The only error I get is something like :the file, c:// etc... can not be accessed as it is being used by another user.&nbsp; I have run multiple tests, checked my firewall, checked all connected devices.&nbsp; No other users have access.&nbsp;
 Again, this is for multiple .pst files.&nbsp; So it would almost have to be a duplicate Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also a new phenomenon.&nbsp; Just started about a week ago. </p>

            Are the accounts pop or imap/outlook.com/exchange?  
<br />
<br />Outlook puts a lock on the file when its open, but after about 10 min of non-use, may release the lock so other programs can access it. That sounds like what is happening.

            Not possible that I know of. I dont think anyone has ever developed and licensed a Windows Media Player on Series60. IT might have somethign to do with competitive edge, and Msoft having their own Smart phone OS.

            WMAPlus! says it plays Windows Media Audio on phones like the N70 (based on S60 2nd Ed.):<br />

<br />
I believe it does not handle DRM (Digital Rights Management) protected WMA files, though.<br />
<br />
Also, there's no S60 3rd Edition version (but then there are S60 3rd Edition based models with WMA support built-in, such as the N91).

            Well N91 with firmware 2.xx or higher supports both protected and un-protected WMA songs.<br />
<br />
You can even use WMP 10 or 11 to sync the music automatically.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Emily,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by the issue, we fully understand the frustration when encountering it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you open the documents? By double clicking them or right clicking them and choose
<strong>Open with</strong>&gt;<strong>Microsoft Word</strong>?</p>
<p>Or by opening Word application first&gt;click<strong> File
</strong>menu&gt;<strong>Open</strong>/<strong>Open Recent</strong>&gt;locate the document to open it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try following:</p>
<p>1.Create a copy of the document, check if you can open the copy.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restart Mac in safe mode to isolate issues</a>, then check if you can open the documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above doesn’t help, pleas share with us the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.Does the issue happen to all of you documents or some specific documents?</p>
<p>2.Do you get any error message when the documents don't open? You may share a screenshot for the error.</p>
<p>3.What is the version of your Office?</p>
<p>If you can open other Office apps Excel or PowerPoint, you can check version via Excel menu&gt;About Microsoft Excel.</p>

<p>Hi Tina</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I seem to be able to open documents (most easily if I right click and choose open with - microsoft word, but it takes AGES to open and then often will pause whilst I'm typing and I have to wait for it to come back to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Microsoft word for Mac, Version 15.29 (161209) - seems to be an issue with word, rather than powerpoint or excel.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Emily,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can feel that the affected document is important to you. I will help you and try troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest you confirm the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Firstly please make sure you have installed the latest version of Word.
</p>
<p>If you are using Office for Mac 2019, the current latest version is 16.21(190117), if you are using Office for Mac 2016, the current latest version is 16.16.6(190114).</p>
<p>Please click Word menu&gt;About Microsoft Word to check the version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Have you tried opening Word application first, then click File&gt;Open Recent&gt;find the document and see if you can open it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Where do you save the document? In local Mac or online location such as personal OneDrive or OneDrive for business?</p>
<p>If it is saved in OneDrive, I'd like to suggest you go to OneDrive online and check if you can open the document in Word online. If yes, download it to your Mac and edit it in Word desktop
 application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And could you please share the information below with me so that I can better understand the situation and help you?</p>
<p>1.When you cannot open the document, do you get any error message? I'd like to know the detailed symptom and see if we can find any clue on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Is it the specific document which you cannot open? What is the file size of it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>
        </p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />To address this concern, we suggest that you follow these steps on how to import a calendar in the Calendar app in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />1. Click the Start menu, and click the Calendar app.
<br />2. Click on the gear icon (Settings) and select Manage Accounts.
<br />3. Click on the type of account you want to add.
<br />4. Enter your account information, and then click the Sign In button.
<br />5. Click Done.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

            &gt;&gt;How can I import my Windows 10 mail app calendar into Outloook 2016?
<br />
<br />What type of account was configured in the W10 app (i.e. Outlook.com/Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo etc etc
<br />
<br />There is no export function in the Win 10 mail calendar app. How you would get the calendar data from W10 Calendar depends on the type of account that was configured for the W10 app
<br />
<br />If it was an Outlook.com/Exchange account, just need to configure the account in Outlook and the calendar data will be there
<br />
<br />If it's a GMail or Yahoo account, would need to export the data from the respective account and then import that into Outlook

<h2>            Receives error message &#34;Unable to write memory&#34;at shutdown on Windows 10 Technical Preview</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10: Receive error message at shutdown</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>ever since upgrading my computer to the windows 10 technical preview from windows 8.1 I receive an error message at shutdown. When shutting down the computer an error message pops up saying " Unable to write memory" the message does go on for longer but
 thats all I can ever read before it disappears again, As soon as the error message goes my computer shuts down instantly as though I have just pulled the plug out the wall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once powering the computer back up, it works fine as though nothing happened however every time it does not shutdown probably and instantly loses power after the error is displayed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this I am a big fan of windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced for all responses</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 on Mac - Weird Problem with Mouse</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi – a weird problem.&nbsp; Have just installed latest Outlook 2016 on my MacBook air.&nbsp; When I am typing there are 2 issues:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The keyboard occasionally misses letters – so loads of misspellings</span></li><li><span>The mouse is behaving strangely – when you hover over a word and right click, the cursor moves down a line and doesn’t know where you are right clicking over – this means that you can’t autocorrect a misspelling (most of the time – it's
 a bit sporadic)</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Put the 2 issues together and it is basically making Outlook unusable.</span></p>
<p><span>I have downloaded and installed the very latest software and its completely OK in Word and other Office software.&nbsp; Just Outlook – so it’s not a mouse or keyboard thing.&nbsp; I have typed this in Word for pasting into the chat!</span></p>

            Hi Mrlonghairs,<br />
<br />
Have you tried re-installing your current firmware via Nokia Suite? If this does not work either, then you will have no choice but to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect.<br />

<h2>            Cannot verify email, no access to skype account for work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, this whole windows live skype account procedure is the most painful, awful, unintuitive, overly complicated user experience I've had. If I had a choice I would never use a windows live account for absolutely anything in this world.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second off - i wanted to check the price of a video game you are offering, which made me change my email, enter phone numbers all kinds of stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it couldn't be the same email for some god forsaken reason i used one of my other emails. But now I cant verify it because for some reason the code never arrives at the email even though its correct. I cannot even CHANGE the email to something else
 because apparently I have to wait 6 months. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I do not have access to my work related skype account because of these **** syncd 5 in 1, 50 different emails verifications ****, I don't have access to all my work contacts because I can't login skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE can this freaking email be changed earlier than six months or somehow just remove the authentication, I've got no idea.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely ludicrous that an email that you enter in one field can block off your entire account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes i've tried to resent, the email DOES NOT ARRIVE. The account name is *************.
</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft values your privacy and safety and wants to make sure that you don’t lose access to your account. Therefore, when you sign in to
 Skype, you might be prompted to verify it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also check the junk / spam email folder for the code. Also, try if you can add a security information on your account by following the instructions
 on this FAQ link below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you still unable to, then you will need to go through account recovery process using this
</span><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a><span>. Once you’re done with the form, you will get an update from Microsoft regarding the recovery of the account.</span></span></p>

    <title>How am I suppose to re-install The insider preview with the new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william roe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How am I suppose to re-install The insider preview with the new measures takin in the newest build&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay so this is actually becoming a very big problem for me. I installed the preview on my pc with Build 10166, but after that my GPU(R9 280x Tri-x Vapor-x) would have random spells and crash. Well last night my pc decided it was going to crash but this
 time it was going to stop recognizing my gpu completely. I tried restarting my pc a few times and it worked for a little while untill it fully crashed again and hasn't worked since. My GPU fans are spinning and it is lighting up but my pc doesn't recognize
 it. Now this morning I finally got my pc to show any sign of life through my monitor it told me windows couldn't start correctly and I had to run diagnostics. Well that didn't help, the only option that did work was the reset option where it whipes averything
 except the IOS. Except that half way through the process it said there was a problem then stopped and had me hit accept to restart. WELL.... after it had me restart my computer started right away. Only for it to tell me that none of my Drives have an OS installed
 on it. <br />
So my question is with the release you guys have with the new build not alowing anyone to download the IOS even if it's for a pc that was already on the system then how am i suppose to deal with this lol? I didn't exactly make a backup of windows 7 because
 I figured a late build of the flagship IOS you are releasing wouldn't have extreme problems like this.<br />

            First thing I would do is remove the GPU and use the on board VGA or DVI if available (as no info provided about system) and reboot and see what comes up, if it comes up go into device manager and delete the GPU that you are having troubles with, then
 go to the GPU web site and down load the newest driver or use the disc that came with the GPU, then reinstall the GPU with the new driver.

                    My PC has Vista &amp; I use Word 2002. Sometimes when I drag a .doc file (or PDF) from the desktop into a folder I can not open them anymore.&nbsp;

<div>When I go to advanced security settings for one of these Word documents is states "No groups of users have permission to access this object".</div>
<div>No one else uses my computer and I have always been able to perform actions - as administrator if necessary.&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I add administrator to the Group or user names of both the PDF &amp; doc files, they still will not open.</div>
<div>Within the same problem folder as these problem files, I can open jpg &amp; MP4 files.&nbsp;</div>

<div>In addition, sometimes when I try to save an existing doc file after editing, the displayed file name on the top of the Word window changes to a tmp file and the original name in the folder the document came from, disappears.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>How can I connect to my internet when in lockscreen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haneul kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I connect to my internet when in lockscreen&#63;</h2>
                    This happened after I restarted my laptop. I put my password in and it said that is incorrect, but is not. Then I found out that my laptop is not connected to the internet even though before it restarted, it still had internet on. Other devices were working
 fine meaning that the internet network is strong. Please help me, I really need to use my laptop as soon as possible. I have been having this problem since the past 3 days. The reason I restarted my laptop was because of the blue screen/stop code issue. I’m
 using an HP model and Windows 10. Thank you.

            Hi, Haneul
<br />
<br />Follow these steps, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />1) Disconnect the internet computer.
<br />
<br />2) Try entering your local account again with the password of your Microsoft account, immediately you will see a legend that tells you a connection error and an option will open in the lower options of login.
<br />
<br />3) Enter your local account validating any of the last three passwords of the same.
<br />
<br />4) Once you are logged in to your local account, manually reinstall the network card driver by viewing

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.

<div>I opened a journal doc and I tryied to simply type and seems impossible. I see all the fancy functions, such as drawing/writing with a digi pen, but I don't see the basic function of typing, which I think it's a major software glitch. Please advise.&nbsp;</div>

 journaling program.

            In that case, you are in the wrong place. This forum is for Microsoft Office products only. If you can find a forum for the software company that published your journaling program, then that would be the appropriate place to ask a question.
