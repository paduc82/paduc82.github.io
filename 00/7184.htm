<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to wildcard&nbsp;filter a subform using an unbound text box on the main form.&nbsp; Unfortuntantly, I don't know where to start with this.&nbsp; Any help would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Create a query that will be used as the Recordsource for the subform.&nbsp; Set a reference to the unbound text box in the appropriate Criteria Row of the query.</p>

This works for filtering a main form. You could apply it filter a subform, by referencing the subform instead of using the ME shortcut for the Filter and FilterOn properties. But I still suggest a query is a better way. As far as using wildcards, again a more
 specific example of what you want to do with the data would help. You would need to use the LIKE operator and then append the wildcard (*) character to the text entry.<br />

<h2>            firewall block of &#34;akamai&#92;netsession_win.exe&#34; is this a virus&#47;malware&#47;etc attempt&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have not downloaded anything lately (as in several days),&nbsp;I had been working&nbsp;off line and&nbsp;left&nbsp;it sitting idle to go to lunch,&nbsp;I came back and found this on the desk top. What is netsession_win.exe and why does it want to communicate with Private and public
 networks? I checked program listing and a akamai program was installed yesterday on this computer but I did not install anything on this computer yesterday or for several days.
</p>
<p>I have a Win Home Server&nbsp;with 2 win7 64bit,1 32bit, and 3xp pro&nbsp;computers attached. Only the desktop W7 64bit and laptop W7 64bit seem to have this pop-up and this akamai program installed both install dates 11-3-11?&nbsp; All 3 W7 machines run MSE the 3XP run
 mcafee still.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>SL</p>
<p>&nbsp;Update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yes this was virus and I had to have&nbsp;a professional clean it out, came in with a Microsoft&nbsp;update. He had 3 other cases of it.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Because you apparently don't understand what you are reading from that page and the others it links to, which&nbsp;are completely clear to me.&nbsp; However, I already knew what Akamai is, so that may make me immediately less concerned with the application itself,
 which is still described by the following paragraph at the end of the initial article and several other references within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""<b>How do I uninstall the Akamai NetSession Interface?</b><br />
Windows: The Akamai NetSession Interface is a network library integrated into other applications. When you uninstall any of those applications, the library uninitializes. If you wish to uninstall the Akamai NetSession Interface, go to the AdminTool found at
 C:\Program Files\Common Files\Akamai\AdminTool.exe"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically Akamai is simply the worlds largest caching engine, also known as a Content Delivery Network, which provides these services to many of the worlds largest data and streaming providers in order to better serve these items (think files) to you the
 end&nbsp;customer.&nbsp; Read the Akamai Technology and other pages here if you wish to understand better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.akamai.com/html/technology/index.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what another couple of these paragraphs describe more completely is exactly what you have asked:</p>
<p>"Upon further review, it appears that the <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/misc/akamai_client/netsession_interface_faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Akamai NetSession Interface</a> is some sort of download accelerator/caching tool, but it is not clear how the user got that particular tool on their system.&nbsp; It does have an entry in the Windows control panel with some administrative
 tools. <br />
<br />
This app appears to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
installware</a> - i.e. a program, not necessarily malicious (but annoying) that was installed without the user's knowledge or direct consent, but included with some other download or via an automatic download mechanism.&nbsp; There is
 a <a href="http://www.akamai.com/html/customers/customer_list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
long list of companies</a> that appear to use this tool"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to summarize, the netsession_win.exe program is described in these two paragraphs and is nothing but a download accelerator and possibly&nbsp;installer that something you&nbsp;browsed to&nbsp;on the Internet invoked to provide its services.&nbsp; This could be an upgrade
 for an application package, a streamed audio or video, or any other type of typically large data file that you requested from a news or application vendor.</p>
<p>So this program itself isn't of true concern, though whatever it was going to deliver in your case is unknown, so we can't make any real definitive statement about the content you requested itself.&nbsp; However, Akamai is highly aware of the potential for their
 network to be misused and so&nbsp;must be&nbsp;inherently quite careful and proactive towards this potential.&nbsp; If their data provider customers files contain malware, so will the content they deliver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key issue here is that if this were malware, it's far more likely that either MSE or McAfee would have known and detected it than anyone monitoring this forum.&nbsp; File names mean nothing themselves as they can be easily faked, so one person might say yes
 and another no for the same exact file and both be correct if that name is being misused by malware.&nbsp; It makes far more sense to either trust your antimalware itself or upload to one of the online malware checking services like VirusTotal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The fact that this program got blocked by MSE and Windows Firewall on both of my Win 7 computers and my WHS server makes me look here because that is what this forum is for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Rob --- If it is ok program to use and let run on your computer why would it get blocked by Microsoft?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Please actually <u>read</u> the paragraph you quoted, it quite clearly states the there is no single answer of either 'Yes' or 'No' that can be assumed, since each individual case is different.&nbsp; In one case it might be the original, safe file actually&nbsp;provided
 by Akamai and in another it could be malware that is misusing exactly the same name, since nothing about a file name inherently provides any assurance of what the file really is.</p>
<p>This is why so much malware exists that re-uses file names commony used in Windows itself, usually placing the file in a different location than it would normally reside on the PC.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that the malware simply attaches itself to the otherwise good file, making a new file that contains both the original file and the additional malware component that is being detected by MSE.&nbsp; Though the original file was fine in&nbsp;this
 case, the new combination contains both good and bad portions, but if done well by the malware continues to function for both purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I mentioned uploading the file to a malware detection service such as VirusTotal, since this uses over 40 different major malware&nbsp;detection engines to verify whether your particular file actually contains malware.&nbsp; This is the manual, on demand
 equivalent of installing and running all of these on your system to check this file, without all the work.&nbsp; You already know what file you suspect, so go check it against all 40+ of these at once to be certain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case none of this has made it clear, file names themselves mean absolutely nothing, because they can be entirely fake.</p>
<p>Rob</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt; EDIT &gt; You also need to note that the OP here indicated that this file was blocked by his firewall and not MSE, which is why he was asking about the file in the first place.&nbsp; SInce a firewall that is configured to prompt when something is attempting to
 reach other networks is making no refernce to whether it's a good or bad file, it's up to the user to determine this themselves or trust their antimalware program as I stated.</p>
<p>In your case it was actually your MSE antimalware that indicated this file was malware, so this is what you should assume until you determine otherwise.&nbsp; However, the general advice to upload the file to VirusTotal still applies if you wish to get a second
 opinion, since it will still verify the file you have with all 40+ antimalware engines.&nbsp; In your case though, we'd expect most of the others to agree that's it's malware, since that's what MSE already told you.</p>

    <title>Persistent Win32&#47;Vobius.CF Infection -- cannot remove - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Persistent Win32&#47;Vobius.CF Infection -- cannot remove</h2>
                    <p>I have a persistent issue with a worm infection (Win32/Vobfus.CF).</p>
<p>It defies all attempts at being removed: indeed, most virus scanners (AVG, ThreatFire, Norton) do not detect it.&nbsp; Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool, however, does -- as does the Microsoft Security Scan.&nbsp; And, occasionally on reboot, it attempts to
 place an invalid .DLL into a directory, which it creates using Admin privileges (C:\Program Files (x86)\BEARSH~2\MEDIABAR\DATAMNGR\X64\ )&nbsp; I have followed the removal suggestions on the Microsoft Encyclopedia Entry carefully, to no avail.&nbsp; Can anyone please
 provide further insight/suggestions -- short of re-installing the operating system (which I a loathe to do)?</p>
<p>This one has got me stumped.&nbsp; Grateful for any assistance you can provide.</p>

Cheers for that, mate. &nbsp;Interesting material, quite helpful.
<div><br />
<div>I've spent the afternoon and evening nutting this problem out, and I think I've now got at least one thing sorted: why the problem seems to resurrect itself, Dracula-like, on reboot -- even when MSE and the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool say
 they were able to partially remove the problem...
<div><br />
<div>(These tools seems to be the *only* ones -- out of about a dozen I've tried -- that detect the Win32/Vobfus.CF worm responsible for the infection...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>In my case, the worm had infected the wireless drivers, AND several of the VAIO programs that get automatically tipped into the System Tray at boot time. &nbsp;The Removal Tool and MSE were detecting an infection in the Wireless Control software, but were unable
 to completely remove it because it was running in background.<br />
<br />
<div>The Wireless Adapter software would re-pollute my system, and resurrect itself Dracula-like, whenever the Wireless network was switched ON. &nbsp;It wouldn't re-pollute when hard-wired to my router, or when operating without a network running. &nbsp;That was my
 first clue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Replacing the Wireless Driver software fixed the problem -- temporarily. &nbsp;However, the problem would return EVERY TIME one of several VAIO background maintenance tools were used -- as they, too, had been corrupted. &nbsp;They would, in turn, re-corrupt the
 Wireless software, and on next re-boot, the problem would recur.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fixing the problem has involved turning OFF the wireless switch, and turning OFF all VAIO maintenance software from running in background, removing the wireless driver &amp; associated software, using the network's HARDWIRE to download fresh copies of all
 the above software, re-installing them (in order), and then re-enabling the wireless switch. &nbsp;Multiple re-boots along the way, with each component of the software being installed...</div>
<div><br />
<div>My system appears to be stable and fast -- for the moment -- and I have not been able to cause the system to become re-infected as before. &nbsp;Perhaps a Stake has been driven into this Dracula's heart? &nbsp;I do indeed hope so.<br />
<br />
I'm running both scanning tools simultaneously now, they appear to be working normally. &nbsp;I'm cautiously optimistic...</div>

<h2>            Major E71 firmware problem</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I did the upgrade this morning v.210, but ran into a serious problem.<br />
After the first attempt there was some error, the updater stated that it is cancelling the update (wait 15 minutes) and that I should try again. During this process the phone rebooted and got stuck at the start-up screen.</p>
<p><br />
The screen now displays the Nokia logo at the bottom, and the words ‚Äúmode‚Äù twice in the middle of the screen and a whole bunch of numbers, ‚ÄúRM345EN074110842.a34‚Ä≥ at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><br />
I am unable to switch the phone off, only able to do this by removing the battery. When I switch it on again after a while, the same screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to hard reset the phone manually?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions/help would be appreciated!</p>
</div>

<p>I had same problem with build&nbsp;9926 and 10041.&nbsp;The solution is to update until it is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Turn off computer and wait 8-10 hours after that it will only happen the first time you open up ie11.</p>

<p>Hi Roy, you're asking in the wrong place, at least with regard to the Nokia 5 performance as a phone. Try the community at:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://community.phones.nokia.com/support/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.phones.nokia.com/support/home</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Microsoft apps on Android, they are better than on Windows Mobile. I've been using them for over 3 years now on different Android handsets. I would stay away from the Microsoft launcher though. It's a personal choice, but it made a real mess of
 my phone setup for the 15 minutes it lasted before I uninstalled it. It could be OK for you, YMMV.</p>

<p>For me, switching from Windows Phone to an Android phone was pretty easy and all of the apps (or comparable apps) looked &amp; felt very similar to the apps I'd used on my Windows Phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were some things I had to figure out, like how to set up the google apps for email calendar and contacts to sync some of my outlook accounts (I don't an @gmail email address but I have several outlook email addresses). I use the outlook app to sync
 to my work email account - it's what my work requires - but I don't like it much for my personal outlook accounts...or at least I didn't at the time (outlook for Android has been improved a great deal since then so maybe my opinion will change about that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I wanted to keep all my pictures in the same place, I had to be sure &amp; install the OneDrive app on the phone and set it up to continue syncing all my photos to OneDrive - by default, my Android phone was set to sync photos to the native Google account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most anything that Windows Phone does natively, an Android phone will do, but instead of automatically using ypur primary Microsoft Account, it will use your Google Account, so you'll need to set up those things to do them with your Microsoft Account by
 installing the appropriate app and setting up the options via the app settings menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, like the Microsoft Account on a Windows Phone, be sure to keep track of what the login and password are for the Google Account you will use to initialize the phone when you first start using it. If you've had a google account all along, then this shouldn't
 take much effort - you will have created it &amp; used it already so you'll already kmow this. But if you are a first time Google account user and someone at the cellphone store sets it up for you, you might not even know what a Google Account is (I have known
 several people who didn't know the login info for their account....when I asked them, their response has been, "I don't use gmail." .Similar to Microsoft and the primary outlook login, there are way more services associated with a Google Account than just
 email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only thing I've really missed from Windows Phone are live tiles, but it didn't take me longvto adjust without them.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word Reading Mode moves objects</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created my resume using word 2013 with some objects in it to help make it stand out.</p>
<p>Part of the objects go off the page. I switch to reading mode and the objects are moved out of their position so the full object is displayed on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i stop this as this ruins the professionalism of my resume?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the objects to stay in their exact positions and do not want the full object displayed, only the part that is displayed on page in editing mode.</p>

            <p>I cannot duplicate your results. You haven't mentioned what kind of objects you are placing, but when I place an autoshape that goes off the side of the page, Read Mode doesn't actually move it. Instead, it displays the entire object, even the part that
 goes off the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're finished with formatting your resume, save it as a PDF and send that out. That's more reliable and professional than sending a Word file.</p>

<h2>            Actionable toast notifications stopped working on Lumia 830</h2>
                    On the first day of the preview this worked for me. But since then its not working. Any way we can help debug.

            Sorry after trying this is working. For text messages only. With face book whatsapp. It's not working even though it has the option to pull down you cant. Is this specifically for text messaging?

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying this out and reporting the issues you are seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this works for text messages and alarms&nbsp;at the moment. Other apps will need to do the necessary integration before similar functionality is available.</p>

            <p>* I rolled back from W10 Technical Preview to WP 8.1.1 via Microsoft Software Recovery Tool.</p>
<p>* Installed all necessary keyboard/speech languages.</p>
<p>* installed Windows Insider app.</p>
<p>* Selected Insider FAST and checked for updates.</p>
<p>* Got a preliminary update 8.10.14219.341. After installing got the real W10 build, installed.</p>
<p>* After installing, Language menu was crashing. Reset the phone.Then installed the necessary apps and updated all apps to latest version.</p>
<p>* Actionable notifications worked for 1st day. From the next day, It works only through `action center' only.</p>
<p>Can't reply to toast notifications. Can't pull it down either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the problems I am facing on my Lumia 830.</p>

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my earlier reply, the only apps that support interactive notifications&nbsp;are messaging and alarms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, lets try to split the issue you may be seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The pull down for notifications when they first arrive: only when you see a chevron (kind of a "v" sign to pull down, and inverted again to push up) does it indicate that the notification can be interacted with.&nbsp;You cannot pull down most notifications
 other than to see the full text&nbsp;that the app wants you to see.&nbsp;Conversely, you can&nbsp;"flick up into the Action Center" if you don't want to interact with the notification at the time it showed up on your screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If the messaging/sms functionality is only working via AC and not via the toasts, then this is a new bug. Thanks for reporting it - I will follow up on this. Please keep a look out for this in the next flight and report again if its still broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Raghu</p>

            <p>Small <strong>correction</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The pull down for notifications when they first arrive: only when you see a chevron (kind of a "v" sign to pull down, and inverted again to push up) does it indicate that the notification can be interacted with
<strong>or expanded to see more lines of text</strong>.&nbsp;You cannot pull down most notifications other than to see the full text&nbsp;that the app wants you to see.&nbsp;Conversely, you can&nbsp;"flick up into the Action Center" if you don't want to interact with the notification
 at the time it showed up on your screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some thoughts on how we can make this more obvious, but would welcome any ideas from our users :).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Delete hyperlinks based on a style - VBA Script doesn&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to run a script across a document that removes hyperlinks.&nbsp;However I only want it to remove hyperlinks from text with a certain style applied.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also want to change the style applied to that text. I thought this would work but it doesn't seem to do anything?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Sub DelHyperlink()</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Dim hl As Hyperlink</div>
<div>For Each hl In ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks</div>
<div>If hl.Range.Style = "H4 Small Blue Hyperlink WT" Then</div>
<div>hl.Range.Style = "H4 Smll WT"</div>
<div>ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks(1).Delete</div>
<div>End If</div>
<div>Next</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas? Many thanks. HJ</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There are several considerations, which actually depend on how your document is formatted:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>The best approach is to apply character styles (that is,&nbsp;"H4 Smll WT" has to be a character style, not a paragraph style) to avoid modification of the surrounding text in the paragraph. If you were, for instance, to apply "Heading&nbsp;1" to a selected hyperlink,
 the whole paragraph would change to Heading&nbsp;1.</li><li>Once the macro selects the complete hyperlink within a paragraph, it looses sight of what the hyperlink's character style is, and instead reports the paragraph style. My previous example worked because the only thing in each paragraph was a hyperlink, and
 you could not tell that the whole paragraph was being modified to the new style. To avoid this, we need to place the cursor
<u>within</u> the hyperlink. Only then should we ask what the style is.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>In the following version:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>For all hyperlinks, select each one</li><li>Instead of asking what its style is as before (which would report the paragraph style), move the cursor back (to deselect) and forth (to enter the hyperlink).</li><li>Now ask what the style is (the style under the cursor, which will report the character style's name, if the is one, or the paragraph style otherwise).</li><li>If the name matches (in this case, I used the default style name "Hyperlink," which is a character style, but you should use your existing character style), do the rest of the steps:</li><li>Select once again the hyperlink</li><li>Apply the proper character style (here, called "Red")</li><li>Delete the hyperlink.</li></ol>
You can do a step-by-step execution with<b> </b><i>Control Command i </i>to follow along. Let me know how it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub ReplaceHyperlinkStyle()</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;For i = ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks.Count To 1 Step -1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks(i).Range.Select</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.MoveLeft UNIT:=wdCharacter, Count:=1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.MoveRight UNIT:=wdCharacter, Count:=1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Selection.Range.Style = "Hyperlink" Then</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks(i).Range.Select</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks(i).Range.Style = "Red"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks(i).Delete</div>

            <p>Hello Deepa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Sage is unable to do anything about this problem as they are saying that the issue is with a change made to the way the Office 2013 stores on the computer( See:
<a href="http://sagecity.na.sage.com/support_communities/sage_50_accounting_ca/b/sage_50_ca_supporthub_blog/archive/2014/02/25/what-should-i-do-if-i-am-unable-to-email-from-sage-50.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click-to-Run Issues</a>&nbsp;, which I already posted a link to above) . &nbsp;This change must have taken place with the release of the 2013 edition as it was not an issue with the previous version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I don't really care whose problem it is and I am getting a little tired of the buck being passed back and forth between Sage and Microsoft. &nbsp; This is an issue that many customers have been experiencing for a year and a half and it is a little
 hard to understand why it has not yet been corrected. &nbsp;I would really like to upgrade the rest of my staff to Office 2013 or 365 but I will not be doing this until this issue has been resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do the right thing for your clients and work with Sage to correct this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody else reads this and has any suggestions, feel free to add them as I am open to any. &nbsp;I have even set up my printing options to Print to PDF so that I can email invoices and statements that way. &nbsp;My biggest issue now is sending out paystubs to
 my employees. &nbsp;Sending them out one at a time in not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your dedicated customer service.</p>

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
Randy wrote at November 24, 2016 a functional procedure to run MAPI sending email invoice in SAGE 50 with Office Home and Business 2013 Click to Run release.<br />
<br />
Randy thank you so much for all your research, I had the same problem as you. I followed you on different forums about this problem.<br />
<br />
The solution is here : <a href="https://community.sagecentralna.com/support_communities/sage_50_accounting_ca/f/150/t/90664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://community.sagecentralna.com/support_communities/sage_50_accounting_ca/f/150/t/90664</a><br />

Just put a String key "MAPI" ="1" here :<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem]<br />
<br />
"MAPI"="1"<br />

<br />my name is Manuel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />Outlook only displays emails within a configured time span.
<br />This article will show you how to increase the time span through the settings "Mail to keep offline":

            Hello Caitlin3!
<br />I am an independent adviser willing to help.
<br />Go to the recycling bin and check if the emails are there, maybe they were deleted and they are still in the deleted folder. If not, visit the following link
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a> US
<br />Where you can see the steps to recover deleted messages.
<br />
<br />Remember that information is automatically deleted when an account goes into an inactivity process after 280 days. For this reason, the messages do not appear in your inbox and may have been completely removed.
<br />If you have another question, I am here to help you.
<br />Greetings.

<h3> dscb57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can only access contacts on SIM card</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a Microsoft Lumia 950 with all the latest Windows updates. The problem I have always had has been accessing my&nbsp;Microsoft and other account's contacts from within WhatsApp. I can only see contacts which were saved to my SIM card, and the only way
 the app will allow me to add a contact is if someone calls or messages me via the app. This is really frustrating.</p>
<p>What I have been doing is add contacts to the People app, which I have tried with several accounts. These contacts do not show up in Whatsapp. I have checked in the phone setting, and Whatsapp is not blocked from access to my contacts. I really fail to understand
 why one cannot simply add a phone number or contact directly within Whatsapp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only way that I am aware of to easily view or save the contents of your device is to connect it to a PC then you can view and download or copy data (pictures or documents&nbsp; for example) to your PC.</p>

</p><p>Dmitry, this is the <strong>first time</strong> you mentioned a Hard Reset&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, because of the way Windows Phone has been designed, after a hard reset there is no way to recover files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option is to hope you had auto upload to OneDrive to save your photos and documents. In the absence of that, you are out of luck.</p>
