<h2>            unable to do mail merge</h2>
                    Tried mail merge with an Excel document and kept getting error message that I was missing fields in the source data. Fields were not missing. Thought the problem was a difference in field names so I made sure they were identical in the source data. Couldn't
 get out of the window that asked me to replace the field name. And then got message that an error was encountered and the merge could not occur. I thought the problem might be with using formatting from last year's document (older version of Word). So I started
 from the beginning in the mail merge process and got the same result. I had 500 nametags to create so I gave up and used my old computer to do the mail merge (no problem). I had mail merge problems in February but after a software update, I was able to successfully
 mail merge. Am also having strange problems with Microsoft Outlook so I'm wondering whether it's a software update I'm missing.<br />

            If you are concerned about your Office software being up-to-date, from any Office app go to Help &gt; Check for Updates. After applying any updates go to your Applications/Utilities directory and run Apple's Disk Utility.app. Use it to Repair Permissions
 on your Macintosh HD drive. Finish the process by rebooting your machine.

<h2>            Daylight savings time change and past appointments&#33;  HTC Imagio&#8482;</h2>
                    I've noticed that after the daylight savings time change all of my past appointments (6 months) on my device are off by one hour.&nbsp; My exchange server remained correct, only the device (HTC Imagio) changed the times.&nbsp; I called HTC support and they told
 me that it seems to be a Windows problem to the device but with no fix yet.&nbsp; Does anyone have the same problem?&nbsp; I was the first for the tech department at HTC.

 1 hour.&nbsp; My PC calendar was fine ... it was the Imagio that was off. It was NOT consistent which is perplexing.&nbsp; Some of my reoccuring appointments were off and others were fine. Most of my "regular" appointments were fine but a few were off by an hour.<br />
<br />
I'll have to look into this a little more.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've only did this for 20 rows to demonstrate the method so you will need to increase the range to match your requirements.&nbsp; These are ARRAY formula, see below on how to enter them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This returns the smallest number excluding zero. You would change to last 1 to a 2 for the second smallest and to a 3 for the third</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SMALL(IF(A1:A20&lt;&gt;0,A1:A20),1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An likewise for the largest, once again changing the last 1 to a 2 and 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=LARGE(IF(A1:A20&lt;&gt;0,A1:A20),1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an array formula which must be entered by pressing CTRL+Shift+Enter<br />
and not just Enter. If you do it correctly then Excel will put curly brackets<br />
around the formula {}. You can't type these yourself. If you edit the formula<br />
you must enter it again with CTRL+Shift+Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Recommended routine maintenance for Outlook &#47; IMAP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sysadmin_ed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recommended routine maintenance for Outlook &#47; IMAP</h2>
                    I have a customer scenario that involves two desktops running Outlook.&nbsp; One is Outlook 2007 and the other is Outlook 2010.<br />
<br />
The Outlook 2007 instance has 1 POP3 account with the local ISP, plus 5 IMAP accounts with many synchronized/shared folders (GoDaddy host).&nbsp; I have it set to download complete emails rather than just the headers for most of the synchronized folders.<br />
<br />
The Outlook 2010 instance has 4 IMAP accounts (shared with the instance above) with the same properties as above.<br />
<br />
Both instances experience occasional freezes while communicating with the IMAP host, which recover eventually.&nbsp; Sometimes there are errors during send/receive.<br />
<br />
I ran the inbox repair tool (scanpst) on all accounts and noted that there were hundreds of errors.&nbsp; It was quite frightening, but the inbox repair tool was successful in repairing the errors.&nbsp; They have never reported to me that they have lost any email.<br />
<br />
After the repair was run, I waited a few weeks and ran it again, and more errors were reported and fixed.<br />
<br />
This leads me to these questions:<br />
<br />
1) What could be causing these errors as reported by the inbox repair tool?&nbsp; <br />
2) What routine maintenance is recommended for Outlook clients that use IMAP accounts?&nbsp; I'm sure that lack of routine maintenance being applied is causing some of this, but I'm unsure of what the correct procedures are for IMAP clients.<br />
3) Can the clients be connected to the IMAP host while any maintenances are being run, or should it be run offline?<br />
<br />
I'm more than a little concerned here.&nbsp; If anyone could provide information (links would be great) I'd appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <div>There could be multiple reasons for PST file corruption but cannot pin point on the actual cause.
<div>Some common reasons could be:</div>
<div>Corrupted file system.</div>
<div>Incompatible add-ins.</div>
<div>Virus.</div>
<div>Outlook termination abnormally.</div>
<div>Hard drive issues etc. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may compact the PST file but it might cause the deletion of the email or data hence take a backup of the PST file and then try to compact the PST file.</div>
<div>Regarding the maintenance you may scan your PST file or also run the check disk on your hard drive.</div>

    <title>Outlook for Mac crashes during IMAP sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billscottetv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac crashes during IMAP sync</h2>
                    I'm using the latest version of Outlook 2011 for Mac 14.3.8 on a new Macbook Pro (Mavericks), but Outlook crashes, requiring a force close each time as it finishes the sync.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm syncing with Googlemail via IMAP and have about 40,000 emails in my Google account. This worked fine on a PC, using Google Apps Sync, which isn't available on a Mac.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All 40,000 emails seemed to synch OK, and the sync appears to finish or almost finish (just 20 or so left sometimes), but then Outlook just crashes (multi-coloured pinwheel of death) requiring a forced close. When you run it again, it tries to synch again
 and then crashes again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a limit to the number of emails you can sync through IMAP? Or is this another problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks &amp; regards</div>

<div>I suppose it is likely to be one that is not currently in Outlook, so it might be possible to do some sort of comparison between the server and the local mail file, though I don't know how to do

Thanks. I'm afraid I probably don't have the patience for that, so I'm looking into alternatives to Outlook, though my last attempt will be to delete the account and add it again, just in case that works.

Thanks for your response. That is worth a try, though it will take some time to do. I don't really understand why there's no Google Apps Sync for the Mac - that worked really well and allowed you to limit the size of your mailbox, so you got the last "n" megabytes
 worth of emails.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, surely the ability to sync with popular email systems (and calendars) should be part of Outlook, shouldn't it? I know Microsoft would like us all to use Office 365, but the reality is that not everyone is going to do that and Outlook should be
 more interoperable. There doesn't seem to be any elegant way to use the Outlook Calendar with Google Apps on the Mac, even if I didn't have this problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, Outlook should handle the problem I'm having without crashing...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            'Should' and 'expected' are words often used with&nbsp;Outlook for Mac.&nbsp;Outlook has been a big disappointment to switchers that are used to the mature&nbsp;Outlook for Windows.&nbsp;Outlook 2011 is a version 1 product and is not fully featured or stable. We hope that
 the next version of Office hopefully due out next year will be an improvement.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Until Microsoft adds CalDAV and CardDAV support to Outlook, there is no way to sync other than get an Exchange account. It's $4/month
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/microsoft-exchange-online-email-for-business-FX103739072.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Online</a>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list.</div>

                    This problem only occurs with internet explorer 8 when using windows 7 and flash player 10. Previous flash player 9 works with out&nbsp;any problems the steps that i have taken is to go back to flash player 9.? . The strange thing is google crome works with
 flash player 10 on this&nbsp;PC Internet&nbsp;Explorer seems to be the&nbsp;only browser with this problem im complaining because the&nbsp;adobe updater askes to update to the latest version at&nbsp;the most inconvienient times. Without thinking and to get rid of the stupid box i
 choose yes. And im back to square one is there a work around for this. You can emagine how anoying this is that when i go to a webpage that has adverts using the flash player ( almost all of them do)&nbsp;the screen flashes white its kind of like getting interference

            You have to bear in mind that Windows 7 RC, as fantastic as it is, is still a beta version.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 RC build 7100, IE8, and Adobe Flash player v.10 and all is working perfectly.&nbsp; I would imgine that something didn't go right when you were
 getting the update of Adobe.&nbsp; You can go to the Control Panel and uninstall the Flash player.&nbsp; Then go back to
<a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.adobe.com</a> and try downloading Flash again.&nbsp; Make sure that you only have IE running when you reinstall Flash.&nbsp; Once it is installed close and reopen IE.&nbsp; I would also reset IE's settings back to defaults just in case.&nbsp;
 Let us know if this helps.

            Since this fix is intended for a vulnerability that could be exploited through "attacks on OLE automation", I recommend you uninstall Activesync and reboot your PC. Install the update and re-install Activesync. Let me know if this helps.

<p>When using outlook 2010 it is very annoying that every single time i use the save as button i have to rebrowse to the desired file path. Often times i need to save multiple pieces of mail to the same location and even if I save them one right after the other
 it defaults back to my documents every single time I use save as. Is there a way to make it so that it defaults back to the last used file path location?</p>

            Thank you. So i understand that this changes the default directory so that instead of defaulting to my documents it will default to the filepath of my choosing, but is there a way to make it default back to the last path used? The problem is I save many
 emails a day and i may save 4 or 5 to one location, and then 5 to another location and so on. Just changing the default doesn't solve my problem. I realize the first time i&nbsp;save for each set of 5 i would have to browse there, but after that i want it to default
 to that location until i browse to a different save location, and then default to that location. Is there a way to do this?

            I think that would require you to create a macro and run that each time you want to save, instead of using the built-in option. But I'm not very good at Outlook VBA, hopefully someone else will have a suggestion.

            As an end user I can tell you that what the original poster wants is completely possible without
<br />
macros , VBA, or registry changes.<br />
<br />
I have two Win7 with Office 2010 installations. One opens the last used save-as path<br />
the other always defaults to Documents Library. <br />
I built both so know they are identical.<br />
<br />
After I figure it out will post back here with the solution.<br />
It is most likely a setting in the options area and advanced.<br />
<br />
We need more experienced end users to respond. They seem to be the only ones that know how to use the products. And understand the questions :)&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Word on iPad crashing on one file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word on iPad crashing on one file</h2>
                    <p>word has started freezing on a particular file. It will open and scroll, but tapping the screen to edit is when it freezes. Other files are okay. PowerPoint works. &nbsp;It freezes when opening through one-drive or dropbox, as recent versions of the file are
 saved in both places. The file is about 65 pages, mostly text. Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply in PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the files you shared with me. And I can open and edit them normally. Here are my steps:</p>
<p>1. Upload your files in OneDrive.</p>
<p>2. Use OneDrive on iPad to open these files.</p>
<p>3. Click Word icon to open them in Word.</p>
<p>4. Click file to edit them.</p>
<p>5. Click arrow on the top-left to close it.</p>
<p>6. Reopen them and I can see the content that I added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my test environment: iOS: 11.2. Word: 2.8. OneDrive 9.9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I test on my iPhone (iOS: 11.2.2, Word: 2.9. OneDrive 9.9.), I encounter this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I create a new blank Word file and copy all content in your files and I can edit them normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may some issue when you edit that files via Word 2.9. I'd like to suggest you created new blank file and then&nbsp;copy all contents from your previous files again to see the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please have a try and share with me your result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>
<p>

    <title>Problems with AVERAGEIF function - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with AVERAGEIF function</h2>
                    <p>It's in the wee hours of the morning where I am so I'll start by saying, "Good morning!" (to anyone who happens to be awake. I am stuck on the syntax of this function:&nbsp;=AVERAGEIF('Aug-1:Aug-22'!H6,"&lt;&gt;0"). I have also tried:=AVERAGEIF('Aug-1:Aug-22'!H6,"&gt;0").
 I am trying to keep a running average of cell H6 of each sheet ignoring zero values because I only have data entered into sheets Aug-1 through Aug-12 so far. At this point I am getting a return of #VALUE! using either function.</p>
<p>Any help or info anyone could give me on my syntax or even a better way of getting the correct value would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help or info provided,</p>

            <p>Thanks HansV for the reply but for some reason that formla is still including the zeros in sheets Aug-13 through Aug-22 and dividing the result by 22. Using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=AVERAGE('Aug-1:Aug-22'!H6)
 I am getting an average of 1446 but if I use&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=AVERAGE('Aug-1:Aug-12'!H6) I am getting 2651 which would be the correct average not including the data from cell H6 in sheets Aug-13
 through Aug-22 which for now is zero. I apologize if I did not make it clear in my first question that all sheets Aug-1 through Aug-22 have already been created and I am trying to keep a running average of H6 in each sheet as the data is entered each day.
 I really thank you for helping me tackle this and again I apologize if my original question was not clear in what I am trying to do.</span></p>

            <p>So the 'unused' dates contain zero values, not blanks. That makes it more complicated, since none of the COUNTIF, SUMIF etc. group of functions work across multiple sheets, and a "3D" reference such as 'Aug-1:Aug-22'!H6 is not valid when used by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible solution:</p>
<p>- In another cell on each worksheet, say H66, enter the formula =--(H6&gt;0)</p>
<p>- This formula returns 1 if H6&gt;0, and 0 if H6=0.</p>
<p>- You can now use the formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUM('Aug-1:Aug-12'!H6)/SUM('Aug-1:Aug-12'!H66)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is to create a custom AVERAGEIF3D function in VBA, but that would probably be slow.</p>

            <p>You must have done something wrong. I tried it out myself and it works correctly. I entered 24 in H6 on Aug-1 through Aug-12, and 0 in H6 on Aug-13 through Aug-22.</p>

            <p>Alright. I'm a doofus. Lol</p>
<p>HansV, your last solution worked perfectly. While going back and troubleshooting I found that I had entered the function THREE TIMES!! No wonder I received a FALSE average. After deleting the extra two functions that I so brilliantly entered into the cell,
 I am now getting the correct average. HansV, your'e awesome!</p>

</p><p>No guarantees this will work for you, but it resolved my issues opening attachments from Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This guidance comes from the following Microsoft support post - </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-Outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fixes-or-workarounds-for-recent-issues-on-Outlook-com-8c95d913-d96b-4065-9171-e1fa44b03ff5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I was using a&nbsp;Microsoft account that doesn't end in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, or @live.com, so I used this information to create an outlook.com alias and made it my primary. I still receive email to my original Microsoft account (just have
 to be careful when responding that I choose the right "From" address) and can now View and Download all attachments.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and report back if this works for you - </p>
<p>
</p><p>"We couldn't open the image file" error when you open a picture attachment sent to your Outlook email address
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>This error could occur if you have a non-Microsoft email address as the primary email address on your account.</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, set your Microsoft email address as the primary email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sign in to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=71369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Your info</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Manage your sign-in email or phone number</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>Make primary</strong> next to the alias you want as your primary. The alias has to be a Microsoft email address, such as an email account that ends @outlook.com or @hotmail.com or @live.com.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to sign out of your Microsoft account, then sign back in using the new @outlook.com alias (the password should be the same as for your MS account)...then check your Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            O365 calendar Free&#47;Busy cannot view in Outlook 2011&#47;2016 for MAC</h2>
                    
<p>Domain environment: Office 365 for Business , No domain controller or additional services. - standalone</p>
<p>By default, calendar permissions domain-wide are set to Full Details, so everyone can view full details calendars with no restrictions.</p>
<p>Few users, however, need more privacy and they setup them calendar permissions to Free/Busy only by default...</p>
<p>Then add explicitly the users who &nbsp;should be allowed &nbsp;to let see full details - all setup from end-user mail client Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>The explicitly added users with<strong> full access permissions don't not have any issue</strong>&nbsp;when viewing those calendars, however the rest of the company users
<strong>cannot see any free/busy information &nbsp;on Office for MAC 2016 and 2011 clients ONLY</strong>! - confirmed :no error messages or permissions issue</p>
<p>If the same calendar is accessed by Outlook 2010 / 2013 for Windows or OWA, all free/busy information is properly displayed.</p>
<p>If someone has similar experience, I would be very glad to hear how it has been resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, If someone could &nbsp;give me advice which Microsoft team should I contact to assist me I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>hi anton,</p>
<p>i did some tests on my side on my outlook for mac 2016 v15.13 and outlook 2011. after getting the reviewer/full&nbsp;details&nbsp;permission of the shared calendar, we can see the subject and room information of the calendar items and click to view the details as
 shown below.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48944d6f-539a-443c-9450-874e667ed244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48944d6f-539a-443c-9450-874e667ed244" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for your issue, i would like to know more details to better understand your situation:</p>
<p>1.the detailed version of your outlook for mac 2016 and 2011.<br />

<p>hi anton,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates with the detailed screenshots. based on your steps, i performed some further tests on my side. and i got the same results with you, as shown below.</p>
<p>1.user2 got reviewer (full details) permission from user1 and got availabilityonly (free/busy) permission from alex.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da18319b-0c13-40ad-8d10-d713d8fef99c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da18319b-0c13-40ad-8d10-d713d8fef99c" /></a></p>
<p><br />
2.user2 can see the details of user1’s calendar events and free/busy information of alex’s in outlook and outlook web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3a44ee3-0845-489a-9d33-8b2f1366c722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3a44ee3-0845-489a-9d33-8b2f1366c722" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22dd380b-9f36-4b71-afde-b6d44ecc61bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22dd380b-9f36-4b71-afde-b6d44ecc61bc" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.in outlook for mac 2011 and 2016, user2 can open user1’s calendar and view the details. however, he cannot find the free/busy information on alex’s calendar.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4da0f9d-a957-43f5-973f-d4c7e8900b1c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4da0f9d-a957-43f5-973f-d4c7e8900b1c" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a129961-9443-402c-a368-5f39fb1bba93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a129961-9443-402c-a368-5f39fb1bba93" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>from our tests, the free/busy information cannot be displayed with availabilityonly (free/busy) permission in outlook for mac.</p>
<p>considering the right permissions work fine in outlook and outlook web app, the permission setting and online services are working correctly. this should be related to the outlook for mac application problem. since our forum mainly focuses on office 365

<p>I've been trying for some time to figure out how to use the secondary axis option in excel 2016 for mac but haven't had any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;When I right click on the data series, and go to format data series then proceed to the series options, it shows the secondary axis option greyed out and I can't click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had any luck using secondary axes with Excel 2016 in an XY scatter plot? &nbsp;If so, please help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If your chart has two or more data series, only then you will have the option to select one of the data series and use Format Data Series to plot the selected data series on a Secondary axis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your chart has only one data series, the secondary axis option is disabled.</p>

<h2>            How to disable &#34;Caps Lock&#34; key </h2>
                    
<p>I cannot train my left hand to hunt down for the "Shift" key and mis-hit the "Caps Lock" key frequently (1 time out of 5 attempts at "Shift"). I cannot ever remember having a use for the "Caps Lock"&nbsp;key. Short of prying the button from the keyboard, is there
 any way of disabling the key during a Word editing session?</p>

            Hi jjk98,<br />
<br />
There's&nbsp;a really good explanation on the How-to Geek website:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disable-caps-lock-key-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disable-caps-lock-key-in-windows-vista/</span></a>&nbsp; *<br />
<br />
* Not only Vista, but Windows 7 also.<br />
<br />
It looks a bit daunting but if you scroll down past the geek stuff you'll find a&nbsp;<strong>Download Keyboard Mappings Registry Tweaks</strong> link half way down the page; the download includes&nbsp;a "Disables Caps Lock" file.<br />
<br />
Personally, I get scared at any thought of tampering with the Registry but the posts at the bottom of the How-to page are very congratulatory to the contributor.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!<br />

<h2>            office 2016 free trial</h2>
                    Hi I purchased an Acer&nbsp;laptop just after xmas and discovered it did not come with an office package. I downloaded my old office&nbsp;package Microsoft works and&nbsp;it worked fine with windows 10. I recently took a free trial of office 2016. This has expired and
 I am now unable to edit any word documents that were on my laptop. In addition if I download any new word documents I cannot edit these either, can anyone suggest a fix for this issue, other than purchase word 2016 which I will do but not for another couple
 of months. &nbsp;

</p><p>it's very significant for me, because if they open the email and see just a link inside it, they will not use it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sways can be embedded anywhere you can add an iframe.&nbsp; You can get the embed code from Sway by opening your Sway and clicking on the Share menu.&nbsp; With that said, many email clients don't support showing embedded iframes due to security restrictions so I'm

            Hi Andrew:
<div><br />
<div>As Bob says, you can have a caption any size you like (If there is a limit it is about 64 thousand characters).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course, the dialog won't show them all to you. &nbsp;But you do not need the dialog to complete a caption. &nbsp;You can simply OK it without typing anything, then insert as much text as you like in the caption paragraph that appears.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should never insert citations in captions, otherwise they will be duplicated into your cross-references and give you a messy looking document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            sync problems - treo700w to outlook 2007 on vista</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to sync my treo 700w (running windows mobile 5.0) to outlook 2007 running on vista (lenovo laptop) using WMDC 6.1.&nbsp; i set this up a couple of months back, and it worked with no problem - partnership was established, syncing worked.&nbsp; i recently
 tried to sync, however, and now i cannot get the pc to recognize/sync with the device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i apply recommended windows updates, so, unfortunately,&nbsp;i cannot say for certain what/if something has changed recently. however, the only changes&nbsp;applied would be those the windows updates&nbsp;which were highly recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in trying to fix the issue, i have already deleted the partnership (and tried to re-establish it -no luck, as it does not seem to recognize the device).&nbsp; i have also uninstalled wmdc and have reinstalled (numerous times) - no luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if i remember,
 when i first loaded wmdc and it had initially worked, vista recognized the device as a smartphone.&nbsp; now, when i reinstalled wmdc and plugged in the device,&nbsp; the driver that was loaded was for 'unidentified device' (or something along those lines).&nbsp; other info
 that might be helpful - when i plug in the device, it is recognized in device manager&nbsp;as 'microsoft windows mobile remote adapter #2'.&nbsp; i have also shut off my firewall to see if that would have any impact and it does not seem to make a difference.&nbsp; i have
 also checked that the services listed in one of hte faq docs are running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i uninstall wmdc, plug in the phone, and reinstall, i do not get anything that indicates that it recognizes the device as a phone.&nbsp; the only driver installed is for the remote adapter.&nbsp; wmdc does not start by itself as i believe it is supposed
 to when being installed.&nbsp; is this some type of driver issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help please - i am lost without being able to get the phone to sync!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any suggestions on what to try/look at in order to be able to sync my phone?</p>

<p>WOW - i am feeling REALLY dumb right now.&nbsp; i think i found what at least part of my problem was.&nbsp; (will start a new thread if i have problems again)&nbsp; i played around with a number of the settings on the PHONE when
 i started having problems to see what impact the different settings would have and see if that would help address my connection problem.&nbsp; one of those settings on the phone was in 'activesync--&gt;menu --&gt;connections...--&gt;sync using... i had unchecked this box
 - and never went back and checked it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just looking at the phone settings again and saw this - as soon as i checked this to allow USB connections, the sync process started as i had previously expected it would have.&nbsp; So, while there was a problem which
 caused me to start playing around with this in the first place, the problem looks like it was resolved by either reinstalling wmdc or the device driver - the last part looks like it was user error!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry for mentioning the b-word (blackberry) in a previous post!</p>

</p><p>Hi Aleksandrs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding the issue on the Wi-fi connection that cuts off when the phone screen locks, we recommend running the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT) on your phone to fix this issue. You can download WDRT at this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Similar to a factory reset, using WDRT would delete everything on your phone, so please create a back up of all of your files again before running WDRT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if Wi-fi still drops after using WDRT.</p>

            StrSQL is a rather lengthy SELECT statement.&nbsp; It works with DAO but not ADODB.&nbsp; Over the years I have tried using examples and writing the code myself according to the reference.&nbsp; It just never works.&nbsp; I have tried to use ADODB for the last 15 years and
 have never been able to get it to work.&nbsp; I have tried it with an Access backend, SQL Server backend and an Oracle backend.&nbsp; I always get errors and no results.&nbsp; I have never found any solution to the errors.&nbsp; I'll finish this db using other tools and in a
 couple of months I'll build another db and try it again and probably have the same result.

                    &nbsp;
<p class="contentStandard">So, last night I hooked my phone up with the latest software update. When it finished in the morning, everything seemed perfectly fine, the apps were running quicker, some of them were better BUT when I tried to open up Microsoft
 Edge and Bing, they wouldn't work!<br />
&nbsp;I supposed that this had something to do with my Settings, so I tried to go ahead and change them. Surprisingly, they were nowhere to be found, either on the Start Screen as a tile or in the menu.
<br />
&nbsp; Concluding, I would need some advice on the Settings matter, as well as the Edge and Bing one.<br />
&nbsp; I have a Lumia 535 with the latest update of Windows 10, so if anyone knows how to fix that, please reply as soon as possible!</p>

            I had the same issues when I upgraded my 950XL. The only solution I found was to do a hard reset. It was something I shouldn't have to do, but it fixed the issues.

<h2>            Cannot uninstall eShield Browser Security</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 I&nbsp;have a nasty infection of eShield Browser security. Defender fixed the behavior but it still exists on my apps list.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also ran Should I remove it and it also reported the file was removed, but it still remains on my app list.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to get rid of it?</p>
