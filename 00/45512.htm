<h2>            poor battery life Thunkpad W520, Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ThinkPad W520 with NVidia optimus, switches between the integrated Intel and the discrete NVidia 1000M, Intel core i7-2727QM, 8 GB Ram, mSata SSD and normal hard drive&nbsp;and under Windows 7 around 6 hours of battery life. Even with windows 8 RP, the
 battery life was only slightly worse. But now, I get a maximum of 2 hours using the final version of Windows 8 Pro with the newest Lenovo drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the problem and how can I improve battery life which was supposed to be better with Windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

Thanks Sharif for your answer. I have actually looked at the upper link before and the second is how I try to treat my battery, but it is a good read.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the poor battery life started with the final version of Windows 8. The release preview had still good battery life. It seems that there are a lot of processes within the new start menu, I actually don't know how to call this interface since
 it is not metro anymore, that need the discrete graphics card. To switch to the integrated card, I need to find those, which much more difficult than with classic programs, e.g. the Metro style control panel, power settings. Since they don't close when you
 change to a different app, the discrete graphics card is always on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do besides turning the discrete graphics card off, which would be not what I really wanted?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Friends<br />
<br />
<br />
I am SARAVANA KUMAR from India.I am glad to inform you that i doing a<br />
research on operating System since 5 years for my studies and<br />
improvements of my carrier.My current qulaification is BE CSE Fresher<br />
in Adhiyamaan College Of Engineering,Hosur.<br />
<br />
About my system Configuration:<br />
<br />
I would say it is 100% compatible with windows 8 because the<br />
configuration of my system is<br />
<br />
Intel core i5 ,3rd generation<br />
Intel HM77 Express motherboard<br />
<br />
Got with windows 8 and its drivers.<br />
<br />
Problems i have faced in my windows 8 operating system:<br />
<br />
My System Condition:<br />
<br />
Fully Updated and Properly installed the genuine software's.I am not<br />
using any antivirus except Windows defender and Windows firewall as<br />
you insist.<br />
<br />
1)Windows Shutting Down Issue:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not shutting down properly after the 5 days of usage.<br />
Even &nbsp;i have enabled/disabled the fast start up(recommended option).<br />
<br />
2)Short battery backup :<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In windows 7 I have installed more than 200 small and big<br />
software's.I used to put my battery profile in balanced mode.(I got<br />
about 5hr of battery backup during light usage)<br />
But where as in &nbsp;windows 8 i have &nbsp;installed only few software's .But<br />
in contrast i am getting very short battery backup (I got only 2hr in<br />
power saver mode).<br />
<br />
3)My System Freezes too much after the windows 8 Update:<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestion:<br />
<br />
Windows 8 is concentrating more on the speed .I really appreciate what<br />
you have done for startup and shutdown process .It is very faster than<br />
its predecessors.<br />
<br />
But the windows 8 default apps like,music ,video ,etc are opening very<br />
slower than the other normal desktop application like vlc media<br />
player,windows media player.(I know some files are related to internet<br />
connectivity but the music,video apps also taking more time to open<br />
while comparing with normal desktop application.<br />
<br />
I hope really you will do care for customers feedback.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards<br />

    <title>Windows Automatic Update Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay cumming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Automatic Update Service</h2>
                    <p>I have several questions, all of varying gravity but first I need to give the setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer does not like updating windows. It never has. For a while, updates were fine, then around the Creators update it all went belly-up. Every time I tried to update, I'd be left with a black screen of death. Turns out this was due to outdated drivers
 for my video card. Ok, I updated those and things went ok for a while until around November of last year. Since then, every single update leaves me with that black screen no matter what. Because of forced updates and the fact I can't sit at my PC telling windows
 to **** off every time it tries to push it with a little countdown timer, I had to remove the automatic update service forcibly and until a few days ago everything was running fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND THEN<br />
<br />
For whatever reason the automatic update service&nbsp;<strong><em>RE-INSTALLED ITSELF </em>
</strong>and caused my machine to brick for a few hours while I tried to fix it. I lost a lot of work due to that because it forces everything to shut down without saving and it also clears the memory causing headaches galore. Imagine my shock when I discover
 a new icon on my desktop that I didn't install, was placed there against my will and I don't want anywhere near my machine but it won't go away. Lovely little thing it is, the Windows Automatic Update "Service". Like a virus, no matter how hard I try to get
 rid of it, it keeps coming back. At this point I'm considering getting a pirated version of windows so I can avoid these pointless updates that I don't want or need. No, I'm not afraid of the oh so spooky meltdown hacks. I'm more afraid of a massive chunk
 of my memory being blocked off from me by Windows because it wants to push an update that my machine doesn't want and will just brick the machine half-way through. You think I like coming home to seeing my computer frozen in the middle of an update, and thinking
 to myself "well goddamnit now I have to install the old version of windows again"? No. It's not fun and there's no reason why I've had to do it every day this week EVEN AFTER I've uninstalled and disabled any and all windows update-related programs on my machine.
 This is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
So here's my questions; FIRST:<br />
Why is the automatic update enabling itself against my will, installing a program designed to push those updates further and then bricking my machine when I&nbsp;have made it abundantly clear that I do not want this to occur? I don't need the security "updates",
 so why is Windows shilling it so hard as to forcibly enable software that I, the user, have disabled or uninstalled? What tertiary program or function is forcing this to be re-enabled?<br />
SECOND:<br />
How to I stop this from ever happening again, so I can avoid this in the future? I don't want the "security updates" (windows moving the kernel) because functionally I'm not at any real risk and this machine I'm using isn't going to be in use as anything other
 than a server by the end of the year.I'm not worried about spooky scary hackers, I'm worried about my monitors going black and never working again because windows pushed an update that made my machine&nbsp;<em>literally
</em>unusable.<br />
<br />
I don't like other OS's because they're simply not as good for what I do. OSX machines are expensive as sin and linux just doesn't have the compatibility or function I need so I honestly want to fix this problem without having to re-install literally every
 program on my computer.</p>

            Hi Jay.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />There's a lot of turmoil in Windows Updates right now.   So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give them a few weeks to sort it out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates using these methods:   <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />You can set a Metered Connection or turn off Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here:

            ****. I just woke up this morning to&nbsp;<strong><em>SEE IT RE-ENABLING ITSELF BEFORE MY EYES.</em></strong><br />
<br />
I want to permanently remove this function. I don't care what hacks I need to use, I don't care if I have to pirate windows, I need to remove this from my machine and going through windows clearly isn't working.

<h2>            Maximum character length in gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>Me and my friends are making a clan and we are trying to get more members. We think of all these names and they are 16 characters long. Microsoft says the length of a GT has to be at the most of 15 characters long. Me and my friends think that they should
 make the GT length to 16 characters long, and I know for a fact a lot of people out there will agree with me on this. Every other thing I know that you have to make a user name for is 16 characters max, except for XBL. Guys, don't you agree that the max length
 of a GT should be 16 characters, I mean, c'mon, it is hard for me and my clan to expand in members if we can't even think of decent GT's to fit the 15 character limit. I love XBL and I have fun playing it, but Microsoft...please change the maximum character
 length of a GT to 16, I am pretty sure I am speaking for A LOT of people when I post this....please just change it to 16 characters it would make a lot of people soo happy, and I hope you guys read this. Thank you.</p>

                    <p>I got this new laptop yesterday, a HP zbook studio G5, I can't use it with my headphones because of some very annoying high pitched noise coming through them only when I plug them in the laptop. I think it might have to do with my audio drivers, but I can't
 seem to change them. I've installed ASIO4all and realtek audio drivers but they just don't show up in my device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 ISSUES with AM3&#43; motherboards and processor FX8350</h2>
                    HI<br />
<br />
Recently i bought the motherboard from MSI model 990FXA-GD65, on it&nbsp; i have the&nbsp; 8-core AMD FX8350 CPU with corsair vengeance 16GB ram 1866mhz and dual crosfired Saphire AMD 7770 GHZ edition OC.<br />
<br />
but&nbsp;&nbsp; as i instal the Windows 7 OS&nbsp; the problems start already by obtaining and installing Updates. Describing the problem, is&nbsp; like it does stuck on certain&nbsp; updates and does not procede to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp; i already&nbsp; reinstaled, formated, defragmented, checked
 the system hardware and&nbsp; software&nbsp; on&nbsp; 3 computers with not that&nbsp;&nbsp; high specifications and&nbsp;&nbsp; it went out without errors only then i put all together on&nbsp; this&nbsp; spec it<br />
&nbsp;in windows logged on&nbsp; the system crashes (explorer.exe), gives me&nbsp; blue screen with, till now 3 differend errors&nbsp; then in game also crash, high load and speed play occours&nbsp; and as i tested im&nbsp; deffinately sure its&nbsp; not&nbsp; related to any hardware component fault&nbsp;
 and its sadly related to the OS.<br />
<br />
is there an fix&nbsp; or&nbsp; do i have to live with this&nbsp; that my&nbsp; work i make&nbsp; goes lost&nbsp; for no reason by getting&nbsp; blue screened or whatsoewer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff happends on it<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
is it possible&nbsp; that&nbsp; if i get the new OS the same issues &nbsp; apply&nbsp; -&nbsp; or will it&nbsp; be &nbsp; that the&nbsp; errors get fixed.<br />
<br />
i build the PC for&nbsp; extreme gaming end multitasking on high level<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            It is not the microphone the issue it is the headphones ....<br />
<br />
Since the upgrade, the headphones device do not show up anymore, even if I show the<br />
disconnected devices.<br />
<br />
Realtek recognises the headphones being plugged in, turn of my internal speaker<br />
but no sounds come out of my headphones.<br />
If I test the speaker device while my headphones are plugged in, I can see the frequency increase but still no sound.<br />
<br />
I have tried to update to the latest drivers.

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you have tried updating the driver. However if you have not tried uninstalling and re-installing latest driver from the computer manufacturer website, try the same and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>To uninstall the&nbsp;audio driver follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on <strong>Start</strong> and type

</span></strong>and select <strong><span>â€˜uninstallâ€™</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Follow the prompt and <strong><span>restart</span></strong> the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Now re-install latest audio driver from the computer manufacturer website.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows&nbsp;10 drivers are not available, I would suggest you to install driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To install the </span></strong><strong><span>audio

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. <strong>Download </strong>the latest </span><span>audio driver&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">from the manufacturerâ€™s website and save it on your local disk.
<br />
b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select â€œ<strong>Properties</strong>â€.<br />
c. Select â€œ<strong>Compatibility</strong>â€ Tab. <br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to â€œ<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>â€ and
<strong>select latest Windows version</strong>&nbsp;from the drop down list. <br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

            I performed the uninstall reinstall for the&nbsp;<strong><span>High Definition Audio Device drivers.<br />
</span></strong><span>I also unistalled the realtek audio drivers.<br />
<br />
While the realtek audio drivers unistalled, in the playback devices, I see the headphones<br />

<br />
When I plug my headphones in, the device used switches from my the speakers to the headphones.<br />

</div>
<div>I am facing a problem right now. Whenever I update my Window 8's window update, it shows me I have 22 important updates to install. But when I click install update it will display the screen downloading update and the problem is that it will display 0%
 even after an hour. It is unable to download the window updates. Please help, I have even tried reformatting my computer and it is still the same. Thanks</div>
                </div>

</span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>You can also install the updates (KB number) manually by downloading from Microsoft download center.</span></p>

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> I <span>suggest that you temporary disable the anti-virus and firewall and check the result again.
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are using Win XP Home switchinh to Win XP Pro (SP2/SP3) might help.</p>
<p>Howeve,r given the nature of this product I would expect that the vendor has probably more knowledge of its working.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play wmv with WMC or Xbox video</h2>
                    <p>I have videos that were converted to wmv and wma 9 or 10, can't remember which, to retain the 5 channel Dolby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will not play with WMP or Xbox video player. Xbox player throws a c00d11cd error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is Windows Media Video file.&nbsp; Why won't it play on a Windows 8 machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is up with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They all play just fine on the Xbox. I converted them so there is no DRM</p>
<p>My Win7&nbsp;WMP plays them. It is my Media center PC. </p>
<p>Compared the audio codecs between the two and they apper to be the same.</p>
<p>The win7 PC has a MPEG/DVD filter that is not on the Win 8 laptop, a ffdshow Audio Decoder and Video.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMP 12 in Win 8 is missing some codecs if Media center isn't activated...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some other people have still had problems with some .wmv files even after activating Media Center, but most will play...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem may be the Dolby... WMP 12 will not play DVD's primarily due to DOLBY licensing issues, although Media Center Will play them...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power DVD and most other 3rd party players furnish their own codecs, so they wouldn't be effected by something missing in WMP 12.</p>

<br />
K-light codeck supports almost all video formats&nbsp; to be played on windows media player..<br />
<br />
K-Lite Codec Pack&nbsp; STANDARD is enough and it will provides codec to windows media player and even for windows live movi maker and almost all windows programs which required codecs

            <p>Just got notified of response and I have two.</p>
<p>I'll take a look at what you said.</p>
<p>I just ran a little test. I used the same program I have been using to convert the iso to wmv. All I have been trying to play were wma v10 audio,&nbsp;6 channel. I did one of the iso again . As before wma but this time I used wma v9 dolby pro logic. It played.</p>
<p>So, the problem is playing wma v10 audio. I also have a wmv surround test file that is 6 channel audio and it will not play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I compared the two Win8 laptop WMP and they are almost the same when you go to help, tech support info.&nbsp; I have never used any codecs so I don't know.</p>

Hi Tony</p>
<p>Before you purchase new, or try to install older software, go to the following website and check the program for compatibility with Windows 7. There have been tons of changes implemented in Windows 7, since the XP era.<br />
<br />
<span><span>Go to the following website:<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Windows
 7 Compatibility Center</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will see a Software and Hardware tab that you can use to locate the product you wish to check for compatibility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Select the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/faq.aspx#faq1_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Compatibility
 FAQ</span></span></a></span> that will explain how to use the compatibility website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you find an installed software/hardware item that does not appear on the compatibility list, go to the website of the developer for
 that product and check for any updates.<br />
<br />
If you find that the program is not compatible with Windows 7 and the software developer will not support the product on Windows 7, try the following.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproappcompat/thread/cdd894f8-1ee2-43e5-952b-d04c25779a7f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><br />
HOW TO: Install a Software Application using Compatibility Mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run correctly, you can try changing the compatibility
 settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the<span>Start</span> button, and then clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type<span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under<span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to
 the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Make
 older programs run in this version of Windows</span></span></a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7<br />

            First of all, I'm using Windows 10. Second of all, running "netsh wlan show profiles" in the Run program or the Command Prompt doesn't work in Windows 10. Third of all, I want it to show when I hit the WiFi tab in the bottom right corner. But, thanks for
 trying!

    <title>common Xbox Live router problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            common Xbox Live router problems</h2>
                    
<p>hello everyone!! Here i will post common problems with Xbox Live and how to fix them.</p>
<p><span>i will talk about 2 topics:</span><br />
<span>1. NAT - What is it?</span><br />

<span>2. DMZ - Perfect for one Xbox</span></p>

<p><b><span>NAT Settings</span></b></p>
<p><span><strong>Three types of NAT issues that can occur:</strong></span><b><br />
<br />
<span>Open</span></b><span><span>:</span> This means that you router has optimal settings, and you should not run into any of the issues described in this article.</span><br />

<br />
<span><b>Moderate</b></span><span><span>:</span> This means that you can talk to other players who have open or moderate NAT issues, but you cannot talk or play with users who have strict NAT issues.</span><br />
<span><b>Moderate</b></span><span><span>:</span> This means that you can talk to other players who have open or moderate NAT issues, but you cannot talk or play with users who have strict NAT issues.</span><br />

<span><b>Stric</b></span><span><span>t:</span> This means that you can talk to other players, but you cannot talk to players who have moderate or strict NAT issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NAT, or Network Address Translation, is a networking concept that, in part, allows your router to share a single IP address across multiple devices. Instead of your ISP assigning you an
 IP address for every single device that you want to use to connect to the Internet, NAT provides your ISP a more efficient way to assign a single IP address to your router. Your router will then generate its own set of IP addresses, which it will manage.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>If your network test on your Xbox looks like this then you have a strict or moderate NAT.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />
<span><strong>This can be sorted depending on your situation and what option best suits you.</strong></span><br />
<span><strong>This can be sorted depending on your situation and what option best suits you.</strong></span><br />

<span><strong>If you have two or more Xboxs connected then you need to look at port forwarding. I will put up a post about port forwarding later on.</strong></span></p>

<p>=================================================================================================================================</p>
<div><span><strong>DMZ Settings</strong></span></div>

<div><span><strong><span>I will start by saying that you will still need to look at the port forwarding post if:</span><br />
<span>1. You have more than one Xbox.</span><br />

<span>2. Your computer or another device that is not your Xbox is set as the DMZ.</span><br />

<span>3. You router does not support the DMZ function.</span><br />
<span>3. You router does not support the DMZ function.</span><br />
<br />
</strong>The vast majority of home networks have a Firewall unless disabled. Computers and Games consoles are protected from malicious content on the internet by the Firewall. The Firewall can also stop information that needs to be sent and received. In this
 scenario, the information that the Xbox trying to send or receive is being limited. A Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) is a zone (IP address) that is external to the Firewall. In layman's terms it exposes one computer or console to the internet with no protection.
 This isn't recommended for computers, but for a games console it is perfect!<br />
<br />
You will need to set your Xbox to a manual (static) IP address. If you are unsure what this is, how to do this or why you need to do this look at part four of the guide.<br />
<br />
Now that you are armed with your Xbox's IP address you need to access your router. Somewhere on the router the DMZ setting will be hiding. An example of the DMZ setting is shown below. Enable DMZ and enter your Xbox's IP address. Click Save and you're done!
 The NAT on your Xbox should now be open. Go to your Xbox and test the network settings.<strong><br />

<h2>            surface rt tablet , holux bluetooth gps receiver</h2>
                    I purchased two surface rt tablets last week . My gps holux m-1000 bluetooth receiver is regognized and paired with the surface rt, but moments later it disconnects on both units.
<div>The receiver works with all other window products, including windows mobile 6.1</div>
<div>I need some indication that it will be fixed, or else the tablets will be returned to the store.</div>
<div>Other than that, I am fairly pleased.</div>
<div>If you can , please respond&nbsp;</div>

<div>The Surface will not connect to the Bluetooth until the Software requests a connection, which is why it stays listed as Offline. We cannot recommend software from the Store, you may need to try several apps that may meet your needs.</div>

<div>Hi Anas Ahmad Shah,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are welcome Anas Ahmad Shah.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now you may have to check which Startup item is causing the issue to occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For that you may have to enable half of the startup items first to determine which application is causing the issue to occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the first half is not causing the issue go to the second half and enable the start up items and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This way you'd be able to determine which item is causing the Windows Explorer to crash.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps from the <strong>Clean Boot </strong>article given in the previous post.<br />

<br />
Look at the taskbar, the black strip at the bottom of the screen. All the windows that you have so far opened are represented by a rectangular box ( it's called thumbnail ). Click one of them, and it will appear at the screen.<br />
Your old one is still there.<br />

<h2>            skype, ireland local number, if i live in the U.S.&#63;</h2>
                    <p>traveling to Ireland in july. &nbsp; was interested in getting an Ireland local number (SKYPE NUMBER) for while in Ireland, so I could RECEIVE local Ireland calls.&nbsp; I realize I can DIAL local calls through skype, was going to buy credits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHEN I WENT to the local Ireland number site, it states disclaimer that "I AM A RESIDENT of....". &nbsp;&nbsp; Are you required to be a resident of Ireland, to get a subscription to a local number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>any other feedback, as&nbsp; to how to use my U.S. based phone, while IN IRELAND, to do a limited number of calls (such as calling bed and breakfasts, reservations, etc, and RECEIVING calls back from them, so they don't incur charges) is appreciated.</p>
