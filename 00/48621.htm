            I cannot comment on your speed max pc issue, but you can fix your startup issue by reinstalling the NVIDIA drivers.<br />
<br />
Here are my standard copy/paste instructions from the JKB1687 article for your reading pleasure:<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are using an NVIDIA video system (either on the motherboard or an add-in card), the installation of the NVIDIA software optionally adds one or more startup items to launch the NVIDIA control panel.&nbsp; They are set to launch and run every time your system
 boots.<br />
<br />
If it was working before and you have done some system updates lately, something is out of whack with it and/or your system has a malicious software affliction.<br />
<br />
To see what the commands look like, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msconfig<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the System Configuration Utility and click the Startup tab to see the Startup Items.&nbsp; You may have to slide the columns around to better see things and since msconfig is not a startup manager (it is a troubleshooting tool) you can't' make
 the display any wider.<br />
<br />
Items with a check in the box will be launched automatically every time XP restarts.&nbsp; Items with no check in the box are still "installed" but not configured to launch automatically every time XP starts.<br />
<br />
The NVIDIA related startup line(s) you see in msconfig Startup tab will look something like this:<br />
<br />
RunDLL32.exe NvCpl.dll,NvStartup<br />
RunDLL32.exe NvMcTray.dll,NvTaskbarInit<br />
<br />
If either the NvMcTray.dll or the NvCPL.dll files are somehow missing, corrupted, mismatched, out of date or the wrong versions (maybe from some recent update), when the NVIDIA applications try to launch, you may see messages like this (or similar complaining):<br />
<br />
rundll32.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application of DLL c:\windows\system32\nvmctray.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
RUNDLL<br />
Error loading c:\windows\system32\nvmctray.dll<br />
%1 is not a valid Win32 application<br />
<br />
If you don't think you are using the NVIDIA control panel, you could just disable the item(s) is msconfig to stop it from launching when you start your computer.&nbsp; If you are using the NVIDIA control panel, disabling the items will leave your system with no
 NVIDIA control panel (this may not be a good thing).<br />
<br />
You could just go ahead and disable the startup item(s) in msconfig (disabling does not uninstall anything), reboot your system and see how your system works.&nbsp; If things get worse, you can run msconfig again and reenable the NVIDIA items, but hopefully you
 will want to fix things the right way.<br />
<br />
Disabling items in msconfig is not really fixing things and you will not have an NVIDIA control panel, but some folks don't even know what the NVIDIA control panel looks like so that may be fine.&nbsp; You will have stopped the message from popping up on every startup.<br />
<br />
If you want to use the NVIDIA control panel features, you need to repair or reinstall your NVIDIA software.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The best way to reinstall the NVIDIA software is to visit the NVIDIA support web page and either let it check your system and recommend the best software for your system or for you to find the correct version of software yourself on their web page and download
 the latest video driver software package for your system and install it yourself.<br />
<br />
It is recommended to run the NVIDIA scan with Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the NVIDIA support page for the scan:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/PreScan.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
Read the directions, then click the GRAPHICS DRIVERS button to start the scan.<br />
<br />
Let their online scanner take a look at your video system and see what it suggests for drivers and consider their analysis if they suggest a new driver.<br />
<br />
Download and install the recommended driver and reboot your system.<br />
<br />
If following their directions does not straighten things out, then do this:<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter: <br />
<br />
msinfo32 <br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the
<br />
information back here. <br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information.
<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be
<br />
private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information. <br />
<br />
When you have the time, I would do this too:<br />
<br />
Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; http://malwarebytes.org/<br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />

<h2>            Login password field not shown, cannot login after display ON when returning to laptop.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">For at least the 3 months, if not much longer, I have been experiencing an issue where I lock the workstation Win+L and return later, maybe hours later or the next day, and I touch the keyboard or mouse to activate display ON (the
 display turns off after about 30 minutes). After the display turns ON, the screen has that upward scrolling effect which is supposed to lead to a screen change that shows a password field, but I often see an issue where the screen remains blank aside from
 the picture shown. It may show the user name or something, but there are no fields shown, no password entry field, so I cannot enter a password. When this problem occurs, I have no choice but to restart the system, losing any work I had active.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I called support today and they wanted me to do a refresh which would require me to reinstall applications and all that... that's a huge time hit for me. Since I had seen other users having a similar problem, I decided to opt out
 of that path and they recommended I try to share the below technical information here.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I gathered some technical info so I'm hoping someone can use the info to help triage this problem. Note, I have not been able to access Feedback Hub for a long while (I have another post on that Feedback Hub issue) so I cannot provide

<p>Thank you. On Sunday I used "Reset this PC" with the "Keep my files" option. After, I reinstalled my primary applications/software which consisted of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>All needed drivers/utilities for an MSI GT72S 6QD, basically what's on the folowing pages...
<ul>
<li>https://www.msi.com/Laptop/support/GT72S-6QD-Dominator-G.html#down-driver&amp;Win10 64</li><li>https://www.msi.com/Laptop/support/GT72S-6QD-Dominator-G.html#down-utility&amp;Win10 64</li></ul>
</li><li>Retrospect Desktop (backup software&nbsp;https://www.retrospect.com)</li><li>Microsoft Office 365</li><li>The following Adobe Creative Cloud applications:
<ul>
<li>Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017</li><li>Adobe Photoshop CC 2017</li><li>Adobe Bridge CC 2017</li><li>Adobe Audition CC 2017</li><li>Adobe After Effects CC 2017</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>With my system reset and setup as above, I left it locked overnight, where in the morning the problem occurred again... I touched the keyboard or mouse, the display goes ON, the time screen has disappared as expected but it does not show a password field.
 It's as if the logon experience is fine except for something causing a deadlock which leads to no password field being displayed.
<br />
</p>
<p>I will see if I can find a way to employ your recommendation to disable services/startup items and leave the system locked overnight. The problem with disabling is it might make my system unusable during the day so I may be limited on when I try this or
 for how long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>After Disk Cleanup, with only Microsoft services enabled, and no Startup items enabled, the problem still occurs. Note, I just refreshed the PC the other day so this overall installation is fairly fresh/new.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What I notice is that right when I start seeing that SCM event indicating the Passport service was terminated.... that's when the issue will occur. I have just observed that several times over that last hour or so... after it occurs, I reboot to clear everything,
 no issue, then wait, then see that event, then the issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I waited a long while, the display was still ON with the eventvwr running as I left it, I moved the mouse and refreshed event viewer and immediately saw the following...&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>the one at 10:41:16.... after that first one, that's when the problem will occurs... at the next workstation Lock with attempt to unlock, there will be no password field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those messages occur every 5 minutes but it's really after the first. That's the pattern... I'm not saying it's Passport service ... maybe that is a symptom of the main deadlock/problem but for whatever reason things are fine and then those message appear
 and that at least indirectly means the issue will occur on next lock/unlock. Again, only Microsoft services are running.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have a little more info... I notice the following pattern:</p>
<ol>
<li>I reboot my system.</li><li>My system starts up.</li><li>I login to the desktop. My settings will keep the workstation unlocked. It will not automatically lock, but the display will go off after about an hour (but system will not be locked unless I do Win+L which I do not do here).</li><li>I let me system sit at the desktop with eventvwr open for 30 minutes. </li><li>At ~30 minutes after sitting there, if I refresh eventvwr, I see the Passport service terminated event.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I did the above two times in a row, and both times, after 30 minutes of being idle, the Passport service is terminated. After that point, if I lock the workstation with Win+L, I will no longer be able to login due the deadlock described in my earlier post.
 For some reason, the deadlock I described with debugger output is occuring ~30 seconds after I restart my laptop. This seems to indicate there's a good chance I will experience this deadlock and inability to login after lock 30 minutes or more after restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the events from my System log for the two attempts I made using the above steps...</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the above, &nbsp;you see the last event before the SCM termination event is about 30 minutes prior to the SCM event. For example, above you see 1:58:03AM as the last event after restart, where the next event about 30 minutes later is the SCM Passport service
 termination failure. After that point, 2:25:55AM, if I Win+L or my system auto locks the workstation, I will not be able to login.<br />

            <p>I'm still seeing this issue constantly, at least once a day. The problem seems caused at least indirectly if not directly by a deadlock in passport service which has a thread owning a critical section, while it itself appears to be waiting on an RPCSS ALPC
 call that is apparently never answered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap my symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>My system works fine right after booting, password field is present and I can login no problem.</li><li>However, after sometime, the deadlock occurs and I start seeing eventvwr System messages indicating Passport Service terminated.
</li><li>After I see that, I know if I lock the workstation, I will no longer receive a password field.
</li><li>So the problem is not always present. </li><li>Also, I have two systems, a 5 year old VAIO which does *not* exhibit this problem, and a 1.5 year old (relative new system) MSI GT72S 6QD (search for "msi gt72s 6qd" to see specs) with fairly new hardware. Both systems laptops but it is only my newer MSI
 which exhibits the issue. </li><li>I have tried Refreshing the installation, and Clean Boot (disabling all non-built-in services, etc., disabling all startup items, the usual troubleshooting steps) without luck, problem still occurs.
</li><li>When the problem occurs, no password field is presented after touching the keyword to turn on display etc., as described in this thread and others, and my eventvwr System log shows lots of Passport Service terminated events per what I mentioned above.</li><li>I'm wondering if this is a problem that affects select systems, perhaps due to some drivers or something, possibly third party or otherwise which are not disabled as part of Clean Boot steps. Clean Boot means following the steps at this url: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows).&nbsp;</li><li>When I first boot my system, as mentioned, I can successfully login. I can lock my workstation, and re-login without issue until... as soon as I start seeing eventvwr messages about passport service terminated, I know with certainty, no doubt, that after
 I see that, if I lock my workstation, I will no longer be able to login. The next time I try to access the login screen, the password field will not be present. My only option at that point, and others have described, is to reboot. Then things start over.
 Refreshing does not fix the issue. Clean Boot does not hide the issue either.</li></ul>
<p>Hope this extra info helps. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I'm still seeing this issue. My only workarounds are to either leave the workstation unlocked when I walk away (a security issue... I shouldn't do this), or to restart my computer when this issue occurs. The latter workaround is problematic if I have apps
 open with files open since I might lose data. I try to enhance that workaround by closing all applications every time I want to lock the workstation. That way if it happens, and I restart, I won't lose any data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My prior post provided a recap of my situation's issues... did anyone see that information?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the following posts are the same issue... I'm wondering if anyone can verify if that's the case? Maybe it can help lead to a solution....</p>

<h2>            Change document from a .jpeg type to a .doc type</h2>
                    
<p>I sanned a word document into Word, but it comes out garbled. I can't encrypt it. So I scanned it into my pictures as a .jpeg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It comes out perfect, but now I cannot edit it, (when you choose edit, the screen goes into "Paint").&nbsp; So I am trying to change
 the type to a <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">.doc</span></strong> so that I can add it to Word.&nbsp; I think I did this once, but do not remember how&nbsp;I&nbsp;did it. Any comments?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sissy&nbsp; p.s. Just saw another answer on the forum, to change
 the extension from .jpeg to..doc&nbsp;&nbsp; I follwed directions, changed te document, but it still won't open!</p>

<p>yes, you cannot simply change the extension and expect it to convert a picture file into a text file.</p>
<p>you will need OCR software to convert the scanned images into editable text documents.</p>
<p>if you have microsoft office, then you may already have a built in OCR and the ability to scan and convert the images into text&nbsp;for msword.</p>
<p>try clicking on start &gt; all programs &gt; microsoft office &gt; microsoft tools &gt; microsoft imaging &amp; scanning</p>

<h3> ahmed23t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resuming Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1 pro, downloaded the media creation tool and started the upgrade process. It reached 85% then it suddenly quit.
</p>
<p>I'd really appreciate it if i can resume the upgrade without having to restart downloading from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 2 folders created by the creation tool on my C drive:</p>
<p>$Windows.~WS (hidden)</p>
<p>$WINDOWS.~BT</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder ~WS contains a file called "BITCF92.tmp" with a size of 2.7 GB, so I'm thinking that maybe this is the download I'm looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to resume the download again?</p>

    <title>Canon MX870 printer under Win 8.1 prints pages in wrong order - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waltculver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon MX870 printer under Win 8.1 prints pages in wrong order</h2>
                    <p>I am transitioning to Win 8.1 from Vista.&nbsp; I have an MX870 Canon printer with page-order problems.&nbsp; With my printer settings exactly the same as on my Vista machine, Win 8.1's printing of a multipage document insists on treating the print of a document backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, setting the printer as I always have to PRINT FROM LAST PAGE, it treats the last page as the first page of the document.&nbsp; So on a 3-page document printed two-sided, pages 2 and 3 are back-to-back, and page 1 is blank on the back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I undid the PRINT FROM LAST PAGE setting, it made no difference.&nbsp; It still treated the last page as if it were the true first page of the document.&nbsp; I went to the Canon website and nothing jumped out at me re a problem fix from their side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>

            <p>Auggy - I got it!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not understand at first what you were suggesting because I had done all of that (I THOUGHT!) but the truly Byzantine design of&nbsp;Word 2013&nbsp;defeated all the logic I had previously applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very nonintuitive way Word 2013 works is that it splits the printer commands between Canon's printer windows and the Advanced window under Options, with the latter printer commands taking precedence.&nbsp; So no matter what I tried in Canon's print window,
 Word 2013 would not permit it to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY IN GOD'S CREATION WOULD WORD 2013 BE DESIGNED THIS WAY????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, after three visits to the Word 2013 Options --&gt; Advanced window (at the Bottom of that window so it's out of sight on first inspection), I figured out that I needed to uncheck Word 2013's print-from-last-page command.&nbsp; That permitted Canon's print-from-last-page
 command to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Damn!&nbsp; Why did they make so nonsensical?</p>

<h2>            Minecraft better together nintendo switch screen size issue</h2>
                    <p>I have minecraft for the nintendo switch, and have the bedrock edition update. The game plays fine, but when playing split screen on my tv, the picture is larger than the TV, so the hot bars at the bottom of the screen are cut off and you can't see them. I did not see any screen adjustment settings anywhere. What do I do?</p>

            Mine has done the same since an update today. Bar is white which isn't great but I am far more concerned that a message came up saying something along the lines of windows couldn't connect and that the problem could only be viewed by administrators????????<br />

            Use system restore for a time prior to any windows update, and having done so review the windows update settings and check that only Important updates are selected for auto install, and NOT recommended updates

            <p>This is a long shot, but this update has caused a lot of other issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;try this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, if your&nbsp;System Restore is working then just use that to go back to before the recent updates, if it's not working then try this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Disconnect from the internet &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open Control Panel</p>
<p>3. Open Program &amp; Features</p>
<p>4. Click "View installed updates" on the left-hand side</p>
<p>5. Find "Security update for Microsoft Windows (KB2859537)" under the Microsoft Windows section</p>
<p>6. Uninstall that update and restart you PC (may take a very-VERY long time to configure)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that works then make sure you stop that update from downloading again.</p>

            <p>Hi Annie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, the first thing that we need to identify is which update exactly has caused this in the computer. In order to do this, the best process would be to restore the computer to a point earlier than the latest Windows Update installation as suggested
 by <strong>Palcouk</strong> and then install one update at a time. Here are the details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> do a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Restore</a> in your computer to a time before the latest Windows Update installation.
</p>
<p><em><strong>Please note</strong> that if you have installed any program or made any changes to a program after the time you have selected to restore to, these programs or changes will be lost in the restore process</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Then,</strong> once the system restore is done, perform the following steps to install one update at a time and find out which one of these updates has caused the problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click <strong>Start,</strong> type in <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the search box in the Start Menu and click on
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Update</strong> option in the search results. This should open up the Windows Update panel.</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Check for Updates</strong> option on the left hand side and let Windows find out all the available updates.</p>
<p>3. Once Windows prompts you with something like <strong>X updates are available</strong>, click on it to see the available updates.</p>
<p>4. Then select only one update from that list, note the KB number for the selected update&nbsp;and proceed to install that update and check if that update is causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Repeat these steps until you find the update that cause the issue. Once you have identified the update, please provide us the KB number for that update.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do reply with the result of these steps in your computer so that we could assist you further on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Note : I request other community members with similar issue&nbsp;to create a new thread in the community so that we could avoid confusion and the issue gets better assistance. Depending on the configuration of the computers, troubleshooting could
 be different even if the cause is similar in two computers. Thank you for your cooperation.</em></strong></p>

            I'm having a similar problem, I did system restore and it returned to normal but was then prompted to install updates again, I did this and it's all gone weird looking again. Can I selectively reinstall updates? How can I tell which one is causing the
 problem?&nbsp;
<div>Ah just seen my question answered above. Thanks everyone.</div>

<p>No, it's not. There is nothing "great" about doing nothing with your life but playing video games all day. You are doing nothing productive that is helping out society in the long run. Anyone if they were lame &amp; jobless enough could do the exact same thing
 as him. Curing cancer or finding a vaccine for AIDS is a great accomplishment. What he's doing is just plain selfish.</p>

            <p>Many thanks for your offer of assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention the 'exe.mui' notation as it it is not the normal '.exe' file type for a programme - it may not be the cause for the file not opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Solitaire game is an icon on my desktop which when double clicked has always opened the game with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Solitaire game is located in my Programme Files(x86) folder.&nbsp; double clicking this folder shows:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;A) Solitaire en-US</p>
<p>B) Solitaire application 715kb Solitaire.exe.mui</p>
<p>C) Solitaire MCE&nbsp;&nbsp; File version 6.0.6002.18005</p>
<p>D) Solitaire MCE&nbsp; PNG file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the programme until I have now lost interest altogether.&nbsp; This game has given much pleasure over the years, and is much better(my opinion) than the latest MS offering even without the advertising.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I am throwing in&nbsp; the towel!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have any ideas that someone with limited IT skills can follow, it would be much appreciated</p>

            <p>Further to my post of 25 OCTOBER - I have since installed the upgrade to Win 10 - and the original programme that had been left on the PC is now working just fine providing that I open it from either the Tile or the icon on the Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original icon on the desktop only directs me to the programme location and is no longer used.</p>

            and what? &nbsp;I already called that out. &nbsp;And..I also stated I am the system administrator. &nbsp;The point here is the error message is incorrect. &nbsp;Not sure what part of that is not clear.

<h2>            Build 18312 upgrade failure</h2>
                    <p>I was fighting with it for 5 days and no success.</p>
<p>- It is downloaded/installed,</p>
<p>- then goes to reboot, </p>
<p>- "getting ready" doesn't finish to 100% (About 12-15%),</p>
<p>- restart and I have regular boot with no installation/update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open "Update center", I see:</p>
<p>"Windows 10 Insider Preview 18312.1001 (rs_prerelease)</p>
<p>Status: Pending restart"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info:</p>
<p>- I have about 108GB free space on the system drive</p>
<p>- I have tried to reset WU - no success</p>
<p>- When download/install finish I see message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're having trouble restarting to finish the install. Try again in a little while. If you keep seeing this, try searching the web or contacting support for help. This error code might help: (0x800706ba)"</p>
<p>So I can't restart from this screen. I've tried to wait — doesn't help.</p>
<p>Restart only works from the Start menu.</p>

<h2>            Music in NAS drive won&#39;t play</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Given that this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-pictures/network-share-locations-do-not-appear-in-music-app/210616b9-98ae-430b-a12e-fc95b36eaadb">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-pictures/network-share-locations-do-not-appear-in-music-app/210616b9-98ae-430b-a12e-fc95b36eaadb</a>&nbsp;is incorrectly marked as 'answered', and a Microsoft moderator has asked a new thread be started,
 I'll give it a shot!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem is this.&nbsp; I've stored all my music on a NAS drive.&nbsp; This is a fairly common approach, and it's not unreasonable to expect that I'd be able to include that location in my Music library on Windows 8.1, and then play the contents in the Music app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I managed to use a common workaround to include the network share with my music in the Windows Music library, and indeed now when I go to the Music app, all my music is listed.&nbsp; However, it will not play.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All the music is listed as having a length of 0:00 and when I try to play it, I get an error "Can't Play" with the error codes 0xc1010107 (0xc00d36c3).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Manually playing a single file works fine, but that's not very helpful - I want to be able to play my music
<em>collection</em> not have to open each file individually!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Music app has been part of Windows 8 since release, and despite various updates, a year later it still can't play music on a NAS drive.&nbsp; This is clearly a problem affecting a lot of people based on the original thread linked above.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is hardly a big ask!&nbsp; It's a very common scenario to put music on a NAS drive and play it via my home network.&nbsp; Please, Microsoft - this is basic stuff.&nbsp; Can't this be made to happen?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm really hoping this can be sorted out.&nbsp; As it stands this problem effectively cripples the Music app for those of us who want to use a NAS drive, and means we have to look to older 'legacy' style solutions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Sorry, but Microsoft stand by their position that "this is not a bug, it's a feature"...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On their <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/apps/windows-8/windows-8-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ page for the Xbox Apps</a>, they clearly state:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"If you have music stored on a network or network access storage (NAS) drive, note that the Music app currently only supports content stored on network shares hosted by Windows operating systems. Windows Search and Desktop Experience features must be installed
 and Indexing enabled for the share. Once these are installed and enabled, you may have to rebuild the index for network shares to function correctly with the Music app."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think that you are out of luck. You'll need to go back to "legacy" solutions, such as Windows Media Player.</p>
