<h2>            Too Many Mail Options&#58; Outlook, Outlook.com, Office 365 or Microsoft Mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had several POP email addresses with my ISP for about 10 years, and also have a Gmail.&nbsp; This week I bought my own domain, and will gradually replace the POP email addresses with my new domain address and aliases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook for managing the POP mail - which is great as it automatically sorts mail to different aliases into separate folders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have Office 365 for the new domain emails, which syncs with the Microsoft Mail app; my Gmail also goes here.&nbsp; This isn't the best app, as it won't sort and separate automatically, but it looks like I am stuck with it.</p>
<p>I also have an Outlook.com account, which doesn't seem to sync, but is connected to my calendar.&nbsp; I haven't looked at it for a year or so.</p>
<p>I can also use Outlook on my laptop to access the POP email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 8.1 RT on my tablet, and Windows 7 on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this:&nbsp; why do I have so many options for my mail?&nbsp; I obviously have to keep the 365, but can I delete my Outlook.com account? Is there an alternative to Microsoft Mail that will run rules like Outlook?&nbsp; Can I use Outlook to download all mail
 through the 365 as well as Gmail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to some wisdom!</p>

            <p>Might depend on exactly what you mean by 'own domain'</p>
<p>In MS Outlook, as part of Office 365 you can add any mail account that supports pop or IMAP, or you can add an outlook.com mail account</p>
<p>If a pop mail account that will not be in sync across multiple devices</p>
<p>An IMAP or outlook.com mail account will be in sync across multiple devices</p>
<p>Gmail can be configured in MS Outlook as a pop or IMAP mail account, provided you have set the appropriate options in the Gmail web management section</p>

            Thanks Palcouk. It looks like Outlook is a good tool for reading, organising as well as downloading and saving messages from the 365 and POP accounts, and that I can safely delete the Outlook.com account as it seems to have been superseded by 365.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 I will need to also keep the mail app for Gmail - I can configure it for Outlook, but only by lowering the Gmail security settings, which I'm not keen to do.&nbsp; Well, I got rid of one, which is a start!

            An outlook.com mail account is completely separate to, and nothing to do with Office 365, its simply a mail account that can be added to whatever mail program you are using<br />

After few seconds it back to 5.04GB used<br />

            <p>Thank you for the reply. We suggest that you do <strong>hard reset</strong> on your phone. Take note that this method will
<strong>erase all</strong> content stored on your phone, including apps and games (along with app data and game progress), text messages, call history, music, photos, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform hard reset:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Start, swipe over to the All apps list, then select <strong>Settings</strong> .
</li><li>Select <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>Reset your phone</strong>.
</li><li>You'll receive two warnings. If you're absolutely sure you want to restore your phone to its factory settings, select
<strong>Yes</strong>, and then select <strong>Yes </strong>again. It might take a little while for the process to complete.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a back up</a></strong> of the files stored on your phone.</p>

            <p>Your control's already offer you this ability natively, no need for any coding.&nbsp; In the properties dialog, under the Other tab, look for the property ControlTip Text.&nbsp; Whatever you enter there will appear to the user when the mouse is left over that control

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another approach is to insert labels and control their visibility using control events.&nbsp; Similar to your original idea, but using labels instead of MsgBox.</p>

<h3> fisch4billf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 11.0 Object Library vs. Access 12.0 Object Library</h2>
                    
<p>We are in the process of migrating from Office 2003 to 2007 in our institution, and as such have encountered issues with some files having been created in Access 2003, used in 2007 and then being corrupt in the next time that 2003&nbsp;is used to open the file.
 The only difference I can find in the files that work versus those that do not, is in the references: once the file is corrupt (according to 2003) the reference points to&nbsp; the Microsoft Access 12.0 Object Library, when it used to point to the Microsoft Access
 11.0 Object Library. In the past&nbsp;I could 'repair' the file by re-installing 2003 on the machine in question which would then restore the reference to the version 11.0 Library. However, it seemed to be a temporary solution as the next time any user opted to
 use 2007, it (2007) was re-installed and the reference again pointed to the 12.0 Library.</p>
<p>Now it doesn't seem to matter what I do, I cannot get the Version 11.0 Library to appear as a valid choice.<br />
Is there anything to be done to help this situation? I'm stuck.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />

<p>If you are using VBA to automate Access, use Late Binding instead of Early Binding and then you will not need a reference to the Object Library.</p>
<p>There may however be other ways of getting the data.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem (I installed Access 2007 after Access 2003 had been installed). I have done the following to resolve it.</p>
<p>First I renamed <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Office12\MSACC.OLB</strong>to another name and restarted my Access 2003 application. This caused Windows Installer to run and configure Access 2003. After that the app ran fine. I did not have
 to put my Office install disks in the drive.</p>
<p>Second, I renamed my renamed file back to <strong>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Office12\MSACC.OLB.</strong></p>
<p>Next I opened up Access 2007 this caused Windows Installer to run and configure Access 2007. It appears that Access 2007 is running fine.</p>
<p>Each time that I switch between Access 2007 and Access 2003 the Windows Installer automatically runs and configures Access. As long as I don't switch between Access 2003 and 2007 Windows Installer doesn't run. I have rebooted and this behavior seems consistent.</p>
<p>On my computer here (2.2 Ghz, Dual core) it takes (just guessing) about&nbsp;10 seconds to configure Access when I switch between versions.</p>

<p>Each time that I switch between Access 2007 and Access 2003 the Windows Installer automatically runs and configures Access. As long as I don't switch between Access 2003 and 2007 Windows Installer doesn't run. I have rebooted and this behavior seems consistent.</p>
<p>On my computer here (2.2 Ghz, Dual core) it takes (just guessing) about&nbsp;10 seconds to configure Access when I switch between versions.</p>

<p>This is very old post. But I need to thank you, for your immense help, you have pointed to a solution for a problem that I have been dealing since I upgrade our organization to Office 365 for two weeks now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access 2003 was crashing consistently when using various rubrics (reports, vba, etc). I had to execute the repair from 2003 installer every time I opened outlook, somehow outlook 2013 was re-registering the 2013 access modules, damaging what was done by
 repair from the 2003 office installer. &nbsp;I really though that was possible for 2003 and 2013 coexist on the same computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: MSACCESS.EXE, version: 11.0.8321.0, time stamp: 0x4b4f9cfd<br />
Faulting module name: unknown, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x00000000</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions, rename&nbsp;<strong>Office15\.....\MSACC.OLB to MSACC.OLB_&nbsp;</strong>this makes access 2003 functional again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now at least our Access 2003 version is working, we need this version to work and open .ADP files, that support was dropped from the 2013 version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>It is now 9/21/2014 and I have just installed Access 2013 for a client&nbsp;and have found the problem above still exists! Once 2013 is installed the reference is wrong in 2003 .mdb's and VBA code will not run from my Access 2003 .mdb file!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reinstall 2003 all is well but if I open the .mdb with 2013 I'm back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moral: I guess you must convert the 2003 .mdb's to .accdb files and move on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions out there?</p>

<p><br />
The answer is yes however keep in mind that some updates may not be available for all devices. If your Lumina 920 is scheduled for an update, then you will get a notification on your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are not privy to what phones (if any) will get additional font updates so we are unable to answer that question KaungSih Ther.</p>

<h2>            HELP - Accidentally Created Multiple Accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've tried to find an email address to help with this problem, as I'm absolutely sure this forum wont be able to help, unless I can somehow get help via a real Tech Support person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 Skype accounts, and I need to delete the 2 redundant ones.</p>
<p>How can this be achieved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had previously used Skype in 2005, and then again 2015, and now again with the Windows 10 App.</p>
<p>Each time I was inadvertently creating another account, but it is important that people can find me and not give up by focusing on the redundant accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Adrian.</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh Dear!... what a disaster that would be if I did that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What to do?!?!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>Guess I'll just have to live with it.<br />
</p>
<p>It's a pity that they have not designed a functionality to remove only the Skype account.</p>
<p>As a programmer myself, with some lines of code and a bit of database interrogation, there would be nothing stopping such a feature from being designed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you anyway Julie,</p>

<p><span>Hello FionaWorthington,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum!
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I have your Skype version and operating system? Kindly uninstall and reinstall Skype.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to reregister javascript and restart your IE settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, kindly follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to Start &gt; Search. Type <strong>
cmd.exe.</strong> Right-click the result file and select <strong>Run as administrator.
</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you are on a 64-bit Windows OS, before you move to the next step, type
<strong>cd SysWOW64</strong> and press the <strong>Enter key</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Type
<em>regsvr32 vbscript.dll</em> and press the <strong>Enter key</strong>. You should now get a message that says:
<em>DllRegisterServer in vbscript.dll succeeded</em>. </span></p>
<p><span>3. Type
<em>regsvr32 jscript.dll</em> and press the <strong>Enter key</strong>. You should now get a message that says:
<em>DllRegisterServer in jscript.dll succeeded</em> </span></p>

    <title>Find function in VBA not working as desired - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devendraram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Find function in VBA not working as desired</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on a VBA application which concatenates Serial number of parent form and line item number of sub form. For example Parent Sr no: 1 and Line item number 2 would be concatenated as &nbsp;1::2. I have written a code which would fetch 1::2 from the entry
 sheet and find in the history sheet, if the value is not found, it will first paste the value there and then perform a vlookup to fetch the subsequent value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked fine till I arrived at parent form no: 11. The problems started after that. It would concatenate 11:2. Now if I want to modify the earlier entered 1::2, it doesn't find the same and hence intended actions are not performed. However, it works for
 11::2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please guide me to find EXACT details so that my work can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code is as under</p>
<p>
<em>Sheet3.Activate</em><br />
<em>Set HR = Sheet3.Range("d13:d100020")</em><br />
<br />
<em>On Error Resume Next</em><br />

<em>Set Fi = HR.Find(what:=Ei, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole, SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, SearchDirection:=xlNext, MatchCase:=True, MatchByte:=True)</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<em>If Fi Is Nothing Then</em><br />
<br />

            <p>Extremely difficult if not impossible to determine what the problem is without a copy of the workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am suspecting that something is not being found and&nbsp;the "On Error Resume Next" is hiding the problem and the code continues to run and returns the incorrect values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Error Resume Next should never be used in the context that you are using it. It should only be used in situations where a test is made and if an error is returned then it is handled (usually with and If / Else /End If)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code like the following should not be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>On Error Resume Next<br />
</em><em>Sheet3.Range("d13:d25000").Find(Sheet2.Range("b" &amp; i + 29).Value).Select</em><br />
<em>On Error Resume Next</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The above code will error on the find line if the value is not found because it cannot select a cell&nbsp; that is not found and then the previously selected cell will not change and then On Error Resume Next hides the error and the next line of code (as per
 the following) is referencing the previous selected cell which is still the ActiveCell.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>ActiveCell.Offset(0, 1).Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup(ActiveCell.Value, Sheet2.Range("b30:ar45"), 2, 0) 'WR SRN</em></p>
<p>Use find code like the following and assign the found cell to a range variable and then test if found.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Dim rngToFind as Range&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>'This line hould be at top of sub</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Set rngTofind = Sheet3.Range("d13:d25000").Find(Sheet2.Range("b" &amp; i + 29).Value)</em></p>

</p><div><strong>This solution article provides information on how to report abuse and SPAM in Outlook.com</strong><br />
<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></em><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the
 spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming
 account.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To report abuse:</strong><br />
<br />
 harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>from a outlook.com account</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should
 send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the relevant&nbsp;information (abuse@hotmail, or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></em><br />
<em>*<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.</strong></em><br />
<em>*<span>&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If you wish to report abuse against a non Microsoft account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol in the sender's e-mail
 address. For example, if the unwanted email came from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.</span></em><br />

<strong><em><span style="color: rgba(235, 0, 115, 1)">* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.</span></em></strong></div>

<p>The Nokia 7208 is not in the list of devices supported at the Ovi store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to install Opera mini, Firefox, Twim, and Twibble. The browser won't even download the files. If I upload the files using Bluetooth, they won't open.</p>

<p>In fact if I try to open the web page for the Ovi store I get a message saying that the content is too large and the browser freezes.</p>

            There is no native support for speed dial in WP 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, this is where pinning comes in handy. Pin your most frequently contacted contacts to your Start Screen and they're right there. Alternatively, you can hold down the Start button and say, "Call
 such and such." <br />
<br />
But, if you speak to people that frequently you can just use the call or messaging history. That is where most of my calls and texts are initiated.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>There is also a FREE PROGRAM called </strong></em><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/speed-dial/19d54529-5304-e011-9264-00237de2db9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>Speed Dial for Windows Phone</strong></em></a><em><strong>. It&nbsp;provides
 you with direct access to all your favorite contacts, directly from the start screen. I use it and love it!!</strong></em><br />
<br />
Simply pin Speed Dial to the start screen and import your favorite contacts directly from the address book</p>

    <title>How to say no to a specific updated version&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas lee  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to say no to a specific updated version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I love being in the vanguard - and love new versions as they come own. USUALLY, this is fun. Although, last week, I found one of the downsides. My laptop was on 17223 and upgraded to 127228. Unfortunately this kind of broke connections to my VMs via a
 GUI&nbsp;which I rely on to demonstrate&nbsp;stuff to my students. Fortunately, that issue was resolved in a later version 17230 IIRC and later). Taking&nbsp;<em>that</em> upgrade gave me back a useful demo environment!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I come home and see that Windows Update wants to install 17228 on my main workstation. Given I rely heavily on the VM environment I have here (I run a dual proc, 6-core 96GB and SSDs) I really want to say no to this build. I just can't afford to wait
 for the reinstall of what I know to be a broken build, then wait for the fix to come down and reinstall all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to stop and just skip this update?<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>From your description you must be using the Insider builds as your main OS and the Main OS should be what ever the Latest Public Release is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you would be able to run the Insider Builds on the VM's and If a Build was out that you do not want just don't use that VM until one comes out that is OK for your machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you could try the Show Hide App in the Insider Builds you might want to stop new Builds with the Link is below for the download.</p>

<p>First, I deliberately run the latest builds on my workstation and laptop.&nbsp; I am involved in a couple of writing projects which almost demand living on the wild side. I fully understand the risks and accept them. In this case, that approach presents a small
 problem which I am looking to avoid. I am quite prepared to take the (know to be broken) update, then wait for the fix I know is coming. I'd prefer not to.&nbsp; But I do appreciate the warning! ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link, but that is not effective. It just shows silverlight! ;-)</p>

<p>OK - and this is spooky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want in to Windows Update and saw it was looking for me to kick off the update to 17728. I did nothing there, went into this lovely forum and posted. I got a couple of responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went into Windows Update only to see 17735 is ready for installation!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like the answer to my question is:</p>
<p>TO skip a version when you know another one is coming down - just don't restart. Wait. And ask WU to do another scan.

            Hi Raju, thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
It is only this specific document that acts out like this, previously I had a similar problem with embedded excel sheets; they kept changing fonts in the same manner it is changing the content now when you chose to edit.<br />
<br />
Heres the file:<br />

Gosha.

            Well, the image displayed in the Word document is for a completely different sheet from the one you actually see when you open the embedded workbook for editing. So something is not updating the image correctly. But which set of data do you want to use?
 The one you see, or the one you see when you edit the workbook?
<div><br />
<div>I wonder if the most recent response in the following conversation describes a similar situation (I see that the embedded spreadsheet in your document is actually an Excel 97-2003 .xls type workbook), and whether the same steps will fix your document?</div>

            I would like to keep the data that is being displayed before I click to edit and the one after, its not a problem of actually retyping the data, i want to know why this happened so i can fix it next time with no problems.

<div>I will have a look at the linked page and will let you know if it worked.</div>

            For now, I can only suggest that you replace the Excel 97-2003 object by a newer type, e.g.as follows:<br />
<div>&nbsp;a. open the sheet that you already have, and Edit-&gt;Copy its contents</div>
<div>&nbsp;b. click outside the sheet, i.e. in the Word document. I believe the display will show the data actually in the sheet at this point.</div>
<div>&nbsp;c. Insert-&gt;Object-&gt;Microsoft Excel Worksheet. (Not Microsoft Excel 97-2003 worksheet)</div>
<div>&nbsp;d. Paste the sheet data</div>
<div>&nbsp;e. click outside the sheet</div>
<div>&nbsp;f. delete the old sheet</div>
<div>&nbsp;g. save/close/re-open</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Document turns yellow and text disappears - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul1919  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document turns yellow and text disappears</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue where the text disappears and the document turns yellow. If I scroll around or zoom in/out the document will go back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is happening very frequently. It was happening in all versions of the Mac Preview, but after upgrading to 15.10.1 it seems to be much worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot that illustrates the problem. The screen should be full of text, but instead it is a very pale yellow. Sometimes the yellow is very bright (as in yellow highlighting), but it only lasts for a second and then turns to this light
 color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is perhaps a related issue (without the yellow). I posted it&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macofficepreview-macword/text-disappearing-word-for-mac-preview/97899b6d-04f7-4ba3-b455-642407348dc1">here</a></p>

</p><p>I believe the fix for that has already been coded. &nbsp;We're just waiting for it to pass internal testing and be released to the public preview. &nbsp;That process can take up to 2 months.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently blocked out of my Hotmail account after trying to login from another country on vacation.&nbsp; I have gone through the unblocking process but nothing seems to work.&nbsp; I cannot remember previous passwords since I haven't changed mine in years.&nbsp;
 I also can't remember my security answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can recall specific folders and contacts but I am not sure who I can actually contact to prove this is my account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas...?</p>
<p>

                    <p>I have just factory reset my old Lumina 925 so that my wife can use it.&nbsp; However, it will not let her sign into her Microsoft account on the phone and therefore cannot sync to one drive or download anything from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have checked the time is set manually, correctly and to the correct time zone.&nbsp; I have also used the phone to sign into the account using&nbsp;the web browser, over the WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, trying to sign in does not even load the username/password form, it just states "Can't connect. We can't connect at the moment. Wait for a while and try again". Not very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            What does &#34;out of box helper&#34; do&#63;</h2>
                    I get wary when a program states it will make changes to your computer.
<div>I just purchased a Toshiba R835 P70 which I will use mainly for internet access</div>
<div>when I am on travel.</div>
<div>It came pre-loaded with Microsoft Office 2010 Starter, which is all I need for simple</div>
<div>word and excel processing.</div>
<div>The "out of box helper" displays when I choose "Starter"</div>
<div>What changes, generally, &nbsp;is effected by the "out of box helper"?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Office 2010 starter comes with limited functionalities, means not all function are available that are in full version of Office.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office out of box helper is a user interface which helps users to activate and upgrade to full version, if Office 2010 was purchased and also it helps users to purchase
 Office 2010 if they want it. </p>
<p>Users can always skip this interface and use the Office starter 2010<b><span>.</span></b></p>
