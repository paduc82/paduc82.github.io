    <title>Azure AD Join and syncing settings with Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Azure AD Join and syncing settings with Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>After joining Azure AD using my Office 365 credentials, I added my Microsoft account, hoping I would be able to sync my settings.
</p>
<p>But I see the following message: "Some Windows features are only available if you are using a Microsoft account or work account."</p>
<p>Am I able to use both, like I can when joining an on-prem domain? When I do that, I can add a Microsoft account and sync my settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The single sign on experience with Office 365 services works great. It's just that I also want to sync passwords, favourites, settings, themes etc from my Microsoft account too.

            I opened a ticket with Microsoft and the reply I received back from the engineer was "The feature is still under development." I personally am getting sick and tired of MS releasing new operating systems that have so many bugs. With MS pushing Office 365
 has hard as they are, not giving 365 users a critical feature on launch date is atrocious.

            <p>I've reset/reinstalled my laptop 3 times now trying to get this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now decided its not going to happen, and just logged in with my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>I did however add my Office 365 account to my 'connected accounts' and this now allows me to sign in automatically to any of the O365 sites and the Azure portal. Also tested a few other sites, seems all Azure AD connected sites now have automatic sign on
 with my O365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So while I don't have all the goodness of full Azure AD Join, I have all the things I really need: MS Account settings sync plus Azure SSO.</p>

            <p>There seems to be little activity on Azure AD Join issues.</p>
<p>We use Intune as well and followed all the steps laid out from different videos and it just isn't working 100% the way its described.</p>
<p>I had hoped to move away from Domain Joined laptops that required on-prem login for first time users, etc but it seems that this will continue until this is a priority for MS, maybe next year?</p>

            <p>Solved! </p>
<p>Before Azure AD Domain Join was available, I was signing into my computer using my Microsoft Account.
</p>
<p>I added my computer to my Azure AD Domain. But as described above, I was unable to add my Microsoft Account and sync my settings to my Azure AD Domain profile on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that my Microsoft Account was already being used to sync my settings on this computer, by signing in with my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Solution</p>
<ol>
<li>Logged into my computer with my Microsoft Account</li><li>Visited Settings &gt; User Accounts </li><li>Changed this account to sign on to the computer <strong>locally</strong>. <br />
This means I disconnected my Microsoft Account from this profile and was changing it to a local profile.
<br />
I had to set a local password. <br />
My profile and all it's synced settings / files from the point that I disconnected my Microsoft Account, still remain in the profile. But from this point forth, I'm not signing into this profile with my Microsoft Account.</li><li>Signed out of this profile. </li><li>Signed into my computer using my Azure AD / Office 365 ID. </li><li>Visited Settings &gt; User Accounts and added my Microsoft Account to the profile.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>I'm still logging into the computer using my Azure AD / Office 365 ID. But now I'm also enjoying the benefits of a connected Microsoft Account, giving access to synced settings and OneDrive (consumer).
</p>
<p>Once I've set up my Office 365 profile on my computer and I'm happy with it, I'll remove my old Microsoft Account (now local account) to free up some space.

<p>My Excel VBA for Mac 2011 (V 14.4.1 running on OS 10.8.5 lets me assign a background color to user form control buttons but then won't apply the chosen color. Button stays white. Also, VBA won't let me assign a graphic/picture
 as a property; When I go to choose a particular graphic, all graphic file formats are gray. Is this a bug or am I doing something wrong? Thanks</p>

    <title>Selective global font change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wtpfeffer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Selective global font change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a long Word document in which parts of the text are in TNR font and parts in Cambria. I need to get these two fonts reduced to one font, but the doc also has some symbol fonts etc here and there that I need to preserve. Is there a way to do a global
 *selective* font change? i.e. Can I specify that I want everything in TNR converted to Cambria, but *not* anything in another font? Doing a select-all and change to Cambria will change all my symbol fonts as well, of course.</p>

            <p>Identify the style that is set in TNR, and change its font to Cambria. &nbsp;Three clicks and you're done. &nbsp;It really is that simple!</p>
<p>

<p>Note: &nbsp;If you have not changed the font in your styles, TNR will continue to break out all over the document like a dose of the measles. &nbsp;What we have done with the Advanced Find/Replace is effectively hard-coded the font in parts of the document. That's
 a bad idea: not only does it make the document unnecessarily large and complex internally, but it means that any editing that causes text to revert to the formatting of the underlying style (such as a paste...) will keep bringing TNR back.</p>

 it is system repair software whereas MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials) is a Anti-virus Etc. and MSE has Realtime protection and it looks somewhat similar to what iolo system mechanic's system gaurd is doing also.</p>
<p>If there is someone who knows both software could please answer the following question: Should one of them be disabled? (MSE Realtime protection and/or iolo System mechanic system gaurd).</p>

<h2>            MS Access 2007, Subreports overlaying one another</h2>
                    
<p>I have built a report which pulls togethre a series of queries (which of course make subreports). The first three subreports display fine, but when I add a fourth or fifth, they overlay each other (the fifth overlays the fourth). I have built a subreport
 that pulls in three reports and then have embedded that into the original subreport, but what if I need (and I will) more than 9 subreports?</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas what might be causing this and how I can get around it?</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by overlay, but if&nbsp;the subreport controls&nbsp;have CanGrow set to Yes and the bottom of one is extending over the top of the one below it, it's beacuse you have the top of the lower one above the bottom of the one above it.</p>
<p>Otherwise I would have to guess that you have them overlapping in design view.</p>

            They are not overlapping in design view and I thought this is not a problem with the first three, regardless of which of the report controls I move to the first three positions. In other words, when I move one of the overlaid controls to the top in design
 view, it displays properly along with the next two, and then the fourth gets overlaid by the fifth.

<p>OK. I looked at each of the subs. They are set to CanGrow-Yes.&nbsp; When I change the starting point, it does move them down. But these reports will have wildly differing numbers of records when they are run. Is there any way to have the top set relative to
 the report that came before? It seems to do that automatically if there are three or fewer continuous subreports.</p>
<p>btw-I have tried inserting a page break between reports, but that doesn't seem to help.</p>

            As long as there are no controls that are to the side of two or more subreports and each sybreport's Top is below the bottom&nbsp;of the subreport above it, even by a tiny amount, it shoud be ok.&nbsp; Check to make sure that you do not have some other controls
 (line control, label, ??) that span more than one subreport vertically.

            It turns out that when I moved a subreport that included a parameterized query to the top of the report, all was well. All of the subs laid out properly beneath it. It is the only query with a parameter in the entire list of reports for the report.

            I can't see how a parameter would cause the problem.&nbsp; Seems like just moving the subreport around may have shaken something loose.

<p>
</p><p>The Icon links work but I can't type anything in Search.... The Menu button does nothing, and the System button will not work. And calendar is not working..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebooting with no luck. I tried going back to last build, but there is none listed.. I tried going back to Windows 8, &nbsp;but it tells me it can not find recovery on this computer. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I have the same problem on a Dell Laptop and I rolled back to 10130 then it works as it did before so now I downloaded the ISO of 10162 and am in the process of reinstalling that build from the DVD.&nbsp; Hope you get yours going but I know its a pain but that
 is what "testing" of per-release software is all about.&nbsp; :-)</p>

            <p>Well I can not get to "Settings" to add a new user, cause settings will not work on my Start Bar or my in Users, No response when I click to try and get to settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded ISO Build 10162 but it will not boot from a DVD or a USB. So I tried an old build, but it will just not boot from USB or DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crazy cause right up till this last build Win 10 was working pretty good. And it it working fine on my Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Startbar is just dead. You can't type into Search, you can't click on Settings. Cortana is not there. You can't click on Notifications. The Calendar is not responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the sfc /scannow... It shows mo errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store Icon says "there is problem with the store, contact administrator for repair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>we are in the process of moving onto O365, we are using a hybrid exchange environment. I have just migrated a users mailbox onto exchange online.

            Hi Gary,<br /><br />Can you try  removing the 365 licence from the account leave the account for about 10 minutes re add the licence and try again<br /><br />Is the mailbox showing as a shared mailbox? You could also try converting it to a shared and back to a normal mailbox<br /><br />I've had these issues where the mailbox appears to be stuck after trying either of the above it gave it a good kick

<p>Hello Romel Ram,</p>
<p>Thank you for all your efforts to solve my issue with the Calendar on Outlook2016.</p>
<p>Perhaps we misunderstood each other by my description of what I would like to achieve.</p>
<p>My request is “how to show the appointments schedule in the To-Do Bar same as can be done in Outlook 2010 as shown in my screen shot?”</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae784054-f231-48c4-8193-3b820a34b1c8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae784054-f231-48c4-8193-3b820a34b1c8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Outlook 2010</p>
<p>In Outlook 2010 I can select Calendar and Appointments from the drop down and that allows for the Appointments to show below the Calendar.</p>

<p>Outlook 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2016 the option for Appointments has been excluded. Having looked at your link</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;scopio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried replicating your issue here on our end. We created sample appointments within the next 7 days. Specifically, we created test appointments that will be on Nov. 26 and Nov. 28. Then, we turned on the option for
<strong>To-Do Bar</strong> and selected <strong>Calendar</strong>. Here's the screenshot of the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efbca264-3432-4689-a696-bb55e4fae782?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efbca264-3432-4689-a696-bb55e4fae782?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the schedules or appointments for the next 7 days from Nov. 24 appeared under the
<strong>Date Navigator </strong>on the <strong>To-Do bar</strong>. So, if you have appointments for the next 7 days from a specific date, it should be showing under the&nbsp;<span>Date Navigator.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, since your appointments for the&nbsp;<span>next 7 days are not showing on the To-Do bar, we suggest that you
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-10-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">install the latest updates</a></span></em></strong> for Windows because
<span>up<span>dates often fix problems that occur with software. Also,&nbsp;<span>try&nbsp;</span><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">installing
 updates</a></span></em></strong><span> for your Office, restarting your computer, and then launching Outlook.&nbsp;<span>The instructions are slightly different depending on version of the Office that you are using.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb067982-1e13-48b2-b03b-c4b62bf3afe0?upload=true" /></p>
<p><span>If you continue to experience the same issue after updating Office, we suggest that you start Outlook in Safe Mode because there is a possibility that third party add-ins might be causing this. Safe mode lets you safely use Outlook without encountering
 certain startup programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can open&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026478/outlook-open-outlook-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Outlook in safe mode</strong></a></em></span></span>&nbsp;by
 pressing and holding&nbsp;<strong><span><span>Ctrl&nbsp;</span></span></strong>while you start the program or by using the "<span><em><span><span><strong>/safe</strong></span></span></em></span>" (that is,&nbsp;</span><span><em><span><strong>Outlook.exe /safe</strong></span></em></span><span>)
 option when you start the program from the command line. When you run Outlook in safe mode, it bypasses functionality and settings such as alternative startup location, changed toolbars, and Outlook add-ins. (However, COM add-ins are excluded.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span>: To stop Office Safe Mode</span><span>, exit and restart your Office application.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p><span>If the issue doesn't occur in the Safe Mode as follows, enable your add-ins one at a time until you hit that one that is causing the conflict. Leave that one disabled or uninstall it.&nbsp;</span><span>For more information about enabling and removing add-ins
 in Office, you can check this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d#ID0EAABAAA=Newer_Versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>link</strong></span></span></span></span></em></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 go to the sections:&nbsp;</span><em><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Enable an add-in</strong></span></span></span></span></span></em><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><em><span><span><span><span><span>Permanently disable or remove an add-in</span></span></span></span></span></em></strong><span><span><span><strong>.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here's are the steps on how to disable add-ins one at a time</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><strong>File tab</strong></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><strong>Options</strong></span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>Click&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><strong>Go</strong></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;next to the Manage list at the bottom of the menu.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Uncheck one of the add-ins, and then click&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><strong>OK</strong></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart the application, but do not use Safe mode.</p>

    <title>WM Version 6.5 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nova rayz  say:</h3>
<h2>            WM Version 6.5</h2>
                    Ok, here's my phone: HTC Touch PRO 2, just purchased 12/21/09.&nbsp; My questions:&nbsp; How does the Outlook work on the device?&nbsp; How come when I'm using messenger (Yahoo or MSN) it does not notify when its in STANDBY MODE; meaning it doesn't vibrate, ring, or
 anything.&nbsp; So here's the kicker to my query; ITS SOMETIMEY.&nbsp; Sometimes it vibrates sometime it doesn't.&nbsp; But it never notifies with a ring on standby even when the phone is set to RING.&nbsp;&nbsp; Next question:&nbsp; How do I create a group listing with my phone?&nbsp; It is
 very easily accomplished on other devices but with my HTC Touch Pro 2, no luck.&nbsp; I had to download an application called MOBILE MESSENGER to be able to send a group message, come'on HTC and MICROSOFT lets get with it will ya!?!?!?&nbsp; So my ultimate question
 is will WM Version 6.5 fix anyof these issues?&nbsp; Does anyone have a logical answer for this string?

            Dear Nova Rayz,<br />
<br />
<em>"How does the Outlook work on the device?"<br />
</em>If you have Wi-Fi access or a cellular data subscription you can easily set-up a few e-mail accounts on your Windows Phone. Or you can simply sync your Touch Pro2 with Microsoft Outlook on your laptop or pc. --&gt;

<br />
<em>"How come when I'm using messenger (Yahoo or MSN) it does not notify when its in STANDBY MODE; meaning it doesn't vibrate, ring, or anything"<br />
</em>Did you install the latest version of Windows Live for Windows Phones? I think this is a good first step to start tackling your problem.&nbsp;--&gt;
<a href="http://mobile.microsoft.com/live/En-US/mobile/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mobile.microsoft.com/live/En-US/mobile/default.mspx</a><br />
<br />
<em>"How do I create a group listing with my phone?"</em><br />
Do you mean a distribution list to sent out e-mails or do you mean a distribution list for sending text messages ? For the latter --&gt;

<br />
<em>"So my ultimate question is will WM Version 6.5 fix anyof these issues?"</em><br />
I think this line of reasoning is a little to simple, since 6.5 and 6.1&nbsp;share the same core files, while WM 6.5 is mainly significantly improved on the UI level. So my probably disappointing answer is no, it&nbsp;doesn't solve your problems by definition.&nbsp;However
 I personally think that WM 6.5 can provide you with a different way of interacting with your Windows Phone, in comparison with WM 6.1.<br />

<h2>            Remove the email &#39;mailto&#39; section from an email address</h2>
                    
<p>I am constantly frusttrated by the doubling up of an email address with the 'mailto' addition that the hyperlink always seems to add.&nbsp; Is there a way that I can programmically ensure that when I double-click the link that only the 'normal' email address
 is sent to my Outlook program?&nbsp; Better, still, how do I ensure that only the normal address is displayed on the form/cell?</p>

            I have a similiar question to EricLeonards posted on 1/18/11.&nbsp; I have a hyperlinked email field in a form that I need to use in VBA to generate an email.&nbsp; When I use that field, two email addresses appear in the To line of MS Outlook; the first one (the
 correct one)&nbsp;is the text of the hyperlinked field (ie email address of&nbsp;individual) and the second being the email address of individual preceeded with
mailto:.&nbsp; I want to eliminate the second item&nbsp;being pulled into the To line.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

    <title>E90 and S60 Vs 9500 and S80 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norris---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            E90 and S60 Vs 9500 and S80</h2>
                    I began using my E90 in November, after being a total Communicator fan for 9years. i used my 9500 for 2 years until it totally wore out.<br />
For the first time I feel really "short changed" by Nokia. i got over the initial "get to know you" adjustment and have really thought long and hard. here are the pro's and cons of each.<br />
<br />
E90 pro's: faster HSDPA / UMTS functioning; Really fast database access<br />
Great resolution screen: more software can work on the S60 operating system. Loved the way it fits in my pocket , but screen fonts are extremely tiny. GPS lovely but extremely slow to load position.<br />
E90 Con's<br />
no more fax; clunky keyboard; no more drop down menus=plenty more button-pushes to get to functions. No more scheduling sms's nor timed profile returns. Quick office frustrating when compared to previous accessibility- separate buttons for word processor. Feels
 like an ordinary nokia phone with a big screen.<br />
S60 operating system like stepping from business/first class back to economy class! I missed the wide screen and bigger fonts. Every function misses that unique "something extra" that made a communicator the best PDA smartphone.<br />
no longer miles ahead of the competition; HTC TyTn is equal if not much better at lower cost; iPhone is better in many ways but does not have the keyboard functionality.

            I couldn't agree more. Like you I moved from a 9500 to the E90 and I have just the same impressions. Overall I'm disappointed. I really miss the smooth keyboard and find the auto-case switching on data entry particularly annoying. It's just not needed
 with a full QWERTY keypad. If it wasn't for the addition of 3G and a faster browser I'd switch back but then where would I go when the 9500 finally fell apart?

            I used to work for Nokia..as a product manager..And I would not like to be sitting behind the desk of the E90 product manager.<br />
<br />
That is if the original person still sits there..<br />
<br />
OK..before some body "up there" hops in and corrects me..<br />
I know that "product manager" today, actualy means "product support team"..But..<br />
There was someone who took/takes responsibility..a team leader who reported to..Anssi Vanjoki..and got/gets the kick backs from him when he browsed board like this one. Which he probably now prefer not to do!<br />
<br />
The first problem that the "product team" had was S80 OS was dead...security problems..they had to use S60.3 and it did not offer the same flexibilty/user interface...It is more secure...but..<br />
Old 9500 users will moan.. but they will gets used to it..<br />
We have...now it is second nature. And nobody has had a virus or Malware in an E90.<br />
<br />
Then came the second problem..E90 was to be 3G...and network operators would not support Fax (said they could not)<br />
No Fax ..Nokia pleaded..but to no avail..E90 could not support fax at launch.<br />
The cries of anguish were correctly anticipated..<br />
One of the largest markets for 9500/9300 communicators had been Indonesia. They are old fasion business people....must have paper and signatures...so they must have FAX.<br />
<br />
It had to be a rapid add on, a down load to get around this...<br />
And it is there now...but there were 100 post threads until there was.<br />
If you dont know it..<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4397273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4397273</a><br />
<br />
The most difficult problem for the "product support team" to work with has been what initialy looked to be a wow/gee wiz case design..But has turned out to be a nightmare..<br />
The hinge design, plus the tight tolerence on case closure..needed to switch camera funtionon when case closed..Caused screen to key board scuffing.<br />
Warranty fix needed...But how to fix case design?<br />
Mine is sort of fixed..Harder surface on screen a wee bit more clearence.<br />
<br />
Was that all?..one might well hear the "product manager" praying.<br />
No...<br />
To cap the list of errors..a batch of faulty microphones found their way into E90 production...another warranty fix..<br />
<br />
To be fair...Nokia service centre Helsinki were very quick in fixing mine..But they do know me from the old days.<br />
<br />
I have personalised my E90 to get around it's problems..I actualy love it now..<br />
I have purchased and added 3 rd party SW; some might say... to put in what should have been there.<br />
I fitted a screeen protector..no more scuff marks.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the only reason why we have not seen the E90 replaced with an E90 Mk 2 is that Nokia dare not have another Ef up like the Mk 1...and nobody wants to be "Product Manager!"<br />

<h2>            Blocking Websites</h2>
                    If I want to block a website, I know that the expected route is to go into the security settings and arrange the parental controls/content advisor.&nbsp; I have set up all the sites that I want to block and if someone were to attempt access through the address
 bar then the administrative password window would pop up, which is fine; however, if they Googled the same website and followed a link to it or followed a link anywhere that it's posted then they would still be able to access it.&nbsp; How can I prevent the website
 from being reached through any outlet?

<p>Hi <strong>BrooklynNY</strong>,</p>
<p>You may refer this below provided method to block websites.</p>
<p><strong>How to block websites in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>a. Start the Internet Explorer, go to Tools / Internet Options <br />
b. Go to the tab Content.<br />
c. At the bottom click on Enable to activate the Content Advisor.<br />
d. Next, click on Settings and go the tab, Approved Websites, and add all sites that you want to block.</p>
<p>You can block all sub domains of a website by entering <strong>*.</strong> in front of the domain. So if you want to block all sites of google.com, simply enter<strong>*.google.com</strong></p>
<p>e. Back on the General tab, check the option Users can see websites that have no ratings.<br />
f. Click on Create password to set a password for editing websites and to disable the Content Advisor again.</p>
<p>Another way is to edit the Hosts file and enter the IP address of the website you want to block.</p>

            <p>Hi Just gettn by,</p>
<p>Are these the steps you are following?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> To create a signature in Outlook 2010, click on the Office button on the top left hand corner and this will open the menu. Click the options button at the bottom of this window.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the Outlook Options window, select the mail tab and here you can see signature options available. Click on the Signatures button and this will open up the Signatures and Stationary window.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> In the Signatures and Stationary, add your signature for the email account you want. You can add multiple signatures here and select which one to display.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, click on OK button and you should see the signatures in action.</p>
<p>Please let us know if this helps.</p>

            hi mate, that is the quality of the camera you have paid for at the price point of the Lumia 625. what you are referring to is the graininess and artefacting.<br />
<br />
if you are after a much better imaging experience, i suggest you invest in something at least with the 9xx series of Lumia smartphones. i.e. 920, 925, 1020, 1520.

<p>I assume that you want to do this with VBA code. Is this correct? If&nbsp;so then the following example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngNext As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Worksheets("Sheet1")&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Edit "Sheet1" with your worksheet name<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngNext = .Cells(.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>'You can copy data and paste it to rngNext as if it is a cell reference.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Following line copies and pastes in one line of code.</strong></em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A6:D6").Copy Destination:=rngNext<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If not what you want then require a more detailed explanation.</p>

<p>MatPhillips10,</p>

</p><p>You would need a macro for this.&nbsp; I have written a sample macro using the change event.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you enter a value in cell A1, it will move that value to the next available cell in column A and then sort A2 through that cell.&nbsp;&nbsp; It clears the value in A1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is my interpretation of what you are asking for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the sheet tab and select view code. </p>
<p>
</p><p>paste in this code in the resulting module. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure macros are enabled: </p>

</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
Dim lastrow As Long<br />

&nbsp; lastrow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row<br />
&nbsp; Cells(lastrow + 1, 1).Value = Range("A1")<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Message Encryption - Having troubles with message.html attachment</h2>
                    <p>I sent a customer an encrypted email.&nbsp; The customer was able to open the <strong>
message.html</strong> attachment, but kept on seeing the below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a7ca889-f355-410c-9f89-6f83326822b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a7ca889-f355-410c-9f89-6f83326822b1" /></a></p>
<p>He was using Internet Explorer 10.&nbsp; I told him to try Google Chrome, but it produced the same message.&nbsp; He was saving the file to his desktop, and opening it from his desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to partially recreate the issue by setting my Internet Options--&gt;Security settings for the Internet zone to
<strong>High</strong>.&nbsp; Once it was set to <strong>High</strong>, and loaded a test
<strong>message.html</strong>, it would say the same as above instead of prompting to either Sign in or Use a one-time passcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I figured that out, I told the customer to change his security settings to
<strong>Medium-high</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He replied saying his settings were already <strong>Medium-high</strong>, and he even tried changing it to
<strong>Medium</strong>, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, Google Chrome also doesn't work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What could the issue be?&nbsp; How does the coding in the <strong>message.html</strong> attachment work?&nbsp; Is it supposed to run a script that identifies the browser, and if it's supported, it displays the sign in prompts?&nbsp; What could block this script from running
 properly?&nbsp; I know that, when the Internet zone security in Internet Options is changed to
<strong>High</strong> it blocks the script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <span>Hi Cgzi,<br />
<br />
I also tested in Chrome and IE on my side. When I directly click on the html file in the email, I got the same scenario. After I downloaded the html file to my computer, I can open it prompting to either Sign in or Use a one-time passcode in both IE and Chrome.
<br />
<br />
To open an encrypted email sent out from Office 365, it is not required to run a script. Based on my suggestion, I would suggest you try to clear the cache in IE and Chrome to see if the user can get the correct page. Also please try in the private mode in
 IE or the incognito mode in Chrome.<br />

</p><p>The user <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>is</strong></span> saving the attachment to his desktop, then opening it from there.&nbsp; He sent a screenshot of his IE window with the file open, and the URL bar does lead to his user profile's desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see what I can do about having the user clear his cache.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, I'll tell him to try private browsing mode, but I'd much rather not have the user jump through hoops to get a secure message open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cgzi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could be related to the antivirus software. You can temporarily disable the antivirus software and see if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: When you change your antivirus settings, it may make your PC vulnerable to viral, fraudulent, or malicious attacks. Please be aware of the risks brought by changing antivirus settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, I’d like to confirm the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did the user download the html file from OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) or the Outlook client? If it’s the Outlook client, please try in OWA and see if the issue occurs.</span></li><li><span>Send another encrypted email to the customer. Can you reproduce the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

</p><p>In regards to Chris' question:</p>

<br />this was in my e-mail today
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />This is a running scam that has been going on for a while. The most likely source of your email is from compromised databases from websites that have been compromised at some point (could be years ago so that would explain why the password is not current or one that was automatically generated). This could be something you did years ago.
<br />
<br />What you need to do
<br />
<br />#1 - Make sure that you change your password anywhere that the one included i the email has been used
<br />#2 - Do not use the same password twice especially when involving things like credit/card, banking, PayPal, Amazon, Apple, Netflix sites etc etct
<br />#3 - Ignore any demand for payment
<br />
<br />You can check to see if your email address comes up on a compromised database by checking it on the following website (created by a Microsoft MVP so can definitely be trusted)
<br />
<br />';--have i been pwned?

            Dear roudydog,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users. Recently they invented new way of spoofing your own email address. This is good explained in this (not Microsoft) article <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/beware-sextortionists-spoofing-your-own-email-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/bew...</a> If you received such an email, report it and just in case change your password to more secure <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026406/microsoft-account-how-to-create-a-strong-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402640...</a>
<br />
<br />Additionally there are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails ( I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you ):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a>
<br />
<br />Also read this information about fighting junk emails from Postmaster for Outlook <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still want to contact Microsoft please use this link to call them in your region <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />I understand what is really happening, as a suggestion it would be good to contact a Microsoft expert directly to validate the status of the account.
<br />The same I want to share as denouncing these types of spam emails or identity theft. You can also report phishing by forwarding the email as an attachment to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
<br />
<br />Deal with abuse, phishing, or spoofing in Outlook.com
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3?ui=en-US&amp;rs=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a> en-US &amp; ad = US
<br />
<br />For this I recommend making contact through the online chat where a non-virtual expert will respond.

<p>Hello roudydog, <br />
<br />
We are aware of the new kind of spam that spoofs the sender address to be the same as recipient's and occasionally even includes some provoking personal information about the user like a past password.
<br />
<br />
This is a new kind of phishing attempt as a result of major data breaches over the years by various online services. See:
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/new-email-scam-uses-old-password-fake-porn-threats-webcam-video-bitcoin-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.businessinsider.com/new-email-scam-...</a><br />
<br />
Here are some of the things you can do: <br />
<br />
1. change your passwords <br />
2. manage your trusted devices <br />
3. enable two-step verification <br />
<br />

            I mean I guess it answers my question but it was not of help. Ironically the only thing I have told the box what I want to do is "How do I remove you?" And it failed, therefore I feel it should be removed for been useless.

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure this out :(&nbsp; after hours of trying different things.</p>
<p>I have a search function that works fine for partial matches to a list box criteria but I need it to only return exact matches. It's too hard to explain so I attached the file here via drop box.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r4x5l3ohalbbmcn/TRAINING.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/r4x5l3ohalbbmcn/TRAINING.zip</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The search form is "frmSearch".</p>
<p>If you open this you will see two control buttons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filter to Partial ----This works FINE!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Filter to Exact ----This doesn't work :(</p>
<p>If I select Niger from the list box ----the results show Niger and also Nigeria.</p>
<p>I want to filter to Niger exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Those buttons initiate a return of a recordset based on a query. The query has a WHERE condition that provides the filtering. The problem is that the first one uses an asterisk (e.g.
<strong>*</strong>)&nbsp;as as wildcard so that everything that begins with the variable is returned. You need to duplicate that query and remove the asterisk so that the filter only looks for exact matches. When you have removed the asterisk, save the new query
 and change your&nbsp;<em>Filter to Exact</em> button so it uses that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will look something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&lt;first part of the query&gt;</em> WHERE [fldCountry] LIKE myForm!selCountry &amp; "*"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remove the part that adds the asterisk on the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>&lt;first part of the query&gt;</em> WHERE [fldCountry] LIKE myForm!selCountry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save it as a new query and use that on the <em>Filter to Exact</em> button</p>

            <p>Hi Jeeped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I understand. The event procedure I wrote for the "Filter To Exact Word" button</p>

</p><p>Just to better explain what I am trying to do.</p>
<p>If I select "Niger" for my filter, the results brings up two record rows, one that shows "New York, Niger"</p>

</p><p>That works for me with&nbsp;<em>Niger</em> and <em>Six Sigma</em> selected. The&nbsp;<em>Debug.Print</em> was,</p>
<p>
</p><p>([Course] = "Six Sigma") And ([Countries] LIKE "*Niger")</p>
<p>
</p><p>The prefixing asterisk is necessary as&nbsp;<em>[Countries]</em> is not a regular field but a concatenated field with something before&nbsp;<em>Niger</em>; in this case
<em>New York</em>. If you picked&nbsp;<em>New York</em> in the selection list the asterisk would have to be as a suffix. I think you might be better using the concatenated strings in your selection list so you can go for an exact match.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeeped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used what you recommended:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Criteria = Criteria &amp; "[Countries] LIKE " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Chr(42) &amp; Me.cboCountry.ItemData(i) &amp; Chr(34)</p>
<p>

</p><p>and I was able to match Niger EXACTLY (i.e. Nigeria didn't come up)!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>YAY!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But....unfortunately and it may be me, the search results should have displayed two records that had the word Niger in it but it doesn't. :(((<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that the solution is so close :(((</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded an updated copy of the db on drop box to show what I did:</p>

            <p>The problem is that your WHERE clause is not looking at individual countries but you are only giving it individual countries. The DConcat() function in the query is creating a field of two countries separated by a comma. This field is aliased as [Countries].

</p><p>So if you are going to use a WHERE clause against that field (as you are currently doing) then you have to use an asterisk wild card. There doesn't appear to be any way to make it work. This is close,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">([Course] = "Six Sigma") And ([Countries] LIKE "*Niger" OR [Countries] LIKE "Niger*")<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That works with your data set but only because&nbsp;<em>Nigeria</em> does not appear as the first country in the concatenated
<em>[Countries]</em> strings. This may be closer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>([Course] = "Six Sigma") And ([Countries] LIKE "Niger," OR [Countries] LIKE " Niger")</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems to satisfy most situations but it is kludgy and I can imagine situations where it would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned previously, it would be better to use the WHERE clause against a field that was only single country names. You currently do not have one but you can add one. Nothing says that you have to use every field that you ask for in a SELECT query.
 Many times I will ask for fields that I have no intention of displaying in order that I can use them as criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed&nbsp;<em>Query2</em> by adding an INNER JOIN so I could get a field of single country names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT m.tbl00MainID, m.Course, m.Online, m.Inclass, m.CreditHrs, DConcat("Country","tbl03countryinput","tbl00MainID=" &amp; m.[tbl00MainID]) AS Countries, i.[Country]<br />
&nbsp; FROM tbl00Main AS m<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; INNER JOIN tbl03countryinput i ON i.tbl00MainID = m.tbl00MainID<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I modified the code in Command192 to build the WHERE clause using the new [Country] field, not the [Countries] field previously used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Criteria = Criteria &amp; "[Country] LIKE " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; Me.cboCountry.ItemData(i) &amp; Chr(34)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems to work as expected. Here is a link to my own public DropBox.</p>

            <p>Hi Jeeped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just looked at your solution. Awesome!</p>
<p>I'm puzzled by why you used LIKE instead of the equal= sign? all that I have read shows using the = sign</p>
<p>when trying to do exact filters...I always thought LIKE was only used for wildcard * filters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely would have not figured that I needed to do an inner join but that makes since</p>
<p>to isolate the values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help!!!</p>
<p>I would have been stuck on this for days!</p>

            <p>Hi Jeeped,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the help on the exact match problem!</p>
<p>It seems to work very well...the only thing is that now I am not able to</p>
<p>use the combo box filter. When I filter to the country and then add a course filter...</p>
<p>I get an error message that says "missing ) or ] in expression Course". This error message happens</p>
<p>in your copy of the db as well I noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm puzzled by this because the Course combobox filter <em>had worked without any problems</em></p>
<p><em>before.</em> It was only the Country Listbox filter that I was having a problem with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what's weird is that the code for the Course filter has not changed from when it was working so I'm puzzled why it would be a problem now?&nbsp;
<strong>It seems that I can only use EITHER the country or course filter but </strong>
<strong>not both at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually I filter to the country and then filter further down&nbsp;by&nbsp; the course but I&nbsp;may sometimes filter by course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated! I'm stumped :(</p>
<p>If I undo the changes you suggested to the country filter, the course filter works fine again!
</p>
<p>LOL--- it's weird. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
For an example which allows you to do both you might care to take a look at MultiSelect.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file includes options to 'Filter Report on Multiple values from Fields, combined with AND' or 'Filter Report on Multiple values from Fields, combined with OR'.&nbsp; From your description it sounds like the former is more relevant to your situation.<br />
<br />
The two attributes on which the report can be filtered are Employee and Project and one or more or each is selected in a multi-select list box of a dialogue form.&nbsp; The code to combine the filters with a Boolean AND, i.e. where the employee is one of those selected
 and is assigned to one or more of the selected projects, is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strEmployeeIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strProjectIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCriteria As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstEmployees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEmployeeIDList = strEmployeeIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEmployeeIDList = Mid(strEmployeeIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = " And EmployeeID In(" &amp; strEmployeeIDList &amp; ")"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstProjects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strProjectIDList = strProjectIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strProjectIDList = Mid(strProjectIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = strCriteria &amp; " And EmployeeID IN" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "(SELECT EmployeeID FROM ProjectEmployees " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE ProjectID IN (" &amp; strProjectIDList &amp; "))"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(strCriteria) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading ' and '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = Mid(strCriteria, 6)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptEmployees", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View:=acViewPreview, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhereCondition:=strCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No employee(s) or project(s) selected.", vbExclamation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
Note that the second criterion applies the IN operator to a subquery rather than a simple value list as with the first, as the projects are in a related table.<br />
<br />
The code to combine the filters with a Boolean OR, i.e. where the employee is one of those selected or is assigned to one or more of the selected projects, is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim varItem As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strEmployeeIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strProjectIDList As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strCriteria As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstEmployees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEmployeeIDList = strEmployeeIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strEmployeeIDList = Mid(strEmployeeIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = " Or EmployeeID In(" &amp; strEmployeeIDList &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.lstProjects<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ctrl.ItemsSelected.Count &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each varItem In ctrl.ItemsSelected<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strProjectIDList = strProjectIDList &amp; "," &amp; ctrl.ItemData(varItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next varItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading comma<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strProjectIDList = Mid(strProjectIDList, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = strCriteria &amp; " Or EmployeeID IN" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "(SELECT EmployeeID FROM ProjectEmployees " &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "WHERE ProjectID IN (" &amp; strProjectIDList &amp; "))"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(strCriteria) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove leading ' or '<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = Mid(strCriteria, 5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptEmployees", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View:=acViewPreview, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WhereCondition:=strCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No employee(s) or project(s) selected.", vbExclamation, "Warning"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
i.e. is near-identical but uses the Boolean OR operator whereas the first used the Boolean AND operator when combining the two criteria.<br />
<br />
In each case one or more values can be selected from either or both list boxes, but if no value is selected from either list box the report is not opened, but it would require only a trivial amendment to the code for it to open the report unfiltered if no values
 were elected from either control. <br />
<br />
The above relates only to exact matches of course.&nbsp; A different approach would be needed for pattern matching.&nbsp; In relation to this you might find the following function of interest.&nbsp; This finds actual 'words' in strings, rather than simple substrings, taking
 account of punctuation characters which might terminate (or precede in languages like Spanish) a word:<br />
<br />
Public Function FindWord(varFindIn As Variant, varWord As Variant) As Boolean<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Const PUNCLIST = """' .,?!:;(){}[]/"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim intPos As Integer<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; FindWord = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(varFindIn) And Not IsNull(varWord) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intPos = InStr(varFindIn, varWord)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' loop until no instances of sought substring found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While intPos &gt; 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' is it at start of string<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If intPos = 1 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' is it whole string?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(varFindIn) = Len(varWord) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindWord = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' is it followed by a space or punctuation mark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ElseIf InStr(PUNCLIST, Mid(varFindIn, intPos + Len(varWord), 1)) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindWord = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' is it precedeed by a space or punctuation mark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(PUNCLIST, Mid(varFindIn, intPos - 1, 1)) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' is it at end of string or followed by a space or punctuation mark?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(PUNCLIST, Mid(varFindIn, intPos + Len(varWord), 1)) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindWord = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' remove characters up to end of first instance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' of sought substring before looping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; varFindIn = Mid(varFindIn, intPos + 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intPos = InStr(varFindIn, varWord)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
The following functions call the above to find 'any or 'all' of a list of multiple words passed in as a parameter array:<br />
<br />
Public Function FindAnyWord(varFindIn, ParamArray varWordList() As Variant) As Boolean<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim var As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each var In varWordList<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If FindWord(varFindIn, var) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindAnyWord = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next var<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
End Function<br />
<br />

Ken Sheridan</a>&nbsp;has stepped up to the plate and filled in the gaps I've left so I will leave that for now. As for your related question, I typically use LIKE when dealing with text or NULL. It is the actual wildcard character that dictates whether partials
 are filtered for. I realize that the equals sign can be used fairly interchangably but I reserve that for dates and numbers. To my mind, that just seems the way to do things and it probably comes from my SQL experience. From what I understand of the two methods,&nbsp;<em>equals</em>
 (e.g. =) looks for an exact match while <em>LIKE</em> looks for a pattern match. Since a pattern match is slower than an exact match, I'm probably creating a performance lag where one does not have to be but until I can get an old dog (me) to change, that
 is just the way I do things. FWIW, it does help me sort out long SELECT statements in my own head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's one back at you. Can equals be used when comparing to NULL in Access? I know it fails when used in SQL.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail &#38; Outlook is blocking my Emails</h2>
                    <p>Hello Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a domain and an email address&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** .&nbsp;I use Zoho Email portal to send my emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, whenever I send email to a Hotmail or Outlook address, I get a notification :</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Mail Delivery Status Notification (Delay)</span>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then few days after I receive an email stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span>Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender
</span>&nbsp;and the notification is "<span>ERROR_CODE :451, ERROR_CODE :4.7.500 Server busy. Please try again later from [31.186.226.248]. (AS3114) [CO1NAM03FT058.eop-NAM03.prod.protection.outlook.com]
 .&nbsp;</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what should I do to&nbsp;resolve this issue. I never had this issue before and I had sent many emails to my clients who had Hotmail&nbsp;and Outlook address emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
