            Try following one by one as see after every step whether it resolves the issue-

1. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.

Now open the file and see if the problem disappears or not. 

Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
1. Open Excel
2. ALT+F11
3. If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window
4. Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter
5. You will have your pat

    <title>Office 365 Home 2016 and Office 365 Business Essentials will not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deep thought &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Home 2016 and Office 365 Business Essentials will not coexist</h2>
                    
<p>I'm at home. I have an Office 365 Home subscription. I have Office installed on my personal laptop.&nbsp;I share my installs with my family.</p>
<p>I also have an Office 365 Business Essentials subscription. I use that for my emails. I make use of the OneDrive for Business it comes with. I also use Skype for Business; a far superior messaging client to the woeful civilian Skype app; it doesn't come
 anywhere close to what Messenger used to be long, long ago!</p>
<p>So I'm screwed. I try to upgrade to Office 2016 from my Home account and it spots OneDrive and Skype for Business installed on my laptop and says they need to be removed for Office 2016 to be installed and that they will not be able to be reinstalled afterwards!</p>
<p>I can't install Office 2016 from my Business Essentials account because that doesn't provide Office, 'just' Exchange, OneDrive for Business and Skype for Business.</p>
<p>Microsoft happily advertises itself as providing services which cross the boundaries of work and personal, centred on the user as worker and lifestyle-pilot, whilst at the same time prohibiting the mix of business and personal software on a customer's own
 device!</p>
<p>Does someone inside M$&nbsp;need a slap for this?</p>
<p>Why let us combine business and personal account identities under one logon account if you're not going to let us use our own software in whatever combination we wish?</p>
<p>So, when will customers be able to have their personal and business products working on the same machine without having to resort to multiple accounts or some other ridiculous identity&nbsp;jiggery-pokery?
</p>
<p>Or, has M$ decided that devices are either for business, or personal use, but not both?</p>

<p>Hi Deep-Thought,</p>
<p>From your description, the issue might be related to the incompatible between the Office 2016 and the Office 2013 version of Skype for Business. In this situation, could you try the skype for business 2016 in the following links to see if there is any improvement?</p>

<p>Hello People,</p>
<p>Where can I find a OneDrive for Business (Windows 10) client which works with Office 365 Home 2016?</p>
<p>'Upgrading' to Office 2016 forced the uninstallation of Skype for Business and OneDrive for Business!</p>
<p>Skype for Business reinstalled from my Office 365 Business Essentials software admin webpage as Skype for Business 2016 and seems ok.</p>
<p>If I try to do the same for OneDrive for Business I get a message saying that newer versions of Office software have been detected (Skype for Business Basic and Office 2016) and need to be uninstalled before OneDrive for Business can be installed.</p>
<p>I am stuck without a Windows 10 desktop client for OneDrive for Business :( &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody know of a fix for this? Doing everything via a browser is a pain in the ***!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Glyn.</p>

    <title>wifi drivers on Windows 10 Technical Preview 64 bit version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john88mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            wifi drivers on Windows 10 Technical Preview 64 bit version</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 Technical Preview 64 bit English. I was using a system with a TP-Link usb wifi adapter TL-WN721N.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 saw the device and recognized it as a usb 2.0 WLAN adapter, but could not use it, and I could not connect to the internet. I tried to install an old driver (support up to Windows 7) but it refused to install. I set up a wired Ethernet connection
 to the internet and searched for the drivers online. TP-Link did not have Windows 10 drivers (obviously it is so new and preview only). But, the updated Windows 8 driver did install, and it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are having wifi driver problems, maybe try Win 8 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, as future releases of Windows 10 (preview) come out, there will be more drivers included.</p>
<p>

            If you are having trouble with TP-link drivers working with windows 10 make sure you have the right version number for your adapter. I know it sounds silly but I just spent the last few hours installing, uninstalling and reinstalling all different windows
 versions of the drivers only to realize that I was using the wrong version number for the adapter (version 4 when I had version 3). Also windows 8 seems to be more compatible than 8.1. Hope this helps someone.~

            <p>your taking part in an insider program, for testing purposes insider build will reset some elements. if you dont want that, stop the insider program and stick with the normal build that will keep/move all your settings and programs with every big release.

</p><p>tip: if you want a clean w10 install via a normal iso, so you can wipe the disk and partition, download the techbench, make your usb poort the first bootable option, disable secureboot and TPM in your efibios to boot in CSM mode, or add the usbdrive efi\microsoft\boot\cdboot.efi

            <p>First of all, <strong>thanks for the repair process</strong>. It worked after several hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a sequence of repairs I don't want to go through again. It took the last step before the repair was completed. (tried installing after each step but failed each time with same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth did the final repair. (<strong><em>this is a long process</em></strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this did not work, the instructions were to use a DVD to fix Windows Update.</p>
<p>We do not have the iso or DVD available to us yet! (:((</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone in Support like to have a copy of&nbsp; my CBS..log file?</p>

            That is normal. Lumia DS phones are dual-standby not dual-active. You can configure Smart Dual SIM so the call will divert to SIM 1 via call waiting. &nbsp;settings &gt; network+ &gt; Set.

    <title>Equation editor causing errors when Track Changes enabled - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Equation editor causing errors when Track Changes enabled</h2>
                    I'm having this issue come up in Word H&amp;S 2010. My current document has track changes enabled, during which I have added 30 or so equations to the document using the equation editor. However, when I attempt to save the document in .docx format, it will
 create a 0kb file with the filename that I specified, and then open the save file dialog again, prompting me to save it in .doc format. The equations are then saved as images in the 2003-2007 file format. I can convert the document back to the new format in
 the editor, but I still cannot save it as a .docx.<br />
<br />
Selecting "Accept all changes" and turning Track Changes off resolves the issue. I don't have the office SP1 installed so I don't know if this is an outdated bug report. I'm just wondering if there was a better workaround or fix for this.<br />

<div><br />
<div>i'm using office for mac 2008 (version 12.3.1) but have always had this excel file on .xls format. &nbsp;tried changing to .xml and .xlsx but still won't open. &nbsp;As far as i remember, my Excel did not crash today or yesterday.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any chance this file can be recovered? &nbsp;it's very important (and yet no backup!).</div>
<div><br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you still need an answer to this question, but here goes...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You say that you can not open the file, yet you say you changed the file to .xml and .xlsx. It is impossible to change the format unless you can open the file and use File &gt; Save As within Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Manually changing the file extensions in Finder will result in the error message you received.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If this had happened to me, I would have restarted my Mac and then try again to open the recently saved file. If the file did not open, I would have used Time Machine to restore the next most recent version of the file.</p>

            <p>Queries can refer to a control on an open&nbsp;form by using syntax like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forms![name of form]![name of control]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So use that kind of reference any time you want the value of the combo box in your query/subquery.</p>

            <p>Your question indicates a denormalized structure where normalization would solve your problem. If you have a separate table with Customer information (which is what I think you mean by an unbound dbx), that table should have a primary key value that identifies
 the customer record. That value should be stored as a foreign key in your main table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your form can then display the customer info in a variety of ways (see my blog on Displaying Data from Related tables). You should NOT be storing customer name or any other info about a customer in your data table other than the ID as a foreign key. That
 is a basic principle of relational databases. So, if any info about the customer changes in the customer table, that info is automatically reflected on the form because it gets that data from the customer table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I've misunderstood your question please try and clarify.</p>

            I am continuing to experience problems with sending emails from Outlook.com. When I try to send/reply, 'Sending' scrolls and never delivers. Then, I receive a banner that states that 'Outlook has been updated' and to refresh and/or close my browser to
 reopen. Same thing happens. I've used the above link and it states that Outlook and all other programs are running successfully. I've tried all solutions, even updates.

            <span>Thanks, Johan! It seems to currently be happening in Google Chrome, the browser that I most commonly use. I just tried in Firefox and from my Android phone and no problem at all. I've optimized and have the current version of Google Chrome
 as well. I had initially cleaned up the browser history, etc. Though I love using Google Chrome for this, I think that I will use Firefox now. I even had to reply to you here via Firefox because in Google Chrome, it would not allow me to send/reply.
<br />
<br />
Thanks again! <br />

<p>I miss the the Math Addin that 2013 had. &nbsp;Like 2016 and 365 it would write equations but it would also&nbsp;<em>solve</em> the equations and graph results. &nbsp;Is this coming to 2016 and 365? &nbsp;It seems like a pretty big backwards move not to have this.</p>

<p>If it's true is could also mean that a 535 will be excluded in the insider program.</p>

<h2>            can not sync to computer using WMDC.</h2>
                    I am using a Palm Treo 750 and I am using Vista on my computer and therefore using Windows Mobile Device Center. I have Microsoft Outlook installed.&nbsp; When I try to complete a sync, the computer informs me that my sync was successful but there are no contacts
 transfered over to Outlook!&nbsp; I set up a "test" contact in Outlook and synced again, still no contacts from my phone in Outlook but the test contact had been transferred onto my phone!&nbsp; How do I get the contacts onto my computer?&nbsp; I need to transfer the contacts
 so I can perform a hard reset to hopefully fix another issue I am having with picture messages.&nbsp; I'm hoping to avois having to uninstall &amp; reinstall all the programs!&nbsp; Any suggestions will be gratefully received!<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Hello. Do you have access to the sync options in WMDC or your device, or are they greyed out? If you can uncheck them, go ahead and uncheck "contacts". Try a sync. Then recheck "contacts". Before you do this, please download and install this free program
 PIMBackup. I don't want to be responsible for losing anyone's contact/calendar info. LOL. Always good to back them up to storage card&nbsp;before you start troubleshooting as you never know what can happen. From what you say, it may be worth the hard reset on your
 device. With the&nbsp;backup, you shouldn't have to worry.&nbsp;I suppose it could be a firewall problem blocking incoming from the device&nbsp;and you might try disabling AV/firewall. There are specific ports that need to be open.</p>

            <p>When you first choose to insert a page using the Web Viewer app, it creates a blank frame in the center of the slide. Each corner of this frame has a white square that you can click and drag to change the size of the frame. You can also click on the frame
 edge to activate it after inserting the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Increase the frame to the size of the slide and the web page will enlarge with it.</p>

            <span>Hi, <br />
<br />
Provide more information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) Which edition Office are you downloading?<br />
<br />
2) Did you click on <b>Install now</b> in the <b>My Account</b> section from the following link and trying to download and install the Office suite?<br />
<a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />
3)When did you receive the prompt (include all the steps)?<br />
<br />
Check in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features whether Office suite is listed. If Office downloading is not completed, restarting the computer may prompt to re-download the installer.<br />
<br />
You may also check the section 'How do I install Office 365 Home Premium or Office 365 University?' from the following FAQ for information regarding downloading and installing Office:<br />

<h2>            office &#40;excel 2016&#41; window location</h2>
                    <p>running windows 10, office 365, dual monitor setup, 2 different resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use excel and word a lot, and I wanted to change my second monitors location and orientation.&nbsp; using the display settings option on my windows desktop, I matched the layout to what I wanted, but now when I open an excel document it moves the window location
 to where it was, but it is now off screen.&nbsp; the positioning seems to be based off of the location of the (0,0) pixel on the primary monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the move function (windows key + space, move, arrow keys to get to the right spot) but doing this every time is unacceptable.&nbsp; there has to be something somewhere that excel uses to reference window position, so how do I change / reset
 it so I can use my new monitor layout?</p>

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
We need to isolate this issue to verify if this has something to do with opening Excel documents, or how your Windows monitors are set up. Are you trying to open and display Excel documents to another monitor screen? Also, were you able to open Excel documents
 normally using Excel 2016?

            using Excel 2016 over a period of time, the sheet I use regularly to keep track of information opens with the exact same position and size every time, regardless of where I close it if I don't have it open for long.&nbsp; I have not played around with leaving
 the sheet open for a period of time to see if that matters.&nbsp; even if I move the sheet to another position or monitor, when I re-open it, it goes back to the original position and size.&nbsp; I typically have the sheet open on my second monitor, and this monitor
 is larger, but of lower resolution.&nbsp; when I use windows to change my monitor positions, the Excel sheet, using Excel 2016, opens in the same position, but it is now off my screen, or half off screen, in an unusable position.

            Thank you for the information. Are you getting the same concern if you open Word documents, or PowerPoint presentation? This will help us to validate if this only happens when opening Excel documents or not.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

            lets assume that it is an office issue, because I am running the latest updates, and I have scanned my files for problems.&nbsp; I don't have any other applications that do this outside office

            For us to get a better picture of this concern, can you provide us a screenshot of this issue when trying to open an Excel file? This will help us to identify if this was an issue with the Excel itself or not.<br />
<br />
We would appreciate if you will provide us the information we requested.

<p>Yes as long as you get the EXACT SAME DEVICE, you restoration should work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would consider using Spb Backup or SPRITE Backup</p>

<h2>            Name of formatting symbol for shift&#43;enter</h2>
                    What is the name for this curved arrow formatting symbol that displays when Shift + Enter is used? Is it correct to refer to Shift + Enter as a soft return?

            The <b>symbol </b>has the Unicode name "Downwards Arrow With Corner Leftwards"&nbsp; &lt;whew!&gt; and the character code 21B5 (hex). As far as I know, nobody refers to it that way.<br />
<br />
The <b>function </b>in Word represented by that symbol is the "manual line break". I think the only place in the program where you'll see that name is on the Special popup in the Find and Replace dialog.
<br />
<br />
Word has never used the "soft" and "hard" terminology, probably because WordPerfect did use it. (MS used to consider WP its mortal enemy.)<br />
