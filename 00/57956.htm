<h2>            Skype cancelled my subscription</h2>
                    <p>I got an email today from Skype saying that my subscription has been cancelled and will not be renewed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

Your subscription has been successfully cancelled
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<div>We are sorry to hear that you will no longer be using our subscription service. We hope you enjoyed using it.<br />
<br />
Your subscription XXXXXX Unlimited mins to landlines 12 months will terminate at the end of the current billing period, which is on XXXXX.<br />
<br />
Possible reasons why your subscription will be cancelled are:<br />
1. You cancelled the subscription yourself.<br />
2. You are using PayPal for your subscription payments, and either the credit card linked with your PayPal account is no longer valid (for example, it has expired), or you have cancelled your billing agreement with Skype on the PayPal website.<br />
No further payments for the service will be charged until you pay for a new order.</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>I have done nothing of the sort. &nbsp;It turns out that Skype no longer offers this subscription so they have cancelled it. &nbsp;In order to now keep similar services I will have to use a different subscription which is 550% more than what I was paying for before.
 &nbsp;The online chat service explained all of this to me but said there is nothing they can do about it. &nbsp;So how do you actually deal with this?</p>

<p>If you have been notified that you are receiving a refund for a cancelled subscription, this may be due because of a recent subscription change that went into effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had sent out email notifications to all affected customers in November 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certain bundled subscriptions are no longer available and those have been cancelled automatically.&nbsp; The subscriptions impacted are those that did expire between December 15, 2017 and March 15, 2018. A refund will be issued for the last successful payment
 received and returned to the payment instrument used to purchase. If you would like to continue using those services you can purchase a new subscription.<br />

<p>It is possible that I received an email in November 2017 although I do not remember this and cannot find it in my email. &nbsp;Also why does your cancellation email state that I cancelled the subscription when clearly this is incorrect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My subscription was supposed to expire in May 2018 so I falls outside the range that you specify. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have received an email saying a refund will be received but again, my subscription was supposed to run until the end of May so it was cancelled early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you are correct I can now utilise the two products separately but instead of costing me approximately EUR35 a year it is now going to cost me approximately EUR230.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you can explain why Skype feels the need to make such a massive increase in pricing in a market where the costs of calls is dropping.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a14fcaef-36cd-4afb-a71a-f4667d4e6161" title="Anthony216">Anthony216,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like you pointed out, many of these subscription rates have not been reviewed in a long time and that gap has necessitated their discontinuation. Majority of the price increase is beyond our control and we continue to provide the lowest rates to global
 destinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure you will find a new subscription that meets with your need.</p>

<p>available to answer your questions, no telephone number to contact no email to communicate. I feel</p>

<p>To be fair, they have replied on a timely manner. &nbsp;The problem is that their reply basically says that we have increased our prices by 550% so good luck with that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype used to be a professional outfit that was great for business. &nbsp;Then they upgraded the interface - and everyone hated it. &nbsp;Now they are making it more expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet one more reason to move away from Skype</p>

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows8- Now my built in microphone does not work. How can I Fix this&#63;</h2>
                    It is an older Toshiba Satellite P300 Notebook with built in Microphone and Webcam. The Microsoft Voice playback does not recognize the microphone and neither does Skype-although I can get the webcam to work just fine. I have searched for possible drivers
 to fix the problem but unfortunately toshiba does not offer any for this specific model with Windows 8 OS. Thank you in advance for your time in helping resolve this issue.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, you are facing issues with the built-in microphone after upgrading to Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Run Audio troubleshooters</b></p>
<p>Windows 8 has a built in Audio troubleshooter that can detect and fix errors with playing audio. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter and check. Refer
 these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key +X</b>, select
<b>Control Panel</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.</span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to
<b>Large icons</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>
</span></span></span>Click on <b>troubleshooting</b> and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.</span></span>Run the
<b>“Playing Audio”</b> and <b>“Recording Audio”</b> troubleshooters respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Install audio drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode </b></p>
<p>You have mentioned that you have the updated drivers installed. To check if the issue is caused to incompatibility, I would suggest you to download Windows 7 audio
 driver from the manufacturer’s website and run in compatibility mode and check. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + X</b>, select
<b>Device Manager</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.</span></span>Locate your audio device,
<b>right click</b> and select <b>properties</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>
</span></span></span>Under <b>driver</b> tab, click on
<b>uninstall driver</b> and restart the computer to check if it works with the default Windows drivers.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.</span></span>If it doesn’t work, then
<b>right click</b> the Windows 7 driver installation file and select <b>
Properties</b> then tap or click the <b>Compatibility</b> tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.</span></span>Place a check in the
<b>Run this program in compatibility mode</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Tap or click the drop down box and select
<b>Windows 7</b>, then tap or click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>
</span></span></span>Try installing the driver and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with more information about the issue, so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to apologize for the late reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try resetting Windows Store Cache and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to reset Windows Store Cache:</p>
<p>a. Press/tap <strong>Windows </strong>Key +<strong> R</strong> key, you will get the
<strong>Run </strong>window.</p>
<p>b. Type "<strong>WSReset.exe</strong>" in the Run window and press/tap <strong>
Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If resetting Windows Store did not help, then it would be better to report an app to Microsoft using the Microsoft Help article that I have provided in my first response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to visit our website for any help with Windows Operating System.</p>

            I have exactly the same problem. Also Surface Pro / 8.1.<br />
<br />
It persists after the WSreset recommended above.<br />
<br />
I am in Windows Store using the "Report app ..." page, as recommended in the Help article cited above.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please fix asap -- it is really not good to have no communication channel about apps in clear violation of terms of use.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

            May 2015 and the "Report an app feature is not working for me either. Same symptoms as above.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what sort of response this is from the support engineer:<br />
"<em>If resetting Windows Store did not help, then it would be better to report an app to Microsoft using the Microsoft Help article that I have provided in my first response.</em>"
<p>There is no way to report an app to Microsoft at either of those links unless I'm going blind and senile in my old age!</p>
<p>This just seems like a total disregard for the problem to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone ever used it successfully?</p>
<p>There should at least be an alternative way to report an app if getting this feature to work is too hard.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Einar,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting and check if this helps. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to go to Control Panel - Programs and Features - Turn Windows features on and off and uncheck on the box .NET Framework. Now check for the Windows update.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>updates</strong> on the Windows search bar and select
<strong>Check for updates.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On Wind<strong>ows update </strong>click on <strong>check for Updates
</strong>button.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Keep posting us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            When I click on the link in Method 1 the page never finishes loading. Method 2 also didn't work. For some reason it never tried to install version 4 of the .net framework, only 2 and 3.

<h2>            trying to load program gives error &#34;Component Comdlg32.ocx is missing&#34;</h2>
                    <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Missing Component</span><br />
<br />
The CD appears to load okay but when you ask it to run it pops up with the message "Component Comdlg32.ocx is missing". The programme ran okaywith Windows XP and runs okay on another Windows 7 computer ? Where can I find this missing component and install it
 on to my PC ?

            <p>I am not Computer Literate in that I can use one but no nothing technical, I don't even know how to 'Unzip' a folder ! I have just purchased a new Laptop running Windows 7 (64 Bit) ?. I was previously using Windows XP. I have reloaded some software e.g.
 MS Autoroute 2007 without any problems. I then loaded ACSI Campsite Europe 2009 and the software appeared to load okay. However when I went to run it the message "Component 'Comdlg32.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing
 or invalid. The weird thing is that my wife bought a new laptop running Windows 7 (x64) only a few months ago and the ACSI software runs fine on her computer ?</p>
<p>I have found some information on the Internet about downloading the 'comdlg32.zip' file but don't really have a clue what I need to do once I have it ? It is telling me to Unzip the file ? then tells me to move it to a system folder ? then it tells me that
 if I am running on a 64Bit Win 7 to run a command "regsvr32 c:\windows\SysWOW64\comdlg32.ocx" ?</p>
<p>Do I need to find someone technical because this really is rocket science to me, sorry !!</p>

<p>Hey there Randall1979<br />
<br />
If you believe that you have been Dos or DDos attacked, then I recommend that you reset your Internet router and contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you know who initiated the DoS or DDoS attack, you may also want to submit a player review to Xbox
 LIVE and avoid the attacker in the future. If you want to report this user, then you can also do so by following the steps below. Sadly Xbox themselves will not be able to do anymore than that, as this is ran through your Internet, and not through the Xbox
 LIVE Servers, otherwise they would be able to do something. <br />
<br />
<strong>- Submiting a Player Review -</strong> <br />
1) Go onto the user's profile. <br />
2) Go to 'Submit Player Review'<br />
3) Select avoid, and then choose which best suits your problem.<br />
----- <span>This will stop you from finding this user in another game.</span> -----<br />
<br />
<strong>- Reporting a Player -</strong> <br />
1) Go onto the user's profile. <br />
2) Go to 'File Complaint'<br />
3) Choose the options that best fits the problem.<br />
----- <span>This will report the user to the Policy Enforcement Team (PET)</span> -----<br />
<br />
Also as a reminder, please refrain from <strong>Naming and Shaming</strong> on the forums, as it is against the forum rules. Thank you.
<br />
<br />

<p>Hey guys, I think I hold the record of getting kicked offline myself, but now I do not have that problem. Chances are your ISP gives you a dynamic IP address, so in most cases the advice in the following youtube video I made could most likely be of some
 assistance.</p>

            <p>100% absolutely agree. Never use a cleaner.&nbsp; The size of the registry doesn't matter or slow down your computer.&nbsp; It's just a list of variables for applications to reference when they need information.&nbsp; They reference the exact value they want to know: it
 doesn't matter if there's a billion or trillion other entries, it doesn't slow down your computer at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But trying to "clean it", now that will be the fastest way to destroy your computer.</p>

    <title>search one folder deep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niborjus  say:</h3>
<h2>            search one folder deep</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know if there is a way to search a specific number of folders deep for files or folders. Search with Windows search would be best, but a command line interface (PowerShell?) would also work.</p>
<p>Scenario: someone says they are missing a folder from a file server's share. The share is huge containing many subfolders and each of those has many subfolders. One guess is that someone accidentally dragged and dropped the file in an adjacent subfolder.
 If I could search for the missing folder, but only one layer deep (for example), I could quickly discover whether it is there or not. Because of the huge size of the share, if I do a normal search with subfolders, it will take hours.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A solution that would work on any one of Windows 7, Server 2008 R2, Server 2003 would be fine. Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 version 1709 high memory usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincelionheart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 version 1709 high memory usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, now I know that this type of question had been asked a few times, but I really am clueless and lost as of now. So it goes like this, I was using a version 1607 of Windows 10 before, and the Windows update manager app came up on my laptop,
 informing me that it is updating my laptop to the latest build which is 1709. So I let the update happened which is two weeks ago, and I must say ever since I upgraded to the latest version, I am having a spike on CPU and memory usage out of nowhere mostly
 when I am watching videos or browsing the net. At first it was all normal, after a period of time where I would just sit and browse casually or even watch videos from YouTube or streaming, the memory usage mostly, jumped high and it makes my laptop unresponsive
 and slow to carry out tasks, even to open the task manager. I closed the browser, which depends on either Edge or Chrome to check whether it dropped, but sadly only little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I closed all other apps and such and memory was still aroubd 75% and above. It was around 95% with any of the browsers being used. I checked my laptop for any unwanted software, processes or even malwares and have got them removed. I ran a full scan
 more than three times using Windows Defender, AdwCleaner, Malwarebytes and Rogue Killer and there was none of threats or malicious files found after the cleanup. I even try reverting to previous version that is 1607 which runs smoothly conpared to the 1709.
 I reverted my Windows version three times which also means I updated to 1709 three times too, and now I am on the fourth try or time I updated to 1709. I really don't want to revert again as I love the new Edge features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and also I tried the methods posted on webs about superfetch, clear page files at shutdown, some registery change, update drivers etc etc and all those but no joy. Anyone can lend me a hand, I would really appreciate that</p>

            No, please do not delete this thread.&nbsp; This is an issue with 1709 that needs to be addressed I think.&nbsp; I am having the same issue on 2 different computers, laptop and desk top.&nbsp; Very high memory use no matter what browser is being used.&nbsp; I have tried edge,
 firefox, safari, chrome even opera and still get high memory usage with all of them on both computers.&nbsp; Build 1607 did not do this.<br />

<p>Windows 10 has been known to cause failure in older hard drives.</p>
<p>And by older two years or more is meant.</p>
<p>This is because of technical progress featuring new and improved programs.</p>
<p>You can try making certain that all your drivers are up to date by visiting the manufacturers' websites and checking for updated BIOS drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also open your Windows Administrative Folder and run the Memory Diagnostic Tool.</p>

<p>Alright I just thought I should informed what was consuming my memory on 1709 too. So, upon startup and about 10 minutes of normal usage, nothing odd happened, but if I leave the laptop idle for sometime, the memory would jump to 90% and under task manager
 resource monitor, the first process that is consuming has about 8,415,096 number value under the commit tab, the process is svchost.exe (smphost). The next process is MsMpEng.exe with 383,516 value under commit tab and third is Microsoft Edge itself with around
 278,340 under commit tab. Even if I close Edge, the other two process would still stay at high commit value hence making my laptop slow. Note that these issues do not happen while I was on version 1607.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this memory consumage proceeds everytime on daily basis hence why I said it was impossible for me to use my laptop efficiently. On version 1607 I even tried opening about 10+ tabs on Chrome and Edge respectively and my nemory usage is just around 60%
 with all the tabs and such. On 1709, it took a single tab of Edge or Chrome to consume a high amount of resources. Note that as I mentioned before, I have more than double check for adware, malware and the likes and I even updated drivers using DriverTalent
 and the problem still occurs.</p>

<p><span>svchost.exe high usage is being experienced by many since the FCU.&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/abnormally-high-cpu-usage-from-svchostexe-solved/eb38d25d-6bb2-47cd-80f2-5389c62337be">There
 is an answer to that issue here</a></span></p>
<p><span>Yes, that answer relates to Windows 7 but it should work for Windows 10, as well.</span></p>
<p><span>MsMpEng.exe is Windows Defender.&nbsp; Although YOU may not be running a scan Defender probably is. It now comes with "Real Time Protection" which means it is checking everything that is coming at your device.</span></p>
<p><span>You might try following the advice of Carol U&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_defender-protect_start/msmpeng-high-cpu-usage-windows-defender-settings/05249c44-7fe1-4080-b715-efc18a5816de">that

<h2>            Skype name to give interviewer</h2>
                    I am new to using Skype use outside of business. I set up a new Skype account, but when I did it, I used my email address so that I could differentiate accounts. I no longer use the business Skype account, and I don't know what "Skype name" for the new
 account to use with an interviewer. Is it my profile name, my email address, or my display name? I don't want to give the wrong info to the interviewer.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f5d2fd7b-98d6-4641-b4b9-55c75caeaa87" title="JulieHammond1">
<p>
</p><p>A Skype Name is the unique username that users created when they first joined Skype. If you created your account using an email address then what you have is a
<strong>Microsoft account</strong>, not a Skype Name. See this link for additional details.
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?q=skype+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What's my Skype Name?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we no longer offer the option to create a custom Skype Name when Skype migrated to Microsoft. As the account creation process has been shortened, users will only have the option to create an account using either a phone number or an email address.
 These types of account still do have a Skype username as a unique identifier, however they are
<strong>system-generated</strong>. The username will show as <strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong> for email address-created accounts while it will show as
<strong>live:randomalphanumericcharacters </strong>for accounts created using a phone number.
</p>
<p>You can locate the username by also following the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to <strong>My Account </strong>on the Skype website. </li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Account details</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Purchase history.</strong> </li><li>Your username will show on the right side of the webpage beside <strong>Sign out</strong>.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            &#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; Lets Be Postive For A Change &#43;&#43;&#43;&#43;</h2>
                    
<p>I often visit the BF forums to find&nbsp; lots of posts from players bring up issues regarding multiplayer. Things like hardcore team killing, whole team of bush wookies being spawn trapped etc................................................. However despite
 these issues, millions of players still&nbsp;logon to the serves every day. <br />
<br />
So I wanted to&nbsp;make a postive post regarding what makes this game great in your own personal&nbsp;opinion,&nbsp;what do you look forward to when you load the game?<br />
<br />
For me its the random moments that happen during a match with no matter how much&nbsp;you try, can never be expiranced&nbsp;in the same way again, also not knowing what type of match your going to play and what kit your going to depend on to help your team secure the
 win. I love the moments when there is only 10 tickets left, 1 objective and seems like the match is over, when all of a suddenthe whole team comes together and caps the objective and then pushes on to get the win.<br />
<br />
What makes the game great in your eyes, what is it that&nbsp;keeps you playing ? ? ? ?<br />
<br />

<p>^^ I know this. But I'm trying to get people to share there views on why this game is so&nbsp;great. Just enjoy the game for what it is. Have fun and share your experiences.<br />
<br />
Think about it like this. Someone thinks I want to get into Battlefield, so they check out the forums and find loads of people complaining. Which might put them off buying one of the best FPS's on the market at the moment.
<br />

This game doesn't&nbsp; always get the credit it deserves.</p>

</p><p>It was a refurbished HP desktop computer I purchased from Wal-Mart after Christmas sales for $89. Now I'm not able to use it because of no Internet connection internally. I have it hooked to a device that is also connected to my other computer, so they run
 together on the same computer Internet service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sitting like a duck not knowing what to do to put in information needed to restore. It did not come with a disc either, so I could just reinstall Windows 7. Please tell me what my options are?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer was working fine yesterday April 2, 2016. I had my technician from COMODO working on it to clear up a big bright red scream that said deceptive websites ahead. It was a link that appeared each time I surfed on a traffic exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is something you can help me do. Please call me as well if you can.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            My product key no longer works when trying to install Windows 7.</h2>
                    I purchased a copy of Windows 7 Student Upgrade. After downloading and installing, I activated my copy of Windows. The hardware I was using it on wasn't working well under Windows 7 (although the upgrade adviser said it would be ok). As a result I have
 wiped the PC that I installed it on, and tried to install it on a different PC I own. When I enter the Product Key, it tells me it's invalid. I believe this is because the activation has "tied" it to the PC i originally installed it on. Is there any way to
 undo this? I have now formatted and reinstalled XP on the original PC, and have a version of Windows 7 that I cannot install or use.

    <title>Adobe&#39;s Bonjour service seems to be the cause of my connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tajs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe&#39;s Bonjour service seems to be the cause of my connection problems</h2>
                    After ?upgrading? to Win7 Home Premium from Vista HP I too lost my internet connection while the network remained active. After fiddling around with modem, router, adapter, and various Win7 features I managed to finally reliably restore my internet connection
 by disabling my onboard (nVidia NF4Ultra) ethernet adaptor and then re-enabling it. However, after rebooting I would again lose the connection. Thanks to folks on this forum, the Adobe Bonjour service was mentioned as a possible culprit. I went into Task Manager
 and found the service under a numeric name (right clicked for "properties" to confirm) and disabled the service.<br />
<br />
After considerable testing (1 cold reboot &amp; 1 warm reboot), my internet connection has come up active.<br />
<br />
I have not experienced the fluctuations in transfer speeds but I've only had Win7 up for about 20 hours so far.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the implications of stopping the "Bonjour" servie is yet but I'll take internet functionality for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone for their quest to solve this issue. Good luck to those still searching.

<div>I suggest you uninstall that pesky Bonjour via Control Panel. Most people </div>
<div>have no use for it, but it gets installed (whether you want it or not) with </div>
<div>iTunes.&nbsp; You may have to repeat the process each time iTunes gets updated.</div>

<h2>            Sending text messages via Skype to Falkland Island mobile numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems impossible to add Falkland Islands telephone numbers (and thus send text messages via Skype) to Skype contacts as Skype requires there to be six digits in the telephone number. However, Falkland Island mobile (and landlines) only have five digits.
 &nbsp;Can this be changed?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Skype application, Falkland Islands' landline and mobiles numbers&nbsp;can be contacted through Skype even if it only has 5 digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can send an SMS text message to almost any number, as long as it's text-enabled. Most mobiles and some landlines can receive SMS text messages. Please refer to these support pages for the steps on how to send an SMS:

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The New Skype version for mobiles and tablets do not support this feature yet.</p>

<h3> richard kropf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech Webcam 110 software installs but fails to activate camera</h2>
                    <p>Software for Logitech c110 webcam appears to load OK with Windows 7 OS (light on camera turns on) but when step 4 in the installation</p>
<p>process is performed (to test camera) the light goes out and the camera fails to capture any picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is true whether I use either the quickload or full versions (recommended by Logitech if the quickload version doesn't work) of the software.</p>
<p>Have also tried the "clean" reload tactic several times. Still the same negative results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried the same camera on my old laptop that has Windows XP and it appears to work fine.</p>
<p>So I tried&nbsp;using the Windows 7 feature&nbsp;to operate the program in the Windows XP mode (service Packs 2 &amp; 3) and still the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;uninstalled Skype to make sure that wasn't the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone there have a solution?</p>

            <p><span>Hi<b> Richard,</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the device detected in device manager?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the links and steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If the webcam device is detected in Device manager, then follow the below step:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let`s uninstall the webcam from the device manager and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Open Device Manager by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, clicking <b>
Control Panel</b>, clicking <b>System and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking <b>Device Manager</b>.</span><span>‌</span><span> If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Look for the <b>USB (Universal Serial Bus controllers) or other devices</b> and expand it. Now, right click on it and select Uninstall. When prompted for confirmation check the box which says “Delete the driver software for this device” and click
 OK.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Restart the computer. Windows will now try to find the latest drivers for the device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the below mentioned links for additional help:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure you have the latest Windows Updates installed. Check for the optional updates as it may have the required drivers.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Install <span>Windows</span> updates in <span>Windows 7:</span></span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Also uninstall webcam driver and install it in the compatibility mode and check if that works.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a. Place the driver installation file on the Desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right Click the <b>driver installation</b> file and select <b>Properties</b> and then
<b>Compatibility</b> Tab. Select the appropriate options in from the list in the following image.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click <b>Apply/OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right Click the file and select the <b>Run as Administrator</b> option to install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend that you contact the maker of that hardware device and inquire about future driver support for Windows 7.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click an empty area on the taskbar, and then click

<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under <strong>Notification area</strong>, click
<strong>Customize</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>For each icon, select one of the following options in the list:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span></span></span><strong><span>Show icon and notifications</span></strong><span>. The icon always remains visible on the taskbar in the notification area and any&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notifications are displayed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span></span></span><strong><span>Hide icon and notifications</span></strong><span>. The icon is hidden and notifications aren't displayed.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - </span></span></span><strong><span>Only show notifications</span></strong><span>. The icon is hidden, but if the program triggers a notification balloon, it's displayed on the taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update us on the result.</span></p>

    <title>Nuvision TM800 Reset loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nuvision TM800 Reset loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating my Nuvision TM800 to the fall creators update I was forced to try to reset the tablet to get functionality of many apps and the app store, now I am stuck in a failure loop. The loop runs from 64% complete up to approximately 70% where it shows
 a garbled Error screen and then resets back down to 64%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been doing this for a while now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried holding the power and lower volume buttons, but it just brings it to the 64% complete spot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on fixing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>

<p>xbox говорит: найдено обновление системы. Соглашаюсь. долго грузится с xbox LIVE, в итоге выдает ошибку 3151-335A-1780-2303-C810-1012. Судя по коду нарушение лицензии на программное обеспечение. Но я ничего не ломал и не прошивал. Что делать?</p>

 trick.I also tried to plug out my HDMI cable and plug it back in but still, the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help?<br />

<p>Hi <strong>Muhammad Asad Ali</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You mentioned about successfully updating the graphics card driver but just to verify, have you also checked if there was an update for the monitor as well? Try to check for updates for your monitor drivers as well and see if it helps. Please refer to
