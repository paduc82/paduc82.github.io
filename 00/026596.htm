<h2>            Difference between office 365, Office 2019 and Sharepoint 2019.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">Hi, I'm Trying to figure out what I need to buy for my use. Let me clear my situation. I'm familiar with developer/programming/server/power user side of tech, However, I'm not a pro.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong><em>I think this question might be for elite/advanced users or developers.</em></strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong>All the solutions I require is on premise, which means It cannot be connected to internet due to security reasons.</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong>Feel free to answer just any of the below mentioned questions if you know them.</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>1.) What's&nbsp;the real difference between office 365 and Office 2019&nbsp;? When I mean real difference, I mean like, is there any enterprise features disabled in the one time purchase version&nbsp;and the subscription
 version? For example : There is co-authoring ( A feature I'm trying to introduce to the team) in O365 and&nbsp;in the other version, there is no co authoring. Mind you, we are already power users of office apps like excel, word, outlook etc. So I need to know if
 there is any limitation or difference right up to the bone of the office for regular versions and 365 versions. PS : I KNOW THERE IS 1TB AND UPDATES&nbsp;</span><span>WITH O365</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>VERSION&nbsp;PLEASE</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>DON'T&nbsp;MENTION
 THAT AS A</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>DIFFERENCE.</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>2.) If I get on premise version of sharepoint 2019 which cost about $7000 for activation and $100 per user, Can I access the office apps and files using sharepoint intranet site through different&nbsp; machines
 in the <strong>INTRANET ?&nbsp;</strong>And what does this per user cost mean? Is it the number of PC accessing the intranet site or the number of accounts registered in sharepoint, or .....well what is it? is Office bundled with sharepoint ? Is sharepoint bundled
 with office ?? ?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>3) Does office 2019 support access through intranet for multiple users (with one time&nbsp;license)?</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>4) I need to work on a single excel file (Let's&nbsp;call the file book 1.xls) through sharepoint web version of excel.&nbsp; At Least&nbsp;20 users will be editing, deleting, adding new data to&nbsp;</span><span>book
 1.xls</span><span>&nbsp;at once, Some might need filtered view of the file, Some might need another data
</span><span>filtered</span><span>&nbsp;for their use. Essentially, What I'm trying to Ask is, if I select a filter that shows me only sales in
</span><span>month</span><span>&nbsp;of august and my colleague selects a filter in the same column&nbsp;that shows sales in the month of december, would I get the view of the same file with sales of august and will my colleague
 get view of sales in december simultaneously in different machine ? When I save it, would It affect his work and vice versa? Will the file get updated with the deleted or added or edited information simultaneously? (Remember&nbsp;there is only&nbsp;one&nbsp;</span><span>book
 1.xls file and its in the server, There is no copy</span><span>&nbsp;)</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentStandard">&nbsp;5) Would Sharepoint and Office take full advantage of multiple cores, say, a Threadripper with 16 Cores and 32 Threads ? I need to know because book 1.xls file alone has 200 MB size. Opening and operating on it is a hassle and
 time consuming.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">6) What would be the cost of Sharepoint on premise with 20 users + Office 2019 + Windows Server + whatever cost I don't know (Like MySql server etc) ?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">7) What is the cost of customizing the sharepoint and office to taylor my need that I would need to pay an expert?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">8) I need data from Excel to be viewed as dynamic charts ( as data is added or deleted) and&nbsp; the business intelligence tool parts to be displayed on the intranet site of&nbsp; sharepoint for managers above me so that they can view progress
 of the project, and enquire about it. Is it possible ? Also daily status like, who are on leave, what are duties of other workers, what are the tasks for today and what works are pending and reminders etc to be displayed on each users intranet site. Is that
 Possible?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">9) Are the apps in sharepoint free or paid?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">10) Can you view the files in the server using sharepoint intranet site, for users, not the admin ?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">

<p>Office365 is a family name for Microsoft's suite of online products. It is not a single product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not confuse Office365 to MS-Office. MS-Office is the desktop productivity product of Microsoft, and Office365 is a broad name that describes Microsoft's suite of online productivity tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exception is Office365 Personal &nbsp;which is essentially MS Office for consumers via subscription, with some additional consumer features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office365 for Corporates comes in two families (Business and Enterprise), and are basically a whole suite of hosted "Server" products plus many business apps. Eg Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Skype for Business Online, One Drive for Business, Yammer,
 Planner, Teams...etc. All these work as a suite to provide a seamless collaborative experience to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all your requirements require on-prem, you cannot use Office365 as these are Microsoft's Online versions of their Server Products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your other questions, you really need to sit down with a Microsoft expert reseller to explain to you how Microsoft suite works, and how Microsoft licenses its products. You really need a A-Z lesson, which a forum doesnt do very well. A forum like this
 helps to answer any specific questions that you might have. In your case you really need to be briefed in detail across Microsoft various products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example you talk about SharePoint. I am not sure if you are aware of the pre-requsites of SharePoint for its various use cases?&nbsp;</p>
<p>You mentioned the cost of SharePoint Server license. Please also remember to include Windows Server License, SQL Server Licenses, and its corresponding CALS as well? Not sure also if you know that Office Online for on-premise also requires a Office Online
 Server. Coupled with this is also costs of servers, 2 tier or 3 tier design, backups etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I would suggest working with a SharePoint consultant on your needs. Costs vary by country and expertise, so we can't help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you intend to self study, a good place to start would be Microsoft's services descriptions which describe, almost down to the bone, the details of the various products. However, without a guide to help you navigate this, it might prove too complex to
 understand.</p>

<h2>            How do I mark a sender as not phishing&#63;</h2>
                    I am currently running the Microsoft Outlook 2016 version on a Mac and am unable to figure out how to mark a sender as
<strong>not phishing</strong>. I deal with this contact on a regular basis and Microsoft has flagged their emails as "This message was identified as a phishing scam." I am looking for a work around solution to allow the sender to send messages without them
 being flagged. Due to the messages being flagged I occasionally will not receive them, or any notification of an email from them.

                    I am currently using Word 2007 English version and living in Japan. For the Japanese version of Word, under Mail Merge, you can choose the Japanese format for postcard addresses. I have been searching but been unable to find that template/download to use
 on the English verison. All I can access is the western style address printing. Help would be appreciated.

<p>Instead of trying to find an Address Block in Japanese format, just insert the individual items (mergefields if you are using mailmerge) in the format that YOU want them.</p>
<p>In Japan, the mail format is: postal code, prefecture, city, ward (ku), block(s) (chome), lot (ban), building (go), addressee name (family name first).</p>
<p>Example of a letter to Mr. Kazuo Watanabe (written in Japanese, of course):</p>
<p>107 Tokyo-to, Minato-ku, Akasaka 1-chome, 10-ban, 5-go, <br />
Watanabe Kazuo</p>

                    I keep getting this annoying pop-up message in my current Office365 prompting me to upgrade to Office365 2016. &nbsp;When I attempt the upgrade I get the Error Code 20125-39 (12007). &nbsp;The only other person I saw with the same error code was in Germany. &nbsp;I don't
 read or write in German so I can't figure out if or how it was resolved. &nbsp;This shouldn't be happening with a subscription version. Why release it if its not ready or bugged. &nbsp;Does anyone test to see what the consumer may experience?

    <title>Sporadic problems with Auto-synching photos to OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sporadic problems with Auto-synching photos to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>I have had multiple issues with auto-synching my photos to OneDrive from my Nokia 1020 WP8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most recently I was on vacation and took many photos.&nbsp; I was without wifi for a few days.&nbsp; Today I am back on a strong wifi system (I've been on my&nbsp;home wifi, and
 work&nbsp;wifi)&nbsp;but none of my vacation photos have been uploaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked my photo settings and they are correct.&nbsp; OneDrive is turned on under Auto upload.</p>
<p>When on vacation I did see the pop-up show saying that there were several photos to upload, but I don't see that now.</p>
<p>I know I can manually sync each picture, but that will take a long time, and I would like to troubleshoot the actual problem.</p>
<p>I am using the Lumia Camera app as my default camera app, and it has synched in the past with no problem.</p>
<p>I rebooted my phone and that did not help.</p>
<p>I have checked all my folders in OneDrive to see if they synched to another folder (which would be weird, but I still checked.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Is there a way to see the photos that need to be synched?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Is there a way to manually batch sync photos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to me in the past and there doesn't seem to be a good way to troubleshoot.&nbsp; I'd greatly appreciate some help.</p>

<p>Haven't found any solutions.&nbsp; Frustrating because it is a sporadic issue making it harder to troubleshoot.&nbsp; I don't want to lose anything.&nbsp; I found something mentioning that there are sometimes issues when the phone hasn't been able to connect to wifi for
 a while... which would coincide with some of my experiences...&nbsp; but nothing concrete.<br />

For some reason I can no longer save a Word doc as a Web Page Filtered. It doesn't show up in the Save As options at all, but it used to. Now it's missing! I've written and saved 4 books as such already. But for some reason the option has now disappeared. What
 do I do to again enable the Save As Web Page Filtered to show up so I can choose it?

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials allowed virus</h2>
                    I recently got infected with a Trojan virus - a scareware program which disabled everything in its path.&nbsp; It's been 2 weeks and counting to repair the damage.&nbsp;&nbsp; My MSE runs in real time, so I wondered why it didn't stop this thing or alert me.&nbsp; I ran other
 anti-virus &amp; anti-malware apps to detect and remove the malware files and tracking cookies.&nbsp; When I look at my MSE history, it shows the two Trojan files and&nbsp;gives the status that the system "Allowed" them.&nbsp; How did I "Allow" them?

            <p>You neglected to provide the Trojan/virus/scareware names, but what are your MSE settings for Default Actions to perform for medium and low level alerts, where
<strong>allow</strong>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;one of the acceptable automatic default responses?&nbsp; Incidently, all mine are set to Quarantine which&nbsp;appears to be the safest, since anything can be restored from there&nbsp;.&nbsp; Also, do you have a checkmark&nbsp;set in the box to&nbsp;'Apply

            Hi ann222,<br />
<br />
MSE does not disable the Windows Firewall. If it is disabled then something else did it.<br />
Possibly one of those fake malware programs pretending to be MSE (looks similar).<br />
<br />
No program detects all malware, and I mean none.<br />
<br />
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can I use Skype meetings without Office 365&#63; If so, how&#63;</h2>
                    I have been going in circles for an hour trying to figure out how to download, or even use, Skype meetings when I don't have an Office 365 account. Every time I click on the link for "get Skype meetings" I'm sent to the Skype for Business page, where the
 only option is "Get Office 365." I just want a simple yes or no: Can I use Skype meetings without having Office 365?&nbsp; There is NOTHING to indicate I can't, yet there is also NOTHING tell me how.

<p>Not sure why you can't talk about. Yes I've read the guidlines. Discussing open source software doesn't seem to be prohibited. Not violating any copyrights, and not linking to anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I hope it is understood that Lollipop (5.0) AOSP won't run on any specific device, not the X series, or Galaxy's or Nexuses. It is the core software, it is Open Source (i.e. free for use and augmentation) It takes someone, or some company, to tailor
 the basic platform software for each device with hardware drivers, and specific device support. I would not expect MS to take on that effort at this point. Keep in mind also that a great deal of the Lollipop changes are cosmetic, the new flat look, changes
 in the task switcher, notification features and such. The X series uses none of these elements providing a unique User Interface, so Lollipop would likely provide little to the X experience.</p>

<h2>            SUM at bottom of page and column add won&#39;t work with figures copied from Bank site</h2>
                    I copied figures from my Bank site.<br />
<br />
The normal SUM function, to highlight and add figures in a column, won't work at the bottom of a page.<br />
<br />
Neither will the SUM function work from the Toolbar, by highlighting the numbers and doing the function.<br />
<br />
It works fine with numbers typed into a spreadsheet.<br />
<br />
What can I do?<br />

            I suspect that the "numbers" pasted into the worksheet from the website are actually numeric text.<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
•Apply any number format to those cells except "text"<br />
.....Hold down CTRL and Press 1...select the number format...Click: OK<br />
<br />
Then<br />
•Copy a blank cell<br />
•Select the "number" cells<br />
<br />
From Excel 2007<br />
•Home.Paste.Paste_Special....Check: Add....click: OK<br />
<br />
From Pre-2007 versions<br />
•Edit.Paste_Special.....Check: Add....click: OK<br />
<br />
Does that help?

<p>if you have tried reset and nothing happens, i am sorry to tell your only option might be to take it to nokia care and have them have a look. it sounds like it might be a hardware issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>try the last option on the list before you take it back and see if this helps any</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With all these operations I recommend you <strong>
<em>TAKE OUT MEMORY CARD</em></strong> and <em><strong>DO A BACK UP OF YOUR STUFF!!!
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE: In front of the hash key ( #) there is also a STAR key that people often miss and state that the code does not work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">1</font>.</span></strong>.<font color="#0000FF"><strong><span>
</span><span>*#7780#</span></strong></font> - <strong>
Restore factory settings</strong> - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data) Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for ALL operations listed here
 is <strong><font color="#FF0000">12345</font><font color="#993300">.</font></strong><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><font color="#0000FF"><span><font color="#800080">2</font>.*#7370#
</span></font></strong>-<strong> Reformat </strong>your phone (out of the box, tho keep in mind that most newer nokia phones at least n series, e series and s60 based phones have udp - user data preservation so not ALL data may be lost. still it is a good idea
 to always do a back up of your stuff.)3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the
 default code is <font color="#FF0000"><strong>12345</strong></font>)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span><font color="#800080">3</font></span>. hard reset</strong> - hold the following buttons</span><span><font color="#339966"><strong><span>
</span><span>* (star key),</span></strong></font></span><span><font color="#339966"><span><strong>
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>3
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>(number button) and
</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong>talk/green</strong></span></font><font color="#339966"><span><strong> key</strong></span></font>. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons
 until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, /<span>GREEN/<span><span><font color="#993300">RED</font></span><span>/<font color="#0000FF">CA</font><font color="#0000FF">MERA</font><span>
 keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. ) For Nokia N97 (unofficial version but works) is
</span><font color="#0000FF">SHIFT /SPACE BAR / BACKSPACE</font><span> while holding the power button. Again do not let go until you see the handshake screen.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Separate Desktops</h2>
                    <p><span>I’m a programmer, I’m studying at university and I like to do lots of other stuff. When I use my computer I prefer to store frequently accessed files and folders on desktop and important programs in taskbar. The problem is that I have one desktop and
 all my files and folders are mixed. Same for the taskbar. For example, I have games and programs there that I don’t need when I’m working. Work, Uni and other stuff are all around my workspace whatever I do. Not organized at all and even distracting.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I like that there is a support for multiple desktops in Windows 10. Can’t say it’s useless, but I think it could be much better. Currently these desktops can’t be customized. I would prefer if I could create multiple permanent workspaces that will
 have different files and folders on desktops and different programs in taskbars for different activities I do. I think that would be very useful.</span></p>

            Hi zaulawt 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Is this error for one file only or for all files? Do you get this error when you start Excel even though you don't open a file?

            <p>Hello ShirleyDer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. I'm pleased to assist you with your concern on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me see if I have this right.<span> When you type a few letters of your contacts' address, Outlook.com doesn't auto-complete the email addresses. If so, it is possible that you are experiencing this issue because your account's auto-complete suggestions
 feature is not enabled. Kindly refer to the steps below on how to enable the auto-complete suggestions feature in your account. You can choose which suggestions appear, whether from contacts only in your list or from contacts and non-contacts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To enable auto-complete suggestions for everyone you’ve communicated with:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>From your Inbox, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> on the upper right corner of the page beside your name.</span>
</li><li><span>Select <strong>More mail settings</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click <strong>Advanced privacy settings</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Under <strong>Auto-complete suggestions</strong>, select <strong>Give suggestions for anyone I've communicated with (contacts and non-contacts)</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>To enable auto-complete suggestions only for people included in your contact list:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your Inbox, click the <strong>gear icon</strong> on the upper right corner of the page&nbsp;beside your name.
</li><li>Go to <strong>More mail settings</strong>. </li><li><span>Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, click <strong>Advanced privacy settings</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Under <strong>Auto-complete suggestions</strong>, select </span><strong>Only suggest people in my contact list</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this helps. Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t even divide in Excel&#33;&#33; What is going on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'll rant afterwards about Excel 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even do basic operations like division. I have checked the formatting. Simply trying to divide one column of numbers by 12. Pretty straightforward. I have uploaded sample spreadsheet but not sure that even worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now. What happened with Excel???&nbsp; I bought a new Macbook. Bought Excel and I continually have had stupid, basic non-consuming issues like this. I have used Excel since it was first released.&nbsp; This can't be for real. Is there some new set up that I never
 got the memo about?&nbsp; Or do they just want us all to go to Google Sheets?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab78a8bd-256b-4a13-a0f6-69b4935da884?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab78a8bd-256b-4a13-a0f6-69b4935da884?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Your upload is not showing up. If you want, save a sample document with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I can take a look at it. I may be able to fix it for you and explain what I did. 
<br />
<br />Are you starting your formula with an = sign? Otherwise Excel treats it as text.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Please let me know if you have any more questions or require further help.
<br />
<br />Regards

            Thank you for your response. I have since uploaded an image and will post link soon.&nbsp; Yes, I used an "=" . As I mentioned i've been using Excel for decades but now can't do basics in Excel 2016.

            OK - seeing the second one. Definitely using the =.
<br />Are you referring to the ones showing VALUE errors?
<br />Same formula?
<br />My guess is that the source cells are text rather than numbers. That is a guess.

            Excel was originally developed for the Mac and then ported to Windows. 
<br />I do not have a Mac and am writing from my experiences with the Windows version. That version is similar, but the two are not the same. While I used Word on a Mac, that was a long time ago. Nevertheless, I hope that I can be of some help.
<br />
<br />The quickest way is if you can post a dummy file, perhaps even as an edit to your original post.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />It is that they are being treated as text. In all cases, they had a space at the end. In some they had space at the beginning or other text in the middle. See screenshot. I've put a box showing the space or lack thereof.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/001360f8-f35f-448f-8beb-46fdbc2dd6e6?upload=true" />

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am accessing email via browser. I also access email via outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just &nbsp;to let you know is that I configured outlook 2007 recently &nbsp;(15/9 - 16/9) &nbsp;. When I configured outlook 2007 only Inbox was synchronized and&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;I made few changes so I can
 synchronize all of the folders . I made few changes after looking &nbsp;at few websites. I don't remember what changes were made as I deleted my outlook profile few times during the outlook configuration process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2007 &nbsp;:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see all of the emails (inbox only) &nbsp;. All of the other folders including Sent &nbsp;folders are still not synchronized with outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Browser :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can see emails are not getting &nbsp;disappeared from Inbox, but I can only see &nbsp;email from yesterday, nothing before that . Emails in all of the other folders are still there<br />
</p>
<p>Appreciate if you assist with recovering disappeared email Or tell me how do I sync my Outlook 2007 inbox back to Hotmail Inbox</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p>KS</p>

<h2>            Font instability in Word 2010</h2>
                    I have encountered a problem that has me stumped and has also stumped my IT people.&nbsp; I use Office 2010 on a cloud-based system.&nbsp; The service utilizes a Citrix client.&nbsp; When creating a document in Word that includes the use of italics, the program will
 sometimes change subsequent text to italics as well, without being told to do so.&nbsp; If I highlight this text, the "Italics" button in the Ribbon does not indicate that italics is active and clicking it does not change the appearance of the text.&nbsp; I can change
 the font back to regular typeface by dragging the mouse cursor across the text (I do not have to click anything else), but as soon as I start typing again it changes back to italics.&nbsp; One other person in my office is experiencing this problem, but not everyone
 else is, despite the fact that we are all on the same cloud server.&nbsp; We have tried disabling the Adobe add-in and&nbsp;rebuilding fonts, but these measures have had no effect.&nbsp; I have tried

<h2>            Is Office Home and Business 2013 compatible with Sharepoint Online &#40;Office 365&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>My client recently upgraded 3 Windows 7 PCs from Office 2007 (which was actually working fine against Exchange/SharePoint Online) to Office Home and Business 2013.&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Now, for all 3 PCs, while Office 2013 Word/Excel can open, check out/in, and save SharePoint Online files, there is ALWAYS a 2 minute delay in closing the file which is apparently waiting for the Local Security Authority
 call to return. This seems to indicate an issue related to SharePoint security on the client side.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>This is the Local Security Authority Security Support Provider Interface Remote Procedure Call (LSA SSPI RPC)<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My client has 66 licenses for SharePoint Online (Plan 2) and 73 Exchange Online (Plan 1) "stand alone" services. The same failure is happening on 3 Win 7 PCs. All of which I've carefully reviewed against the MS Office trouble shooting guides (start Windows
 OS w/out non-MS services, Word/Excel safe mode w/out add-ons, O365 readiness checks, Office repair, etc.). We have PCs running Win 7 (32 &amp; 64-bit) w/Office 365 ProPlus &amp; Office Professional Plus 2013 that work fine. it's JUST these 3 Win 7 PCs that were upgraded
 from Office 2007 to Office Home and Business 2013 that have the 2 min. SharePoint file close time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can you please confirm that Office Home and Business 2013 is compatible w/SharePoint Online
</strong><strong>at least for Excel and Word</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "slow close" problem can be demonstrated on multiple site collections/sub sites and w/Excel &amp; Word docs in doc libs and lists</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After many hours capturing information, following the MS Office trouble shooting guides, and repairing the Office install, I've had no luck in resolving this.</span><span><span>While
 Word/Excel will eventually close SharePoint Online files after about 2 minutes, this is certainly unacceptable</span>.
</span><span><span>Otherwise, locally stored files close normally and new files were created by the Office 2013 Excel/Word for this testing.</span><br />
<br />
</span><span>Any thoughts or guidance would&nbsp;be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Today 13/10/13 I have had the same problem with my Nokia 820, the battery appeared to discharge rapidly&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; charger plate, usb (from 12vdc), usb from mains would not recharge the battery. I have had this before but never really found a solution, even my
 short (200mm) usb lead would not work this time.</p>
<p>Then all a a sudden it charged OK, from 7% to 100% in 10 minutes (is there a battery monitor software glitch????).</p>
<p>Try this sequence which I did today - turn off phone put it on powered charger plate or connect using USB. The phone will automatically power up, (enter pin as normal if used). Phone will charge.</p>
<p>It appeared to charge rather quickly as stated above but it would not be possible to charge from 7% to 100% in 10 minutes, a charging current of about 9amps - non of the chargers would charge at this current.</p>
<p>THERE MUST BE A BATTERY MONITOR SOFTWARE GLITCH - PLEASE NOKIA RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.</p>
