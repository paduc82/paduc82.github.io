<p>Plug and Play cannot be uninstalled, its a specification built deep into the Windows operating system at the kernel level. If you are experiencing problems when you connect a device to your computer, its most likely a driver issue or system files are corrupted
 or your chipset drivers need to be updated.</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow<br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations<br />
<br />
Restart your system</p>

<h2>            Malware triggers continuous UAC prompts, making the computer unusable until permission is granted</h2>
                    <p>I was looking at malware that attempts to execute itself as the Administrator, which triggers a UAC prompt.&nbsp; If you select 'No' or try to exit out, another UAC prompt for the same action is displayed.&nbsp; This happens continuously until the user grants the
 malware permission to run with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'd be awesome if there were a maximum number of UAC attempts that could be made by a malicious program, or at least a maximum in some time period.&nbsp; As it's currently implemented, the user is essentially forced to click 'Yes', since the computer is unusable
 until then (the UAC prompts take up the whole screen).&nbsp; Are there any plans to implement functionality that will prevent this type of thing from occurring?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a video of this happening:&nbsp;https://youtu.be/NeRtU6Zfy4o</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is a possibility that your browser got infected with<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>a virus</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>or malware. To isolate the issue, we suggest that you use a different browser to check if the issue persists. If it is only happening
 with Chrome, clearing cache and cookies, resetting browser's settings and reinstalling the app will be the basic troubleshooting steps. Getting in touch with the app developer will be our last resort if<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>the</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>above
 possible solutions fail.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hundreds of Malwares and Viruses are being released<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>every day</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and to keep our devices safe from any attacks, it is best to keep our PC protected by always installing any suggested cumulative and security
 updates in Windows Update Settings. We also suggest to update<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>your</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Defender</a></strong> and then
 do a full system scan to get rid of the issue.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Look at your browser extensions as well as your installed programs if you see anything fishy which needs to be removed......</p>
<p>In general, the best remedy against these fake Tech Support alerts/warnings is the use of a good advertisement etc blocker.</p>
<p>I'm a Firefox user and use and recommend the browser extension <em>uBlock Origin</em> which exists for Chrome too, see

<p>I was just looking at Walmart's website and this same thing happened to me on Chrome. It's not letting me close out of the browser to uninstall Chrome and I can't access any of Chrome's settings to clear the cache and cookies or reset the browser settings.
 When I click around nothing happens. I have other tabs open and even I can't access them, though, a YouTube music channel is still playing. All I can do on Chrome is minimize the browser or change the size of the browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very worried about this since I cannot uninstall the browser.</p>

            Well, I don't know why or how but I was eventually able to close down Chrome and uninstall it. I kept clicking the red "x" to close the browser. I don't plan on reinstalling Chrom, but now I want to know if there's anything else I need to do to be sure
 my computer is safe.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay. We understand how important it is for you to fix the issue as soon as possible. We would like to know if you already tried Jsssssssss' suggestion. The link that he provided contains important information on how to prevent malware infection.
 Since the issue also occurs when using Edge, let's try some methods that may help in addressing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Let's try to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> by following the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Some apps run automatically during the boot process. When you start Windows by using a normal startup
 operation, several applications and services start automatically, and then run in the background. This includes infected apps and programs. Performing Clean boot will help stopping infected apps running on bootup process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Uninstalling any unwanted and unknown apps from the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2601726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Add/Remove Program</strong></a>in <strong>Control Panel.</strong> Some downloaded apps from the internet contains malware specially if it is from unknown sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> You may also try resetting <strong>Hosts file</strong> back to the default. But first, check the default contents
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/972034/how-to-reset-the-hosts-file-back-to-the-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a>. If your Host File has more text or entries, it is possible that yours is infected or modified. This process on resetting Hosts file will also work on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to use with the results.</p>

<p>Windows Defender (assuming you kept it up to date) isn't doing anything because nothing is trying to get into your computer. Not yet, anyway. These pop-ups (drive-by attacks) rely on the user (in this case that would be you) to start frantically clicking
 all over the place trying to shut the&nbsp; damned thing down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing to do is take a deep breath. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the Task Manager. Use that to close your browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the Microsoft Store and download one of the free ad blockers you see there.</p>
<p>Or use the one Jssss recommended above. Personally I like the AdBlocker Ultimate from the Microsoft Store but they all work about the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should keep these lurking bits of rubbish from popping out at you with their jump scare tactics until the idiots who write the code for these things find a new way around your blocking program. Of course, you can regularly update the program as well
 and try to at least stay even with them.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05b1aa64-c55a-421f-9f7f-f7cf408d1971?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05b1aa64-c55a-421f-9f7f-f7cf408d1971?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Lenovo tablet with Windows trying to undo updates, taking hours on end</h2>
                    <p>My recently purchased Lenovo yoga tablet 2 is having some problems with installing updates. My tablet was performing some Windows updates when I had to leave the wifi network I was connected to. The screen went from installing updates to the error code "We
 couldn't complete the updates Undoing changes Don't turn off your computer." The tablet has been "undoing updates" for more than 4 hours at this point. I tried restarting it, but I don't know what else to do. Please note, this is a TABLET (that has both tablet
 and PC features), and I currently do not have any way of attaching a keyboard to it. Please help, I need to use my tablet ASAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry in advance to everyone, but I have not used Windows since about 2010, and the last version of it that I used was Vista.</p>

<h2>            Can&#8217;t access my Xbox account</h2>
                    <p>When I try to log into 3rd party apps (such as the one for RDR2) its says there’s an authentication error and:</p>
<p><span>We were unable to sign you in with your Xbox Live account. Please visit&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com</a><span>&nbsp;and sign in to verify/update your Xbox Live account. This error usually indicates
 that your Microsoft account has no Xbox Live Gamertag, or that your account must be updated in some way, such as agreeing to an updated terms of use.</span></p>
<p>And when I go to Xbox.com, I can sign into my Microsoft account but when I go to view my Xbox profile it takes me here:</p>

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with viewing your profile. When you get the link&nbsp; your account is usually a child account. You will need a parent account to sign in and change the settings. Remember if you altered your birthdate on Microsoft.com, you are unable to do
 so on Xbox.com so this birthdate will be whatever it was when you created it. If you did in fact use a birthdate that is under 18, then account is considered a child account. If you are not in a family, you will need to add your account to a family then the
 parent change settings.</p>

<h2>            Constantly need to reset my Wireless Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Ever since an upgrade, I have had to reset my wireless adapter after turning the computer on, or even after sleep or hibernation. Only after I troubleshoot the network adapter, does internet connection resume. The fix after troubleshooting is not always
 the same, sometimes it says WIFI does not have a valid IP configuration, sometimes the Network adapter is reset, etc. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver, as well as adjusting the power management settings. Please help! Thank you in advance.</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the Lenovo computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />4. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />5. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />.

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate this, it's not something I had tried before, but it did not work. Honestly at this point it might be a physical problem with adapter, as it is a new computer and may have come with defects? I'm not too sure. Thank you for the suggestion!</p>

<p>1. This year</p>

<p>3. I had (or have?) McAfee installed, though I disabled some of the internet extensions associated with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. No, I have not</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since I still have warranty on the product, I was thinking about sending it in just in case it was a physical problem with the adapter, it is just too time consuming to reset the adapter every time I want to use the laptop!</p>

<h2>            Surface will not charge even when plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface and I love it! Recently I'd been getting the "plugged in, not charging" message; however, I checked all around and did the work throughs and that seems to have stopped. Now when I have my surface plugged in, it is not acknowledging that
 it is plugged in at all. The battery icon currently reads as "battery saver on" despite having the charging cord actively plugged in. The cord is lighting up at the connection point to the surface, so it should be charging. Can someone tell me what is going
 on and/or how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To run XP Mode you need Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise - more information<br />
in the last section below.<br />
<br />

<br />
Other methods would be to use Compatibility Methods to run them on Windows 7.<br />

<br />
More however the above should be all you need.<br />
<br />
If you have Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise then XP mode is an option.<br />
<br />
From a post by Kristan M. Kenney :</p>
<p>"Most applications that were designed for Windows 2000 or Windows XP will still function correctly under all editions of Windows 7, including Home Premium. Some applications check the version number of the operating system and will fail to run&nbsp;if it finds
 an unexpected version number, therefore Windows 7 has a&nbsp;compatibility mode which&nbsp;allows these types of programs to&nbsp;run correctly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There is also another compatibility option geared towards IT professionals and business users which is called "Windows XP Mode," which is essentially a fully-licensed copy of Windows XP Professional running inside of a virtual machine and is only available
 to Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 7 Ultimate users.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Windows XP Mode is&nbsp;meant primarily for companies who have designed their own software in-house which is targeted specifically for a version of software - a prime example of this is a web application that only works in Internet Explorer 6 (which is available
 with Windows XP, but not with Windows 7).</p>
<p>For more information on application compatibility with Windows 7, please see <br />

<h2>            Recovery partitions after the Windows 10 upgrade From 8.1</h2>
                    <p>i now have two primary partitions( both with Win10's{release and preview 10240}), AND six recovery partitions. ( C partition is the boot partition.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>since Win10 doesn't rely on a recovery partition(I think I read that somewhere),
</p>
<p>
</p><p>can I reformat them and merge into one or the other primary partitions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, one of the partitions is ID'd as an "EFI System partition".</p>
<p>1.0 GB&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 MB &lt;&lt;&lt; this is the EFI SYSTEM PARTITION</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you have a question in merging the partition.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that you have an option of merging the drives with simple changes from the issue description. Do not merge the EFI system partition as it deals with the boot process. Also
 I suggest you reserve a drive so that you can retrieve files of Windows 10 when needed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Create a recovery drive</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Now you can merge <strong>
four drives</strong> out of <strong>six. </strong>To do so refer the steps below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
You can do that by <strong>right clicking</strong> on the drive.</p>

            <p>Yep, I still don't know if the duplicate partitions are expected behavior of Windows 10, or if it's the result of a bug because of something that was looked over, and Windows does in upgrade process from in my case 8.1 to 10. I also know I had intel SSD
 caching enabled during the upgrade is that a common piece in anyone else's experience?
</p>
<p>The duplicate partitions don't look right that I can be assure of.</p>

            Hello, I'm Sheri. I'll be happy to assist you.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry you having so many problems. If I were you, I would roll back to the previous version until Microsoft gets this resolved. I'm personally waiting to update my own.
<br />
<br />To go back to an earlier build of Windows 10, open Start Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery. Here you will see Go back to an earlier build section, with a Get started button. Click on it. The process to revert your Windows 10 back will commence. 
<br />
<br />Best wishes,
<br />

<p>Thanks for your suggestion!</p>
<p>Unfortunately it didn't work. There is three different ways on this version to Refresh/Reset/Fresh Start - I tried today all of them and all install version 1809. Since this PC had Fresh clean install it didn't keep older version of Windows, so I can't back
 up to it. My secondary PC (1803) on the Recovery screen has following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the previous version of Windows 10</p>
<p>This option is no longer available because your PC was updated more than 10 days ago. ( Get Started button disabled )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft makes me insane!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My backup/restore software doesn't work properly - it seems to have a bug also, or something is messed up. I guess I'm doomed.</p>

            I’m so sorry nothing worked. Microsoft is working to resolve the issues with the update. I would report any issues you are having by selecting the Windows key + F<br /><br />I wish there was more I could do to help you. Hopefully, they will get those patches ready soon. <br /><br />I know you probably hate to wipe them and do a clean installation of Windows. <br /><br />I’ll also send this straight to Microsoft for you.

<h2>            My computer is unable to search for any updates, error 80073712. W7 x64, IE9.</h2>
                    <p>Because my computer was unable to complete the installation of the&nbsp;program named "VMware Horizon view-client" due to "the Microsoft Runtime Installer DLL failed to complete the installation" I tried to resolve searching into my PC through the windows update
 (error 80073712) the conflict among the information contained in the "View update history, the "Control Panel Programs and updates installed", and the &nbsp;"Updates installed". While my PC is unable to search for any windows updates due the error mentioned (80073712),
 the View Installed Updates shows "no updates are installed on this computer", while the
<strong>Control Panel via Programs and Features </strong>shows some installation occurred during this year ( The Microsoft Security Essential today, and others from microsoft, C++ distributable 2008, etc, and the View Update History shows succesfully updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Eduardo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to this article which mentions about <strong>Windows update error&nbsp;80073712</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-update-error-80073712#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-update-error-80073712#1TC=windows-7</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you have already tried System Update Readiness tool (KB947821),&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">you will need to repair(In-Place Upgrade) Windows as mentioned in the same article above.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><br />

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.&nbsp; However, I would suggest you to backup all the important data from the computer before performing
 in-place upgrade.</span></p>

            <p>I uploaded the system and Application logs to the OneDrive Gerry. And i still waiting for your help. However I tried to repair from the W7 x64 DVD, and following all the instructions I was able to delete or uninstalled the i-tunes as one of the two application
 srequired in order to continue with the installation W7 x64 DVD but the second application required was the AMD Catalyst Manager, and when I tried my computer crashed. The original Graphic Card was NVIDIA but was break 3 years ago so the video Card now is
 an ATI HD RADEON 5700 series which requires the AMD graphic cards and drivers. So at this time I am unable to fix using the DVD . I ran the AVAST, MALWAREBYTES and the ADVANCEDCAREPPRO, the last one found&nbsp; register errors. Also 3 virus Win64:Adware-A[Adw]
 transfer line 6/28; and two from 7/02 all of three in 2014? The foruth is from 6/28/2014 Win32:Malware-gen. The program offer the software updates and all but the Internet Explorer9 V 9.0.8112.16483 ignore updates which is still pending. Anyway, running restarted
 and follow the sign to apply the updates got the same error 80073712.</p>
<p>The History of updates shows updates successfuly installed even in 07/05/2014, the Installed Updates in this computer shows NO updates installed since 12/05/2013.</p>
<p>I still hope for your help on this matter.</p>

    <title>Standard VGA graphics adapter error 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason kang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Standard VGA graphics adapter error 10</h2>
                    Hi, about 3-4 months ago, when i opened up device manager, i noticed an error sign next to my standard VGA graphics adapter. When i opened it up, it showed: "This device cannot start. (Code 10)" I tried to uninstall the software and reinstall, update the
 driver, pull open windows update to find new updates, and use the Microsoft fix-it app. Unfortunately i have return from my searches with empty hands. Is there something that I can do to fix this error? Thank you!

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I access bluetooth settings anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this was the result of a Windows 7 update, but one day I could no longer access the bluetooth settings to connect my bluetooth headphones. I will click on the icon (from every source or direction I can find the icon) and nothing happens or
 opens. Does anyone have a solution? Thanks!</p>

Use MSCONFIG or AUTORUNS to figure out what is starting it up and from where (Registry, most likely.)<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Windows Mobile Device Center on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, when I try to install WMDC on my Windows 10 (64 Bit) Laptop i get the following error "Windows Mobile Device Center could not be installed because at least one Windows component is missing"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28ceda73-b115-4845-a9e3-af9c0bd22d29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28ceda73-b115-4845-a9e3-af9c0bd22d29" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried both the installer that comes when connecting my device to the usb port, and the 64 bit installer I have downloaded from here&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3182</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another Laptop with the same Windows version, where the downloaded WMDC is working fine, but unfortunately I can't figure out which Windows component is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

            A modem is provided by the Internet Provider to get online via Ethernet.  If it fails you can try restarting it, change the cable, right click the network icon in System tray to run the Troubleshooter.  
<br />
<br />If those fail you need to contact the provider as keeping it running is included in their monthly charge.  
<br />
<br />If this is a router and modem, or actually a router, then here's how to reset it:

<p>Your modem comes from your ISP. Windows has nothing to do with it, and doesn't try to identify it. You wouldn't know whether your modem's setup is scrambled, because ISPs hide their modem's configuration screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just describe in your own words what problem you're experiencing.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
1.Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Is the issue confined only when you search WD USB external drive?<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Method 1: <br />
</span></strong><span>If you're having problems locating specific files, folders, or other items on your computer, try using the Search and Indexing troubleshooter to fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above does not work, then I would suggest you to rebuild the search index.</span></p>
<p><span>To rebuild the index:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Indexing and Search Options by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Indexing Options.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Advanced, click the Index Settings tab, and then click Rebuild. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:</span></p>

<h2>            RPC errors - forced reboot. Started when I drag and drop a file.</h2>
                    I've had some problems in the past few days with the PC rebooting. I've done a bit of nosing around in the Event Logger and seem to have found the root of the problem..<br />
<br />
This is the error log..<br />
Faulting application name: svchost.exe_RpcEptMapper, version: 6.1.7600.16385, time stamp: 0x4a5bc3c1<br />
Faulting module name: rpcss.dll, version: 6.1.7600.16385, time stamp: 0x4a5be037<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000096<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000000000056a58<br />
Faulting process id: 0x2a8<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01ca8bdf78799831<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe<br />
Faulting module path: c:\windows\system32\rpcss.dll<br />
Report Id: ce324aff-f7d6-11de-a3cc-002215ed0658<br />
<br />
It seems to cause this to happen<br />
<br />
The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service terminated unexpectedly.&nbsp; It has done this 1 time(s).&nbsp; The following corrective action will be taken in 60000 milliseconds: Reboot the machine.<br />
<br />
Eventually the PC will reboot. By that time Aero will have failed, as will have Microsoft Security Essentials.<br />
<br />
The problem starts when I attempt to drag and drop a file. Following this Explorer ceases to function properly - which makes sense if the RPC is gone.<br />
<br />
The problem <em>may</em> have started when I installed WinSCP. I did not reboot after installation, as I wan't too bothered about the shell integration (for drag and drop). However I did reboot a couple of days ago, and since then, I've been having issues.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to sort this?<br />
<br />
Edit : The RPC has just fallen over again, however this time I didn't drag and drop... shortly things will collapse and the PC will reboot... Again!

            I may have found a solution to this.<br />
<br />
I've run several "free" registry fixers. None of them turned out to be really free... they all wanted to sell me something, however through a combination of small amount of fixes the problem has not reared its head for nearly a day now.
