<h2>            Windows 10, Outlook 2016 on O365 Shows &#34;presence unknown&#34; in status while hovering over a contact after recent update.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am the onsite Network Admin for one of my employer's offices, and we use windows 10 64 bit for all of our workstations. We also have O365 licenses for all of our workstation. We use microsoft teams to communicate with others in the company instead
 of Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since yesterday I've been getting requests to fix the "unknown presence" status that comes up next to the status color when you hover over a contact and click the down arrow in the bottom right of the pop-up. I was able to pinpoint the issue as coming from
 the most recent batch of O365 updates, but I'm unsure of where to go from here. I was hoping yall might have some solutions I could try, or at least a confirmation that we're screwed until a fix is included on one of the next updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've tried already:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) rebooting, always worth a try.</p>
<p>2.) doing a quick repair of office, usually fixes most weird issues that come from O365 updates.</p>
<p>3.)deleting all of the files in the tracing folder at&nbsp;<span>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync\</span><span>&nbsp;tracing\&nbsp; (I got this idea from another thread on this forum
 and wanted to try, but to no avail. The person on that thread used skype for business instead of teams so wasn't exactly what I needed anyway.)</span></p>
<p><span>4.) using the ipconfig /flushdns command since the support contact on the same thread that I got step 3 from said that the "unknown presence" status stems from a dns issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>i haven't tried resetting the outlook profile yet. Doing that might work, but it's always a hassle for the requester when they have to redo their preferences and not worth the risk in my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>below is the thread I looked at to get steps 3 and 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/presence-unknown/79f46593-30ce-414a-abe4-18a0efc9b3b7" title="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/presence-unknown/79f46593-30ce-414a-abe4-18a0efc9b3b7">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/presence-unknown/79f46593-30ce-414a-abe4-18a0efc9b3b7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any questions regarding the issue. I work from 8:30AM to 5:30PM (-5)eastern time.</p>

<p>Hi Dustyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the post. To better understand your situation, I'd like to collect the following information before we process further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Since you mentioned the issue happened after a recent update, may I know your current Outlook client version? Please capture a screenshot via File &gt; Office Account &gt; About Outlook.</p>
<p>2. Generally if you only use Microsoft Teams, then the coexistence mode should be Teams only. But I'd like to confirm it since it will influence the presence behaviors.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89f1a771-f40a-447e-babd-e070f26cf016?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89f1a771-f40a-447e-babd-e070f26cf016?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Does the issue only happen in Outlook desktop client? Please check if it recurs in
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> (OWA), Teams desktop client and
<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Teams on the web</a>.</p>
<p>4. Also, if it's in Teams only mode, the presence of contacts is based on Teams. Please make sure if the "unknown presence" contacts have signed in Teams.</p>
<p>5. Does the issue happen to all users in your organization? Or just some specific users?</p>
<p>6. For these affected users, does the issue happen to all contacts in their Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p>Thanks or the very swift response, and sorry for the delay on mine.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12a39971-9866-4ff6-aa35-82409412f0ae?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12a39971-9866-4ff6-aa35-82409412f0ae?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the screenshot you needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My team doesn't have access to that teams management page, in the office.com website, we only get the "admin" option, and not all of the other app management options. We used to have access, which is the only reason why I know what
 you're talking about. I'll have to reach out to the team that does have access to that app manager and get them to see what the coexistance is set to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason that i know that the issue was caused by the updates is because I tried to view a contact's status before i forced updates on my outlook and it worked, whereas afterwards it immediately started with the "presence unknown" issue. I actually
 only had one person request access, but as people update their outlook, they will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately we've disabled outlook web access, so we can't test via that outlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found one thing that may have a bearing. in file&gt;office account, my outlook was using my company domain user as an office account instead of my actual O365 account. Even after changing that, I only am able to see my boss's
 status color and status. Everyone else showed up as presence unknown. I even got someone else to switch accounts to their O365 account and I still can't see their status. The only reason that I can see my boss's status is because he's been messing around with
 the settings in outlook and he's not even sure what made it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers all of your questions.</p>

<p>Hello Dustyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information. From the screenshots I can see you are using the Monthly Channel of Office 365 ProPlus. Regarding to the problem, you can try the following methods to see if it helps:
</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-25663bc3-11ec-4412-86c4-60458afc5253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Outlook Data Files (.pst and .ost)</a>. </p>
<p>2. Turn off <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-Cached-Exchange-Mode-7885AF08-9A60-4EC3-850A-E221C1ED0C1C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cached mode</a> in Outlook client. Make sure that <strong>Use Cached Exchange Mode</strong> is unticked.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please do some tests and provide the following information:
</p>
<p>1. Please check if the same behavior happens in Teams client.
</p>
<p>2. Since your organization has disabled <a href="http://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App(OWA)</a>, please let some other users update to the same version as yours and check if the same issue happens.
</p>
<p>3. Let me know the Teams Coexistence mode. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, during my tests, I found that if I sign out Teams and only open Outlook desktop client, I cannot view the status of my contacts. So please make sure that both you and your contacts signed in Teams. Please feel free to post back
 if you have any update on it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

</p><p>For a couple of weeks, when I'd jump from one website to another, I'd get the small message box saying "Internet Explorer has stopped working..."&nbsp; It happened a lot.&nbsp; But if I clicked the box away, everything would continue on.&nbsp; Well, now my wireless internet
 has stopped working.&nbsp; I've tried system restore, driver updates and typed in Administrative command prompts as directed through a&nbsp;live chat with Microsoft.&nbsp; Still no wireless internet connection.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; I blame Windows 10, but I don't know.....Has anyone
 else had this problem?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you with the query.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I understand the inconvenience caused, n</span><span>ow that you have me with you let me take care of this.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This issue could have occurred due to</span><span> corrupted cache/cookies/browsing history stored in the browser.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:
</span>As an initial step, I suggest you to check the issue with a different browser and also try to clear the browser's cache/cookies/browsing&nbsp;history and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Delete and manage cookies</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong>:
<span>Let us try to </span><span>browse <strong>inPrivate </strong>mode and see if the issue persists.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>InPrivate Browsing helps prevent your browsing history, temporary Internet files, form data, cookies, and user names and passwords from being retained by the browser.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To open an InPrivate browsing window, you may use the
<strong>Ctrl+Shift+P</strong> keys.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: If the issue persist, let us try to reset Internet&nbsp;Explorer settings to return them to the state they were in when Internet&nbsp;Explorer
 was first installed on your PC. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems that might be caused by settings changed after installation. Resetting Internet&nbsp;Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></span></span></p>

            You have to clean install Windows 8.1. &nbsp;You cannot do an update. &nbsp;If you are trying to update Windows 10 to Windows 8.1 from the Store that is impossible. &nbsp;You need to use media from the link Deepak gives in his reply. &nbsp;You will need your 8.1 product key.

            Just to clarify Cbarnhost's reply - you need to restart <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span> boot from the USB and choose Install. &nbsp;You cannot mount the USB and then run setup from within Windows - that tries to do an upgrade, not a clean install, and will fail under these circumstances.

            You need to force the computer to boot from the USB. &nbsp;To do so generally requires going into the BIOS setup and making sure it is set to enable you to boot from USB and changing the BIOS boot order so that the USB device will be tried before the hard drive.
 The details of doing this are usually specific to the computer and its BIOS, so you'll need to look at the BIOS setup documentation for your computer.

    <title>run-time error 1004 from Workbooks&#40;&#41;.Close on Excel for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maffam  say:</h3>
<h2>            run-time error 1004 from Workbooks&#40;&#41;.Close on Excel for Mac 2011 on Lion</h2>
                    <p>I've searched this forum and elsewhere for a solution to this issue but I've failed to find one, so here goes:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the highest level, what I'm trying accomplish is:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>user opens .xltm file containing my macro&nbsp; </li><li>the macro opens a data file </li><li>fixes up the data (not shown below)&nbsp; </li><li>saves the result as .xlsm </li><li>closes the original .xltm&nbsp; </li><li>Excel (for Mac) is left open with the newly created .xlsm for the user&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>The code for that is included below.&nbsp; This all appears to work correctly on Excel 2011 on Windows XP and Windows 7 and so long as the macro does not attempt to close the original .xltm on Excel for Mac 2011 on Lion, it works correctly there too. The issue
 seems to occur only on Excel for Mac 2011 where an attempt to close the .xltm results in a 1004 error. The Excel for Mac 2011 has the latest update (14.1.4) but the problem still remains. I've attempted a number of workarounds, e.g. using ActiveWorkbook.Close,
 Workbook("name").Save before close, setting .Saved:=true, close with savechanges:=true or false and others but none have helped.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions someone might have as to what I'm doing incorrectly or what I might be able to do to work around the issue would be appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much.&nbsp; </p>

            Nope. I don't at all need to have a template. As discussed a few replies back, it is clear that I can get the same behavior with a .xlsm and the .xlsm is much more 'Finder friendly'. Are you suggesting that a .xlsb might not have the same close issue?
 I shall try that instead.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion.<br />

            Groovy! :D<br />
<br />
Was it like this straight out of the box or have you installed any programs or made any modifications?<br />
<br />
If it was like this from new you should return it to the retailer.<br />
<br />
If that's not an option try a hard reset (all data from phone memory will be lost).<br />
<br />
Hard reset:<br />
<br />
1. Switch off the phone.<br />
<br />
2. Hold down the following three buttons: Green (the call answer button), * button, and '3' button.<br />
<br />
3. While holding these buttons, hold the power button for a second to switch on the phone.<br />
<br />
4. Release when the phone shows the nokia hands logo or shows other signs of life like the language selection screen.<br />
<br />
It may take a few attempts and very flexible fingers!<br />
<br />
If that still fails to solve it you could try to reinstall the firmware at <a href="http://www.nokia.com/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.nokia.com/softwareupdate</a><br />
<br />
If all tat fails and you can't return it you will have to visit a nokia care point to get it repaired.<br />

            Oh, I forgot.<br />
I wonder why those two didn't come with FP2?<br />
If their releases are after N78 they should've been packed with FP2.<br />
Maybe because FP1 is more reliable and fast.

    <title>Macro to transfer Word Tables to Excel Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prkhan56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro to transfer Word Tables to Excel Options </h2>
                    
<div>Hello All, <br />
<p>I am using Office 2003/Windows XP. <br />
I have copied this macro from the newsgroup which transfers all Tables <br />
from the Active Document to Excel.</p>
<p>There is a column with the Heading “Date” in the Word Table. <br />
When the macro runs and transfes data to excel it changes some dates <br />
to mm/dd/yyyy and some to dd/mm/yyyy. <br />
I wish that the dates in the column with Heading “Date” should not <br />
change when it is transferred to Excel. My requirement is dd/mm/yyyy.</p>
<p>Secondly when the data is transferred the first row of each Table <br />
should be in Bold Format.</p>
<p>Can this be done? &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks <br />
Rashid Khan</p>

<h2>            Outlook - different calendars</h2>
                    <p>I just migrated to a new Windows 10's PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am its&nbsp;only user.&nbsp; I copied my Outlook files to the new PC's C:\Users\Admin\Documents\Outlook Files' folder.&nbsp; I then installed Outlook 2016 to the new PC. I opened Outlook and I didn't see any of my appointments
 or contacts. So, I went to File/Open &amp; export/Open Outlook Data File, and I navigated to C:\User\Admin\Documents\Outlook Files and selected Outlook.pst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I clicked open, I can see my appointments, etc. I also noticed that on Outlook's left pane, under "My Calendars", I have two calendars. One of them is "Calendar (This computer only)" and that&nbsp;calendar is blank. The other calendar is "Calendar" and
 that&nbsp;calendar has my appointments. The same is true of my Contacts windows. One the left pane, under "My Contacts" I have two contacts lists. One is "Contacts (This computer only)" and it has no contacts. The other contacts list is "Contacts" and it has all
 my contacts.&nbsp; Is this normal? I need to sync my Outlook with Google and I&nbsp;don't want to screw up and delete my contacts and appointments. Thanks.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Your gmail account is probably IMAP and its your default data file, so its calendar shows "This computer only" and is empty because your previous account was a POP account and used a PST that you opened. That calendar has your events, I'm betting.
<br />
<br />Open that calendar in a List view, select all the items by pressing Ctrl+a, then copy the selection to the IMAP calendar. Do the same for Contacts (and any other folder that contacts data in the PST) and your IMAP folder set should then contain everything. You can then remove the PST by right-clicking its root in Outlook and choosing Close.

            I think you are right, Brain. I just set up Gmail for my Outlook. Just to be clear: it is these "This computer only" files that I should erase? When I open these files in list view, I don't see any data there. Thanks. Dik

            You cannot erase those. Every default data file must have a certain complement of folders, including Inbox, Outbox, Drafts, Sent Items, Deleted Items, Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks, and Journal. Since IMAP cannot handle non-mail folders, Outlook still creates them, but marks them "This computer only" so you know they don't sync. What you can do is copy the contents of the PST data file calendar, contacts, etc. to the IMAP versions of those folders so all your data is in a single data file. 
<br />
<br />Just keep in mind that if you delete that IMAP account for any reason (like, say, to remove and re-add the account because of some problem), you'll lose the contents of those folders permanently. This is one reason why some people still have a PST data file to hold their calendar, contacts, and other non-mail folders, making a backup (copy) of that data file periodically. You can even change the default data file to be the PST so that the calendar and contacts folders there are the ones that contain active events. Your mail will still flow through the IMAP folders.

<p><span>Hmmm</span>...... So, (This computer only) files are connected to my non-email, IMAP account? Actually, I don't like to use Outlook for my emails.
 I prefer to use Outlook just for my calendar, personal contacts, and tasks. These are synced to my google account via.&nbsp;<span>gSyncit</span>.&nbsp; I keep these separate&nbsp;from my email. For email, I use Chrome to email directly
 from my&nbsp;<span>Gmail</span>&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
When I installed Outlook on my new PC, Outlook prompted me to set up my email. Not setting it up was not an option. I don't want to have two calendars, contacts lists, etc. It's too confusing. Since I don't use Outlook for my emails, isn't it possible to move
 all of my calendars, contacts, and tasks to these (This Computer only) files, and delete the other account? Or am I as I asking for&nbsp;<span>trouble</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if these are primitive questions. I actually don't know the difference between IMAP and POP accounts.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.<br />

            The "This computer only" folders are typically part of the IMAP folder set. I'm not familiar enough with gSynchit to know what Outlook presents when using it. Perhaps someone else knows it better than I.
<br />
<br />Outlook used to be configurable in a "no mail" arrangement, but Microsoft did away with that for Outlook 2016. Enough people expressed dissatisfaction that Microsoft will be bringing it back, first in the Insider builds, then generally.. You may have a version that can use it now. See this article for a lengthier explanation: <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/create-no-mail-account-outlook-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/create-no-mai...</a>

<p>Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That explains it. When I&nbsp;installed Outlook to my old computer, I didn't have to set up an email account.&nbsp; But, my university gave me a new copy of Outlook 2016 for my new computer and, when I tried to install it, my only option was to create it with an email
 account.&nbsp; Until I migrated to this new computer, I used Outlook strictly as a PIM. I had been doing this since the 1990's, and I want to go back to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted gSyncit and they&nbsp;told me that I can use it to sync to whatever files of my choosing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me that I can move all of my appointments, contacts, and tasks to the (This computer only) files. Then, I can go to Outlook's Account Settings to remove my email account which is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, and also the data files connected to that email
 account. Is that correct? Can you take a look at my screenshot? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Camera application on HTC P3450</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just bought a HTC Touch (P3450) with Windows Mobile 6.0 and it works OK with one exception.</p>
<p>It doesn't start the camera application despite all ways of accesing it.</p>
<p>I have tried from Start - Programs - Camera - nothing happend then I have checked the assignable buton on the right side and still no response.</p>
<p>The assignable button works if is set on other application to run, therefore doesn't seems to be a hardware problem.</p>
<p>It might be a driver problem or software one.</p>
<p>Did some of you encountered same problem and if yes - can you give me a hint?</p>
<p>Thank's</p>

<p>I have tried that and still no response. When I select Camera - it appears that rotating icon like it's start the application then in one second comes back to the initial background like nothing was selected.</p>
<p>I would go to service representatives in Romania but since I bought HTC two days ago from NY, I don't think that they will repair it under international guarantee.</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply and if you find something please let me know.</p>

            locate exe file in the windows folder. on my htc s620 it's called HTCCamera.exe. Tap to run it. If it works from there, copy a shortcut to the programs folder. If it doesn't, try a hard reset. You will lose all your data when doing that. so make sure you
 do a backup. Else you'll have to send it back for repairs. Check if you don't have a worldwide guaranty.

<p>I agree with Linley ... HARD RESET</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dans00, a hard reset will bring it back to factory default.&nbsp; Before you load anything check to see if the camera is working.&nbsp; If it is, then it is not your device and may well have been a piece of software you installed that overwrote a file.</p>

<h2>            MS Word Hyperlinks to create Page Navigation &#40;Next and Previous page&#41;</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0affb28c-6ce9-4a41-88f8-d210efea98e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0affb28c-6ce9-4a41-88f8-d210efea98e1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see in the above image, I've designed a Word Template that has this element in the header. I was able to link the first icon to ToC because that page will always be there. But the previous and next icons needs to be dynamic hyperlinks giving user
 ability to navigate within the document in the exported PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I could only find the following closest solutions:<br />
1. Create a bookmark everytime you create a page and edit that link to go to that bookmark (But in my case, it's in the 'header' and it'll be the same across, so I have to forego the header and have this repeated on every page)</p>
<p>2. Insert Hyperlinks to Headings (Same as above as it's not exactly dynamic)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any Macro Hyperlink that I can put on to these icons that will open the appropriate next or previous page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi, I think the best way to accomplish what you want to do is, insert MacroButtons or images with the forward and back arrows, into your header and then assign a macro to the click action of the buttons or images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code for the next page macro is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Selection.GoTo</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;What:=wdGoToPage, Which:=wdGoToNext</span><br />
<br />
The code for the previous page macro is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Selection.GoTo</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;What:=wdGoToPage, Which:=</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">wdGoToPrevious</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also the commands: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;wdGoToLast and wdGoToFirst</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;available to you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps . . .</p>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the emails you are sending are going to the Junk folders of your recipients. We suggest that you contact them and check if they have blocked your email address or have set up rules that would automatically process emails to be put in to the
 Junk folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems difficult to contact all customers :</p>
<p>
</p><p>We send more than 100 orders confirmations per day to customers with @hotmail, @outlook, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, if we send a communication about the spam issue... all customers will not read this mail... because it will be marked like spam...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is , why if 3 peoples (or little more) put a filter about our emails, affect all our emails we send ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Microsoft can't say what is going wrong with our orders confirmations emails ?</p>
<p>Why Microsoft don't do anything about this filters when i send 10 tickets, 5 phone calls, and 3 forms ?</p>
<p>Only bots respond to me (like "My name is Rajesh and I work with the Outlook.com Sender Support Team")... lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you a real contact to help us ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            It could be that the Junk email filter assesses the messages that you send as spam, based on several factors. These includes the time when the message was sent and the content of email. We suggest that you change the content of the messages that you are
 sending and see if the recipients received the email to their inbox.

<h2>            Word table&#47;column width cannot be changed when using non-Normal template</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a template for my client, and can't get the column widths of any Word table created in this template to change. They're fixed, and won't change width under any circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the case with files created with my normal.dotx file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the Tables' Properties in both files&nbsp;</strong><strong>are the same</strong></li><li><strong>when I paste a (adjustable) table from my normal-based file into a file created with the template, it becomes fixed, regardless of the Paste option used (merge, original, etc.)</strong></li></ul>
<p>So please, no instructions concerning basic Table Properties - the problem appears to be in the template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed this when working both in my personal Office365 Family environment, and within my client's Office365 for Business environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what should I be looking for in this template? Apart from this one problem, it's
<em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deeply frustrating</p>

            <p>Hi Matthew Lowry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the latest updates for your Office applications? To update, go to File &gt; Account then update now. Can you provide the current version of your Office?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you confirm if you opened your template on New &gt; Personal (Templates)? Then on your table, go to Table Properties. (Note*: this is on the template itself, on modifying the table properties)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6747fae3-6950-44df-9e97-4e4c3d8214f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6747fae3-6950-44df-9e97-4e4c3d8214f7" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the table properties, click on Columns tab then modify the size/preferred width.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, can you try creating a new template with tables, and then check the outcome?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I misunderstood your question, you may post a detailed description of the issue, as to how you created the table with screenshots, for us to better understand the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Thanks but no need - somewhere else, someone mentioned that having different even &amp; odd headings/footers could cause this. I changed my template to have the same header/footer on all pages, and the problem disappeared.</p>

<p><span>Which picture format did you use to insert the pictures which do not have the rotation handle? (.png, .bmp, .tiff etc).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ideally all types of pictures inserted in a Word document should have the rotation handle.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: usually the rotation handle appears at the top of the picture. Therefore if the picture orientation is changed the rotation
 handle position changes respectively. Ensure the pictures do not appear on the edge of the document.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Word 2013 space mark shows as box for web font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anabas910  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 space mark shows as box for web font</h2>
                    After I turn on Show/Hide to on to see paragraph or space markers, it works fine for fonts that are in Windows.<br />
<br />
I am trying to use a Hindi web font Bhaskar_WEB_Intro_Test_ship.ttf in word as there are not good looking Hindi fonts except Utsaah in Windows. Mangal font is ugly.
<br />
<br />
The space marker is shown properly for MS Font like Mangal or Utsaah but instead of showing a small dot for the space it shows a box (very similar to box shown for unknown char when you read something on the web).<br />
<br />
Since I am used to turn on Show button to see paragraph and space markers, I really cannot use the font as the line shows like a mess with boxes for all spaces instead of tiny dots that Word uses.<br />
<br />
Do you know a solution for this? It looks that there is some incompatibility in this font. What char # Word uses to display this tiny dot? May be I will ask font developer to change something if I know what to exactly tell them. This is a web font so there
 might lie a problem. So help is very much appreciated if you know how to get this fixed in the Web font to see the space markers properly.<br />
<br />
I do not know how to attach an image here otherwise I could shown with an example.&nbsp;

            <p>Unfortunately, some fonts are just designed this way, especially old, cheap, or free ones. I used to have this problem with the fonts that came with earlier versions of Corel Graphics; instead of purchasing commercial fonts, Corel created clones that were
 advertised as "similar to" the commercial fonts (with similar names), and they did tend to display this way. Some of them had very distracting representations of the paragraph mark as well. There is really nothing you can do about this except try to find a
 better font or, as you suggest, ask the font designer to change the space display character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until you get relief, what you might do is compose in some other Hindi font and then change to your preferred font when editing is complete.</p>

<h3> orangechad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2016 &#40;Win7&#41; will not display slides that contain photos</h2>
                    <p>I have a basic PowerPoint 2016 presentation that works just fine on my main office computer (Windows 10, PowerPoint 2016, fast computer, monitor with HDMI connection) but malfunctions with my other computer that I need to present on TOMORROW (Windows 7,
 PowerPoint 2016, slow computer, slow hard drive, television with VGA connection so people sitting across the room can see it - TV is running in decent resolution - 1300 something by 700 something).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I'm not talking about Red X image markers indicating that images aren't there.&nbsp; I'm talking about any slide that contains an image literally does not show up.&nbsp; Supposing slides A and C have only text, and slide B has a picture, PowerPoint appears
 to be "stuck" on slide A when it's supposed to display slide B, but internally it appears PowerPoint is still moving on, because if I keep clicking, eventually it advances onto slide C (so it goes straight from A to C).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer's slowness seems unlikely to be the issue, because slide transitions and animations are functioning perfectly well - the animation isn't even choppy (totally smooth, looks like 60fps or something).&nbsp; Even when the slide transition is something
 complicated like "wind" or "crunch" it's still as smooth as silk.&nbsp; So it would be difficult to believe that the TV, VGA connection or slow computer / hard drive is somehow making the images difficult to display when animations and transitions are having no
 trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also no issue with the saved file.&nbsp; I'm using Microsoft OneDrive to load the file, and the pictures show perfectly fine on my iPhone with Office for iOS, and of course as I mentioned above, perfectly fine on my office computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really crossing my fingers that people don't tell me the problem is Windows 7.&nbsp; That would be kind of like telling someone, "In order to get your new vacuum to work, you have to buy a new house."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully updated Office 2016 yesterday, and today I'm updating Windows 7 with 10 more updates (the computer was offline for a while).</p>

            <p>I seemed to have solved my own problem:&nbsp; the images were too large for the little amount of RAM I have in the slow computer (4GB).&nbsp; When I reduced the resolution of each image by enough, the presentation went smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, when I use the "change picture --&gt; from file" option and re-save the presentation with the smaller file being used instead of the larger one, the size of the presentation file goes UP, not down.&nbsp; Is PowerPoint saving the entire history of images
 used in each slide or something?</p>

<p>Hi Newhc,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I understand the inconvenience it caused, the root cause is that you cannot get over the spinning wheel after entering product key, and this happens to different machines. Here are some ideas:<br />
1. To rule out the Microsoft account impact, if possible you can register a new free Microsoft account and try again.</div>
<div>2. To make sure it's not a browser issue, check the browser related settings described in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/get-help-with-product-key-errors-on-office-com-setup-e5064f7b-2a8d-4e77-bd59-f1d828086851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get help with product key errors on Office.com/setup</a></div>
<div>3. If none of them works, the issue might be related to your product key itself. You can refer to this article<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/where-to-enter-your-office-product-key-0a82e5ae-739e-4b92-a6f4-2ec780c185db#bkmk_blockedkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Where to enter your Office product key</a>:<br />
&nbsp; a. Check "My product key isn't working" part to enter your product key using the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/virtual-agent/?partnerId=office&amp;flowId=office-content&amp;userInput=I%20need%20to%20download%20office%20using%20my%20product%20key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Virtual support agent</a> (English only).&nbsp;The Virtual support agent &nbsp; can also let you know if your product key has been blocked and can connect you to a live agent.
