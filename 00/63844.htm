            Hi Brittany.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does the charger still power the PC but not charge the battery?  If not remove the battery to check again, then if no power replace the charger with the manufacturer's part for that laptop.  Any imitation part will often not work, although you can take it to the Geek Squad and have them fit a Universal charger to see if it works and if so you can buy it.  But no matter how good you spec a replacement part on the web, cheap imitations mostly don't work.
<br />
<br />If the charger powers the PC but the battery won't charge the problem is the battery.  
<br />
<br />Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery. However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            This most probably is due to a faulty charger or a battery.

            <p>I do PC repair</p>
<p>Microsoft did something in windows 8x that caused mouse problems, and they never fixed it in 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>unfortunately windows10 takes control away from the user as far as driver or software updates, so it cant be fixed by trying different drivers because windows 10 will just put the broken driver that IT wants back in there all over again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend rolling back to your previous OS until such a time when either </p>
<p>Microsoft figures out how to get decent hardware comparability in windows 10, or</p>
<p>stops forcing us to use drivers that are having problems, and allow us to fix drivers again</p>

            <p>Hello Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot and check.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I have had this problem since I upgraded to Windows 10 on my PC (from Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Constant freezing, sometimes every 5-10 minutes, makes it impossible to work. I've narrowed the issue down to the mouse as well (there is no information in the Event Viewer) and the annoying thing is that the mouse I am currently using is a Microsoft one!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest drivers, but still the system freezes up completely on a regular basis. So far today I have been able to get away with removing the mouse and plugging it back in again. This unfreezes the system and allows me to work until the next freeze
 occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are not slight lags, the whole system stops responding! I can't type, I can't use keyboard shortcuts - ctrl, alt, del doesn't work. I have had to keep powering off my computer and restarting it and this is causing me to have to carry out regular disk
 checks too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot write Win10 drivers for your own Microsoft USB Intellimouse Optical, then what chance does anyone else have?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any solutions for these mouse problems, that seem to be widespread?</p>

            <p>I'm getting occasional mouse freezes (about every other day), but I cannot revert to an earlier version of Windows because my new computer came with Windows 10 installed when new.&nbsp; The only solution is to turn the power off and restart the computer, but
 if important programs are running the data can be lost.</p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to carry out a completely clean install of Windows 10 and have had a lot fewer problems since, although there are still very occasional freeze-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't had this problem from the start, it might not be the mouse, but another driver that causes the system to freeze up and it may be that a driver installed by Windows Update is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I found that it was better to install Realtek drivers from my motherboard manufacturer's website, even thought they were only written for Windows 7! The ones that Windows Update was installing caused all sorts of chop and stuttering. I installed
 them in compatibility mode and have ignored the updates since.... of course, this is only possible with Windows 10 Pro, because Microsoft forces Home users to install their updates!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it might be worth visiting your laptop manufacturer's website to see if
<strong>they </strong>have released any drivers and to install them instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reece</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Errors After Troubleshooting &#38; Community Board Search</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem</span></p>
<p>I recently discovered that Windows has not been updating without a "Failure" since August of 2015 (it's March 3rd 2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try troubleshooting I come up with the error code:&nbsp;80246008.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Troubleshooting so far</span></p>
<p>I have found multiple <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/windows-update-error-80246008/41f8c5c9-42d1-4d10-93cf-46b9e913f2fd">
boards </a>in the Community on this error and a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-error-80246008#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How-To page</a>&nbsp;regarding this particular error. I believe the issue could also be Norton related a<a href="https://community.norton.com/en/forums/uninstalling-nis-norton-removal-tool-breaks-windows-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">s another board
</a>suggests that a Norton Removal tool (which I recall using long ago) might effect Windows Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions on the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-error-80246008#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How-To page</a>. &nbsp;The problem is when I get to this instruction: "5. Next to Service status, check to see if the service is started. If it's not, click Start." I get the following error message: "Windows &nbsp;could not start the Background Intelligent Transfer
 Service on Local Computer. &nbsp;For more information, review the System Event Log. &nbsp;If this is a no-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code -2147024894</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the Update Troubleshooter. &nbsp;It came up with the following message: &nbsp;"Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found. &nbsp;You can find more details below." &nbsp;Below: "Windows Update components must be repaired."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My laptop</span></p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite with Windows 8.1 and Avast Security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should also note that I am unable to install updates of my Toshiba. &nbsp;I called customer assistance but they won't help me unless I pay $50+ for a diagnostic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does anyone have any idea of how to fix this issue? &nbsp;Clearly something is up with BITS but I am not computer literate enough to fix it myself.&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Yes, I am sorry, I tried running that as well. &nbsp;But Thank You for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>It found multiple errors that it fixed except one. It reads:</p>
<p>"Problems installing recent updates" &nbsp;and then in the next column reads "Not Fixed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Windows Update is still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be I could not even enter the Windows Update screen from the Control Panel. &nbsp;Now I can but when I hit "check for updates" it just endlessly loops that it is searching. &nbsp;I have left it on for over an hour before. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Try disabling the Avasf "Shields" when you want to update. You can do that by right clicking the Avast icon on the taskbar which will give you a menu where you can disable them for an hour or until you restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the problems with security software these days is that they tend to go overboard in their quest for absolute security whereby as soon as they detect that an installation attempt is being made, various modules spring into action to scan what's happening.
 Any delays in a Windows update attempt will result in it terminating though. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be worth your while checking Windows for file corruption as well. That can also interfere with the way updates behave. To perform that task proceed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<p>
</p><li>Right click the Start button and click Command Prompt (admin).</li><li>Type: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>SFC is an acronym for System File Checker and the tool will check the integrity of Windows system files for corruption. If any are found, it will attempt to repair the file using the DLL repository.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes though, SFC cannot repair files and you'll see a message to the effect that file corruption was found, but Windows resource protection was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that event, use the same command prompt to run the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>When DISM runs, you won't see much happening in screen and for about five minutes, it'll just show a flashing cursor. But eventually, the figure of 20% will appear followed about 15 mins later by 100%. You'll also get a report on whether the tool was successful
 or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on please.</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you so much for trying to help me with this. &nbsp;I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you said. &nbsp;the sfc/scannow came up with: "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. &nbsp;Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. &nbsp;For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. &nbsp;Note that
 logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios."</p>
<p>
</p><p>the DISM.exe command came up with: "DISM failed. &nbsp;No operation was performed. &nbsp;For more information, review the log file. &nbsp;The DISM log file can be found at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried turning off the "Shields" both before and after completing these steps. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Not good news. You're probably seeing error <span>0x800f081f which translates to CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING. In layman's terms that means DISM can't find the components necessary to perform the repair.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run this Fixit to reset the Windows Update components and then try and run the same DISM command again:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you upload the <strong>dism.log</strong> file which you'll find at the following location to your OneDrive / Shared folder account and post the link to it here please:
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">C:\Windows\Logs\DISM</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>A quick route there is to hit Windows key + R to open the Run command and then copy/paste the path and click OK. Saves all that navigating.

            <p>I downloaded the Fixit program and ran it first selecting Windows Update. &nbsp;The program remained in "Resolving Problems" for a little over an hour, so I gave up on that. &nbsp;Then I re-ran the program and selected the BITS option. &nbsp;That resulted in one fixed
 item (Windows Update error 0x80070057(2016-03-18-T-10_40_09A) and one Not Fixed item (Problems installing recent updates). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran the DISM command again. &nbsp;Received message: "Error:0x80240021 &nbsp; &nbsp;DISM Failed. &nbsp;No operation was performed. &nbsp;For more information, review the log fie."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The log can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=F625654B84E3F9F7!7523&amp;authkey=!AP18t4ru0YjcRZE&amp;ithint=file%2clog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=F625654B84E3F9F7!7523&amp;authkey=!AP18t4ru0YjcRZE&amp;ithint=file%2clog&nbsp;</a></p>

</p><p>It looks to me like you typed the command without inserting spaces at the appropriate places.

<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do here is to copy and then paste it using a mouse. You have to paste the command using a mouse right click though since Ctrl+V won't work in a command prompt.

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 7 plays tracks in wrong order - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 7 plays tracks in wrong order</h2>
                    
<p>Taking an album bought from Amazon as an example, the tracks play in this order:</p>
<p>09 10<br />
02<br />
03 04 05 06 07<br />
01<br />
08</p>
<p>If I look at each file in Windows Explorer I can see that Explorer thinks that they are tagged properly (right click / properties / detail shows the track numbers correctly).</p>
<p>I'm playing the files by dragging the directory containing the files (which is on an SMB share on another PC) onto WMP.&nbsp; If I copy the files to other devices I don't get the same problem - my Blackberry and my Sansa E180 both honour the disk and track numbers
 and play in disk / track order.</p>

<p>If you play the files from within WMP's library, then they should be played in the correct order. To add the files, click&nbsp;<strong>Organize
</strong>in the library, select&nbsp; <strong>Manage libraries</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Music</strong> , and add the directory containing the files to the list.</p>
<p>If the files are sorted correctly in Windows Explorer, then playing them by clicking&nbsp;<strong>Play all</strong> (near the top) might help too.</p>

            There has to be an FN key on your keyboard. The letters on the key are usually a different color than the rest of the keys. Mine is Orange and beside the Ctrl key. Look closely, you'll find it.&nbsp;

<h2>            Kernel-Power Event 41 Category &#40;63&#41; - Desktop Freezes Frequently Until Hard Reboot</h2>
                    <div><b>Update (Fixed):</b>&nbsp;It ended up being bad RAM. Somehow my RAM evaded the Windows memory test (a few times) and even the first test of Memtest86. Second time I ran Memtest86 it caught the error after a couple of errors. Replaced the RAM and everything
 seems to be running fine now. Thanks for all the help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I've been having the problem for a few weeks now and it is becoming more frequent.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Originally the computer would only freeze after being idle for a couple of hours. But eventually it began freezing during use once or twice a day, and now freezes every hour or so. When the computer freezes things typically become sluggish for a few seconds,
 then everything but the mouse becomes completely unresponsive, then after a few more seconds the mouse freezes too. The only way I can continue and by pressing and holding the power button and doing a hard boot. I feel it's worth noting if I try to reboot
 my computer with the quick-reset button on my case Windows does not boot successfully. I get an error message about an incorrect boot device, hard booting does not cause this problem. Not sure if it is related but I felt it was worth mentioning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have a problem where my D drive will occasional disconnect and reconnect. I have my system set up with Windows installed on a SSD C:/ drive with my program/user files living on my D drive. About a month ago my D:/ would randomly disconnect and immediately
 reconnect causing no real problems other than interrupting file transfers and backups. I haven't had this problem in a while now, but I have also been trying to avoid using the D drive but again it might be related so I felt it was worth mentioning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read a few other topics in community here and the biggest recommendation was to perform a clean boot. I've done that following the instructions here (disabling all but Microsoft's services) and my computer has still crashed at least 3 times in the
 last few hours. I've begun uninstalling program I think might be causing the problem (Google Hangouts, Chrome, iTunes) with no luck yet. I have also tried disabling my audio drivers (I have 4) as those supposedly cause problems on occasion too. But still no
 luck. Any help would be appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently was running Task Manager, Process Explorer, and Resource Monitor to log what was happening when my computer froze up. I was playing "Worms Revolution" at the time but I don't believe that is what caused the problem since the computer has crashed
 many times without it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I took pictures of the screens, sorry for the low-resolution. It was the only option since print screen doesn't work for obvious reasons. What sticks out to me is the disk section is completely blank, which I do not believe it was before.</div>

            Hi Joey,<br />
<br />
<span>This scenario usually indicates a problem with the hardware. Or, the driver can cause this problem. To help isolate the problem, check the following items:&nbsp;</span>
<p><strong><span><br />
1. Overclocking</span></strong><span>: Disable overclocking to see whether the issue occurs when the system is run at the correct speed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Check the memory</span></strong><span>: Verify the memory by using a memory checker. Verify that each memory chip is
 the same speed and that it is configured correctly in the system.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Power supply</span></strong><span>: Make sure that the power supply has enough wattage to appropriately handle the
 installed devices. If you added memory, installed a newer processor, installed additional drives, or added external devices, such devices can require more energy than the current power supply can provide consistently.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>4. Overheating</span></strong><span>: Check whether the system is overheating by examining the internal temperature of
 the hardware.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>5. Defaults</span></strong><span>: Use system defaults, and run the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you see that the computer generates a Stop error that contains a BugcheckCode value that is not reported in an event ID 41, change the restart behavior for the computer. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Right-click <strong>Computer</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click&nbsp;<strong>Advanced system settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4. In the&nbsp;<strong>Startup and Recovery&nbsp;</strong>section, click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click to clear the&nbsp;<strong>Automatically restart&nbsp;</strong>check box.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

            <b>1. Overclocking</b>&nbsp;- I haven't done any over clocking so that can't be it.
<div><b>2. Check the memory</b>&nbsp;- Checked the memory using my Windows install disc, everything checks out.</div>
<div><b>3. Power supply</b>&nbsp;- This could very likely be it. I'm running with 4 drives (3 HDD, 1 SSD), GTX 670 graphics card, and AverMedia capture card, 8GB RAM, 4 monitors (do more monitors require more power?) and a handful of USB peripherals. I have an 850W
 PSU and from the calculator tools I found online I should only need 750W. Is there a better way to check how much power I'm actually using? And why would sometimes my computer crash when doing nothing, but sometimes crash while playing games at seemingly random
 times? Bottomline is what's the most efficient way I can check if this is the problem?</div>
<div><b>4. Overheat</b>&nbsp;- I'm running speccy now, everything seems to be at a good temperatures but I'll keep watching it in case something fishy pops up.</div>
<div><b>5. Defauls</b>&nbsp;- When you say system defaults what do you mean, defaults for what? I'm running my BIOS defaults, and running in "clean boot" mode on Windows 7. I am running the Balanced power plan from the Windows settings. (I do have it set so that
 my monitor stats on indefinitely, but just for now so that when my computer freezes I can read my system monitors left up).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have disabled the <b>Automatically restart</b>&nbsp;function as per your instructions. Although when the computer freezes it doesn't reboot or anything. It will stay frozen on whatever was up with until I manually reboot the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help!</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Update 8/3/2013 10:47PM EST:</b></div>
<div>My computer froze again since I made this post. It has crashed twice since then. The first time it crashed I came home to this screen.&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/NQw9U27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/NQw9U27</a>&nbsp;I rebooted my computer just fine about
 half an hour passed and it froze again while watching a YouTube video. Rather than completely freezing the audio became extremely slow and "robotic" sounding. But was still definitely coming from the video. In hindsight I should have waited it out to see what
 would happen over time, but I decided to reboot the computer instead.</div>

            Yes, Vijay linked me there. Unfortunately it didn't help. I have however pulled the Kernel-Power critical event's details if they can help solve this problem.

<h2>            Updated Network Adapter and now it won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I have Toshiba Satellite, network adapter: Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Network adapter has a very weak signal compared to all the other computers in my house, and this is a brand new laptop. I updated the driver and it appeared to be a stronger signal but the new network adapter is dropping the signal and won't display
 a webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back the driver and now it works again, but again at a very weak signal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some of the information of the updated driver that isn't working properly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service vwifibus for Device Instance ID PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_4365&amp;SUBSYS_21551A3B&amp;REV_01\0000DDFFFF0628C200 with the following status: 0.</p>

<p>Is it still telling you it's corrupted? Try going into you're attached email account and resetting the password, if this is still a problem you may have to try recovering your gamer tag without the hdd plugged in if possible.</p>

<h3> di-r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set up Windows Speech Recognition in French</h2>
                    I have read that Windows Speech Recognition is available in a multitude of languages, including French, but have yet to find out how to do this. As I use both English and French, it would be helpful to dictate in French as well, but I haven't het foudn
 out how to turn the speech recognition to French (and I'm not sure if it's worth adding all of those French words tot he English Custom Dictionary...). How may I accomplish using both languages? Changing the language bar to French does not work, and I am unsure
 how to chang the language of the computer itself to try that out (it is currently in English).<br />
As background information, I have taken the tutorial and set it up in English and have been using it for a while, but I did not once see another language option.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Windows Speech Recognition is available only when the language of the operating system matches the language of Windows Speech Recognition. In Windows Vista Ultimate, you can change the language of the operating system by installing a language pack from Windows
 Update. If you install the language pack of a supported Windows Speech Recognition language, you can then use Windows Speech Recognition for that language if that is also the language of the operating system.<br />
<br />
Check the article “The Windows Speech Recognition language must be the same as the operating system language in Windows Vista”
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934377</a>
<br />
<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/How-do-I-get-additional-language-files</a>
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong></em> Multilingual User Interface Pack(MUIs) require a license to be used and are only available with Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows Vista Enterprise. If you are using Windows Vista Ultimate, you can download MUIs by using Windows
 Update. If you are using Windows Vista Enterprise, contact your system administrator for information about installing additional languages. Also you cannot switch between languages for Windows Speech recognition.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the Windows network diagnostic tool which can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings that could cause issues with network. Right click on the network icon in the notification area and click on 'Troubleshoot'.
 If that didn't help, I would suggest you to visit the PC manufacturer's website from a different PC to download the network adapter drivers available for the latest Windows operating system and install it in compatibility mode in your PC and check if the issue
 persists. Let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

            <p>Greetings smoff, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not entirely. I've spent many hours with the techs at Microsoft and they are at a loss. The problem seems to be related to several things occurring at the same time. For one, my HP desktop runs on an AMD chip and until recently, the AMD update was causing
 the connection to be dropped. That now appears to be fixed and I can recommend the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, do not rely on Microsoft's word on updates for anything else that has to do with your drivers; thankfully, HP has now stepped out and has a page dedicated to help with inconsistencies with the Win10 update. In all fairness, I cannot blame Microsoft
 for this situation, as there are too many computer manufacturers out there for a one size fits all driver update. Go to your computer manufacturer's support page and see if they offer help; anything recently posted will only serve to help. Do not rely on any
 of those programs out there for driver updates. I've run into problems with their recommendations. Stick with Microsoft and your computer manufacturer and you can also Google search the forums out there that offer further information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem lies within my router. I just purchased a new router prior to the Win10 update and I discovered that part of the problem lies with its driver. I've updated the router's firmware, which helped, along with using an app to determine the best
 channel for the driver to function. Although, all this helps, the router still occasionally drops the connection. My opinion is that there is some conflict between Win10 and my router that is simply not copacetic. I'm planning on upgrading soon to a dual band
 router with a few more bells and whistles and see if that helps. </p>
<br />
<p>One other item: some folks have complained that Windows updates are installed automatically, but that's not the case. Once a day, I'll go into Settings and check for updates. Since I no longer have the capacity to allow my computer to go into sleep mode,
 and I have to turn my computer off manually every night, the updates won't install automatically. One solution is to change the time to an earlier one for installation, but again, if your computer won't sleep or hibernate, there could be a conflict. Updates
 always help so be watchful for that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Keep us updated on your progress, as sharing info always makes a difference.
</p>

Intermittent network connection might occur due to outdated network driver. It might also happen due to corrupt TCP/IP settings for the wireless network or conflict from other applications running on the laptop.

            <p>Hi Anthony/Jose, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried both of those methods and they did not work. What would help tremendously is for Microsoft to look deeper into the problem, because there are too many of us out here who are trying everything possible without a resolution. Also, updates
 regarding the power management aspect of Win10 would be helpful, since I still have to turn off my computer every night. Screensavers don't work, sleep/hibernate won't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to say it, but it's been 3 months since Win10 came out and we're still left with a buggy OS. Thanks,
</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these methods, provided below, to fix your issue:
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong><br />
<br />
Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard, then reboot and restart your system and check, if it helps you.

<br />
If the issue still persists, follow the method 2.</span></span></p>

<span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Power troubleshooter:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep
 mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
1. Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press Enter.<br />
2. Select Troubleshooting. Click on view all and select Power.<br />
3. Click next and follow the on-screen instructions. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue still persists, follow the method 3.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3:</span> </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Restore Power Option Settings.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to restore default settings of power plan and check, if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>1. Press Windows + X, and select the option Control Panel.<br />
2. Click on the Power Options icon.<br />

<h2>            Cannot convert Local user account to Microsoft user account and install latest updates in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: WINDOWS 10 &amp; MS ACCOUNT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen multiple posts here in the MS forum and elsewhere, but nothing seems to apply. &nbsp;I am currently running Build 10240 on an HP desktop PC. &nbsp;I know this is an old build, and that's part of my problem, Win10 won't update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen indications that I need to be logged into my MSA for Win10 to update. &nbsp;I updated to Win10 using a local account. &nbsp;I attempted to create a new account and had to use CMD&gt; net user /add. &nbsp;I was able to create a new account, but neither of my 2
 accounts (admin privileges) will let me "sign in with a MSA instead".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I have tried to link to the MSA results in a blank new window (black like a CMD Prompt window) that appears for ~10 sec and then disappears. &nbsp;I have attempted Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in with a MSA instead; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Add an account;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings
 &gt; Accounts &gt; Add a work or school account; Cortana &gt; Sign In; &nbsp;Settings &gt;Updates &gt; Advanced &gt; Get Insider Preview builds; and several others. &nbsp;Nothing will allow me to log into my MSA. &nbsp;If I open a browser (Edge doesn't work!), I can access my MSA without
 any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am leaning toward rebuilding the bloody box and going back to Win 7!</p>

<p>Hello Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span>There are many reasons why you might receive an error message when updating on Windows 10,
</span><span>but common errors can be fixed by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This troubleshooter automatically diagnoses and repairs common problems with Windows Update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click on <em><strong>Start</strong></em>, then search for <em><strong>Control Panel</strong></em> and click on it.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the Control Panel window, search for <em><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></em> and click on it.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the left pane, click on <em><strong>View all</strong></em>. Select
<em><strong>Windows Update.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on <em><strong>Next </strong></em>and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Manually Reset Windows Update Components</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might also occur due to corruption in Windows Update component files. We suggest to manually reset the Windows Update Components, refer to the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article.</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, proceed to method 3.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3: Download the KB update using Microsoft Update Catalog</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download and install KB4025342 using Microsoft Update Catalog on this <strong>
</strong><strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4038782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you want to directly boot to the desktop screen, you need to disable the login screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Anybody who turns the computer on can get into the desktop screen directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open <strong>Run</strong> command box by simultaneously pressing Windows logo and R keys (Windows+R). In the Run dialog box, type
<strong>Netplwiz</strong> and then press Enter key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will be prompted with the <strong>User Accounts</strong> dialog, select your user account first and then uncheck the option labelled
<strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong> at the top.
</p>
<p>Click <strong>Apply</strong> button to see <strong>Automatically sign in</strong> box.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> On the "<strong>Automatically sign in</strong> <strong>
box" </strong>confirm your credentials and then click OK. Restart the computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1607 Boot Up Issues With Starting Watch Dog Initialization</h2>
                    <p>Upon installing recent updates, my computer is not having issues booting up and it freezes before ever loading to the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After powering on the system, the vendor logo appears and it looks like it will start to boot up. &nbsp;Then the screen flashes and the logo goes away but the circle of dots for loading appears again on its own and continues it motion. &nbsp;The screen flashes again
 and the same thing happens. &nbsp;Then the Start Watch Dog Initialization program starts. &nbsp;It completes a Phase 0 and Phase 1. &nbsp;After Phase 1 has completed, nothing further happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system stops booting up and the system sits there with no further action. &nbsp;Forcing a reboot only causes the cycle to begin again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ISO file that contains Windows 10 1511 2 English x64. &nbsp;When I insert that, I can finally boot up the computer to login. &nbsp;The computer is very slow to load anything though, taking 30 seconds or more just to bring up the login pane, going to a green
 screen with the load circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the glare, Screen shot of the loaded Watch Dog Screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32803108-396e-4c7a-9adb-7916d5a2cbcf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32803108-396e-4c7a-9adb-7916d5a2cbcf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any resolution to this issue?</p>

            <p>Early this week, my&nbsp;PC (Acer All-in-One) faced same issue right after updates restarting. After some research, I found out that Watch Dog initialization is part of AVG anti-virus.
</p>
<p>Following might help to fix the issue. (using AVG rescue tool to disable and remove)</p>

<p>Exactly, I paid for 2 years of this AVG program and now I have to uninstall it just to get my computer to boot?&nbsp; Isn't that the same as malware?<br />

            <p>Hi Larry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response which is very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the company's I work for now has skype for business with their new IT package but we are really struggling to make it work.&nbsp; The company has only 6 sites and so from my previous use of skype for business should work fine but the sites keeping dropping
 out of the meeting or they lose video or voice or both.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The IT person says that it is only video capable for 5 sites? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise would be gratefully received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lisa</p>

            <p><span>Hi Lisa,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there are more than five participants in a video call, video of only the most active participants appears in the top row, and a picture appears for the other participants</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To better understand your situation, we need to collect some information below:<br />
1. Does “6 sites” mean 6 participants?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Screenshots about “they lose video”. You can capture two screenshots,
<strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> they lose video so that we can compare them.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does it occur only when there are more than five participants in the video call?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Larry</span></p>
