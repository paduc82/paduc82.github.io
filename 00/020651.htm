<h2>            How to stop receiving unwanted messages in Outlook.com.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Blocked Senders List Ineffective Due to Outlook's System Configuration -- Upgrade Required, Please</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook's Blocked Senders filter feature is of no use when the senders are robo-spam mailers that send every item from a different name@domain. I have hundreds of junk emails from a Canandian **** offering **** pills, despite my assiduous efforts to make
 sure each address is moved to the Blocked Senders list -- tedious, one-at-at-time effort. As a result, my blocked senders list is comprised of one- and two-letter variations of addresses that look like this: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** Outlook's filters would
 be actually effective if it were possible to enter the readable name that appears in the "FROM" field, such as Canadian **** and **** RX and Candanian RX -- to name the three identities that keep using these thousands of randomly generated domain names. In
 short, blocking a domain address (&nbsp;Removed for privacy&nbsp;) is not effective because spam generators change it at every mailing. The effective thing would be to create a system where we, the users, could enter the visible name (or even subject line) in order
 to prevent this daily pornographic assault from filling up our junk folder --a folder that still must "scanned" by a human (me) and deleted by a human (me). Is it too much to note that Gmail does not have this problem? Looking forward to a speedy upgrade that
 will help everyone tied to your product due to institutional requirements. Best Regards, (removed PII)</p>

                    <p>I've noticed that I'm now getting restart scheduled notifications several times per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens whether I've applied updates and restarted or if no updates have been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several times, I've looked to see what's new and usually find that it's not been updated that day or just had the Defender update (which can happen several times per day).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this is because of the dual boot. To all intents and purposes you have 2 completely separate computers, each with it's own operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation also has to do with the licensing requirements of the third party software. Some licenses&nbsp;allow multiple installations and others require purchasing a separate license for each installation.</p>

            I've been having a similar problem - but I get a lot of the direct emails with marketing and other nonsense from Twitter. I just don't get the password reset links.&nbsp;They block my yahoo.com password links as well. I have all twitter email addresses that
 I have been able to find, along with the twitter.com domain, in my safe senders list. And there are no senders or domains in my blocked senders list. So I think this is an issue with the spam filters at the upper level, where us users can't get in the way
 and actually interfere with what microsoft is trying to do. Not helpful, I'm afraid, but I hope you'll get a useful response sometime!

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I understand you are getting spammed by newsletters and update from twitter but had difficulties getting the password reset&nbsp;for it which also
 happens for yahoo. You have tried to add to twitter to safe senders list but same happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Just to clarify, getting newsletters and updates from twitter to your mail rely heavily on the number of tweets you are subscribed to and this
 is by design. This is also a clear evidence that you are getting mails from twitter which means issues receiving a password reset from them may need to be addressed by the twitter team.

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With regards to the yahoo password reset, you may need to add yahoo on your safe senders list or check if there are any mail rules set to delete
 yahoo mails or all mails containing password reset. You may follow the guide below to check;

<p>
</p><p>It seems it was a problem at the twitter end.&nbsp; I don't know what it was but I bombarded them with 2 emails a day for 2 weeks and they finally sorted it.&nbsp; All my settings were correct and they weren't blocked.&nbsp; I'm afraid you need to get the twitter end to
 sort it.&nbsp; </p>

            I've been having the same issue since 16215, no luck with the workaround. I thought about removing all .Net versions on my machine but if I did and couldn't reinstall them not much would work. I'll wait for Microsoft to figure out how to make Windows work

<p>Hi SP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bit late in replying but rather busy, sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's likely that you have some <strong>MS Visual C++ Redistributable Xxx</strong> packages installed on your system that you might have to remove. Look under
<strong>Control Panel-&gt;Programs-&gt;Programs and Features</strong> and if any, remove one by one starting with the oldest . Of course, this will/might&nbsp; mean that some software will no longer work *) and you may have to reinstall that in order to get functionality
 back. Do think about whether it's really that important that you have that rather old software installed at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*) Failure is likely indicated by 'Missing MSVCxxx.dll' messageboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS New Build maybe as soon as tomorrow, so choosing to wait and see if that fixes it, might also be a good idea.</p>

</p><blockquote>I removed all <strong>MS Visual C++ Redistributable Xxx packages

<p>Ok, that means that either (a) the message has let unto a wild goose chase and the offending software is still on your system or, (b), we did remove it but WU is not as yet 'aware' of the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is a slim chance that a 'reset' of the WU might help you (various threads on how to go about this). But frankly, I advise to give up at this point and do a
<strong>Clean Install (CI)</strong>, i.e. rebuild your system from scratch. This has the advantage of being virtually guaranteed to work and it is also the only way to get rid of any corruption and/or 'digital dust' one cannot help but accumulate over time.
 You might well find that your machine will run noticeably better after this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are plenty of threads on how to do a <strong>CI</strong>, so I'd rather not go into how to do this, but do post if you are in trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS As always, DO make sure you have a valid backup before you start re-installing</p>

            Not much point doing a clean install again. When I did last time, 16226 installed but I couldn't install anything else. I will wait for Microsoft to make a version that is compatible with its own software. Updates paused.<br />

    <title>Open a Form in Multiple Tabs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manuels49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open a Form in Multiple Tabs</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I'm not sure whether this is even possible in Access, but here goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dashboard form that, amongst other data, contains a list of projects.&nbsp; The project name is a hyperlink and when the hyperlink is clicked, a separate form containing&nbsp;the details of the project &nbsp;opens in a new tab.&nbsp; What I'd like&nbsp;to have is for a
 new instance of the detailed project form open in a new tab each time the user clicks on a project on the Dashboard form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you could have the Dashboard, plus Project 1, Project 2, Project 3, etc.&nbsp;all open in separate tabs.&nbsp; Note that Project 1, 2, 3... forms are all the SAME form, just different instances.&nbsp; I'm hoping that it's possible to open multiple instances of the
 a single form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?&nbsp; What's the best way to accomplish what I'm trying to accomplish without creating multiple project detail forms (which I don't want to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's done by adding each instance of the form to a collection.&nbsp; The following module demonstrates this by opening multiple instances of a form, one for each company.&nbsp; In this case the code is designed to show the forms in stacked windows, but if the
 StackCompanyForms function is called in a database using tabbed documents each will open in a separate tab.&nbsp; Note that the collection must be decalred at module level, not in a function or procedure:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Next n<br />
<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function StackCompanyForms()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Const conSQL = "SELECT * FROM Companies Order By Company"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim dbs As DAO.Database, rst As DAO.Recordset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Integer<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set dbs = CurrentDb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rst = dbs.OpenRecordset(conSQL)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While Not rst.EOF<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set frm = New Form_frmCompanies<br />

            <p>Are you referring to a Tab control on your dashboard? If so, I don't think you CAN do this unless you have already setup hidden tabs with a subform control pointing to the same source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, as Ken's example shows, you can have the same form opened separately multiple times. This would be a good example where using the tabbed documents interface works better than overlapping windows.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ken, Thanks for the code... I'm able to appropriate the code to open multiple instances of regular forms, but the code doesn't seem to work for Navigation forms (and, as luck would have it, that's the type of form I'm hoping to open in this fashion).&nbsp; Why
 don't Nav forms work?&nbsp; Is it a matter of&nbsp;tweaking the code?&nbsp;Any work-arounds or other ideas that you can suggest?</p>

            Navigation Forms (which I don't really like) are actually subforms on a main form. That is probably why the code won't work. Again, I don't think you can actually generate new subforms in code.

<h2>            Arbitration Mailbox &#38; Discoversearchmailbox</h2>
                    
<p>we have ex 2010 &amp; ex 2013 servers in a single domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;exchange 2010 standalone server with all the roles installed.</p>
<p>exchange 2013 are 5 nos. &nbsp; 3nos are mailbox &amp; 2nos are cas.</p>
<p>i have migrated all the user mailboxes form ex 2010 to ex 2013. (note:we are going to decommission the ex 2010)</p>
<p>i have one discoverysearchmailbox, &nbsp;which is &nbsp;in 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no&nbsp;discoverysearchmailbox in ex 2013.</p>
<p>note:you can’t use the exchange admin center (eac) because discovery mailboxes aren’t displayed in the eac.</p>
<p>if i dont have discoverysearchmailbox in 2013,then do i need to move from 2010 to the 2013 or i need to create a new\fresh discoverysearchmailbox in 2013 exchange servers.we are going to decommissioning the exchange 2010 server.</p>
<p>as i mentioned,we have 5 exchange servers in my topology,the ex 2013 servers will have any discoverysearchmailboxes by default?</p>

<p>what about the arbitration mailboxes. should i move the arbitration mailboxes from ex 2010 to ex 2013.is it mandatory&gt;</p>

<p>Based on my research, Exchange Server 2013 Setup creates a discovery mailbox by default.<br />

<p>Hi Hari,</p>
<p>In this case, we don’t move any other mailboxes from local Exchange 2010 to Exchange 2013. I’d suggest that create a new fresh eDiscovery mailbox on Exchange2013 server.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Hari,</p>
<p>It’s good to create the eDiscovery mailbox on Exchange 2013 side. For the arbitration mailbox part, we don’t need to migration to Exchange 2013. If you also have any local Exchange Server issues and questions, please move forward to our<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-us/home?forum=exchangesvravailabilityandisasterrecovery%2Cexchangesvrmobility%2CExch2016SD%2CExch2016GD%2Cexchangesvrsecuremessaging%2Cexchangesvrsharingcollab%2Cexchangesvrdevelopment%2Cexchangesvrgeneral%2Cexchangesvrclients%2Cexchangesvr3rdpartyapps%2Cexchangesvrdeploy%2CExch2016HADR%2Cexchangesvradmin%2Cexchangesvrunifiedmessaging&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have used my student e-mail address to be able to use Office 365. I can do so online, but have also downloaded it. Still I cannot edit my documents anymore. I was able to, but my laptop (Mac) had to be wiped completely. So now I am trying to get (firstly)
 my Office Word to work.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I have to do.</p>
<p>It just says that my account is not able to edit the documents, just view. It worked before though.</p>

            Some schools pay for students to have downloaded applications on their desktops; most pay for a less-expensive version that only uses the online apps. Do you know which your school is using?

<br />Please navigate to your account's subscription page (<a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions</a>) to check whether you have a license for the latest desktop version of Office:

<br />There is a 4-year deep discount subscription available for some students as well.

<br />Even if you have free use at your current school, you may want to take advantage of this while you still have an .edu email. It will last after your student status ends. I currently have that as my Office 365 subscription (as staff, not student).

<h2>            connection yes, sync Contacts no &#47;  HTC TD WM 6.1 to Outlook 2003 Windows 7  WMDC 6.1</h2>
                    <strong><span>Roland</span></strong> <span>
says</span>
<div>
<p>I'm really frustrated – for many days I try to sync my HTC Touch Diamond /&nbsp;WM6.1 with Outlook 2003 ( Windows 7 WMDC 6.1 )<br />
<br />
The connection seems to be ok. <br />
<br />
Synchronization&nbsp;for Mobile Favorits and Notes works and can be finished.<br />
But as soon I config the wmdc for contacts or calender, the syncronize center never comes to an end.<br />
<br />
I used a new and&nbsp;empty PST file to avoid corrupted entries but it dídn’t helped.<br />
<br />
I even hard reset the HTC with no progress</p>
<p>Any guess?<br />
I <span>appreciate
</span>any help<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
&nbsp;Roland</p>

            Hi Roland,<br />
<br />
Verify that "Advanced network functionality" is disabled on the device. You will find this in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; USB to PC.<br />
<br />
Re-connect the phone to see if it syncs.<br />
<br />
Linley.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new Nokia 208 Dual SIM type&nbsp;RM-949 (English &amp; Chinees).</p>
<p>I wish to install Hebrew on it but I can't find an&nbsp;appropriate firmware.</p>
<p>Does anyone knows if there's such version around the net?</p>
<p>Can I install the RM-948 instead? Will it support the Dual SIM function?</p>
<p>Is there an RM-956 version with Hebrew and if yes, can it be installed on this model (RM-949)???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.............. I'm stuck........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Unfortunately, there is no way other than by sending it to a Nokia Care Point as they have the proper tools to perform it.<br />
<br />
The Nokia software recovery tool won't allow cross installing firmwares designed for other Nokia models.

<p>The Dual-SIM version was specifically made for specific regions mainly for developing markets (esp in Asia-Pacific). Hence, language packs available are limited or made available only to those countries.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word - Not all Pages being displayed</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm working on a report with some colleagues using Microsoft Word 2013 and Sharepoint.<br />
<br />
It was working OK until a few hours ago, but now there are some problems:<br />
<br />
If I open the document in word online, I can view all 35 pages of the document.<br />
<br />
If I try to edit the document in Microsoft Word, however, I can only view the first 2 pages of the document, but the word count at the bottom is for 5642 words (which would correspond to 35 pages). For some reason at the bottom it says I'm on "Page 2 of 3,"
 but I cannot see anything beyond 2.<br />
<br />
I tried Selecting all and copying (Using Ctrl+A and then Ctrl+C) and pasting to a new Word document. If I paste selecting using "the destination theme" or "merging formatting," all 35 pages come through. However, if I paste using the option of "Keeping Source
 Formatting", the same problem comes up (only 2 pages visible).<br />
<br />
I unfortunately need to keep the original formatting as this is a company report.<br />
<br />
Any assistance so that I can view and edit the whole document with the original formatting would be very much appreciated!

<p>Do you see all content in Web Layout view? In that case, copy the content from that view, minus the final paragraph mark (¶), into a new, blank document and see if that overcomes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To show/hide paragraph marks as well as other nonprinting marks, click the ¶ icon on the Home tab.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Android not syncing and not correctly showing Sections and Folders</h2>
                    <p>Starting this week, my OneNote for Android is not functioning. &nbsp;It was not syncing at all on my much-used ToDo page despite reboot. &nbsp;So I uninstalled the app, rebooted, and reinstalled OneNote , and the results are worse. &nbsp;It's not even showing all of the
 pages within a given section, and the page it is showing is way out of date. &nbsp;It's showing a version from Jan 24, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried syncing the folder, and sync all. &nbsp;No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rely heavily on the multi-platform capability of OneNote. &nbsp;Please let me know if you have any ideas I can try&nbsp;</p>
