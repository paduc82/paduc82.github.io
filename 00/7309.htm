<h2>            Debug Assertion Failed error</h2>
                    <p>Bought a Lenovo computer in Dec 2010 &amp; purchased Microsoft Office H&amp;S 2010 at same time.&nbsp; Got a "Product Key card" and installed successfully.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Suddenly I am now getting a "Debug Assertion Failed" error pointing to igfxsrvc.exe&nbsp; line 170 Expression SUCCEEDED (jRes).&nbsp; I had just downloaded files from my cell phone to the computer and tried to open one of the files.&nbsp; After shutting down and restarting,
 I can now open the jpg files but WORD and EXCEL give me a message that I am opening a TRIAL VERSION.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have SP1 installed, and opening WORD in Safe mode gives same results.</p>
<p>Can you help???&nbsp; </p>

            <p>You will need to install the driver on the machine that will actually be using it to do the processing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I donâ€™t think it should require a restart after the install is complete. <span>
&nbsp;</span>It will prompt you if it does.<span>&nbsp; </span>Based upon the scenario you are using it for, I would definitely review the download page to make sure you are using the driver in a supported scenario:</p>

<h2>            Escalating Complaint about my unrepaired Lumia.</h2>
                    
<p>In short my 920 won't wirelessly charge, after taking it to a care centre who shipped it off to wherever and then waiting nearly three weeks the phone was repaired. When I went into the shop we tested it there and then and lo and behold the phone had not
 been fixed at all. After discussions via live chat/e-mail and telephone not one operator can/will give me any information regarding what was done with the phone and why it wasn't repaired they all tell me I have to send the phone back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up I want to know if anyone has any experience getting any sort of response from someone higher up who might actually provide answers. I am aware that this might not be the place to expect an answer from anyone at Nokia but frustration with their
 system has led me here.</p>

            Send it to Nokia directly.<br />
they pick it up the next day, and return it within 3 days (for me).<br />
they actually understand the phone, unlike incompetent 'repair centre's'

<p>and yet more issues with Nokia Support...&nbsp;&nbsp; I say support, really its the department that says send in phone, and we'll post it back to you untouched.&nbsp; Have sent the 920 back with no signal 3 times now. Each time comes back saying fixed, yet within 30 seconds
 of powering on, its obvios it isnt.,&nbsp; I have more than one Nokia 920, so I know what should happen, and what shouldnt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4th time, the phone comes back as unrepaired.&nbsp; I call and ask why.&nbsp; The first excuse is that the phone is physically damaged. Not true - all nice and shiny to me as I hold it in my hand.&nbsp; Nokia insist its broken, even when I tell them I HAVED THE PHONE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They later try again saying its blocked by my network operator - I check and it isnt - a fact support by the fact that occasionally I can make calls from it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each day this week, i have called support - tell the story - wait on a call for 45mins plus, have them go through each of the lies above, then be promised call will be escalated and someone will call me back within the day, which they dont but dont worry,
 the whole history is documented.&nbsp; So i call the next day and guess what - no documentation so all starts again ..&nbsp; Thats happened 5 DAYS RUNNING!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Nokia are hoping ill give up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I promise I wont... court action will have to be sought if this continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I bet Nokia still dont call me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had purchased Lumia 930 Black model via Amazon site few weeks ago. I am shocked to state that the frame of the phone gets hot upon usage within less than few minutes. So much so that, if I speak for more than 5 minutes it is very difficult to hold the
 phone in my hand due to this problem. The level of heating is unacceptable. This is definitely a very big disappointment as we were eagerly waiting for this product. Lumia phones as a product of choice seem to be incorrect. As a consequence of this, I had
 to take this product to Nokia Service Center and they have accepted that this is a defective product and have taken this up for servicing. This is a disappointment as I had selected this product after&nbsp;fair amount of&nbsp;search.&nbsp;</p>

            i must say, again and again, microsoft has the worst customer care support.<br />
<br />
nobody still taking any responsibility even now after so many faults in there sets are openly proved on this forum. i don't even imagine how big in reality the number would be. and still no one taking any responsibility or giving a definite and genuine response.

            <p>Yes Microsoft Devices has pathetic and unprofessional customer support. They have had my Lumia 1520 since 3rd of August. The job sheet mentions 12th of August as the target delivery date. They say device is at the factory in Bangalore. I have been asking
 them repeatedly for a date by when I will get it. No one has the date. Heck they say even the parts that need to replaced are unavailable. Microsoft Care Centre people say something...the call centre says something else and Twitter support says something else!
 For someone who needs a decent phone for traveling they have put me in a spot. I will never go for a Microsoft device ever again in my life. If this is the way they treat a flagship device customer I can imagine how they treat customers who buy less expensive
 devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the part wasnt available they shouldnt have taken my device. What do they expect me to do? Wait till eternity for the part to become available? For a device in warranty shouldnt they just be replacing a faulty device? I have only owned Nokia/MS devices
 so far. I owned a Lumia 800 before this. But I guess this is the end. No one should have to spend so many hours chasing for a device that shouldnt have been faulty or should have been replaced if faulty.</p>

<h2>            Movie purchased in English now playing in Spanish</h2>
                    <p>I know that there have been some issues with Xbox media, and I'm wondering if this is a part of it. I purchased "Frozen" in English for my son about a month ago, and have been watching the movie regularly in English (seriously, like at least once a day --
 toddlers, right?). Anyway, today we went to watch the movie, and it only played in Spanish. When I went to the movie info it said that the language was Spanish. Is this a glitch from the other problems related to streaming media? Is it something I should be
 worried about? I'm not about to pay another twenty dollars for another copy of Frozen, when the movie I bought was clearly in English. As much as I appreciate the multi-lingual experience my son is getting, I don't know how much longer I can convince him that
 this is the way the movie's supposed to sound.<br />

            <p>Hi, have you reset your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Phone was originally designed to use Exchange Active Sync (EAS) to sync Google email, calendars, and contacts to your phone.
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=279984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google has announced</a> that it is ending support for EAS for new customers. Because of this change, new Google accounts set up on the latest version of the Windows Phone 7 software will sync via IMAP
 instead of EAS.</p>
<p>If you set up a new Google account on a phone with the latest version of the Windows Phone software installed, you'll still get your Google email, but your Google calendars and contacts will not sync to your phone.</p>
<p>If you've previously set up a Google account on your phone and your contacts and calendars sync, they'll continue to do so. However, if you reset your phone and then set up the Google account again, your Google calendars and contacts won't sync to your phone.

<p>Hey,<br />
<br />
We had a link to be able to download onedrive for business for mac.<br />
It seems to be broken now.<br />
From my understanding the was a preview client.<br />
Is this link related to the non availability of preview client?</p>

<h2>            Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>i had enrolled in Windows insider program long back. I installed my pc with win 10 tech preview pro which is already activated. I wasn't using it for long now. Now I'm not getting any further updates, will it be possible to upgrade with iso images. If yes,
 when I upgrade will they ask for product key ? Which is safest build to upgrade now to get updates again.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are do not get further updates and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>How do you connect to the internet?</li><li>If you are using Wi-Fi, have you tried testing through Ethernet cable?</li><li>Which build is installed in the computer?</li><li>Do you receive any error message while checking for updates?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li></ol>
<p>The latest build is 10240. You sure can upgrade with iso image as well and since you would want to upgrade with iso image, you will have to use the product key again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to refer to some of the frequently asked questions related to Windows 10 Insider Preview that can answer even more questions&nbsp;you may have.

<p>
</p><p>I connect to interntet using wifi.</p>
<p>I haven't tried with Ethernet but am sure that's not the problem.</p>
<p>The build now I'm using is win 10 9961 technical preview pro which is activated.</p>
<p>I don't get any error messages, i get a message that everything is up to date.</p>
<p>There is no security softwares either.</p>
<p>I saw iso images of 10240 build in torrents and other sites but the problem is what if they ask product key when upgrading? will i be able to use the product key which i have used for activation?</p>

<h2>            Merge multiple imported PST files in Outlook Mac 2010</h2>
                    <p>Previous questions dealt with issues merging contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is about merging folders containing emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loaded into Outlook 2011 Mac, several PST files. &nbsp;That created several folders in my computer, one corresponding to each PST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within each of those folders there are many other folders. &nbsp;The PSTs contained a similar structure, that is, the folders inside the main folders have the same names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeking an script that would move all the emails into a common folder structure, allowing me to simplify my email history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, it would be nice also to find another script that would eliminate email duplicates within those folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could write a vba program to do that but it seems that Outlook Mac 2011 doesn't have vba.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Suppose weights are in range G6:G10</p>
<p>2. Suppose prices are in range H6:H10</p>
<p>3. Enter weight in cell G14</p>
<p>4. In cell H14, enter this formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(ISNUMBER(MATCH(VLOOKUP(G14,$G$6:$H$10,2,1),$G$6:$G$10,0)),VLOOKUP(G14,$G$6:$H$10,2,1),((INDEX($H$6:$H$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1)+1,1)-INDEX($H$6:$H$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1),1))/(INDEX($G$6:$G$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1)+1,1)-INDEX($G$6:$G$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1),1))*(G14-INDEX($G$6:$G$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1),1)))+INDEX($H$6:$H$10,MATCH(G14,$G$6:$G$10,1),1))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>I assume the price is linear between the adjacent points?</p>
<p><br />
Suppose that you have a set of weights in a column range named Weights and the prices for those weights in an adjacent column range named Prices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<font color="#000000">0</font></td>
<td>
<font color="#000000">Â£0</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<font color="#000000">5</font></td>
<td>
<font color="#000000">Â£2</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<font color="#000000">10</font></td>
<td>
<font color="#000000">Â£3</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<font color="#000000">20</font></td>
<td>
<font color="#000000">Â£4</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<font color="#000000">50</font></td>
<td>
<font color="#000000">Â£5</font></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>And you have a weight for which you want a price in cell D3.</p>
<p><br />
It is easiest to use an intermediate cell to hold the row number within Weights for which has the highest weight which is not greater than the value in D3.&nbsp; Say this is in E3 which contains the formula<br />
=MATCH(D3,Weights)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the price will be:<br />
=INDEX(Prices,E3)+(D3-INDEX(Weights,E3))/(INDEX(Weights,E3+1)-INDEX(Weights,E3))*(INDEX(Prices,E3+1)-INDEX(Prices,E3))</p>

<h2>            Clip Art</h2>
                    <p>I have recently bought a new computer with Windows 8 OS and have Windows Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to utilize clip art in Word and PPoint, that is via,&nbsp;Insert&gt;On Line Pictures, I get the message "Sorry, we are having some temporary server issues".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not temporary as it has been this way for several days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried looking up the Office 2013 for Dummies which shows an "Insert Pictures dialog box", as do other help sources, but I cannot get that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to adjust settings somewhere?</p>

<p>Hi OptimisticWay,</p>
<p>To narrow down this issue, could you let us know the following points?<br />
1. Does this issue happen to all files in the sharing user's OneDrive for Business library? What about sharing the same documents with another user?<br />
2. A screenshot about the error message.<br />
Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.</p>
<p>3. If you try to access the file via browser in private mode or go to the file through a guest link(click ellipsis next to the file &gt; share &gt; get a link), will you be able to access the file?<br />
4. Your permission on the two Word documents. In the sharing user's OneDrive for Business library, click ellipsis next to the file &gt; share &gt; shared with &gt; advanced &gt; check permission.<br />
5. Your permission on the sharing user's OneDrive for Business library. To check it, go to LIBRARY lab &gt; Library Settings&gt; Under Permissions and Management part &gt; Permissions for this document library &gt; click Check Permissions &gt; Input this userâ€™s name or an
 email address to check the permission.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>hi optimisticway,</p>
<p>based on the screenshot below, it seems that you have break permission inheritance from the onedrive for business library level. could you confirm it?</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=acd01432-2c2f-4eb8-9d82-698b0b263527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dacd01432-2c2f-4eb8-9d82-698b0b263527" /></a></p>
<p>generally, in the default permission inheritance mode, when sharing a file in onedrive for business library to a user, the user will also be granted minimal permission(limited access) on the site and library level in order for him to be able to cross site
 and library to view the file. for the&nbsp;scenario that permission is not inherited, you need to explicitly grant site and library permission to the user.</p>
<p>if it is not the situation, could you also check whether the affected users are able to view the file from onedrive for business "shared with me" section to confirm whether file is shared?</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
vincent</p>

<p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>Once the OneDrive for Business license is checked off for the user, there is normally no change made to the user's rights by the admin, nor by the user in OneDrive for Business view; &nbsp;a check of the Site rights in SharePoint, shows the person sharing their
 files to me has "Full Control".</p>
<p>In my OWA/webmail "Shared with me" folder, the files shared by the user are not present.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help,</p>

<p>Hi OptimisticWay,</p>
<p>Seems there is some misunderstaning here. Based on the description, I can see that the receiving user(you) doesn't have permission to access the sharing user's file. Could you check whether your account have permission on the sharing user's OneDrive for
 Business library and personal site and share two related screenshots with us?<br />
1. To check permission on the OneDrive for Business library level, in the sharing user's OneDrive for Business library &gt; click Return to classic OneDrive in the bottom left corner &gt; click gear icon in the upper right corner &gt; click Ribbon &gt; LIBRARY &gt; library
 settings &gt; permission for this document library &gt; check permissions.</p>
<p>2. To check permission on the personal site level, in the sharing user's OneDrive for Business library &gt; click gear icon in the upper right corner &gt; site settings &gt; site permissions &gt; check permissions.</p>
<p>Note: To insert a screenshot, please click on Use rich formatting and select the Insert Image icon.</p>

<p>Hi OptimisticWay,</p>
<p>To further investigate this issue, I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.When that user share file to others, did he enter a group or specific user account?
<br />
2.If other users share file to him, can he access the file?<br />
3.When you navigate to your OneDrive for Business library and click <strong>Shared with me</strong>, can't you see the file he shared to you? If you can see the file, can you access it?<br />
4.For other users, if they share files between each other, can they access the shared files? It can let us know if only the files shared from this user cannot be accessed.<br />
5.That user's work/school account and OneDrive for Business URL.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the account and URL, you can find the message via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hi OptimisticWay,</p>
<p>Based on my understanding after reviewing the thread, I see that although the document, for example, â€œxxx_March 2015_English 23 03 15_finaldocxâ€, is shared with three users and they do have the permissions with Read or Contribute when checking
 permissions, they run into the Access Denied error when accessing the document and it doesnâ€™t appear in their Shared with Me section.</p>
<p>Please correct me is anything is misunderstood. While our waiting for the response from the user to check whether he can access the files shared by others, Iâ€™d like to collect some additional information so the issue can be further investigated
 and clarified:</p>
<p>1. You mentioned in the first post that â€œ<i>no information on folder shares</i>â€. So, does it mean that if the affected user shares a folder with others, they can access the folder without issue?</p>
<p>2. Please help test whether the issue occurs in other libraries in the affected userâ€™s personal site:</p>
<p>a. Browse to the userâ€™s OneDrive for Business library.<br />
b. Click the gear icon at the up-right corner. <br />
c. Click <b>Add an app</b> &gt; <b>Document Library</b>.<br />
d. Pick a name and create a document to it.<br />
e. Share the document with you and check you can access it.</p>
<p>3. Could you provide me some additional information? To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to collect the information. You can access the private message via

<h2>            Microsoft Office 365 Activation issues following Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Just how long will it take MS to resolve this major issue - a Google search shows a huge number and growing of very dissatisfied customers, me included. Some form of communication is needed urgently to let us all know we are not being abandoned - MS has
 our money but many of us do not have a properly working Office suite. I am close to seeking a full refund and will look elsewhere for similar products.

            Just checked again and I see I have 7 days left before my products are unlicensed. Wonder where that leaves me legally, having paid for a product in good faith, which I am not able to activate despite wanting to, and repeatedly trying to.&nbsp; Anyone with
 a legal brain who has the answers?<br />

            I have recently paid for an extra full years sub for Office 365 Personal and I am getting "we're sorry something went wrong and we can't do this for you right now. Please try again later (0x8004FC12)"&nbsp; I've been following various other threads concerning
 this matter and tried the suggestions without success. I am an OAP and not an expert on PC issues and find the solutions in your link difficult to follow. I have been used to click and proceed over the years. I guess I'll end up having to pay a firm to sort
 this all out which is disappointing, for a product I bought in good faith and expected to work properly.<br />

            Will somebody from Microsoft tell me how to cancel my Office 365 subscription which I renewed (regrettably) on August 16th 2015 thus I am entitled to a full refund which I am claiming now by way of this notice. I am totally frustrated by this failure to
 resolve the activation issue and I will be unlicensed in 1 day, although I am paid up to August 2017. I intend to switch to a more reliable office suite.

            I agree Brian, it would help if Microsoft acknowledged this issue and had the decency to inform us what they are doing about it. I will be unlicensed tomorrow, so will see what happens, but expect I may have a useless product then which I renewed on the
 16th August in good faith! <br />

These might help :<br />
<br />
Try adding these to your trusted sites in IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security - Trusted Sites.<br />

<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which<br />
can&nbsp;cause strange issues).<br />
<br />
If no joy something maybe blocking it.<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but<br />
Java still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.)<br />
Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a<br />
program ask about it here. <br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - SPYBHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download
<br />
and run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

 is NOT compatible with the Nokia Suite or Nokia PC Suite..atleast not as per the official compatibility list.. but you may try connecting the phone to PC and after opening Nokia PC Suite click on 'Update Phone Software' and see if it provides you with the
 Re-install option ..</span></p>
<p><span>Just for your knowledge, in Nokia Suite the option &nbsp;is provided as seen in the second attachment ..</span></p>

            <p>That is 'normal' behavior. When you start creating a record by entering something, the new AutoNumber value is assigned, and it will not be reused even if you cancel out of that record.</p>
<p>This should not be a problem since an AutoNumber is intended to be used as a meaningless unique identifier.</p>
<p>If you compact and repair the database (from the Database Tools tab of the ribbon), the "next" AutoNumber value will be reset to (largest currently used value)+1. Gaps in the sequence will not be filled in, however.</p>

            <p>I am not concerned that the autonumber is now missing.&nbsp; What I am concerned with is that when it deletes the half finished record it automatically creates a new blank record upon exiting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>ID 3: Record is half finished and exited out of without saving</p>
<p>In the table ID 4 is a new blank record, ID 3 is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care that ID 3 is missing - I understand why that has to be the case with AutoNumber.&nbsp; However, how to do I get ID 4 to stop creating itself - it's clearly just being created upon exiting the program.</p>

            <p>A Form with an updateable recordset will always have a blank new record displayed after the last real record. This isn't actually stored on disk as a blank record, it's just a "placeholder" open for new data. Are you sure this isn't what you're seeing? Or
 are you getting an actual new record and incrementing the autonumber value? If so, either you're unintentionally dirtying the new record by typing something into it, or you may have some code or a macro doing so.

            <blockquote>Record is half finished and exited out of without saving</blockquote>
<br />
<p><span>What do you mean by<i> 'without saving'.</i><span>&nbsp;
</span>A bound form automatically saves an edited current record if the form is closed or moved to another record, including an empty new one.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>You can exit a new record if no data has been manually inserted by the user, or no values have been inserted by code behind the scenes, but if you've entered data and then deleted it from the form's controls then you must undo
 the record by pressing the Esc key or by other means, or Access will attempt to save the record.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you wish the saving of a record only to be specifically undertaken by the user then you must set up
 the form so that it does not automatically do so.<span>&nbsp; </span>You'll find an example as SaveDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your
 browser's address bar.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another point is that, if a record is being saved with only the autonumber value, then there is something
 seriously wrong with the table design as it means that all columns bar the autonumber column are allowing Nulls.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No table should do this; at least one and usually most, columns should disallow Nulls by having their required property set to True (Yes) in the table design.<br />

            MS does look into the forums and hope they consider your feedback.<br />
<br />
AFAIK the pop up of the onscreen key board is a feature on the surface pro which support touch screen. However you do have the option to disable it.<br />
<br />
To disable the on-screen board gotoStart screen/Control Panel/Administrative tools/Services. Scroll down the list to see "Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Service". Click on Stop to stop the services.<br />

            I need the on-screen keyboard other than when I use OneNote MX. I guess your solution disables the touch keyboard all the time, right? ...

            <p>So is there just no solution to this? I'm having the same problem when I switch from drawing to the selection tool. The keyboard always pops up with the cursor under the last thing I drew. Its very annoying.

            <p>I agree, there needs to be a drawing mode where the keyboard doesn't show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use OneNote to solve math problems sometimes, and the keyboard, and often the taskbar start popping up interfering with what I'm doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're missing a huge opportunity here. &nbsp;OneNote could be amazing for kids in school, if you could just write on it more easily without all of the things getting in the way.</p>

            <p>Since this question was originally posted, MS started using the "UserVoice" site to collect. MS does not have many employees actually reading these postings. They do actively read suggestions on UserVoice, and surprisingly they even react to a few of them</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 for Mac &#40;v14.4.4&#41; Can&#39;t delete an item under Drafts Folder</h2>
                    <p>My computer is MacBook Pro Late 2011 Mavericks v10.9.5</p>
<p>Some days ago I created an item but not sent it. I waited untill the next day and saw doubl saved item under the
<strong>Drafts Folder</strong>.</p>
<p>I opened one of them, edit it and push the "send" button. <strong>The other item</strong>&nbsp;(1 item 1 unread in the status bar) got empty on the preview pane
</p>
<p>but&nbsp;<strong>I could not delete it</strong>... &nbsp;<strong>Although I rebuilt the "main identity"</strong>&nbsp;nothing has changed.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Can anybody help me </strong><strong>to solve the </strong><strong>problem of&nbsp;</strong><strong>deleting any item in drafts folder</strong>?</p>
<p>Please see the images...<br />

            Sadly not :(<br />
<br />
For future reference, there's a fairly new thing in "My Nokia" called "My Nokia Backup" which will let you quickly &amp; easily sync Contacts, Calendar &amp; Notes and restore back if needed...<br />
I use it to backup those items once a week ish usually, good if you need to access the details online too if you've not got your phone etc.

            My nokia is a good free service. I use it whenever I add a new contact because it only takes seconds to back it up. It's not yet available in all countries though.<br />

            Did you ever get messages from those numbers that has been deleted? if you did and only need the number instead of contact details, try to select the message and press green button to dial, it will dial the number, hence you can save the number.

<h2>            HELP&#33; Saved over a PowerPoint file but need older file back...</h2>
                    <p>Hi-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had open an old, but very important, PP file that was in a certain format. I wanted to use the format for another file, so I simply deleted most of the slides and started building the new file. I went to 'Save As' but accidentally clicked 'Save'. I tried
 to Undo the save but that was not an option. Is there any other possible way of getting this original file back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original file had been open for many weeks. Perhaps it had saved a temp file somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, I'm using PP 2010 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi OAIfonso,<br />
<br />
If we start to sync OneDrive for Business library with the Next Gen OneDrive for Business Sync Client(OneDrive.exe), we canâ€™t sync it with the legacy OneDrive for Business client (groove.exe) any more.
<br />
<br />
The new Next Gen OneDrive for Business Sync Client can sync both OneDrive for Business library and the team site Libraries now. More information can be found in the article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-syncing-SharePoint-sites-with-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-Preview-6de9ede8-5b6e-4503-80b2-6190f3354a88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started syncing SharePoint sites with the new OneDrive sync client â€“ Preview</a>. Therefore, do you mind try the following steps to sync libraries with it?
<br />
<br />
1. <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=823059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install the preview build</a> of the new OneDrive sync client.<br />
2. Download and open <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TeamSiteSyncPreview.reg</a> to enable SharePoint document library sync.<br />
3. Restart the sync client:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Right-click the Blue cloud icon in your system tray and click Exit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Search for â€œOneDriveâ€ in the Start menu and choose OneDrive Desktop app.<br />
4. Log into the client with your current Office 365 account. <br />
5. Go to the library to sync in SharePoint Online with the modern SharePoint UI. <br />
6. Click Sync to see if you can sync the teamsite library. <br />
<br />
If you still have some issue on the new client, could you share with us more details so that we can help to troubleshot?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley
