<h2>            Win 10 Overlapping User Profiles&#63; Two users, both me, nearly identical but not quite, only 1 showing at a time. Issues&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong><span>WHAT IT IS</span></strong><span>:&nbsp; (see subject) Same exact username, different paths to thing, only one shows at a time. For anonymity guidelines compliance will call myself GhostUser1 and Ghostuser2. GU2 has a pic, GU1 generic representation
 of me; also the names are slightly different. It would be like "GhostUser1" and "GhoustUs"...similar like that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>WHEN IT STARTED</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Option 1 </span></span><span>- I might have been dealing with this since I first was given this laptop (Lenovo Edge 15) brand new. I created my account, and some weeks later I decided to add another entire user
 because I wanted to see what settings I preferred and already wanted a fresh slate. For a while things were fine; I used them with different emails, different MS accounts, and different uses ie.-&nbsp; personal and work. However, as I started to get serious software
 and services installed it became a problem. Example - GU1 installed and pre-paid a year of Office 365 and the only feasible-for-me way GU2 could have it was to have GU1 add GU2 by invitation .
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Option 2</span></span><span> - I put that computer aside one day when I thought it would not boot and started using other laptops&nbsp; (T400) but picked it up again some months later. I decided to fix it but was
 told that I needed a new mobo so eventually bought one on EBAY listed as dead. I joined&nbsp; the two machines by bringing my&nbsp;HDD, RAM display to the new/old one. Windows was close to self-termination it got so confused by the wrong parts being in the right body
 or vice versa, but I kept working with it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>WHERE IT IS NOW</span></strong><span>: Not good and getting worse I think, since now
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have two (or more if syncing to OneDrive or anywhere else) of every known folder sitting right there side by side</span></li><li><span>I have nine Unknown User accounts showing up when getting the security info from folder properties BUT in my User Accounts there is only GU2 (generic icon, no pic); when I click Change Another Account I am viewing another list of just one, GU1 (with
 pic)</span></li><li><span>my Programs Installed lists me as having just eight programs; and</span></li><li><span>my System Volume seems to be living on/in an Unknown Volume&nbsp; named ? (long nonsense string of characters surrounded by curly brackets)\\C:\Programs\Windows Apps folder. There's more, but this seems like plenty for now..</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I THINK that the deleted GU2 showed back up and took over GU1, but I have no real idea. Or.. I will say though that these things have memories far beyond my ability to explain. Because: last night, when doing Google searches attempting to find a possible
 explanation for this all, one link brought me here, to Microsoft Communities. I about fell off the chair when I saw that I was - somehow, I didn't enter ne ingle thing - I was logged in as a Me (GU3!) with a Display name I haven't used in many years, and a
 post I did indeed make: seven yeas ago, 2010. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have no removable drives whatsoever, so however that happened it was either cloud-related or I need an exorcist or who knows. SINCE (not IF) GU3 survived across seven years, a dozen computers, clean installs, reformats and complete destruction well
 then I know for sure that GU2 could have come back and overtaken GU1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>WHAT I HAVE TRIED</span></strong><span> (not in date order):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>A number of System Restores</span></li><li><span>Two resets (last on 5/13 and I really do not want to do another. Putting everything back is so tedious</span></li><li><span>Downloaded current Recovery Media; backed up the whole thing;</span></li><li><span>Learned a small amount about Powershell and with that I</span>
<ul>
<li><span>ran sfc/ scannow, which returned the "Errors We Can't Fix" result (a few times) then</span></li><li><span>ran another command "like DISM find and fix it all, please" three times. First time it got to 49% then had to suddenly quit. and the second time same thing but get to 51%.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Also I had it lit all the Users, known or not, which was a REALLY good thing because somewhere in here I stopped even being offered the chance to Run as Admin, so I resurrected an Admin account from somewhere and proceeded. There's more, but again
 that seems like plenty,</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Complete virus/bug scan Defender (nothing) plus downloaded and ran Malawarebytes (47 quarantined files listed as PUP but was all from the same non-virus program I once had and uninstalled;; annoying but not a bug.);</span></li><li><span>Updates, updates and more updates;</span></li><li><span>Screen-shot all of it;</span></li><li><span>Physically went to the C drive (well I mean rather than/in addition to) looking at a report trying to get a scope. Permission violations all over bt since I am both GhostUsers, one of me had Admin power and I can at least get around. I am denied,
 I try as Admin, I check Security, Advanced button where I give myself View rights but I have not been taking ownership f anything since don't know what the *bleep*I am doing. Like camping in the woods, I am leaving nothing and taking nothing.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><strong>STATUS THIS MOMENT:</strong> Last night I ran elevated PS cmd sfc/ scannow and got back a result in no time which said something like Data Protection (?) didn't find any integrity violations. Great but since I still saw signs I ran the DSM
 thing and fell asleep. This morning it said that the restore operation was a success. But it's worse than ever, and I still seem to have only eight programs so I downloaded and ran CCleaner - which can see ALL of my apps. I think...</span></p>
<p><span>Of course: There is more. But isn't this plenty? Please help if you can and remember I would rather not have to start from scratch. I've come this far, but also would rather not try any of my own ideas. Like, I even thought that if I changed GU1 and
 GU2s names to be all the way identical, that might help. I could terminate myself if I will let me. And under the general “There’s More” heading, did I mention that every single one of GU1s office docs have appended an X to themselves and are now all Templates?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for reading.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you're already at your wits end. The last option that you can do is to do a clean install or call the manufacturer of your computer. If you choose to call the manufacturer of the computer, they might run some test to see what's causing the
 issue. However, performing a clean install will reformat your computer and make it as new again. Check this

<p>
</p><p>Hi I am installing Windows 8.1 on a brand new PC that I built myself. &nbsp;I tried installing it the first time but I got error code&nbsp;0x000000e. &nbsp;And it won't let me "Prtess Enter to try again" or "Press F8 for Startup Settings". &nbsp;I then unplugged my regular
 Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 3TB Hardrive and let my 500GB SSD still run. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 is loaded and all ready to go on the SSD but I cannot access the 3TB hardrive because of the windows error. &nbsp;How do I get rid of windows on that hardrive and if not how do
 I repair it? </p>

            There are many ways to install a full version of Windows 7 Professional:<br />
<br />
 you need to choose Custom.<br />
<br />
 does not have an operating system, or if you want to set up a multiboot system on your computer. For more information about setting up a multiboot system, see Install more than one operating system (multiboot).<br />
<br />
<br />
During the installation process, you need:<br />
<br />
The Windows installation disc.<br />
<br />
Your product key. You can find your product key on your computer or on the installation disc holder inside the Windows package. A product key sticker looks similar to this:
<br />
<br />
PRODUCT KEY: XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX<br />
<br />
Go to the Microsoft website to see examples of product key stickers.<br />
<br />
Your computer name, if your computer is currently connected to a network.<br />
<br />
You also need to decide whether to install a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows 7.<br />
32 vs 64 bit<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
<br />
<br />
Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit<br />
<br />
Before you begin, to save time and help you avoid problems during installation:<br />
<br />
Update your antivirus program, run it, and then disable it. After you install Windows, remember to reenable the antivirus program, or install new antivirus software that works with Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
Back up your files. You can back up files to an external hard disk, a DVD or CD, or a network folder.
<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/<br />
<br />
Connect to the Internet. Make sure your Internet connection is working so that you can get the latest installation updates. These updates include security updates and hardware driver updates that can help with installation. If you don't have an Internet connection,
 you can still upgrade or install Windows. <br />

<br />
<p><strong>Beginning Setup</strong></p>
<p>To begin the installation, insert your Windows 7 Installation DVD and click the
<em>Install Now </em>button on the<em> Install Windows</em> window. If the
<em>Install Windows </em>does not appear on screen, click <em>Start &gt; Computer &gt; </em>
open the <em>Windows 7 dvd, </em>and double click file <em>Setup.exe </em>then click
<em>Install Now. </em>Setup will start copying temporary files that assist the installation of the operating system. If you have installed Windows Vista before, the procedure is pretty much identical.
<em>Please note, that I started my installation from within a running installation of Windows Vista SP1. If you are doing a clean install, you could also boot from your Windows 7 disk and proceed with installation just the same. If you are planning on upgrading
 from Windows Vista SP1, you must launch Windows 7 setup from within a running installation of Windows Vista SP1.</em></p>

<p><em>You have the option of obtaining necessary drivers and software patches before installing.</em></p>
<p>Before Windows 7 starts copying Windows files to disk, you can check Windows Update for any important files and hardware drivers that might make the installation go as smooth as possible. It is always recommended you do so to prevent unexpected problems
 with incompatible hardware and software. Next you accept the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>

<p><em>Windows 7 provides multiple options for installing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Choosing your installation:</strong></p>
<p>You have multiple ways of Installing Windows 7, you can do an upgrade from an existing version/edition of Windows such as Windows Vista SP1. Custom Install features advanced options that allows you to select a partition that you have created to install the
 OS on. In addition to that you can choose to do a clean install of Windows 7 which will remove any data currently stored on the disk you plan to install Windows. In my case, I have created a dedicated partition to install Windows 7 on.

<p><em>Phases that the Windows 7 installation goes through.</em></p>
<p><strong>Installing Windows</strong></p>
<p>Windows will now begin copying files and restart several times during installation. A clean Windows 7 Installation goes through a series of steps which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Copying Windows files</em></li><li><em>Expanding Windows files</em></li><li><em>Installing Updates</em></li><li><em>Completing installation</em></li></ul>
<p>The time it takes will vary depending on certain factors such as the performance of your PC: Processor speed, memory and disk speed. I installed Windows 7 on a system with a Intel Core 2 Quad 2.5 GHz processor, 2 GBs of RAM. Installation took approximately
 14 mins and 30 seconds. During this phase, Windows 7 will restart several times, apply registry settings and test your video hardware performance.</p>

<p><em>Post installation Task (OOBE)</em></p>
<p><strong>Out of Box Experience (OOBE)</strong></p>
<p>Once Windows 7 has completed installation, you are taken to the <em>OOBE, </em>
which consist of post installation task such as setting up a user account, entering a product key for the edition of Windows 7 you installed, choosing your Time Zone and joining a network. After these quick task have been completed, Windows 7 applies settings
 and prepares to load the Desktop for the first time.</p>

<p><em>Startup and Log in Screen</em></p>
<p><em>There you have it, you have successfully installed Windows 7. The installation process will of course vary across many systems, but my experience so far installing the OS on two systems has been a smooth one. I have put together a list of things you
 should take into account before installing or upgrading to Windows 7. </em></p>
<ul>
<li>You have two choices, you can either upgrade from Windows Vista SP1 by launching setup from within Windows&nbsp;<em>
</em>and choose the upgrade option during the installation wizard; (Windows 7 requires that you have a minimum 16 GB’s of free disk space before upgrading). Note: Upgrades are not supported for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition at all; Windows 7 x64 requires
 a clean installation. Users of Windows Vista SP1 x64 can do in place upgrades to Windows 7 x64.</li><li><strong><em>Get Religion: Backup, Backup, Backup!</em></strong>As Murphy Law states, if it can go wrong, it will. Upgrading is a very complex process and there are often cases of failed upgrades from older versions of Windows. Causes can include, power
 outage during installation, hardware or application conflict. This is why you should always back upâ€, it’s better to be inconvenienced than having to start all over from scratch.</li><li>If you are upgrading/clean install, disable any external or USB based devices you might have attached to the computer. Also, disable any Security software before launching setup and ensure that you meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 7.
<p>- 1 GHz processor (32-bit or 64-bit)</p>
<p>- 1 GB of system memory <strong>(2 GBs for 64 bit)</strong></p>
<p>- 16 GBs of disk space <strong>(20 GBs for 64 bit)</strong> <em>Windows 7 uses approximately 10.5 GBs of disk space.
</em></p>
<p>- DirectX 9 graphics with 128 MB of memory (WDDM 1.0 or 1.1 driver) – <em>this is important if you want Windows Aero Glass user experience.</em></p>
<p>- DVD Drive</p>
<p>- DVD Burner and Internet access <em>(if you do a digital download Windows 7)</em></p>
<p>- Technical know how to burn an ISO file to make an install DVD. </p>
</li><li>You cannot uninstall Windows 7, if you need to use XP or Vista, you will have to reinstall it. If you are uncertain about upgrading to Windows 7, it’s always best to do a dual boot installation by installing Windows 7 on a logical partition or another hard
 disk. This option can be done during setup, simply click Custom (Advanced) and select the other partition you created to test Windows 7.</li><li><strong>Some of my devices and applications are not working, what should I do?</strong>If your Internet connection is working in Windows 7, I suggest you try obtaining the drivers through Windows Update. Click
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Turn on Windows Update</strong>. A list of available updates will then be downloaded, you will have the option to view them, do so and check off the appropriate drivers or software patches you need and click Install. You can also check the manufacturer’s
 website for patches, updated drivers or to simply find out about Windows 7 support for the particular product.For software, if you are running Windows 7 x64, certain types of applications will not work; these include Win16 applications and Win32 applications
 that use Win16 installers. You can also try running the application in Compatibility mode to see if it will work (full 32-bit application applications supported). Right click the programs executable &gt; click Properties &gt;
<strong>Compatibilityâ€</strong> tab &gt; under <strong>Compatibility Modeâ€ </strong>
check the <strong>Run this application in compatibility mode for:</strong> box &gt; click in the list box and choose a suitable version of Windows.<strong>

 Account Control security component in Windows 7 because the application was designed to run with Administrative privileges. You can try a work around by, right clicking the applications executable and click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>â€ on the context menu.inset</p>

<p>I was excited when all I knew was that CD Project Red were making a game set in the Cyberpunk universe. I used to play the pen and paper game and having the developers that brought us the Witcher trilogy making the video game is the icing on the cake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>every detail from the game that they tell us about only serves to excite me more.</p>

            Cyberpunk 2077 is in good hands, CD Projekt Red is an amazing developer that doesn't do too many microtransactions for the base game and they take really good care of their games as well, who would expect Keanu Reeves to be in it!

<p>The video game is basically supposed to be a direct sequel to the original tabletop board game it was inspired by. Cyberpunk 2020 is a fun experience if no one here's ever played a tabletop RPG. Its not your standard D&amp;D lol. I played a lot of the Cyberpunk
 RPG and now that its finally getting a rendition in video game format by CD Projekt Red, this game is going to be awesome!&nbsp;</p>

            I've been looking forward to this game for over a year now and my excitement is only getting bigger! I'm not so bothered by all the customisation we'll be able to do but I'm really looking forward to the story and another quality game by CD Projekt. My
 all time favourite game is The Witcher 3 so I know this game is going to be up there with it when I finish playing it.

            What do you mean pop ups.&nbsp; Can not you just click on the icon to activate the app?&nbsp; There is no need to click on anything in the pop up.<br />
Also you have an ability to turn off the pop ups if you want.

            Thanks. I'm new to Windows 10 (just getting used to the 'apps' terminolgy) but on my own new PC (Win10) if I right click something on the taskbar the sub menu pops up and I can see the options and use them from there, which I find very helpful (works like
 my old Win7). On my Mum's laptop, if I do the same thing, the popup/sub-menus&nbsp; display for a split second and disappear which is very very frustrating when I'm trying to resolve issues on her machine. I will take your comment on board though.

<h2>            Sent me wrong Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My small company purchased a Surface Book about 1.5yrs ago, with a serial number ****557. We sent the laptop back twice for different reasons, once for an issue with a screen and the second the it kept crashing when opening excel. On receipt of the Laptop
 the second time, it wouldn't turn on. I left if on charge and did all the 'reboot' options to no avail. I went to send it back again and then realised the serial number was different ***874.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft, and they said the laptop I sent over wasn't in warranty so they sent it back. This is the only Surface Book we have, so it isn't a mix up on our end. The technician said he couldn't help me either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise who I could speak to?</p>

            <div>this is a little confusing. Microsoft usually replaces with a completely</div>
<div>different refurbished device as opposed to fixing the device you send in. The</div>
<div>refurbs have a 90 day warranty. If the device you currently have was replaced</div>
<div>within 90 days, and does not work, then you should be able to open a new claim</div>
<div>and replace it again. If you are in the US, you should go to the closest</div>
<div>physical retail Microsoft Store</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have the email receipts noting the original serial number being sent over twice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note your comment on the 90 day warranty, but the technician noted there was no warranty on the laptop he received. So this isn't available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note your comment on MS changing the laptop when they send it back. From what I could see the laptop did change (well certainly the cover of the laptop did) as the first one sent over had a small dent on it. The one we sent back was very new, but the one
 we ended up with seems very old. The serial number stayed the same until we ended up with the final laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance of who I should send the 'evidence' of the laptop being sent for repair (x2) to in MS would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I gave them the serial number they could figure out where it came from</p>

<div>&gt;From what I could see the laptop did change (well certainly the cover of the</div>
<div>laptop did) as the first one sent over had a small dent on it. The one we sent</div>
<div>back was very new, but the one we ended up with seems very old. The serial</div>
<div>number stayed the same until we ended up with the final laptop.&nbsp; </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we start troubleshooting, I suggest you to identify if you have made any recent changes to the computer prior to the issue. Also, what is the make and model of the PC? Does it have a dedicated graphics module?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the primary source of&nbsp;message <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff557275(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR</a> comes from driver issues in Windows. Here, we are looking at a probability&nbsp;that the&nbsp;video driver&nbsp;might be&nbsp;corrupted or damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to consider the below important&nbsp;methods and check if it helps to identify and resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter. This is a diagnostic which helps to identify any potential driver related issues present in your PC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the <strong>Hardware and Device </strong>
option from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the <strong>Hardware and Device
</strong>Troubleshooter. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, check if rolling back/updating the video driver helps to resolve the issue. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First of all, Press <strong>Windows logo + R</strong> from keyboard. It will open
<strong>RUN</strong>.</li><li>Now type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press Enter to open Device Manager.</li><li>You will see all the driver list or your PC. Expand <strong>Display Adapters</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Rollback driver&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Double click on your video driver in <em>Device Manager</em>. Then Click on <em>
Driver tab </em>and select&nbsp;Rollback.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;If your drive is performing well and there is no error, Rollback driver button will be grayed out as an option.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update driver&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double click on your video driver in <em>Device Manager</em>. Then Click on <em>
Driver tab </em>and select&nbsp;Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, check if you are using the latest version of the video device driver available from the manufacturer's website and that the driver is correctly matched to the video adapter model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue. This includes third party antivirus/firewall software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span>: As the&nbsp;article is designed for Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7. Unlike launching step for&nbsp;'System Configuration', options and steps to Clean Boot are same for Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>

    <title>RDP display errors&#47;glitches - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobterwilligerca  say:</h3>
<h2>            RDP display errors&#47;glitches</h2>
                    <p>For over a month now, the users on our network have been experiencing some odd graphical glitches when using programs like Word, Outlook and Excel.<br />
<br />
Here are a few examples of the display problems and their circumstances - an explanation of our setup will follow:<br />
<br />
-Sometimes when composing an email in Outlook or a document in Word, whatever you are typing will suddenly transpose itself to an area near the top of the screen, complete with cursor. Moving somewhere else and clicking away from the area will give you back
 control, but a white bar with the last sentence you typed will still remain. Wiping your mouse through the area will 'erase' any part of it that has an icon or button beneath it.<br />
<br />
-Sometimes when scrolling down using the mouse wheel in Excel or Word, a portion of the screen will duplicate itself somewhere else on the display. Like the situation with Outlook, it can be partially 'erased.' Occasionally, swapping between application windows
 will temporarily clear the issue.<br />
<br />
-Sometimes when using Excel, clicking on a cell will highlight the cell on either side of where you clicked, rather than the one you clicked on.<br />
<br />
-Sometimes when entering data in Excel, whatever you are typing on one spreadsheet will show up either somewhere else on the screen.<br />
<br />
-Sometimes when opening a dropdown menu in a program, the menu will duplicate itself in the upper left area of the screen.<br />
<br />
Closing all programs and logging off of the server will clear the issue for approximately 10-20 minutes, at which time it starts to appear again.
</p>
<p><br />
These problems do not affect each user uniformly, nor can they be recreated on demand. We have two users who have&nbsp;these things&nbsp;happen to them all the time, while others are not affected at all. I myself have experienced first hand the Outlook draw duplication
 glitch three times in one day - but only occasionally since then.</p>
<p>It also happens to users regardless of their connection location (i.e. in the office on the domain or from an external location), or the machine used to connect.<br />
<br />
In our environment, we run a terminal server based on Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise (SP 1). The server is a Hyper-V virtual machine, running on a host that also runs Windows 2008 R2 Enterprise. All users connect to the terminal server via the latest version of&nbsp;Remote
 Desktop - no programs are installed or run locally. Our version of Microsoft Office is 2007. All users' local machines are either laptops or desktops running Windows 7 64-bit Pro, but I have seen this behaviour on machines&nbsp;running Windows 7 32-bit Home Premium,
 and 32-bit Windows Vista Home Basic as well.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to address this issue. My first thought was that it was somehow related to each user's RDP configuration, but I have played with all the various settings in the display and experience options to no effect. The fact that it is both persitent
 and random yet not uniformly present is infuriating.<br />
<br />
It showed up in early January, but at least a week after any sort of changes/upgrades were made on the server.</p>
<p>I have scoured the web for answers on this topic, talked to various IT professionals and gathered whatever 'fixes' I could - so far nothing has worked.</p>
<p>Any ideas?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Store - App Update</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Pro and recently I am getting an error 0x87AF010A when I try to run the 7 apps that need to be updated from the Windows Store.&nbsp; I have tried clearing store cache, running store apps troubleshooter with no problems detected and deleted
 and recreated file folder AUInstallAgent in the Windows directory.&nbsp; Which none of these methods have helped in solving this error.&nbsp; I have found many error codes in the community but nothing matching this code.&nbsp; Can anyone give my any further suggestions to
 solve this&nbsp;so I can update my apps.&nbsp; Thanks, JR

<h2>            computer requests me to log-in as Administrator even in admin account</h2>
                    Civ 4 &amp; 3 are loaded.&nbsp; When I go to play Civilization the computer says that I have to log in as Administor...I was already logged in as Administrator or else I wouldn't have been allowed to load Civ 4 or do any other tasks if I were NOT the Administrator.&nbsp;
 I even went so far as to add another account with Administrator privileges and it STILL request me to log-in as Administrator&nbsp;if I want to play any Civ game.&nbsp; I cleaned the Civ disc with SkipDr...same results.&nbsp; I just recently up graded to Win 10 from Win
 7...so many probs I brought it back down to Win 7.&nbsp; After a couple of days, I upgraded to Win 10 again which I am running now.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>Hello Ronald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you ar facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you facing this issue only for the particular Game?</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I also suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC scan (System file checker) scan.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Refer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Same email, different name as it made me make a new profile...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know about all of those gestures but I mean when I'm using the handwriting input, if I want to enter a "space" or indent or etc, I have to press the responding key on the side. When a old windows PDA I didn't have to resort to the side keys and it
 seems that neither did you have to in winv and win7.<br />

<h2>            Recovering emails from a deleted Windows Live Mail 2011 Account</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently installed MS Outlook on my PC. &nbsp;As such, I wanted to prevent any future emails being sent to the Windows Live Mail Account as I want to now use that for Hotmail only.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In order to test the Outlook install, I thought I would delete my account from Windows Live Mail in the understanding that it would merely the&nbsp;delivery&nbsp;of future emails. &nbsp;Astonishingly however, it appears to have removed all trace of the account and any
 associated folders. &nbsp;These appear to be no where on the hard drive at all and even doing a system restore has not brought them back.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot believe for one moment that Microsoft would make it so simple to lose so much important data so easily and would&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;some guidance on how I can restore or gain access to these emails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

</p><p>When you remove an account from Windows Live Mail, a message appears warning you that

<p><br />
You may be able to recover them using <em>Previous versions </em>in Explorer, although I'm not sure what effect your system restore will have had on these if they exist. Otherwise, you'll have to resort to using an undelete utility like
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recuva</a> to locate any .eml files that still exist on your hard disk.</p>

<h2>            code 43 error on VISTA&#47;nVIDIA GeForce 8600M GS</h2>
                    Hi! Starting from last week my laptop starting reporting the "nvlddmkm" error with system recovery (after a Windows update, as far as I remember). Two days ago the system couldn't recover any longer, crashing all the time imediatley after loading the screen
 saver. Witout the screen saver on, it was crashing after at least 20 min. I've tried to install/unistall drivers, clean registries, clean the fan, upgrade drivers, and now the display adapter reports the "code 43" error. The memory check was ok. The video
 card isn't dead, only alive at the lowest resolution possible. Do you have any suggestions what should I do next? Thanks a lot!

<p>I just spent a couple of days playing with a DV9000 series laptop.&nbsp; If you have one of these, I think it is the beginning of the end.&nbsp; Essentially what happens is the video overheats and manages to melt the solder on the video chip partially disconnecting
 it.&nbsp; This is why it will work sometimes and not others.&nbsp; Searching DV9000 video brings you up a plethora of people with this problem and some "fixes" which are not for the faint hearted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not just the DV9000 series, any similarly designed laptop will have the problem.&nbsp; Dell, HP and even MACs all have the video chip that causes the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP had a class action suit in the USA but this is now over.&nbsp; One of the problems is that the CPU and GPU share just one fan and heatsink and it's just not enough.&nbsp; Very poor design.&nbsp; In the UK there is no help at all.&nbsp; Nvidia do appear to be doing something
 though http://www.nvidiasettlement.com/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a list of the machines covered under the lawsuit.&nbsp; http://www.nvidiasettlement.com/affectedmodels.html</p>
<p>If you are not in the USA, you are out of luck.&nbsp; I am just going to lay this DV9000 to rest.</p>

    <title>Touch scroll doesn&#39;t work after updating to Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zetret  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch scroll doesn&#39;t work after updating to Windows 10.0.10240.17202 on Lenovo Y580.</h2>
                    <p>The previous version of Windows 10 was working perfectly. After updating (which took more than 1.5 hours!), the touch scroll stopped working. (Even clicks are a bit shaky, doesn't work that well, i.e. clicks don't happen when the button below touchpad is
 pressed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's worse is <strong>Lenovo Y580</strong> doesn't release any drivers for Windows 10, and I was using an earlier driver that was working on Windows 7. However, after this update it seems to have stopped!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's installed is <strong><em>Lenovo Pointing Device by Synaptics version 19.0.9.5</em></strong> and Windows says this is the most up-to-date driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now rolled back to&nbsp;Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.10240] and the touchpad scroll works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question to <strong>Microsoft </strong>then is what changed between&nbsp;Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.10240] and&nbsp;Windows 10.0.10240.17202 that invalidates the aforementioned Synaptics driver?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Zetret,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per checking with Lenovo, it seems that Y580 Lenovo Ideapad can only support Windows 7 to Windows 8.1. We would recommend that you downgrade to the ideal Operating System for you to optimize the full capacity of your device. For further assistance, you
 can contact the device’s manufacturer for support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I’m aware that there’s already numerous questions about this, though unfortunately I was unable to find any that fixed my problem.</p>
<p>I have a HP Pavillion Laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>Recently my laptop has been randomly freezing around 30 minutes or so into using it. I checked various things and upon checking task manager noticed the disk column was at 100%. The main culprate for taking up this space was&nbsp;Antimalware Service Executable.
 Other things taking up a fairly large amount were: Antimalware Definition Update and the installers for AVG and Avast. Prior to the laptop freezes AVG wanted to restart my computer to switch itself back on (I’d turned it off for a short while) and once back
 on these problems began occuring. I considered that it could be the&nbsp;Antimalware Service Executable trying to do something with my antivirus programs but I’m not sure. Any advice is greatly appreciated!<br />

Yes, it will, I personally recommend you create a system image though. You should do so now if you plan to move to a different hard disk in the future.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 not displaying second monitor on boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danlevan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 not displaying second monitor on boot</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8 a little while ago, and its mostly working great. The only problem I'm having (apart from something in Windows Update bricking my system whenever I update and having to do a system restore, but I've just turned that off for now)
 is that every single time I boot my second monitor just shows a black screen. The system POST information appears, followed by the Windows 8 loading screen, but as soon as I hit the unlock screen it just goes blank. Not switching off, the backlight is still
 going, but displaying a blank screen. Device manager and desktop properties and the Catalyst control center all still see it and think its working fine, but nothing. I restart and it comes up straight away. Every single time. I'm running the exact same hardware
 as I was on 7, with the latest AMD drivers so to me it has to be Windows 8 as the culprit. Any ideas?<br />

            Thanks for the reply Karthik.<br />
<br />
I'd gone through all that, but it turns out that it must have been a driver issue, as the most recent AMD beta driver has fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
As for the system restores, something in Windows update was causing the system to blue screen immediately on boot, and wouldn't load into the OS or even safe mode. After a couple of tries Windows was automatically going into recovery mode. It's currently showing
 37 items in there, and as I haven't the foggiest which of them was causing it, I'm somewhat reluctant to go through them one by one at the moment. It's possible it was tied to the driver issue, in which case it too might have fixed itself.<br />

I must try that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW I had been assuming that what you were describing was normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if I want to see both screens at the same resolution as the primary I need to use Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then it is just duplicated and looks terrible in the wide-screen monitor
 anyway.</p>

    <title>Using cortana on my Surface pro 3 mutes microphone after &#34;Hey - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ehjhey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using cortana on my Surface pro 3 mutes microphone after &#34;Hey Cortana&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So I got my upgrade to windows 10 today, managed to get Cortana working after making sure all the language settings matched. BUt now It's basically unusable (Cortana) because once I give my "Hey Cortana" command, or another initial command, the Internal
 microphone volume is instantly muted so I can't say anything further until raising it again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've performed all the updates and the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community and for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program
 is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot.”</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the below link:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 240, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, try this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and
 repair them. <br />
1. &nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X,</strong> click <strong>Command Prompt </strong>
(<strong>Admin</strong>).<br />
2.&nbsp; In the Command Prompt, type the SFC / scannow, and then press&nbsp;<strong>enter</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks and regards.</span></p>

            <p>Hey, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try doing and update if there is one. Also, try and kill SearchUI.exe and try Hey Cortana again.
</p>
<p>Do not go through the voice training. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't go through the mic set up go through it. They mic set up is not the same as the voice training.

            This also happened to me. What I did was unmute the mic and set the levels correctly, then set up the mic again; this can be done through the "set up a microphone" in the control panel. &nbsp;Microsoft's advice on doing a clean boot or running system checker
 is equivalent of saying: I have no idea what's wrong why don't you tell me how to solve it.

            <p>I am sorry that they some one told you to reboot. I know there are issues with the surface where the message is misleading however, all we are trying to say is go through the microphone set up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tell me more about he issue that you are having I can try and help you resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you having a zero microphone gain issue. Meaning that when you use Hey Cortana the microphone goes to 0?</p>
