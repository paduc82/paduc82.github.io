<h2>            Account hacked and orders placed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email account got hacked yesterday and the hacker subsequently got access to my card information as well as other accounts. What is concerning is that he/she made a lot of orders on the Microsoft store, and I urgently need to cancel these orders or I
 would be losing a lot of money. I've changed the passwords of the hacked accounts I was aware of and cancelled the card that was used. I just need to find a number to call regarding cancellation of the Microsoft store orders or find a way to do it online,
 which I haven't been able to do so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

    <title>Viewing Sharepoint Documents on OneDrive for business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Viewing Sharepoint Documents on OneDrive for business</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
there use to be an Office Mobile app for iPhone where you could view all your documents on your SharePoint using this app for iPhone. Now they have upgraded to OneDrive for business and cannot view the files within your SharePoint documents. When you configure
 the OneDrive for biz app, it has advanced settings where you can add the SharePoint site but when it logs in, it goes to your One Drive folders.
</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone have a workaround or different app to use for iPhone's so we don't have to use safari or chrome to view apps.</p>
<p><br />
You are probably wanting to know why I am using SharePoint.. well my clients have windows 8.1 computers and I would like to sync from a NAS to SharePoint. After some investigation, One Drive for business for 8.1 doesn't show up as a folder, it merely shows
 up as a SharePoint folder, therefore I have to sync from this. If there are any times for this, please let me know.</p>
<p>Any help, would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>Hi Chopper,</p>
<p>You can use the new Office for iOS apps with your organization account to view the documents on your team site:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, to show the entered characters on the password box, click on the “Eye” logo at the corner of the password box. This logo helps you in entering the correct password, as when you click onto the logo after entering the password will
 display the password. Which is generally hidden when you enter the password.<br />
<br />
Some security considerations when using the password eye:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Be wary of anyone looking over your shoulder.</li><li>Do not leave your phone unattended with the password box filled in (but not submitted).
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. <br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Users being logged out of Office Desktop applications</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of users with the same problem, users are being logged out of&nbsp; Word, Excel etc. and are prompted to login whilst editing or creating new documents.&nbsp; In some cases the users enter the username (email address) and the prompt for the password
 never comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the usual, logged them out of everything from the Admin Portal and reinstalled the Office applications but the problem still persists.&nbsp; On a number of occasions users have been on customers sites and haven't been able to save work because of this
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My users are getting more and more frustrated, does anyone have a solution?</p>

<p>So you're telling me that I have to open up another tab, navigate to the page I want to link to, copy the address and then paste it in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Won't that insert a static link, i.e. not a relative one? What happens if we decide to re-organise our site structure and move one site to another place in the tree using sitemanager.aspx? Won't all these static (non-relative) links break?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really must be missing something here because these new modern pages appear to be a step back 10 years... Sure implement a simpler user interface if that's all you need but please don't take away the power that more competent users need. Like where's the
 HTML view in case I need to do some direct editing?</p>

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
In SharePoint modern page, it’s not possible to insert a link from the site structure, and we need to copy the address from another tab.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, we suggest you submit your requirement to UserVoice, which is the best way to perfect our products and services.<br />

            yes,<br />
there are other BRANDs to select a DV-RS-MMC from.<br />
<br />
You can try finding NEC,MAGU,PANASONIC,KINGSTONE(this card is very slow),Olympus etc..<br />
<br />
NOTE: Be sure that you buy the Dual Voltage Multimedia Card for your N70.<br />
<br />
<br />

            I had bought my N70 in India and bought a 1GB DV MMC at the Frankfurt Airport from a company called Transcend. It works like a charm.. I believe you can buy this card in Europe.. coudln't find any here in the US.

            Hey.. sorry for the late reply.<br />
<br />
well.. I was on a Europe trip and I'd bought this card made by a company called Transcend (1GB MMC .. the dual voltage thing) at a mall in Berlin .. in a cellphone store in the Mall... not quite sure where it was..<br />
<br />
hope this helps..

            The original 64MB card that came with my N70 had a rating of 1.8/3.3V Dual Voltage and so I remembered to buy the same rating Dual Voltage card when I was looking for a 1GB card..<br />

<br />
<br />
yes !!!! may be said as SPECIAL !<br />
<br />
The built in card reader in the n70 works on the 1.8 volts.<br />
So, you need a memory card that supports 1.8 volts.<br />
<br />
It is a matter of sorrow that there is NO card in the market that ONLY supports 1.8 volts. So, you have to buy a card that support both 1.8 and 3.0 volts and this kind of cards are available in the market.<br />
<br />
Buy a card of the above type and they may be called "MMC Mobile" or "DV-RS-MMC(dual voltage reduced size MMC)".<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

How long have you been using your Transcend MMC in your N70 and what have been your experience so far. I have read in this forum and others about Nokia phone users having nasty experiences with a particular brand of MMC i.e Kingston and i just want to avoid
 that.<br />
I wish you well.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With the newest update from March 15th, 2018, every time I try to update a web query&nbsp;Excel just crashes. No messages, no errors, nothing it just shuts down and closes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having similar issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what to do here? Tough call with no errors, everything was working fine yesterday 3.28.18</p>

<p><span>Hi Joe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the issue in your environment, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if the issue only happens after you updated the version of the Excel 2016 application.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if the issue only happens when you update a specific web query or a specific file.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the Excel 2016 application you are using. You can access the page via File&gt;Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, I backdated Excel to&nbsp;version&nbsp;<span>16.0.7870.2031&nbsp; &nbsp;and the IQY files work perfectly. I went back that far because there was an issue with the next version of Excel and the IQY as well. you
 can see my&nbsp;post on that issue here:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_win10/excel-web-query-format-numbers-importing-as-text/660c2053-c41b-485e-a067-2d2fca0391d1?tm=1493393677076</p>
<p><span>2. This happens for any file with an IQY query in it (and this is happening on 4 separate&nbsp;machines who have all updated- including a MAC)</span>3.</p>

<span>Hi Joe,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>As you have downgraded your Excel 2016 application and the issue goes away, I suggest you currently use the version as a workaround.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Moreover, if you need further help on this issue, I’d like you to list the detailed steps about what you did before the crash issue happened and share a sample affected file with us for
 our test in our environment. You can provide it in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

I had the same issue in MAC Excel 2016 using the Actual technologies Oracle Driver and at the end I realized that for keeping the modifications to the Queries I have to edit it from the "Connection" option rather than the shortcut access.<br /></p>

<h2>            How do I subscribe to subfolders without having to move them back into the main folders&#63;</h2>
                    I work with Public Folders for my clients and since switching to the Mac, I'm unable to subscribe to the folders I need properly. &nbsp;When I subscribe to the main folder, it doesn't subscribe to the subfolders too. &nbsp;If I subscribe to the subfolders, it lists
 them separately on my drop down screen rather than within the main folder and it does not allow me to move them into the main folder, only copy. &nbsp;Has anyone else run into this problem because as of right now, I'm going from my Mac to my HP laptop and it's
 beginning to be very counter productive.

<p>
</p><p>I was trying to embed videos in email and came across some posts which mentioned that the video support has been discontinued from most of the email clients.</p>
<p>I would like to know if there is any way (via plugin, etc) that I can embed video in emails.</p>
<p>EDIT : Will it be possible to do it by building a plug-in for outlook?</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>True. By embedding video in email, what I meant was that the video is hosted somewhere else and I want to send link to this video in my email in such a way that receipent will be able to play it in mail client itself.</p>
<p>I tried using HTML players but apparently they are not supported. Hence I would like to know how to go about doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Don't feel bad, it happened to me a few times too, along with the frequent long term buffering I experienced with both Internet Explorer and Chrome, although not nearly as bad in Chrome.&nbsp; If I had been anticipating these issues, I might have downloaded
 Firefox and tried it out in that browser as well, but too late. Now its just an afterthought.&nbsp; Maybe next time though :)

                    <span>I just got a c550 pocketpc from a friend of mine and I need some help getting it to work correctly. The thing is that my friend got it from his mom who the company she works for was throwing them out. My issue
 is that I can't get to the main screen of the pocketpc because some program called "Kiosk Agent" keeps loading up the software the company used and I can't get rid of it. Then it proceeds to load up another piece of software on top of it that i have determined
 the Kiosk Agent almost will force to be open despite I actually managed to close it one time by messing around with it. Is there any way I can get the windows mobile (version 5) into some type of safemode so I can then disable the Kiosk Agent from the startup
 and get rid of it?<br />
<br />
I don't have a USB cable for this pocketpc, only a power adapter which makes it even more difficult. I know there has got to be a way to close that program though.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you better perform a hard reset on the device. A hard reset will return it to factory defaults and remove all applications not installed by the device manufacturer. Follow the steps in the link below to hard reset your device:</p>

    <title>Excel Table sort function messing up formulas outside of table - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Table sort function messing up formulas outside of table</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a table in Excel 2013, with data and formulas in the table. The sort function works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a formula that is simply&nbsp;=(H24+H26)*-1. Both H24 and H26 are within the table, the results of this formula are one the same page but outside the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I sort the table the formula stays at H24 and H26 as if I was using absolutes, obviously the data for that formula moves, messing up the equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the formula to stay with the data and not the specific cell it is in before a sort?</p>

            1. One way is the way which Ugo Lopez has pointed.
<br />
<br />2. Another way is to have a helper column and insert sequential number 1, 2, 3.....But once again, it has to be part of your sorted range. Now, you can reference to this. 
<br />Let's say that this helper column is column G and values 1,2 etc are filled from G1. 
<br />
<br />Hence, in your case the formula
<br />=(H24+H26)*-1
<br />Becomes
<br />=INDEX(H:H,MATCH(24,G:G,0))+INDEX(H:H,MATCH(26,G:G,0))*-1

<h2>            Word Online Duplicates almost Every Image</h2>
                    <p>I'm experiencing a similar issue as described in </p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/word-online-print-pdf-duplicates-of-every-image/45792fcf-89d5-45b3-90bd-65941bfdf750">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/word-online-print-pdf-duplicates-of-every-image/45792fcf-89d5-45b3-90bd-65941bfdf750</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I embed an image from my local machine (insert &gt; image &gt; this device), the image gets inserted succesfully and Word online is autosaving the applied change inside the document.</p>
<p>When I leave the editor and return back to the same online document in edit mode, some of the images are duplicated next to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also saving the document to my local machine, results in an offline document with the same duplication.</p>
<p>Hence, even if I remove the duplicates inside the online version and immediately afterwards save it to my local machine ("download a copy option" in "File &gt; Save as.."), the downloaded copy still shows the duplicate images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As if they were never actually removed in the office 365 document source file...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone have a look at this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. My local machine is a MacBook PRO, running on High Sierra 10.13.6</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sorry for this inconvenience caused by this issue. After tested on our end, we can’t find the same issue as yours. I created a word file with an image and saved it in OneDrive, then I opened it in Word Online. I don’t have the duplicate
 images. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you said when you insert image in Word client it can word without duplicate images. So I assume issue may be not related with client.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For narrow down this issue, can you provide the information to let us do further investigate:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does this issue only occur to specific word file or other files? If only for one file, can you share the file link to us by

PM </a>link?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What browser are you using? Does it happen to other browser?</span></p>
<p>3. Where did you opened the Word document? In the OneDrive Online or Word Online in portal.office.com?</p>
<p><span>4. As you mentioned, after you delete duplication in Online and download it in local machine, the image deleted show up again. Does this issue persist when you click the“Open in Word”and open it in client after you do the delete action? Can you see
 the duplicate image in Word client in this way?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Bart,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your video and it shows clearly the issue you encountered. But as we have no permission to access the SharePoint site, could you share the document link by this way: click share-&gt; Anyone with this link-&gt;
 Copy link, and share the link to us?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You open this document Online and you download it as copy, then it means the original document have some save issue. So you have duplicate images in the document. To further investigate, can you provide the information
 to us? Because they are also important for us to figure out the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;</span><span>Does this issue only occur to specific word document?</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Does it happen to other browser?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Does this issue occur to other users who edit this document online?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Does the issue only occur to images? We can see it happens to some images but not all.</span></p>

<p>Hi Ivy,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to share the document the way you described, but the option "Anyone with this link" is not accessible :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/139c7dd8-cdf7-424b-adc8-80cf116edb25?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/139c7dd8-cdf7-424b-adc8-80cf116edb25?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>My contractor does not allow sharing to anyone with a link to it.</p>
<p>I could share it directly with you via "Specific persons" if you provide me an email address.<br />
</p>
<p>To answer your other questions :&nbsp;</p>
<p>- it appeared on several documents on a certain point in the past</p>
<p>- i haven't tried yet in another browser (only Chrome&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(95, 99, 104, 1)">Versie 74.0.3729.169</span>)</p>
<p>- i have to ask around, since my direct co-worker with access is still on holiday.</p>
<p>- it appears to happen only on uploaded image embeds, no textual parts; i had another document with 5 or 6 duplicate images which I downloaded, fixed via Word offline and re-uploaded in replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting back. Based on your issue, please allow me to explain about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, if you want to fix this issue, seems like as you said we need to re-upload a new file which don't have duplicate images. But we still suggest you try to create a new document in your SharePoint site and see whether this issue persists.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ivy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every document I create with embedded images, has the duplication symptom on certain images, not all thus randomly.</p>
<p>I always use the same method :&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9cd49d2-6234-4ff5-af90-aab0972017e0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9cd49d2-6234-4ff5-af90-aab0972017e0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-uploading is not a long term sustainable method, certainly if more then 1 person is working on the same document(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I would like to have a solution sooner or later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below, you can find the version history of the respective document I shared with you. I only worked on this one, but it could be possible my co-workers was also inside the document (most of the time in non-edit mode) during my edit operations :&nbsp;</p>

<p>I suggest we keep the option open for your support to experiment with 1 of our documents (by sharing it via a mail address you provide us.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bart,</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Appreciated for your screenshots. As this issue only occurred in Word Online ad you mentioned this issue happened with every document you created, we want to confirm the steps about how to reproduce
 this issue.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<li><span>In a SharePoint site library. Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">+ New</span><span>-&gt;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">
 Word document.</span></li><li><span>In the online document, click

</span></li><li><span>After save this file, click close. Go back to site library.</span></li><li><span>Re-open this word document and you can find the duplicate images.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow these steps and can find the issue in new document, it means this issue is related with Word Online. We need to make sure every new document you created has this issue, as that workaround

            One thing I can clearly say indra, the navigation will be much better than the n91. Still not as much fast as my iPOD CLASSIC but definitely better. I would expect some more features like Loop, lyrics viewer etc.

            My sources tell me that the sound quality at the 3.5mm connector is "comparable" to the N91, better in some aspects.<br />
<br />
Where there could be some debate is:<br />
<br />
Output power: New legislations in EU require portable music players to limit the output power, so N81 may not be as loud in some markets.<br />
<br />
Remote control: The data lines of the remote control are mixed with audio lines in the N81 (similar to N95) so there could be some difference when you use the remote.<br />
<br />
On the Headphones issue, I don't think that the supplied headphones will be much better than the ones that came with the N91. But that's why there's a 3.5mm connector :) so you can put your preferred best headphones.<br />
<br />
Actually some of the headphones people use I wouldn't even consider but to each its own. :)

            Mmmmm, Ngage games are developed for a broad range of devices so they can't be as optimized as say PSP games (that only run on the PSP).<br />
<br />
Other constraints are the resolution of the screen and the 3D prowess of the hardware, PSP is most likely better at handling polygons and sprites than the N81.<br />
<br />
That being said, I saw a demo of the 3D fighting game and it looked pretty good, graphics wise. Smooth animations, good polygon count. The only question is how well it will play in reality.<br />
<br />
The pictures of the other games in N-gage.com should give you a good idea. I think graphics are slightly better than Nintendo DS but not as good as a PSP. But of course the N81 lacks the shoulder buttons, the touchscreen (of the DS), the analog control (of
 the PSP), or the big screen of the PSP. On the other hand it promises a lot more on-line stuff, free demos, downloadable content, etc, and it has everything else in it. And is much more portable than the PSP ;)<br />

            <p><span><span>Hello Allister Wade,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I am sorry to know that midway during the Publisher 2013 installation Office Home and Business 2013 got uninstalled and subsequently Publisher 2013 also failed to install. I will be helping you with this issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue may sometimes occur when the original Office installation may be corrupt. In order to resolve this issue we will have to run a Microsoft Office FIXIT tool which would completely remove all remnants of Office installations from the
 computer, and then reinstall Office Home and Business 2013 followed by Publisher 2013.
</span></span><span><span>Let us follow these steps. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will have to install and run the Office 2013 FIXIT tool. </li><li>Download / Install and run the Office 2013 FIXIT tool from the following link.
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong> Save the FIXIT before running it if you’re working on a 64 bit Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have completed running the FIXIT follow these steps to delete the
<strong>Office 15</strong> folder.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>From Windows Explorer please navigate to the following location: <strong>C:\Propgram Files\</strong> or
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\ </strong></li><li>Make sure to delete the <strong>Microsoft Office 15</strong> folder. </li><li>In case you are not able to delete the folder then right-click on it and click on
<strong>Rename</strong>. Rename the folder as <strong>Microsoft Office 15 old. </strong>
Ignore these steps in case you are not able to find the Microsoft Office 15 folder in the above mentioned location.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We shall now restart your computer in the Clean Boot mode in order to install Office Home and Business 2013 and Publisher 2013. Please follow these steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Clean Boot mode would temporarily disable all the non-Microsoft applications which could interfere with the installation of Office 2013 &amp; Publisher 2013.</span></span></p>

            Halo.<br />
<br />
I think the limitation is the space.<br />
<br />
You could try making shorter section-titles or use your own abbreviations.<br />
e.g. Devl for Development, etc.<br />
<br />
I do not use space between words of a section-title.<br />
e.g. DevWindOff&nbsp; for&nbsp; Device Windows Office&nbsp; (my section for Windows and Office notes)<br />
<br />
I prefer keeping the navigation bar expanded, but still I make the section-title as short as possible so that the navigation bar is not too wide and consumes the screen space.<br />
<br />
Dont you like having the navigation bar always expanded ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
.<br />

            Currently not available in Skype 8, you would have to go back to the classic version to be able to do that.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Report the issue you are experiencing as a bug.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2?01?8 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<p>Hi Carole,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you uninstalled CCleaner - but if you were having the problem before doing so, did you uncheck those boxes and save the changes first ... and then reboot afterwards to confirm the problem was resolved before uninstalling CCleaner?&nbsp;Granted this should
 not occur, but sometimes programs don't fully uninstall and the remnants left behind can be enough to continue to cause the issue that got you to remove the product in the first place (especially here if you were using any of the registry cleaning parts of
 CCleaner when it was installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'd try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Re-install CCleaner, uncheck the items noted in the screenshots above (and anything else you don't want checked), save the changes, double-check those items above are not checked, run ONLY the cleaner part, close the program and reboot.&nbsp; Defender may
 or may not still show the problem.&nbsp; Do a quick scan and make sure Defender shows fine.&nbsp; Now reboot and see if Defender is fine - it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; If not, <strong>manually </strong>download and install the appropriate full Defender engine and definitions per
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/definitions/adl.aspx</a> Then reboot. Scan. Reboot again and see if the problem is now resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Once resolved, to be sure CCleaner is properly and fully removed if you choose to do so, download and install the

</p><p>If the above does not work, I'd wager you have some other cleaning program on your system causing a similar problem for similar reasons.&nbsp; There are many out there.&nbsp; Do you have any of them (e.g., ASC,...) and, if so, which ones and which versions?&nbsp; Let us
 know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the above works (all of the above fails to resolve the problem), please post back with as much information as possible, screenshots if helpful or showing errors or what you did or have (no personal information though), everything you tried and
 what occurred.&nbsp; Include when this started and what you did in the 2-3 days before and after that - and if it has ever worked properly since that date.&nbsp; The next steps we recommend (or questions we ask)&nbsp;will depend on what you say.</p>
