<h2>            Background installation ran into a problem</h2>
                    I recently purchased a copy of Microsoft Office Professional Plus through my college so i could get a student discount, and after installing it on my computer, I tried to open Microsoft Word and I got an error that said I had problems with the Background
 Installation or something. I looked around on this forum already to try to see what other people did, and my problem is i cant even open a single program, it just goes straight into the error and loads infinitely. Im wondering if there's anything I can do
 to fix it because I tried to repair it and the loading bar stopped about halfway. Anyone have any ideas?

    <title>rollback wmp 12 to wmp 11 in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andypercy  say:</h3>
<h2>            rollback wmp 12 to wmp 11 in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Like many I suppose, windows 10 was foisted upon me without my consent as part of a windows update despite repeatedly stating I did not want 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am coming to terms with 10 as I cannot roll it back to 7 without prejudicing many programs and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the biggest irritation is Windows Media Player 12 with its significantly reduced functionality. WMP11 for all its shortcomings was by far the best media player around because of the flexibility in its library.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The much vaunted Groove Music is completely hopeless as a replacement for any of the WMP's from 9 onwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my perceived WMP 12 shortfalls </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can no longer organise your library by songs globally, and as such you cannot do a global sort based on track length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in any of the three permissible sorts you cannot add the column Album Artist. This leads to significant corruption of the library database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result any album title is attributed to the first &nbsp;name/field in the contributing artist column as the album artist.</p>
<p>For example on a 10 track album released and performed by shall we say "Cliff Richard" there may be one or two tracks/songs where a guest artist appears say "Amy Winehouse". In the contributing artist column the tag may have been entered alphabetically ie
 "Amy Winehouse; Cliff Richard". WMP12 takes the first name to be the album artist and&nbsp;creates an album of the same name but by the first contributing artist of 1 song length. It also creates an album record of the same album title but only 9 tracks/songs long.
 and if you have more than one contributing artist on the album say one on each track chaos ensues.!</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the third party competitors ever matched up to the library and sort options of WMP11 in fact most do not have a library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So question </p>
<p>1/- Can I rollback WMP12 to WMP11 in windows 10 in order to recover the flexibility and accuracy of WMP11,
</p>
<p>2/- Could such a roll back be done in compatibility mode?</p>
<p>3/- Is there a plugin for WMP12 that restores this flexibility?</p>
<p>4/- Are Microsoft intending to release an update to fix these issues?</p>
<p>5/- If so when?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi Andy - as far as I know there is no option to roll back because it is now part of the OS... hopefully someone will say otherwise if I am incorrect.</p>
<p>I am with you on Groove music - it needs a lot of improvements if it is intended to be a replacement for WMP at some future point. I'm not sure why you are seeing this problem of contributing artists 'hi-jacking' album artist though - that's certainly not
 my experience in any recent version of WMP or Windows. Could you post a screenshot because although you have described it very well it would be helpful to have an overview (i.e. what view/columns etc.) - link below if screenshot help needed. In the meantime
 I'll have a more detailed look at the other points you raised. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>Hi Ric&nbsp; thanks for your interest</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to attempt to add a series of screen shots which hopefully will demonstrate the effect</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e536b6-811e-49c5-b283-e65a4c6827a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90e536b6-811e-49c5-b283-e65a4c6827a9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you will see that under music the choice Song has disappeared and I have not found a way if putting that choice back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second Image shows the result of Searching for a particular artist Namely "Moulettes" (No The)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31a2a58c-88e4-4d33-8e37-8aed3f8a18eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31a2a58c-88e4-4d33-8e37-8aed3f8a18eb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the last album "Moulettes" by "Moulettes" you will see that track 7 is missing. Because I happen to know the name of the additional contributing artist I then searched for an album called "Moulettes" and discovered two, the first&nbsp; titled "Moulettes"
 by "Emma Richardson"containing only one track this one track being track 7! You will note in the contributing artist column "Emma Richardson's " name comes first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e4ddfff-a919-4a54-890c-d086725e6f41" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e4ddfff-a919-4a54-890c-d086725e6f41" /></a></p>
<p>The second album is&nbsp;"moulettes" by "Moulettes featuring 9 tracks but not track 7!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I edit the Contributing artist column to put "moulettes before Emma Richardson the result of a search for the album moulettes gives fig 4 below&nbsp; Hey presto all 10 tracks!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a225ba5c-4b73-4780-bbbd-84c038b3a710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a225ba5c-4b73-4780-bbbd-84c038b3a710" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This phenomena applies to probably 70% of my album collection and numbers in the thousands none of which were downloaded from any source and are copies of the original CDs or Vinyl's which I possess. Some albums&nbsp;a complete nightmare as&nbsp;the contributing artist
 fields contains dozens of people and not nessecaril alphabetical and not allways with the principal artist in the lead!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this lets you see my predicament I never experienced this with predecessors to WMP 12. I can resolve this but I think I am looking at Many days of work to edit all the contributing artist field.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest loss is not being able to sort by song and therefore track length globally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best to you I look forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Quite a lot there to work through - thanks for the shots; I think I may have an idea of what is causing the artist issue&nbsp;but I'll re-read it and test a few things.</p>
<p>More immediately - I think you may be missing a trick when it comes to sorting by song and length... although this is not a setting that holds - you'd have to use it when wanted, but if you go to WMP - select 'Music' (rather than album or artist) in the
 left (navigation) pane and then select the 'view' dropdown (next to the 'search' box - top bar) and choose 'Details' - you can then click the top of the 'length' column and choose 'sort by length' there. Various useful actions can be done with the column headers
 - like swapping their positions and in this view you also can have an album artist column. - Shot below -&nbsp;relevant areas red boxed... to see it more clearly just click on it.</p>
<p>I'll get back on the album artist problem - probably tomorrow. - Regards, R.</p>
<p>btw - when you come back, please mention what format(s) your tracks are in (all types if mixed) because that may be relevant. - Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Never thought that the major category would act as a minor, My hat off to you! I could not tell you if that was there in WMP11 because I never looked! always went straight to songs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not fully tested it yet but it seems you have solution to my biggest practical problem, where I have to make compilations of a very specific length.&nbsp;&nbsp;(You have no idea&nbsp;how much I hate the "playlist" word) They have to be accurate to the second without
 if possible losing any part of the&nbsp;original song. (Film music and Television soundtracks).

<p>Interesting projects, your compilations... what software do you use to assemble them - or do you just come up with a running order to be assembled locally?</p>
<p>You did not mention file formats but if some of these are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
wav</span>. tracks, that may explain some of the issues. The two other things I picked up on from your reply with the screenshots were - a) No album art - and b) you mentioned that some of this was originally from vinyl. This suggests that it is not so much
 a WMP problem as a tagging issue. It may take a bit of work to put right but it should be possible
<p>So could you update on what file types are involved - and advise if the album art was there before the upgrade.</p>
<p>Thanks, R...</p>
<p>btw... Hope you found the column management tip works for you - you can play around with different navigation pane and column views and get all manner of different&nbsp;sorting options. Once you know it's there, really&nbsp;the only limit is the size of your library!</p>

            <p>Hi Ric&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used WMP for the task and select the compilation for each specific need and then copy to either Usb stick or&nbsp;Disc as the situation demands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to file formats being an analogue man at heart I always use the highest bite rate and quality format available to me Over the years this has devolved to:- &nbsp;wav at 1.5Mbit typically, wma at 1Mbit typically, and for certain purposes mp3 at 320Kbits &nbsp;(In
 car system use of my library)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All vinyl transfers are done to wav. But none are affected by this problem as I edited all the tags and created to contributing artist field always staring with the named album artist first and the rest in no specific order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I have never been that concerned about the album art but now you mention it, It does now seem to use a particular Eagles album artwork for half of the albums/ artists in my collection where there is no artwork available on the net!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the sorting still not quite as flexible but I am already getting used to it just got to wade through 55 years of collecting music and correct all the anomalies caused by this upgrade. So it is huge, I&nbsp;have transferred all but the last 50 or 60 vinyl's
 to Wav&nbsp;and have the released cd version of each album as well, plus around another 1000 cd's so all in all about 2500 actual albums.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you see the need to not have tracks apparently disappear! and for you to track down the cause if you can and would be so willing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a total aside you will appreciate the notion of "what to play next?", so one of the things I have done is created a compilation for use in the car of every song/track in order of length starting at&nbsp;8 seconds through to the longest, this when played guarantees
 no repeats and gives me know idea of what's next and has taken over two years to get to 6 minutes long and bear in mind the longest specific track is Pink Floyd's echo's at 26:30&nbsp;so about another year to go I suspect!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway enough rambling and thanks for your efforts so far</p>
<p>

            <p>Got some more D.I.Y. to be getting on with over the next few days so I shall be dipping in and out here as and when....</p>
<p>First thing I wanted to mention (which is technically off-topic but relevant to your compiling) is a program called 'Audacity' (free download) - admittedly I have not used the W10 version yet because I still have it on my older W7 laptop, but it is what
 I use for analogue - digital and I have never had any issues /conflicts with it. You can string together tracks - overlap fades etc. and crucially for your work you can change speed, pitch or tempo individually - so if you needed to gain a few seconds a 0.3%
 change to the tempo could make the difference - and no 'orrible 'chipmunk' effects!&nbsp;Completed projects are saved in wav. format. &nbsp;Have a look...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.audacityteam.org/about/</a>
</p>
<p>Regarding the metadata issues - orphaned tracks - muddled artwork etc... there are problems with wav. files because although it is perfectly possible to edit the fields in WMP and add artwork if required, this does not attach itself to the actual files,
 whereas with wma or mp3 it does. To see what I mean look at the 'properties' - 'details' tab of a wav. file and compare it with an mp3 (or wma) file. Like you, I like to keep classical and treasured rock and folk albums in high bit-rate (wav. wma lossless
 and now also flac) but I do this in a separate user-account, so effectively I have an audiophile library in this second account and a standard mp3/ma4 library in my main account. This avoids duplication of albums/tracks in the main library but it is still
 all accessible without the need to keep switching user-accounts.</p>
<p>Give me some feedback on the above - and also could you advise... in what format&nbsp;is the Moulettes album that you used as an example earlier, because I may be able to use that as a template for putting things right.</p>
<p>Ric.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ric, &nbsp;thanks for that . </p>
<p>
</p><p>As to audacity I am aware of it and in fact use it to edit live recordings etc. for friends of mine in various bands.</p>
<p>and It works very well although I confess I have had no occasion to use it since moving to win 10.
</p>
<p>Fortunately my compilations do not require the accuracy of the real fine tuning that audacity provides just to get a suitable number of items within a set time period without cutting a track off in its prime. I will add the thought that a suitable fade given
 by audacity might help on occasions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not aware of the differing tagging properties you have pointed out between wav and wma and that may hold the key. The examples I gave for "Moulettes" were in fact recorded using wav. I did not seem to see this error crop up in wmp11. so I am going
 to delete the recordings from the library and the drives and re record them in wma and see what happens and then repeat the exercise using wma. I'll let you know the outcome. As to the incorrect album art oddly these are all wma's! but again I emphasise this
 has only occurred where there is no online record of the album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also take one of these occurrences and repeat the exercise outlined above and see what happens and of course let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andy P</p>
<p>&nbsp;PS good luck with the DIY</p>

            <p>Before doing any reorganizing just check a few WMP settings to avoid problems down the line. The main one with WMA is making sure you avoid copy-protection but I expect you already know that! The other settings to avoid are those that allow WMP to interfere
 with stuff you may have personalized, so just check that your settings under 'Organize - Options' in the Libraries and Security&nbsp;tabs match these (checked/unchecked as shown below) - then all should be well.</p>
<p>Also, if you are going to rip a CD that you have created yourself from the vinyl you can find it using 'Find Album Info'

    <title>Windows 10 Movies and TV App causing distorted sound with mp4 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lannyrtaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Movies and TV App causing distorted sound with mp4 files</h2>
                    <p>After the initial upgrade from Windows 7 to free Windows 10 download I had no sound problems, but after a later update&nbsp;(not sure which one) I started getting distorted sound like a static noise when streaming videos. I then downloaded the videos and used
 the Movies and TV app to play it and the sound was still distorted. I tried Windows Media player and same problem. But&nbsp; then I tried VLC and also Quicktime and the problem went away. I changed&nbsp;my default video player to VLC to try streaming again using Edge
 and IE and the sound was distorted again. I then downloaded Chrome and tried it and it worked except I noticed that the video doesn't run as smoothly as with the Movie and TV app, hesitates some times.&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the MS browsers ignore the default video
 player and your forced to use its own&nbsp;Movie and TV app.&nbsp;So caught between a rock and hard place, can't use MS browers due to distorted sound and can't use other browsers with other video players due to video not smooth. Only solution is to download&nbsp; videos
 and run them locally with VLC or Quicktime. </p>
<p>ps. Forget to mention that I also reset my computer due to other problems, but this issue still was there.</p>
<p>Update: I discovered today the problem is only with mp4 files sound being distorted. Movies and TV app plays other types I tried fine. Couldn't find anything recent with mp4&nbsp;problems on Windows 10 like mine, but saw other different issues with mp4.</p>
<p>VLC plays mp4 with no problem so can't be a driver problem, but rather a Movies and TV app problem.
</p>
<p>Any one else seen this problem.</p>

<p>I too have been having issues on a couple of my PCs.&nbsp; One is an Insider but the other one is my main PC.&nbsp; I have another spare PC and it is syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be that Onedrive is not actually running.&nbsp; On my public build, I went to the Store and downloaded Onedrive and did a new install.&nbsp; This seemed to work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Setting on Onedrive that should be set to load and start Onedrive on a new start.&nbsp; However, if Onedrive has not been loaded, then you cannot get to the setting.&nbsp; There is also a "Fetch File" setting.&nbsp; These settings are a right click on the "cloud"
 but only if Onedrive is actually running.&nbsp; I have also used Revo uninstaller to remove Onedrive and then re-inhstall.&nbsp; This may work for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had more time here but you do not seem to be alone in your problem.&nbsp; It does seem that if you cannot see or make the Cloud icon re-act, then Onedrive is just not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\OneDrive and you may see a Setup folder.&nbsp; This could re-install Onedrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>sofspra</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort of have to play with this.&nbsp; I think the issue is that Onedrive is not being Re-started on a new start.&nbsp; You get the damn thing syncing and you are good until the next re-start.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Had to go through many hoops to Research the problem; assuming the Bios and all the drivers are up to date, including the Intel updates on the chip set.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most likely the causes are any, or all of the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- External wireless Mouse and wireless Keyboard, ( Both needs to be disabled for waking up the computer, because the wireless dongle can keep the PC to go into a never-never land, not allowing the PC to go into the Sleep routine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- USB suspend setting Not having been enabled, ( Needs to be ENABLED): this you can find in the advanced setting Listing for Power /Sleep mode in the HP control Panel-system settings-power options,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- all the USB Hubs not being allowed to be turned off by the PC power config. parameter and control, by the Hp, because of the mismatch between the default settings on the HP laptop and the Windows 10 power config, and the Intel Interface&nbsp;Management engine..,</p>

<h2>            IE8 Loading Blank PDF on the FIrst Try &#40;consistently&#41;.</h2>
                    We've been running into an issue with viewing PDFs from IE where upon the first click on a link to a particular PDF, the browser window will appear to be loading, but then stuck at a blank page while the status bar indicates Done.&nbsp; The address bar shows
 the URL of the related PDF.&nbsp; However, if we refresh the window or click the same link again, the document will load with no issues.&nbsp; This can be replicated after clearing cache and cookies.&nbsp; IE version is 8.0.6001.18702.&nbsp; Can anyone help?<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Do you recall any changes made to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2.&nbsp;Was it working fine earlier?<br />
3.&nbsp;Do you receive any error message when the issue occurs?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Make sure Adobe PDF reader add-on is enabled. Steps to follow:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp; Select <strong>Tools &gt; Internet Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Programs</strong> (tab) &gt;
<strong>Manage Add-ons</strong>. <br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set Show to <strong>"Add-ons that have been used by Internet Explorer." <br />
</strong>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Find and select A<strong>dobe PDF Reader. <br />
</strong>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure<strong> Enabled </strong>is<strong> selected.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You&nbsp;may configure the browser to open PDF files in a separate Acrobat window, and then configure the browser to use Acrobat or Adobe Reader as a helper application. Then, when you select a PDF file in Internet Explorer, the browser opens the PDF file
 in an Acrobat window instead of the browser window.<br />
To configure the browser to use Acrobat or Adobe Reader to open PDF files:<br />
<div>a. <strong>Close </strong>your <strong>web browser. <br />
</strong>b. <strong>Star</strong>t <strong>Acrobat</strong> or Adobe Reader. <br />
c. &nbsp;Choose <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong>. <br />
d. &nbsp;Select<strong> Internet</strong> in the list on the <strong>left.</strong> <br />
e.&nbsp; <strong>Deselect Display PDF in Browser</strong>, and click <strong>OK.</strong>
<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Restart </strong>Internet Explorer. <br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong> The next time you select a link to a PDF file, the browser may prompt you to open or save the file. If you choose to open the file, then the browser opens the file in the helper application that you specified. If you choose to save
 the file, then the browser downloads the file to the hard disk.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Anannya,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I've kept an eye on these related issues on various message boards, including Microsoft and Adobe and have tried the solutions you suggested.&nbsp; The add-on is indeed enabled and there is no error that i can see associated with it.<br />
<br />
As to the second solution, when I do deselect showing PDF in browser, upon clicking on a PDF link, the pop up (still the browser window, not the adobe reader window) will come on the screen, then disappear.&nbsp; So that doesn't work for me in IE.&nbsp; I tried this
 in Firefox and it works fine (I also don't have the same issue with Firefox in the first place).<br />
<br />
I'd like to point you to the fact that the blank page, at least for me so far, is showing only on the first click of a PDF link.&nbsp; If I refresh that blank screen or click on the PDF link again I can see the document.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

Yes, I've read that thread and did pretty much everything.<br />
<br />
I'm comparing access on two other sites, one of them does get stuck on a blank page for 5 seconds or more, but eventually loads.&nbsp; I'll check on more sites.<br />
<br />
I would hate to think that it's site specific (because it's our own site).&nbsp; But I'm having our guys checking on our side as well.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas?&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Yes,&nbsp; 1) going to the 'page design' Tab, 2) pulling down&nbsp;the "Size" menu and 3) clicking on "More Preset Page Sizes" will get to the Avery business card choices,&nbsp; plus those of other manufacturers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the choice is anything but intuitive, can you get that instruction, along with the words"Avery" and "template" into the "Help" instructions for the next benighted user with the same question?&nbsp;&nbsp;

Did you start with the Avery 8869 template? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to New &gt; Installed templates then Business Cards. Scroll down &amp; choose the 'Avery US-Letter' folder &gt; scroll down until you find the 8869 template and create it. Now when you print from this template are you still having problems? If so please be specific
 as to what the problem is? Are the cards centered on the Print preview? "Not centered" is not specific enough to help you.</p>

    <title>Autocorrect working intermittently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nettie007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Autocorrect working intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I thank the people who answered my post entitled, "Autocorrect self deletes".</p>
<p>I still need to know what to do regarding my autocorrect problem.</p>
<p>I'm writing a research project and have 'educated' autocorrect to a great extent with many repetitively used words, such as 'R' for 'research'. &nbsp;In any one document it might or might not work. &nbsp;Sometimes it goes back to it's default state with only a few
 default autocorrects.</p>
<p>I think it changes between 'educated' and 'default' because of all the various formatting in my document with font changes and bullet points etc.</p>
<p>How can i make autocorrect work consistently in every document instead of flicking back to 'default, I don't know any of your strange words' setting?</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>Jeanette</p>

            <p>Windows and Office support thirteen (!) different variants of English, each with a different numeric Locale ID value (listed
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms912047(WinEmbedded.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>). The plain text AutoCorrect entries are stored in files whose names are MSOnnnn.ACL, where the nnnn is the Locale ID for the specific language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If some parts of your document are marked as English (US) or English (UK), and other parts are in English (New Zealand), the AutoCorrect entries that you added while in one part would not be available while in another part with a different variant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step is to select the whole document (Ctrl+A) and apply your preferred English variant to everything in the selection (Review &gt; Language &gt; Set Proofing Language). Then check the AutoCorrect list, and reenter any entries that are "missing" (i.e.,
 only in the other variant's list). In the same dialog, it's a good idea to clear the check box for "Detect language automatically" because that feature is unreliable and can change the selection's language without warning.</p>

            AutoCorrect entries are language-specific. When AutoCorrect fails, check the language formatting of the text at the insertion point.

<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>Hi GMA4514,</p>
<p>According to the error message, the first error is a connection issue. For the second issue, looks like the mailbox cannot be provisioned due to some conflict error. But no more detailed information can be found in the error message. May I collect some more
 information to troubleshoot the issue?</p>
<p>1. About the migration error, could you provide the entire screenshot? &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Use PowerShell to get the migration information.</p>
<p>a. Connect PowerShell to Exchange Online: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</a></p>
<p>b. Run the following commands:</p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationBatch | fl</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationStatistics | fl</strong></p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationUserStatistics -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -IncludeReport | FL</strong></p>
<p>Note: <strong>user@domainom</strong> is the problematic user.</p>
<p>3. Make sure: the on-premises admin account that you use to connect to your on-premises Exchange organization (also called the migration administrator) has the necessary permissions to access the 4 affected on-premises mailboxes. The required permission
 are: &nbsp;member of the Domain Admins group in Active Directory, or FullAccess permission, or Receive As permission.</p>
<p>If the migration admin account cannot access the on-premise mailboxes, such connection errors might occur.</p>
<p>4. For the 4 affected mailboxes, can you see them in Office 365 admin center (<strong>Active Users</strong>) and Exchange admin center (<strong>recipients</strong> -&gt;
<strong>mailboxes</strong>)?</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to request the PowerShell information. Please use this link to access the private message:
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hi GMA4514,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information. Let’s continue analyzing the migration issues?</p>
<p>1. About “<em>The greg mailbox error has changed after I found and herd deleted an external user account with the same smtp address</em>”, could you provide the detailed steps you have done?</p>
<p>2. Upon analyzing the PowerShell logs, I find the following error messages:</p>
<p><em>Error: ProvisioningFailedException: You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization.</em></p>
<p>Looks like the mailboxes’ email address suffix is not verified in Office 365 tenant, such as proxy address domain.</p>
<p>Could you please go to on-premise Exchange Management, and run this command to check the email address.</p>
<p><strong>Get-Recipient UserName | fl</strong></p>
<p>Note: replace <strong>UserName</strong> with this affected user name.</p>
<p>Then, please provide the entire output in private message.</p>
<p>3. For the 4 problematic mailboxes, did you get the same error message when running this command?</p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationUserStatistics -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -IncludeReport | FL</strong></p>
<p>From your PowerShell output, it seems that you only run this command against one user.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;I found an external user account with an ...#ext# username. &nbsp;Probably due to some history of inviting Greg via email to a SharePoint server site as an external user before the migration batch was created.</p>
<p>2. posted for accounts as representative of the 3 failing mailboxes</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;yes the 3 shared mailbox outputs were the same.</p>

<p>Hi GMA4514,</p>
<p>I have checked the results of PowerShell and noticed that there is the error “You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization.”. May I know whether there are any domains only using in your old mail provider, but you didn’t
 verify them in Office 365? If so, please try removing them and check them again.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, since you mentioned the Greg mailbox is uploading now, please run the following PowerShell commands for the problematic user and provide the results via private message.</p>
<p>Get-MigrationUserStatistics -Identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -IncludeReport | FL</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>For the accounts @xxx.com, I noticed that the error message: “MigrationCancelledByUserRequestException: The administrator canceled the migration”. May I know whether you did any action when the migration batch start?</p>
<p>Since the Greg starts working, about sales and info, can you re-run the batch? If the issue persists, please run the PowerShell command (Get-MigrationUserStatistics) for the three problematic users (accounts, sales and info). I have sent you a private message
 to collect PowerShell results. I will check it whether there are any new error messages.</p>

<h2>            &#61;IF&#40;ISBLANK&#41; Error in Calculated Field</h2>
                    
<p>I have created a formula (that works) assuming all the rows have data in it..... If the date isn't entered (and there are reasons it might not be) it throws in a time before the Internet..ha&nbsp;10/31/1899</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>=IF([Type of Approval]="Final Plan",[Expiration Date]-60,IF([Type of Approval]="Joint Permit",[Expiration Date]-120,IF([Type of Approval]="Misc Permit",[Expiration Date]-120,IF([Type of Approval]="NPDES Permit",[Expiration Date]-120,IF([Type of Approval]="PennDOT
 Permit",[Expiration Date]-30,IF([Type of Approval]="Preliminary Plan",[Expiration Date]-60,IF([Type of Approval]="Zoning Approval",[Expiration Date]-90)))))))</p>
<p>I tired about every variation I could think of to add an (ISBLANK( to just leave the calculated column blank if no date was entered but I keep getting the syntax error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a basic: =IF(ISBLANK(""),"Yes","No") &nbsp;will work so I know the ISBLANK can be used, just can't seem to fit it into my formula.</p>
<p>last attempt:</p>
<p>=IF(ISBLANK([Expiration Date]),””,)([Type of Approval]="Final Plan",[Expiration Date]-60,IF([Type of Approval]="Joint Permit",[Expiration Date]-120,IF([Type of Approval]="Misc Permit",[Expiration Date]-120,IF([Type of Approval]="NPDES Permit",[Expiration

<h2>            Chat&#47;IM and whats app issue - Battery saver turned on</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been using Nokia Lumia 720&nbsp;from past&nbsp;one month. When battery saver is turned on
<strong>IM </strong>shows online very very rare.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp;IM <strong>works&nbsp;perfect only&nbsp;when battery saver is turned off</strong>.&nbsp;Also I have
<strong>delay in receiving fb messages</strong> and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>sometimes I dont receive at all</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;adding to this&nbsp;I <strong>dont get</strong> a<strong> pop up</strong> for new
<strong>messages</strong> in <strong>whats app</strong> when<strong> battery saver is turned&nbsp;on.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone know&nbsp;<strong>why this happens</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            Battery saver turns off push notifications to save battery. That's the whole point of Battery Saver.<br />

            Johann Eva, while your reply here is well intentioned, you only provided generic instructions for normal-functioning versions of Windows 10.&nbsp; Many people are experiencing a non-working live Photos tile in the two most recent Insider builds, and we are
 already well aware of the steps you outlined above.&nbsp; So my question to you:&nbsp; Do you have the most recent Insider build installed, and if so,&nbsp;is the Photos live tile working in it?

<p>Hi Felipe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my experience, Microsoft Teams has no specific network requirements. Generally speaking, you can sign into Teams with public network. If you failed to sign into your account, would you please help confirm if any error message occurs? If yes,
 please send us the screenshot of the error message. If you have concern with the networking configuration, please refer to the following link to get details:</p>

            <p>it seems to be a common issue since it was reported by so many people around the world, what worked for most of them is to stop windows update services, go to Windows folder and look for Softwaredistribution folder and delete it, restart the machine and
 check updates again</p>
<p>to stop windows update service, open Task Manager, Services secion and look for wuauserv, right click on it and press stop</p>

    <title>bug in values of data points shown in stacked area charts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            bug in values of data points shown in stacked area charts</h2>
                    <div>Excel for Mac 2011 v 14.2.5 (121010). &nbsp;OS X 10.8.2 (Mountain Lion)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
There is a bug in stacked area charts which causes the incorrect value of the y-axis to be displayed for any given data point. &nbsp;When you hover the mouse cursor over any data point it should popup the corresponding x-axis and y-axis values for that data point.
 &nbsp;Instead, for stacked area graphs it is giving no x-axis value and an incorrect y-axis value for every single data point. &nbsp;If I change the chart type to stacked lines, the hovered mouse cursor pops up the correct x-axis and y-axis values for every single data
 point.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. &nbsp;Why does MS make it so difficult to report bugs? &nbsp;Do they think they're infallible? &nbsp;Why should I have to go to a Community Forum to report a problem with the program code?</div>

Choose feedback <br />
Locate section bugs<br />
describe problem in detail.<br />
<br />
You will not receive any acknowledgement what so ever from MS. And fix such bugs depends on a number of people reporting the same sentence. So if yours is the only complaint it won't be be dealt with.

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2013 crashes, how can I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    I open Outlook 2013, it starts downloading new e-mail, then a message pops up saying it is not working properly and then it shuts down. &nbsp;When I restart it, it downloads the same e-mails over again, but I cannot delete them before it crashes again. &nbsp;I've
 searched for a fix on the forum, but itlooks like the only fix so far is to switch to Thunderbird. &nbsp;So far, it's the only thing that has worked for me. &nbsp;Anybody got any solutions?

<h2>            How to lock a Word document and leave some areas editable</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to create a document to go alongside&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mycreditcontrollers.co.uk/Articles/credit-account-application-forms-best-practice.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article on credit control</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like it to be a word document showing an idealised account application form. &nbsp;I'd like the design of the form to be fixed (not editable), which would be the body of the document. &nbsp;Also I'd like to leave some branding from my company on the document (so
 if people start to use it, there'll be a small marketing benefit), but I'd like to make some sections editable, so that the company using the document can add their own branding and contact info. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could keep the editable area in just a couple of text boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>

    <title>Creating fillable forms with the developer tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jade johnston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating fillable forms with the developer tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have created forms using Microsoft Word. I designed them to be used for print, but now we would like to make them fillable as well. I have been using the developer tool in Microsoft Word and have a few questions-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way to insert fillable text fields while maintaining the underlined tabs that I created? When I put the fillable field in, the tab moves past the fillable field, and the fillable field isn't underlined like I would like it to be. I have been
 changing the tabs to be blank to keep the spacing between the fields, but I would prefer to have them underlined. For example in the first picture below, I would like all of the fillable content to be underlined and for the lines to continue to the next question
 (Applicant name to Tax ID, etc).</p>
<p>2. How does grouping text fields work? I would like to group address lines for Legal address and DBA's address in the first photo, but when I try to group the Associated DBA's address, it adds in the fillable field for DBA as well.</p>
<p>3. Is there a way to insert a radio button without any text next to it? Or to set groups of check boxes so that only one of the boxes can be chosen? For example, in the second photo I would like the Yes/No questions to be set so that only one of them can
 be selected, but when I try to use a radio box from the Active X controls in the developer tool, it won't let me insert just the radio box without text next to it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time! :)</p>

<p>Hello Charles,</p>
<p>I appreciate your quick response. As you may be able to tell I am a beginner at this stuff, so thank you for the resources- they will help me as I continue working on my forms!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I am still not finding the answer to is radio boxes. Do you know if there's a way to set check boxes so that only one option can be selected, or would I have to create a drop down list instead?</p>
<p>And is there a way to set it so that if the form is printed, the fillable fields will disappear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!!</p>

                    ok, this is a strange one.&nbsp; I have started using Time Machine with a view to thinking that everything on my Macbook Pro 17 unibody would be backed up.&nbsp; Interesting, I want back in time using Time Machine, only 1 hr and noticed that the Database file which
 sites in the Main Identity for Outlook 2011 isn't there in Time Machine?&nbsp; how come?&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the main reason for running Time Machine as I want Outlook 2011 backed up just in case.....

            One thing we did not check was did you check after Time Machine had time to do a complete backup. One hour is not enough time for the first backup to complete.<br />
<br />
Open System Preferences under the Apple in the Menu bar <br />
Select Time Machine <br />
Click on the Options tab.(edited)<br />
<br />
Is the Microsoft User Data folder, Office 2011 Identities folder or Main Identity folder added the the exclusion list.<br />
<br />
To find the file in Time Machine if you navigate to the Office 2011 Identities folder is selected in the Finder when you enter Time Machine you select a previous date and select to restore.<br />
<br />
RESTORE YOUR IDENTITY FROM A TIME MACHINE BACKUP:<br />
<br />
1) Click the Time Machine icon in the Dock or open it from the Applications folder.<br />
<br />
2) Use the arrows and the timeline along the right edge of your screen to browse through the Time Machine backups. When you find the Main Identity file, select it, and then click Restore. Select to save on the Desktop.<br />
<br />
3) Rename Main Identity on Desktop to "Restored Main Identity".<br />
<br />
4) Drag "Restored Main Identity" to the Office 2011 Identities folder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;~/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/<br />
<br />
5) "Switch Identity" Select "Restored Main Identity"<br />
http://www.officeformachelp.com/outlook/faqs/#faq20<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) You can export data from the newer Identity as .olm file to merge with the older data.<br />
File &gt; Export (select the default action to export as .olm file. You might only want to select the item you need to restore like contacts or messages otherwise you'll get duplicates)<br />
<br />
7) File &gt; Import select the .olm file into your main Identity. You'll need to drag from imported folder to the local folders/calendars, contacts etc.<br />
