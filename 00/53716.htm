<h2>            Skype missed calls</h2>
                    <p>On previous versions of Skype if I wasn't home when a call came through I used to see a yellow dot on my Skype icon indicating that I had missed a call.The last few versions of Skype do not have this feature, Why? It was very useful.</p>
<p>Also the contacts list do not now indicate if a contact is on-line or away?</p>
<p>Am I missing a set-up procedure somewhere?</p>
<p>Skype version is 8.29&nbsp; O.S is windows 7 on my desktop. Same situation exists on my small W10 laptop.</p>

            Hello PIWIRB<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to re

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            How do I change my DVD drive letter and still have the DVD drive read dvds&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just installed windows 7 64-bit on my computer and I want to chance the drive letter of my dvd drive to something other than D (which it was auto-assigned), because I'm used to using D as a second hard drive. I know how to change drive letters in the disk
 manager, the problem is if I change the DVD drive letter to anything but D it won't read dvds anymore. I get an "Application not found" error. The only solution I've found is to change the dvd drive letter back to D.</p>
<p>So how can I change the dvd drive letter without breaking the dvd drive?</p>

<blockquote>Thank you for answering, but your suggestion didn't help. However, I (sort of) solved the issue, though not very satisfactory. While most drive letters will cause the dvd drive to spit out that "application not found" error whether I reboot or not,
 letter H does work. But only drives D and H are acceptable,&nbsp;apparently. I would really like to know why this is.</blockquote>
<br />
The drive can be any letters except maybe A and B (FDDs). You get problems because a lot of apps record the installation CD/DVD drive letter within their configs.. That could be recorded practically anywhere, registry, an ini file, within the program's user
 options etc.. So if&nbsp;a game&nbsp;was installed from D: for example and it needed&nbsp;the game&nbsp;disk in the drive in order to run it would always&nbsp;look for that disc in D: drive. Unless you get a prompt allowing you to "browse" to the required drive/folder, you'd either
 have to manually change the disc&nbsp;location information for each of&nbsp;the affected programs or reinstall them&nbsp;using the new DVD/CD drive letter.

                    After my Surface book is turned off or in sleep mode and the I try to use it the surface pen won't write anything but the button works just fine. Every time this happens I need to restart the computer to make it work. I've checked the battery and also
 for updates an that doesn't seem to be the issue.&nbsp; Is there anyway to solve this problem ?&nbsp;

            Joel,
<br />Can you please run
<br />
<br />winver
<br />
<br />and reply with the build number shown? 
<br />
<br />When the pen fails to write, does multi touch pinch/zoom fail as well (using two fingers to enlarge a web page for example)? Others have found that going into device manager and disabling/enabling the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" in device manager made both the pen and the multi-touch work again. Open device manager, click on human interface devices to expand it and it should be near the bottom of the list.
<br />
<br />Suggest you also run the Surface Diagnostics Toolkit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a>

<h2>            Boot Mgr Missing...Windows 10</h2>
                    I've just been on the phone with Microsoft customer service for an hour and 1/2 waiting for someone there to answer and finally gave up. I called earlier after downloading Windows 10 repair/reinstall&nbsp;to a flash drive per instructions found on this site;
 a tech support agent remoted in to the computer I was using and extracted the files, doing what he said needed doing to make it work and said it was good to go. Got home to reinstall from the drive to my computer and I STILL get "boot mgr is missing." The
 problem I was having before this, was being stuck on the "Choose keyboard layout" screen. PLEASE HELP, Microsoft, and get more call agents, 1 1/2 hrs waiting for someone to answer is unacceptable :(

</p><p>You don't want to boot into the BIOS setup, instead you want to boot into the&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Installation Media</a> to it's second screen link for Repair Your Computer if you want to repair, or Install Now if you want to reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that I would not boot into the BIOS setup to change the Boot order, but instead power up the PC while pressing the
<a href="https://craftedflash.com/info/how-boot-computer-from-usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS Boot Menu Key.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the link to see which key is used for your PC make/model, or ask Google.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your BIOS setup screens don't indicate you have UEFI so in that case choose the flash stick or DVD drive by using the up and down arrow to highlight the correct one for your media, then press Enter to boot it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p><p>If it ignores attempt to boot the flash stick like that, it almost always means the stick is not written correctly or the stick itself is bad.&nbsp; Are you sure you selected the correct bit-version (likely 64 bit) of Windows 10 if given a choice, or did it download
 and write the stick with both versions?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try again with that stick in the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            The flash drive is brand new, 8g. I was given the choice of 64 or 32; I chose 64. A tech remoted into another computer with me to extract the Windows 10 files on the flash drive, make it bootable as he said. What about just using a new Windows 10 disk?Turning

            Hi Benedict
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is a consumer Skype forum. SFB related question is best answered at Microsoft's Technet forum where SFB experts answer the questions. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet SFB forum also.

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Connecting Headphones to the Xbox 1</h2>
                    <p>Hi there gamers!&nbsp;</p>
<p>My son bought himself an Xbox1 with his birthday money from a well known trade-in store in the UK. I bought him a Hisionlee Gaming headet last week to get him going as im fully aware how faddy kids can be and didnt want to spend loads on something that may
 not get used!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, the headset works on his laptop and with his phone and we are completely stumped as to how to connect this headset with his console so that he can chat and game with his friend!</p>
<p>HELP please as I know there must be something we are not doing to get this to sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you ☺️</p>

<p>Hey Hector,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us today! I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would first look over our article on how to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
connect compatible headsets to the Xbox One.</a>&nbsp;Does your headset plug in to the 3.5 mm headphone jack on the controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all 3.5-mm audio jacks are made to the same standard. There are two audio jack standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), and </li><li>Open Mobile Terminal Platform (OMTP). </li></ul>
<p>If you use an OMTP headset, you’ll probably experience audio or chat issues. However, if your headset or earbuds use the OMTP standard, you can purchase an adapter to convert the device to CTIA. These adapters are available at many electronic retail stores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By any chance would you happen to have another controller to test it on there as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no audio coming out from the headset at all when connected to the controller?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know so we may be able to better assist you!</p>

<p>If it is this headset&nbsp;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hisionlee-Gaming-Headset-Headphone-Black/dp/B07FYBKHGL<br />
<br />
The 3.5mm plug should plug into the bottom of his controller if he has the newer style controller with the 3.5mm port. If it is the olde controller without that port you will need the headset adapter&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there and thank you for responding. There is no audio coming from the headset when i plug it into my controller, we think it might be some setting on the xbox but we are not to sure how to fix it. In the top right hand corner of the home screen there
 is a mic symbol with a cross through it, we think that might be the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware, that you need to enable headphone output in the console's settings under "Display &amp; Audio", if you want to have game sound coming from the headset. Otherwise, only chat sound from other people will be heard from the headset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose between Stereo output, and 3D spatial sound through "Windows Sonic", or if you have purchased Dolby Atmos for headphones, you can also use Dolby Atmos for headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the stereo output connectors are the same on OMTP and CTIA plugs, the headset should at least provide sound coming from the ear speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As XBF Diego M has explained, the headset might have the Microphone and ground connectors reversed. If so, you can't get the microphone work, try buying a cheap "OMTP to CTIA" adapter. Since that adapter simply crosses two wires, the adapter works both ways.
 So you can also get a "CTIA to OMTP" adapter and it's the same thing.</p>
<p>You can get these online or in almost any cellphone store. </p>
<p>Just make sure that the cable doesn't cost much more than a coffee-to-go, or you're being ripped off.</p>

    <title>Xbox one data usage control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mocharocka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one data usage control</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm currently on a mobile data plan as it is the only Internet available to my area. the speeds are manageable on online play but my problem lies in the 15gb I data cap. The 360 was fine, playing games on my laptop was also fine but the One seems to
 consume an awfully huge amount of data at high speeds. i realise its next gen consoles and it runs multiple apps and things like chat probably use data. What I am after is anything I can do to lower usage, like making sure there are no automatic updates, any
 settings I can change to lower usage, things to close off that may run in the background etc.</p>

<p>any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>don't play destiny then, that was using between 200 and 700MB per hour when I played that, games stream more these days from the servers, so if your going to want to reduce data do research which games use the net a lot, titanfall, destiny and the crew all
 stream from the net and most likely use a lot at the same time.</p>

<p>that's the future of cloud based gaming, we get all the content on the disc and then they pump up the graphics or add elements etc etc via streaming. &nbsp;Gaming in general will become more dependant on servers as we go forward which in my eyes is a grey area
 and could potentially destroy gaming as we know it.</p>

<p>that's a good way of reducing the data overhead, but with a 15gb allowance a month I wouldn't start sending hour upon hour playing online as you will hit that cap within a week.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Best to remove Norton/Symantec and just use Windows Defender. WD in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus and offers excellent compatibility. Uninstall Norton and then run its Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants.<br />
<br />

<br />
On a home build it would be best to remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do no just snug.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check with the motherboard maker and the major device makers to ensure you have the most current BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security
<br />
products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />
corrupt or go out of bounds.&nbsp;The video driver or something affecting it would <br />
be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by <br />
manually checking&nbsp;at the System maker and device makers' sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>====================================================&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Well it's really hard to say, sounds likely that one of the terminals might not be making contact properly and is still be all sticky with beer, did you try alcoholic Q-tip's to get in those hard to reach spaces?</p>
<p>If you do a quick Google search there is actually a lot of similar chases like this that give all sorts of advice, though I would just check the wires leading from the battery terminal to wherever they go are not sticky with beer. If you've already done
 that then I'm not sure.</p>

<p>To add to DigitalAssasin's reply make sure when you clean it that its Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) preferably 99% but a more common 91% will still work beautifully. Make sure it is completely dry before throwing it back together (it shouldn't take to long it
 evaporates very quick). I use this method to clean up rosin flux when i'm done soldering.</p>

<p>I used Isopropyl Alcohol 91% with a large q-tip a week or 2 ago. Don't know where i could get 99%. I got it working again except the dpad. no direction would work on the dpad except left...I opened it up again, tried to clean more and now the dpad left/right
 won't work but up/down does. this thing sure is temperamental...</p>

    <title>Audio Problems with Windows 7. No Sound, video and game controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregorylaventure  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Problems with Windows 7. No Sound, video and game controller option. No Audio Output Device is installed.</h2>
                    Recently upgraded my HP Pavillion dv9827cl to Windows 7 64bit from Windows Vista 64bit. Your website told me that my laptop was able to upgrade so i did. It worked fine for a few days but then all of a sudden, all my audio was cut. I have an X on my speaker
 icon and i no longer have a "Sound,video and game controller" option to my Device Manager. And the HP website doesn't even have upgrades available for my model for 64bit Windows 7. How do i get my audio back? And please do not tell me to go to Download Manager
 and do something with Sound,video and game controller because once again I do not even have that as an option in my Device Manager. Can someone please help me solve this issue so that others who experienced this same problem may revieve aid as well?Once again
 sorry for repeating myself but i have no Sound, video and game controller. For some reason people can't seem to understand that part. And i have already clicked on my speaker icon and tried letting windows solve the problem automatically but to no avail. And
 no my computer is not on mute and I already tried letting it show my disabled and disconnected devices and it still tells me that no audio devices are installed.<br />

            <p><span>Hi GregoryLaventure,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
There is no sound card driver for Windows 7 in the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
However, you may try to install the sound card driver softwares in Windows 7 compatibility mode i.e. in XP mode or in Vista mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>To install in compatibility mode: <br />
a. Right click on the setup file of the driver software, click Properties, click Compatibility tab, under compatibility mode, check mark “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” and select “Windows Vista (Service Pack 1)” or “Windows XP (Service Pack 2)
 from the drop down list. Click Apply and then click ok.<br />
b. Under “Privilege level”, click “Run this program as an administrator”, click apply and then click ok.<br />
c. Install the software successfully and restart the computer for the changes to take effect.<br />
d. Thereafter, check for the functionality of the gamepad.<br />

            I have tried what you suggested. Both Conexant Audio driver installations did not work and ended up saying "Driver Installation Failed: Could not find the device for this driver." The Realtek Audio driver installed but when i restarted my computer, nothing
 changed and I still have the problem I mentioned before. X on the speaker icon and so on.<br />

            <p>See if you can get Sound driver from the Realtek manufacturer for that type of sound card you have installed for Windows 7. If they don't have one, download one for Windows Vista.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can control most of the&nbsp;Windows 10 features through <strong>Settings </strong>
app. Settings got a makeover—and dropped "PC" from its name. Get to Settings by selecting the Start
<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.2%2fmain%2faa922834-ed43-40f1-8830-d5507badb56c_91.jpg" /></span> button, and then selecting&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>. From there, browse the categories or use search to find what you're looking
 for, including advanced options in Control Panel. Most apps have their own settings—look for this icon in the app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To change desktop background and colors,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Select the Start <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" /></span> button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Personalization</strong>&nbsp;to choose a picture worthy of gracing your desktop background, and to change the accent color for Start, the taskbar, and other items. The preview window gives you a sneak peek of your changes as
 you make them.&nbsp;In <strong>Background</strong>, select a picture, solid color, or create a slide show of pictures.</li><li>In <strong>Colors</strong>, let Windows pull an accent color from your background, or choose your own color adventure.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To get started with themes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Select the Start <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" /></span> button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Personalization</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Themes</strong>&nbsp;&gt;
<strong>Theme settings</strong>. Then choose from a default theme, or select <strong>
Get more themes online</strong> to download new themes featuring cute critters, holiday cheer, and other smile-inducing options.
</li></ul>
<p>Coming to Icon spacing, system will capture this by default. The spacing between Icons will get adjusted according to your display size and resolution. Right-click on desktop screen and point to
<strong>View</strong>. There you can control the behavior of desktop icons, but not the spacing. Select the Start
<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" /></span> button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>System &gt; Display. </strong>From there you can change the size of text, apps and other items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is built-in app called <strong>Get Started </strong>on Windows 10<strong>.
</strong>Select the Start <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" /></span> button, type

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? I'm an IT from a company, and yesterday (Sept 10, Philippines Date) i set-up an Out of Office Reply in Windows Live Mail using Rules (the company is using POP3 mail server not an Exchange Server), when the rule is completed i activated
 the rule and send a test message to my own mail to test if it will automatically reply the "out of office template" that i created, but unfortunately the "Mail Service Delivery" continuously delivers email to my account (<strong>continuously means tons of
 emails</strong>), i already contacted Microsoft about it, they said to contact our ISP, i checked with out ISP and they said that our lines don't have any problems, what should I do to stop that mail?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You have probably set up a loop by doing this. The automated reply&nbsp;clearly can't be delivered, so it is bounced by&nbsp;a mail server. The bounce message itself trigger a new automated reply, which bounces again and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect from the network (switch off Wi-Fi or unplug the Ethernet cable if necessary), then deactivate the message rule - this will stop it responding to incoming bounce messages. Then empty the outbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should examine the source of a bounce message to find out why the automated response isn't being delivered.</p>

<h3> markanthony  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Libraries Are Empty when set to Arrange by Folder</h2>
                    
<p>Just recently all of my libraries have started showing up&nbsp;empty. <br />
<br />
If I switch to view by name, type, tag or date modifed the files show up, but under Arrange by Folder they are completely empty.<br />
<br />
About my system:<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 7 64bit with with 6 GIG of ram and&nbsp;all of the most recent patches/updates. I have added only one library which points to a C:\Jobs directory and I do use&nbsp;XPMode apps daily. A reboot did not resolve the issue. Neither did delete the Jobs library
 and re-adding it. <br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            Dear ScottRich,
<div>Your issue appears to be different than Pavlov's and MarkAnthony's. &nbsp;For your situation, you should try the same step MarkAnthony tried:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click your library that has the issue in the left side of your Explorer folder. &nbsp;For example, right-click the "pictures" library.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Choose Delete. &nbsp;No files will be deleted, just the library definition that describes what folders make up the library and how to present the results.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Right-click the Libraries section heading, and choose <i>Restore default libraries</i>. &nbsp;Test your results.</li></ol>

</span>I could print, scan, use pc-fax etc. without any problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>Recently controlcenter3 software stopped working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It freezes every time I try to scan (whether to file, to e-mail, to OCR).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I also get a "fatal scanner error" message whenever I try to scan through any other program using the twain driver (eg. abbyy).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Scanner works fine when using the wia driver (windows scan application).</span>
<p><span>I have downloaded all latest drivers and updates from the brother site.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is no problem with IP address either.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was using a PC with Windows XP and ControlCenter2 works just fine.</span></p>
<p><span>I want to use the controlcenter3 program as it is most useful for me.<span>&nbsp;

<strong>
<p><strong><span>So,
 using the step by step method described on microsoft's website, I'm trying to link my account to an online ID.&nbsp; Every time I actually sign in, this error appears.&nbsp; I've tried restarting, making a new Windows Live account, and various other workarounds and
 solutions, but the error keeps appearing.&nbsp; How do I resolve this error? &nbsp;In addition, if I type my password wrong, it immediately recognizes it as such without giving the error, but if I type it in correctly, it waits a while, and then gives me this error.

</strong></strong></span><strong><span><strong>
<p><strong><span>)
 said that this error was caused by a ram problem, but I think that was coincidental because I've run full diagnostics on my RAM, and received no errors, additionally, there is nothing wrong with my computer that would lead me to believe that my RAM is faulty
 (e.g. instability)</span></strong></p>

<p>edit:<span>&nbsp;I also posted this question on the live support forums and was referred to microsoft support :(</span></p>
<p><strong><span>any
