<h2>            Blue Ray playback no longer working since Windows 7 Professional Upgrade</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 7 Home Edition to the Professional Edition. &nbsp;Prior to the upgrade I was able to view blu ray movies on my laptop. &nbsp;Since the upgrade the 3rd party blu ray software (Cyberlink PowerDVD 9.5) will play the discs but will not
 display a picture. &nbsp;I tried downloading a free 3rd party software (VLC Mediaplayer) and when I go to play the blu ray discs (I have tried several) &nbsp;I get an error message like "VLC is unable to open the MRL 'dvd:///D:/'.Check the log for details." &nbsp;I need
 to find out what the upgrade changed so that I can view blu ray discs again. &nbsp;Thanks.

            The system recognizes the DVD drive and the discs in it. &nbsp;The Windows Media Player has no problems with regular DVD's or CD's in it. &nbsp;And the drive and the blu ray disc are recognized by the blu ray software Cyberlink PowerDVD. &nbsp;But, when it is playing
 the disk it doesn't display the image yet it plays the soundtrack. &nbsp;This software used to work prior to the upgrade from Windows 7 Home Edition to Windows 7 Professional Edition.

            Power DVD came pre-installed on my laptop and no backup disk for it came with the laptop. &nbsp;So I can't re-install it. &nbsp;I went to Cyberlink's website and they no longer support version 9.5 which is funny because I just bought this laptop a little over a
 year ago. &nbsp;I guess Dell didn't believe in giving recent versions of the software. &nbsp;To reload the software I would have to buy the upgrade (which Cyberlink is going to charge me full price for). &nbsp;I don't know if it will work or not and I really don't want to

            I had already seen that reply. &nbsp;That doesn't address my situation. &nbsp;I already had a 3rd party program that handles blu-ray playback. &nbsp;It had been working until I upgraded my OS from Windows 7 Home to Windows 7 Professional. &nbsp;Now the 3rd party software
 will not display the video but does play the audio. &nbsp;Since this problem began after the upgrade the most likely thing is that the upgrade changed something that is causing the 3rd party software to not work.

<p><br />
Have you gone to Dell's support site to see if they have by chance the download of the Cyberlink's program, or maybe some drivers or something for your laptop? Sometimes the manufacturers have downloads for their preinstalled programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without knowing your laptop model number, it's hard to see what other things I could suggest?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to be out of town for a week with no access to a computer, so right now that's all I can suggest. I hope you figure it out, and I'll check back here on the forums when I get back to see if you got through this. Good Luck!</p>

<h2>            Lost zip&#47;unzip Win 7 ultimate 64 bit</h2>
                    I have recently asked about restoring the zip and unzip files for Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. I have had some answers, but they have not helped. I cannot go back to a prior restore points as I have no idea when the zip/unzip files were deleted. I did sign
 up for a Zip trial period from Winzip and when I was no longer allowed to us it, and then tried to remove it may have been when the native files stopped working. Can you tell me how to reinstall those files from my windows 7 disk or some other way to bring
 them back?

    <title>How do I turn my laptop into an Audio Amplifier using the internal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul lowans  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn my laptop into an Audio Amplifier using the internal Soundcard&#59; external speakers &#40;USB&#41; and a wireless mike plugged into the microphone input&#63;</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have a Dell laptop running Vista Business; a set of Logitech portable USB speakers and a wireless microphone that&nbsp;I can connect into the mike input on the laptop. The speakers work fine when&nbsp;I play music CD. The wireless microphone shows a responce when
 testing it using the speech recognition in the control panel.<br />
<br />
What I need is to turn the soundcard in mylaptop into an amplifier so when&nbsp;I speak into the mike and&nbsp;the sound comes out of the speakers.
<br />
<br />
The reason I need this is because I give several presentations and thought having a sound system would help if I were in a larger venue. I realize the limitations of the speakers to deliver sound and also feedback limitations. I just need something that will
 project sound when needed.

<p><span>Hello Paul Lowans,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>In order to be able to use the Mic for live playback:
</span></p>
<p><span>Here would be some options that you have to accomplish recording Line-in to a microphone input.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Try to turn the source volume WAY down.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>a. Turning the source (mp3 player, stereo, CD player) of the signal all the way down.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>b. Turn off the microphone boost in the recording settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>c. Slowly turn up the volume of the source until you start to notice distortion, then turn<span>&nbsp;
</span>it down just enough to where the distortion is gone.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>d. If you hear the distortion as soon as you turn up the volume from the source then this method will not be possible.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Use an attenuating cable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>a. This cable will turn a line level signal in to a microphone signal. (So when it is amplifier it is amplified to line level again)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. This cable will replace the cable that you are using now. (Connects from the
 source<span>&nbsp; </span>“Line-Out” to recording device “MIC-In”)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>c. You can find this cable in most electronic stores.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Using a different sound card.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>a. You can buy a sound card for your laptop if you want more functionality than your laptop provides.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>b. You will want a sound card that has a Microphone Level Input as well as a Microphone Level Input.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>c. There are various different ways you can install sound cards on your laptop. Most common being through USB connection or through an Express Card.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>d. Once you install a sound card that has a Line Level Input the option for “Line-In” will become available in Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>E.This devices are usually sold in major electronic and computer stores.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>4. Contact Manufacturer</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>a. You may be able to contact your manufacture to see if they have developed a driver<span>&nbsp;
</span>that will convert the “MIC-In” to “Line-In”</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that this information helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox Preview Program</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I have a problem in regarding to the Xbox Preview Program. My Xbox one is registered in the program and I want to opt-out. Problem is that the account used for opting-in the Xbox one into the program is no longer available to me, so I can't just
 go into the Preview app and opt-out manually. Got in touch with Microsoft's Xbox customer support about this, and they couldn't help. They just told me to look into the private forum especially made for the Preview program, in which I have no access since
 I am not in the program (only my Xbox one is). Is there a way to opt-out of the program without the main account that registered the Xbox one into the program or am I complete stuck in the program?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you get a message that states that the "group cannot be found" PM a mod so they can grant you access to those parts of the forums. Or wait up to 3 Days if you just registered.</p>

<p>Just a heads up the Xbox one support forums are not the place to request invitations to the preview program i will provide the necessary info to request the invitation. If you want an invitation to the program you will have to go through 3 steps, and the
 program isn't accepting new members yet in fact it seems like it is full of members.</p>
<p>1) Be invited</p>
<p>2) Be accepted</p>
<p>3) Enroll</p>
<p>(Note being accepted can take up to months before actually getting into the program and there is no guarantees and if you have any 'recent' enforcement action on your account can restrict access to the program. But if your enforcement action was a year ago
 then your set and authorized to join the program.) If you currently have no friends in the program and you want in! Then post here in the link below.</p>
<p>forums.xbox.com/.../1994482.aspx</p>
<p>Side note if you have issues launching the preview app and get a message that states "Unexpected Error" and all you can do is close the app / program</p>

            <p>Hey, SUPER SOLDIER01! Sorry to see you can't change out of the preview! We don't suggest sending private messages to Official Staff. If you are at least invited to the program, we generally have users create a post in the registration support forums for assistance. To clarify on your issue, do you know the gamertag that registered the console into the preview program? If you do, please send it to me in a private message. To do that, you will want to click the envelope at the bottom of my post.</p>
<p>Once I have that, I can look into things a bit more, and get you handed off to the Preview Team. We will have 2 options at this point. One will be to unenroll your console and then wait until the current preview is out to everyone; the other is to immediately factory reset your console. When you post back, please let me know which one you're okay with so that I can let the preview team know your preference. </p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hi</p><p><br /></p><p>If you did not enrol the console in the Xbox Insider program can you please install the Xbox Insider Hub app on the console. Once you have installed this app on the left can you select Setting &gt; Manage Devices and you should be able to remove the console from the Insider Program yourself.</p>

<h2>            No sound in Win 8.1 Impossible To Fix</h2>
                    <p>I loaded up a YouTube video and... THE SOUND WAS GONE!</p>
<p>Same on all four of my browsers! Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer (As well as Opera)</p>
<p>Now nothing can get sound back. I've searched for the past 6 hours across YouTube and Windows Forums.</p>
<p>I did not find anything that I can use.</p>
<p>The only sound I can get is from the "Test" button in "Sound".</p>
<p>Otherwise my computer is muted. But It does not say so anywhere. </p>
<p>What the heck is going on and how do I fix it (I can't find a way)</p>
<p>No malware on my computer checked 6 times.</p>
<p>Nothing is getting better.</p>
<p>If anyone can help me that will be great.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Matt,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft community. I appreciate your interest in windows 10.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you able to use mouse to select the keyboard layout?</div>
<div>
<p>2. Try connecting&nbsp;another key board and check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of&nbsp;your&nbsp;PC?</p>
<div>4. Remove the key board from the present port&nbsp;and connect it to another port? (If you are using a desktop) and check</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persist I suggest you perform clean installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I had exactly the same issue trying to install version 10.4.1.10 of itunes and it failed on the installation of the quicktime part of the install. I even installed the standalone quicktime but it still wouldnt complete the itunes installation. I tried
 for several hours following posts where solutions were met, none worked for me. I decided to approach it all manually after total uninstall and running the MicrosoftFixit50356 tool did not fix it. Following these next steps solved my issue:<br />
<br />
For Vista,<br />
1. Enter regedit in start search and <span style="font-weight: bold">run as Administrator</span><br />
2. Select folder, <span style="font-weight: bold">HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18</span><br />
3. Right click on AppData (in value list) on right pane<br />
4. Select Modify or double click on the key.<br />
5. Check the data value for AppData value to <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
%USERPROFILE%\AppData</span><br />
6. If value is different or missing, type the value as mentioned in step5.<br />
7. Next check the key <span style="font-weight: bold">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</span> and ensure the value is as mentioned in step5.<br />
<br />
You do not need to restart the machine after this modification if you are working with an installer as it will read the value from the registry each time it runs. I ran it with 4 out of the 5 apple products installed, just missing itunes so i fully expect it
 to work with an upgrade as well which is all i originally wanted to do.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps people experiencing this issue, it seriously wound me up.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />
Paul<br />

                    <p>I've been experiencing a little problem with my keyboard. I've been using MSI CR41OM and some of the keys were not working unless it was pressed many times. Reinstalling the driver may fix the problem but I do not have knowledge
<strong>where I can have one of the appropriate drivers for my device.</strong></p>

            <p>The chances of a driver re-installation fixing what is most likely a physical keyboard problem is almost ZERO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine the general state of the notebook's keyboard, connect a full size USB keyboard and see if the keys work properly. If they do, you will have to get the notebook keyboard replaced..

    <title>Can I delete all user accounts and start over without losing personal - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I delete all user accounts and start over without losing personal files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been using more than one user account on my computer (both Microsoft and local accounts) which is getting confusing.&nbsp;
<strong>I would like to just delete all of my existing&nbsp;user accounts and start over with&nbsp;one new local account.</strong>&nbsp;
<em>But I don't want to format my hard drive and lose all of my personal files and programs in the process.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to just wipe out all user accounts and start over <strong>while keeping all of my files and programs intact?</strong>&nbsp; Could I&nbsp;move all of my files to public folders, delete all of my user accounts, create a new local account, and then move
 all of my files to the new user account?&nbsp; Is there a way to do this?&nbsp; I don't mind having to redo a few settings or reinstall a couple of devices, but I would rather not have to&nbsp;restore lots of data files.</p>

            <p>Better to move the files to an external device or a separate folder altogether but to a certain extent it depends on what files you are referring to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Documents, pictures, music etc. can be moved relatively easily to another folder or drive and then copied back into the new account. If however you are using specific programs such as Outlook the data file can belong to a specific profile so would need other
 options to transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs themselves are normally available to all users unless the program setup allowed "just for this user" as an option. However if a program has user level preferences a new user will get the default options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy the contents of a user profile direct to another user but this must be done whilst logged in as a third user. i.e. A can be copied to B but not whilst either is active so has to be done by C.</p>

            <p>HairyFool, thanks but I'm trying to avoid having to copy everything to a external drive.&nbsp;
<em>But you say a separate folder is OK -- would that be true for copying all of the subfolders and files from my USER folders to my PUBLIC folder?</em>&nbsp; Then is there a way to wipe out ALL of my USER accounts AND associated folders without touching the PUBLIC
 folder?&nbsp; I was under the impression that a system reset would destroy all of my personal files on drive C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got into this mess because I when I setup my new laptop, I was prompted to create a Microsoft user account.&nbsp; So I entered an email address, not knowing that it created a user folder&nbsp;with my email address as its name...but the complete address is too long
 to display, so Windows used a shortened version.&nbsp; Then I changed my email address, so when I tried to change the email address on my user account I wound&nbsp;up with another user account and another&nbsp;user folder with a cryptic name.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really didn't want a Microsoft
 account anyway and I didn't like my email address displaying on my screen when logging in at a public place, so I converted my Microsoft account to a local account.&nbsp; This had the effect of creating yet another user folder.&nbsp; So now I have multiple user folders
 with cryptic names.&nbsp; My current local account is an admin account so I have no trouble accessing all of my files, but I would really like to streamline my hard drive and remove the extraneous&nbsp;user folders with cryptic names.&nbsp; But Windows won't let me&nbsp;rename
 or delete the folders because apparently there are&nbsp;user profiles still&nbsp;associated with each of them&nbsp;even though I deleted all of the user accounts except for the one I currently use.&nbsp; It seems that resetting my system is the only thing to do, but I dread having
 to copy all of my files to an external drive and then copy them all back.</p>

<h3> curgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 8 blue screen error&#58; &#34;Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We&#39;re just collecting some error info and then, we&#39;ll restart for you&#34;.</h2>
                    I've been trying to install Windows 8 Pro on my HP ENVY 4 Notebook. Unfortunately, after completing all the&nbsp;procedures, my computer restarts and the Windows 8 screen shows(Welcome screen i suppose) and the loading icon starts rotating. After couple of
 secs, a blue screen appears saying "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info and then, we'll restart for you".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to install from my USB, doing this, when it gets to the point where I have to choose Customized Installation, after clicking next, its brings out a screen where the Drives on my computer are supposed to appear but unfortunately, no Drive is
 appearing on the dialog window. I have my C: drive as the primary and also I made a partition to install the Windows 8 but non of these seems to be working out. I don't know if i'm doing something wrong. Please I really need someone to help me out here, All
 my friends had upgraded to Win8, i really feel left out.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope my problem explanation is&nbsp;discrete enough for anyone to help. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities. From your problem description I understand that you are unable to
 upgrade Windows 8 operating system. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best
 to resolve it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>From which version of windows are you trying to upgrade it?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Before upgrading to Windows 8, we recommend that you run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. It scans your current PC
 to see if it is ready for Windows 8 and then provides a compatibility report and optional steps for you to buy, download, and install Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Check if the issue is caused by some of the hardware malfunctioning on your computer. I suggest that you disconnect all the External devices connected to your computer, except the mouse and the keyboard
 and check if you can able to boot in Norma mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>If the issue persists then I would suggest you to
<span>perform a Startup Repair.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>a) Boot from the Windows 8 USB device.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b) At the Install now screen</span></p>
<p>
<span>c) Click <b>
Repair your computer.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>d) Click <b>
Advanced Options.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>e) Click <b>
Troubleshoot.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>f) Click <b>
Startup repair.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>g) Follow the on screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please go ahead and follow the methods mentioned below and later update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>I had the same problem 2 weeks ago while in Mexico. &nbsp;I contacted TWC support and the person I talked said he had to unblock something. &nbsp;When he did this, all my mail came into Outlook into the spam folder. &nbsp;This was OK because I got my mail.</p>
<p>I moved to a different house and now have the same problem again. &nbsp;I contacted TWC support again and had no luck. The second tier support person and I spent over an hour, calling from Mexico using Vontage. &nbsp;He could not find anything from the previous call
 that guided him in fixing it this time. &nbsp;He said he would open a ticket and call me back in the next 24 to 48 hours. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If he calls back and resolves the problem, I will post how it was corrected.</p>

 remove the dual boot option and let it go straight to Vista? EDIT: Also i've tried system recovery, don't have any other backups

            <p>I agree. The post from the moderator was unhelpful and very simple- something I suspect many Insiders would already know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone sees this please look into this issue - seems to be a bit more complicated than a registry error (unless my cleaner missed it).</p>

            <p>It happend to me again. When I was following Repair, it always ended unsuccessfull, when I used my saved login, but if I choosed to log in by different account and used the same as I was already loged in, everything went well and error is gone.&nbsp;

<h2>            When charging the charger makes a high pitch noise is this normal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When charging the surface the charger makes a lot of noise once the surface is fully charged. Its a really high pitch noise so is extremely annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed other plugs doing it such as mobile phone chargers but never as bad as the surface one are other in the UK having this as well or should I get it replaced?</p>

            Either problem with fluctuating current (cause you mentioned other devices do the same) or get your charger/device replaced.

<p>It sounds like the issue you are having is that you can't log into your Microsoft Account so that you can see if your bitlocker recovery key is available at&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey&nbsp;</a>
 - and you had to change the email address or phone number etc. so that there is a 30 day wait. Is this what is happening?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't do anything to remove the 30 day wait. You can reimage and wipe everything and set up fresh with a downloadable recovery image. You will lose everything store on your SP3 and you will need to reinstall programs. If you decide to do this, you can
 set up a new Microsoft Account or set up as a local account and then when you get access to your original Microsoft Account, you can add it to your Surface or change the local account to a MS account. Below is info on using the recovery image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)<span>&nbsp;
</span>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</p>
<p>Step 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</p>
<p>Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Step 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</p>
<p>Step 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Just remove my files.</p>
<p>Step 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Reset.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).</p>

<h2>            Windows Key not working on G15 logitech keyboard </h2>
                    
<p>I have had windows 7 for several months now and have never been able to get the windows key on my G15 logitech keyboard to work. All the other keys seem to function and the display on the keyboard picks up the correct information, just not the windows key.</p>
<p>Any ideas for a solution would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Thank you both very much</p>
<p>i checked it on another computer and at first it wasnt working either, then i played with some of the keyboard setting namely&nbsp;a particular switch which seems to turn on and off the windows key functionality (assuming that is for gaming)</p>
<p>i had already tried reinstalling drivers and things with no luck, amazing what happens with a bit of trial and error</p>
<p>thanks again</p>
