<h2>            Managing holidays for multiple sites in different countries.</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; I work for a multi-national company with multiple sites around the world.&nbsp; As you might expect, the holiday schedules for each of these sites and locations is different.&nbsp; Now, we are in the beginning phases of migrating from
 a competing mail and collaborative solution to Office 365.&nbsp; In our current solution, managing these different holidays is easily done in the central directory for that platform and users can chose to import or update those holidays as needed.&nbsp; This is a very
 important function for our users.&nbsp; However, I have not seen a similar function in Exchange Online or Office 365.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; So, my question is this.&nbsp; Is there a way to easily create, deploy, and manage multiple and different holiday entries and make them available to the users?&nbsp; Is there a central repository for Holidays that can be updated either
 in the GUI or via PowerShell that is then distributed to the user's or made available to them to import into their own calendars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as an example, we have multiple sites in the US and each of them has a different list of observed holidays for business reasons.&nbsp; The same is true for our sites in Germany, Belgium, and other locations around the world.&nbsp;
 Each with a unique list of observed holidays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Many thanks in advance for your consideration and assistance.</p>

<p>Hi RoRWessels,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding to holiday calendar, you can create it in Outlook Web App or <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-holidays-to-your-calendar-in-outlook-for-windows-f16d872f-8dad-4750-bb7c-166e72c26977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for Windows.</a> </p>

</p>
<p>You can create multiply calendars in Office 365. You can also create a shared mailbox to manage multiply calendars.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, you can share calendar to others. For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/calendar-sharing-in-office-365-b576ecc3-0945-4d75-85f1-5efafb8a37b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I sort of stumbled on the suggestion of creating multiple shared calendars.&nbsp; In our currently platform, it is rather easy to create the lists of different holidays for each site and country, usually also localized in the native language for that site.&nbsp; Then
 the user can easily import those holidays into their personal calendar as they need or require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how the solution in Exchange Online actually works.&nbsp; As this is something I have not yet had to do.&nbsp; However, I am willing to learn and I would like to have a solution before the request lands on my desk.</p>

<p><span>Hi RoRWessels,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, you can create one shared calendar for each site. Then you can share the calendar to users in this site if they are using Office 365 and in the same organization. We don't&nbsp;</span>support sharing a calendar to Office
 365 groups currently, but you can share a calendar to a security group. It means you need to add the users in a site to a security group. Otherwise you can only share with&nbsp;individual users.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Account Creation Fails With &#34;Usage Limit Exceeded&#34; Error Message</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am a tutor on computer course for pensioners run by the UK charity AgeUK. One subject that is covered by this course is Electronic Mail. To help with the lesson on Electronic Mail, we create an Outlook e-mail ID for each student. Up until recently I had
 no difficulty in creating these&nbsp; IDs provided I created only two per day. However, since last week I haven't been able to create any new IDs and the error message that I have received is "Usage Limit Exceeded. Try Again Tomorrow". Of course, the attempt also
 fails on the following day. The computer course requires me to create up to 4 new Outlook IDs every four months. Could you advise me please as to which "usage limit" I might have exceeded that prevents me from creating new Outlook IDs. For example, have I
 now exceeded the number of new Outlook IDs that I am allowed to create in a month or year, etc. Many thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>If the accounts are created on behalf of the students are free (Outlook.com), there should be no problem. If the accounts are created under an Office account provided by an organization, it would be best to have it communicated with that organization's IT

<p>He is talking about free accounts&nbsp; (outlook.com), and there is definitely an issue here.
</p>
<p>I face the same one, with only one account to create.</p>
<p>I'm in in private mode to avoid interference with other accounts, and always get this message : limit exceeded, try again tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT :&nbsp;the error message appear whenrequesting the SMS security code. Apparently cannot be sent because of this limit, so it is impossible to create a new account. I tried with French phone (+33)</p>

            Are you referring to the 2-step verification? If you are able to disable it, test it and see if you will still encounter the concern after. Should you still encounter the concern, best is to have it communicated with our support services team for further
 assistance: (<a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>).

</p><p>Hello Dann Ave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if the process I have described above whereby Outlook uses my mobile phone to send me the required security code for creation of a new Outlook account, is described as a "2-step verification". But if so, it can not be disabled (not by me).
 It is an integral part of the process for creation of new Outlook accounts. As you suggest. I may have to contact your support services team for further assistance. Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi I recently had the same issue when creating a Microsoft account on behalf of my client (after his account got suspended for incorrect password entry). I got in touch with Microsoft support and they advised to use another phone number for verification.</p>
<p>I tried both my mobile and my client's mobile but it would not accept either due to the usage limit message. We tried again 7 days later and we still got the same message.<br />
</p>
<p>Again I contacted Microsoft and they advised that because the mobile numbers were associated with existing Microsoft accounts we could not use them for a new account verification, and that I should use a friend's phone. Of course this is not practical or
 professional in a business environment.</p>
<p>In the end we were able to create a new account, but it required the use of a disposable SMS service. We could then add the correct number back on the new account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What was this disposable SMS service that you used please? - and how did you manage to get the option&nbsp; for its use. The only option I get is that for submitting a phone number. (One frustrating aspect of this problem is that no one in Microsoft can tell
 me exactly what "usage limit" I am supposed to have exceeded. Is it, for example, the number of accounts created per week, or the total number of accounts created to-date in total, or some other limit). Many thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>I am unable to give a specific provider (I'm sure Microsoft regularly block these for abuse prevention).</p>
<p>You can try a web search for "sms verify disposable number" and this will bring up a lot of results, just keep in mind there will be some trial and error. I would only recommend this as a last resort if you have already tried your customer's mobile and are
 stuck in the same situation which I was.</p>

<p>What I would like to do if possible, when I open the word document that a macro will auto run to do the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Here is the layout for the tables.</p>
<p>Index Table...</p>
<p>3 Columns, Rows added when new programmes are added.</p>
<p>In the table cells are the title of the programme... "Sons of Anarchy" and so on...</p>
<p>I wish to change this to this... "Sons of Anarchy (Current Season: 5, Number of Episodes Recorded: 13/13, Number of Episodes Left to Watch: 13)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table for "Sons of Anarchy"...</p>
<p>Above the table is the Programme Title (This is where my Hyperlink sends me)</p>
<p>Table Layout...</p>
<p>"Season no:" (One Row, 3 Columns Merged)</p>
<p>Column 1 = Episode Number (1...13)</p>
<p>Column 2 = Recorded Date (Format: dd/mm)</p>
<p>Column 3 = Seen (Format: P (Tick in Wingdings 2)</p>
<p>Rows = Top as Season Number, then How ever many Episodes their are for the Season, then 1 final row (Columns 1 &amp; 2 Merged, 3rd = Number of Episodes still to watch).</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sons of Anarchy</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Season 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>|&nbsp; Ep.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rec&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp; Seen&nbsp; |</p>
<p>|-------------------------|</p>
<p>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp; |&nbsp; 12/04&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
<p>|------------------------ |</p>
<p>|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp; |&nbsp; 19/04&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>|------------------------|</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and so on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>|-----------------------|</p>
<p>| Total Seen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I want to do, if it is possible, is to go to this table, and count the number of episodes, then count the blanks in the column for Rec Date, then count the number of non blank for number recorded, then count the number of blanks, and take blanks
 from non blanks, to get the recorded/total episodes, then for the last part, take number seen from total recoded for Left to Watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then repeat this for each programme (Table) I have in the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>I hope I have made myself clear, just ask if I have not.</p>
<p>I know it would have been easier to have created this in excel, but others who use this file don't have access to excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>MS Band won&#39;t turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickdoherty67  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Band won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    <p>So, updated Health app last night (18th Sep 2016) and it updated my band. All seemed fine. Went to bed, put it into sleep mode. Woke up, told it I was awake. 20 minues later I looked at it and it was off and wouldn't turn on even though the battery should
 have been more than 50%. However, this has happened before and usually connecting the charger will bring it to life, but not this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing happening when connected to charger (either adapter or PC USB). Pressing and holding power 9or both) button does nothing when connected to charger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disconnect charger and press and hold both button, after about 8 seconds I get the 2 arrows you normally see during updating. If I let go of the power button (or both) this disappears. If I keep the power button pressed in the arrows stay there animating,
 but nothing else happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your Microsoft Band 2 that doesn't turn on, We would need you to perform a two-button method to restart the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps on how to perform a two-button restart on your Band 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;Press and hold the power button and the action button on your Band at the same time.<br />
<strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;After three seconds, your Band will show Turn Power off?
<br />
You can power down your Band and restart it by swiping left and tapping Yes, or you can continue to hold down both buttons for an additional seven to eight seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 3:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;After an additional seven to eight seconds, your Band’s screen will flash red. You can release both buttons and your Band will perform a quick restart, or you can continue to hold down both buttons for a few more seconds.<br />
<strong>Step 4:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Release both buttons. <br />
You Band will now be turned off.<br />
<strong>Step 5:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the power button to restart your Band.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the approach we've provided did not work or solve the problem, you may reach out to our
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Answer Desk</a></strong> for further assistance.</p>

<p>You need the Office cd, a downloadable installation file is not available from MS or any other legitimate source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007 and higher is fully win8 compatible.</p>

<h2>            Cortana won&#39;t update my name</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 1520. Cortana used to get my name right. &nbsp;Then my grandkids used my phone for playing some games, and in the process, decided to pull a prank and change my name to a silly name. Later, I changed it back to my original name, and Cortana
 confirmed the change in text and pronunciation. Yet, when I get a text, Cortana <strong>
always </strong>reverts back to that silly kid name when it announces a received text message! That's even if I specify to
<em>not </em>call me by name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue as to how to <em>really </em>reset my Cortana name?</p>

            Still no solution to this issue. Looks like the only possible solution is to do a complete reset of my 1520. But even if that works, it may only work until the next time my grandkids change my Cortana name.

 may need to set the date and time after this. Let us know how it goes.

<p>Why? This is a very poor design choice.</p>
<p>It seems clear to me that the mobile app use case is when the user is away from their computer, and therefore much more likely to be scheduling things that are with family and friends or doctors or otherwise private then I am when scheduling things sitting
 at my desk in the office. <br />

<h2>            Interesting Article in Neowin regarding the Windows 10 Insider Program</h2>
                    <p>Very interesting and food for thought. Kudos to Colin for his determination to update the Release Preview ring.</p>

<p>I agree Colin has asked MS many times to use the Release Preview for what it was designed for along with myself when I was using my Cal54 account here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so disappointed with this site and the way so many things we suggested were just ignored even though they were also added to the Feedback Hub, I deleted the Cal54 Account and started over just trying to answer other Insiders with a little help when
 I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many Post here about the Insider Builds being Unstable, causing Processors to over work, and just breaking the OS in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many have also asked if the Insider team could concentrate on stabilizing the OS more than just adding apps that would not be used by some or even many.&nbsp;</p>

            The worst experience for me is how long it is taking to download these 19H1 builds. My Dell laptop took about 3 1/2 hours but my HP laptop took 8 hours as the download process did not inform us that the bounce issue was throwing out an error that meant
 to re-download the build and try again.&nbsp; Again a total lack of communication.

<p>An informative and lucid article explaining clearly the points some of us have been saying for some time. The fact that basic parts of Windows 10, like Edge, still have problems today. Just look at the number of Insiders using other browsers. Everybody remembers
 the upset in April when Chrome froze. Do we get the same fuss over Edge?</p>
<p>But if you are sat at your computer with your HoloLens on, watching an X-Box game, using 3D graphics and Tweeting on your super-phone (note not a Windows phone) then you are as the great &amp; good of the Windows Insiders hierarchy say, "the best of the Windows
 Insiders."</p>

<p>When I was still school age I lived in many places in So. California as my dad moved a lot. But I have lived here in Amboy Washington as of 1968 I hated moving all over the place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this thread receives many many Replies and maybe someone from MS will see that we do care about the OS more than a few Apps that don't work as they should or some of us have no need for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if MS could finally get the Download /Install process working as it should. It seems to be one of the Insiders biggest Problems and must be so full of errors it is what could be causing the largest part of the problem.</p>

            Great post and I think it shows what MS wants but went at it the wrong way one of them being the name "<strong>insiders</strong>" which caused a lot of ill informed people to join thinking that being an insider that they would be getting the
<em><strong>latest</strong></em> and <em><strong>greatest operating system</strong>
</em>from Microsoft, after installing finding out that it is a BETA testing program where it would help to have at least a basic knowledge of computer systems.&nbsp;

<p>I would need a forum all to myself to report ALL of the problems that I have had with Edge over all of our builds since 1/10/2014 with 99xx or whatever it was. But I have tried to stick with it. Some times to stop myself screaming at the constant failure
 of my ability to post using Edge I have used IE11. And what do I find when I open IE11? I get a webpage telling me to use Edge as it is the most professional and fastest browser available.....! Hmmm! I have to endure the laughter and sarcastic comments as
 my wife uses Chrome and Google on her Windows 7 laptop but I persevere in silence (I know which side my bread is buttered...:~)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the most pertinent sentence in the whole article is;</p>
<p>"<span>Open Feedback Hub now, for example, and among the top 10 most upvoted items,
<strong>only two pertain to actual problems users encountered in their use of Windows 10.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>We, all of us, have tried over 4 years to make Microsoft Insiders hierarchy understand that "we" the Insiders signed up to "Test Windows!"</p>
<p>The interview with Donna said it all. No mention of testing Windows. No mention of sacking all of the Microsoft testers. No mention that this is a "Beta" program.</p>
<p>My old Mum-in law, God bless her soul, used the phrase "making a molluck of things." I didn't believe it was a proper word. But it is in the English dictionary as a Gloustershire term for making a right old mess of things.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Let's say your flash drive has the letter F: assigned to it.&nbsp; When you export, you'll export to the F: drive.&nbsp; After following a few screens it'll ask you "Where do you want to export your favorites" and give you a default address of<u> C:\Users\xxx\Documents\bookmark.htm</u>
 where "xxx" is your user ID.&nbsp; Change the address to something like <u>F:\bookmark.htm</u> .</p>
<p>&nbsp; Then remove the flash drive and take it to the new PC.&nbsp; Plug it in and it will again assign a drive letter to it.&nbsp; Assuming it assigns the letter F: again, when it asks where to import from, put in</p>
<p><u>F:\bookmark.htm</u> .&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;That's it.</p>

    <title>Corrupt Toolbar and Ribbon Icons in PowerPoint&#58;mac 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmarkppt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt Toolbar and Ribbon Icons in PowerPoint&#58;mac 2011</h2>
                    I had a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;today whereby the Mac menu bar for PowerPoint disappeared (File - Edit - View - Insert etc.), leaving just the first "PowerPoint" item allowing me to exit only.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After reading lots about plist files and Mac user profiles (PowerPoint works ok in a new user account), I reinstalled (without removing first) PowerPoint using the Office installer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I now have the Mac menu bar back but the icons in toolbar above the ribbon and the ribbon itself are all jumbled up as if the reference to the right icons is corrupt. &nbsp;This is corrupt for all Office applications even though I only reinstalled PowerPoint.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Given that I've already reinstalled PowerPoint, Does anyone know what I can do next?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE 1 : I've just noticed that after the installation of the PowerPoint component that Outlook is no longer able to start. It asks to select an identity and all of the options shown cause the error "Could not change to that identity. An unknown error
 has occurred in Outlook." Even creating a new identity doesn't work. So I guess that's my working day lost to trying to fix this :-(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE 2 : I rebuilt the Outlook database by holding the option key when starting Outlook but that didn't make any difference.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE 3 : I've just manually removed the entire Office:mac 2011 suite by using these MS instructions, except for the last part where the Microsoft User Data has been left in place&nbsp;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2398768</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE 4 : Just reinstalled Office:mac 2011 followed by an automatic update to the Microsoft AutoUpdate and then the Office 2011 14.2.3 Update and then the Office 2011 14.3.1 Update</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And all the problems are now fixed, just 2 hours after I started.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The steps you have taken are exactly the steps MVPs have been recommending for people who re-installed all or part of Office without first completely removing Office.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We also recommend after reinstalling you should run&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=font+book+how+to+site:apple.com&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fkb%2Fht2509&amp;ei=QCohUeenM-Xr0QHslYD4Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHza5OSTnsTSUiy-Fyw_DP1zik2zg&amp;bvm=bv.42553238,d.dmQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u><strong>Font Book</strong></u></a> application. Use Font Book to validate ALL your fonts. Generally, we suggest that you keep the newest versions of duplicate fonts and delete any font that doesn't pass validation. Restart you Mac and then empty the trash
 to get rid of the unwanted fonts.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><strong>Disk Utility</strong></u></a> to Repair Permissions and Verify the startup volume after installing Mac OS updates is also a good idea.</p>

<p>I am using Kinoni Remote Desktop (ovi store), it works and can be used also in shareware mode, but since one year or so I cannot change the cursor mouse type anymore (it only shows the "compass rose" movement type in upper right corner). I suppose it is
 related to the PC drivers, since it works the same (i.e. buggy) on N8 with Belle and on fresh flashed Anna on same phone. I am using the paid version, so a shareware limitation is out of question.</p>
<p>(also in recent installation the first launch help screen afer install does not show anymore as it once was)</p>

<p>You may also be interested in TouchRemote, which is a Java app that runs pretty well on Symbian. I have used it successfully on a Nokia 808 connected to a PC running Windows 7. The app is also still being updated, as the client is also available for Android
 (and Blackberry). The server app, which is also available as a demo, runs on the PC, and can work over the internet (typically with some tweaks to the router settings) as well as within a LAN or by Bluetooth. Since there is no central database of clients kept
 on a server somewhere, it's not as easy as Teamviewer to set up. Here's a lnk to the developer's site:</p>
<p><a href="http://touchremote.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://touchremote.eu/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The client can also be obtained through the Nokia Store, but that's the free part.</p>

    <title>No Synchronization to Metaverse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart townsend  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Synchronization to Metaverse</h2>
                    <p>I have recently deployed an AAD Connect staging server. We decided to test it and we can see all the objects that should be synchronised to Office 365/Azure AD in the Metaverse. However, if I look in the Synchronization Service I see that the Synchronization
 operations have a status of "Stopped-Server". There are error events in the application event with IDs of 6311 and 6401. There are some old articles about a hotfix for FIM, but these obviously cannot be applied. Also, if I create a new user I can see the object
 listed in the Connector Space for AD when an import (full or delta) runs, however, even though when the Synchronization (full or delta) runs the statistics says add 1, if I click the link there are no objects listed. AAD Connect is using full SQL hosted on
 another server. I can also see on the SQL server that AAD Connect is connected and the solution must have worked at some point because there are objects in the Metaverse. I believe the Connector Space objects are stored in memory on the server and only the
 objects synchronized to the Metaverse are stored in SQL, so could it be a problem with SQL?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot run the AAD Connect troubleshooting tool in the environment that I'm working in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas what could be the root cause of the issue and how it can be fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Hi Stuart,<br />
<br />
I understand that you encountered an 'Stopped-Server' error in AAD connect.&nbsp;It could be to many deletes in the local AD. A feature of the AZure AD Connect Tool is the deletion threshold. This feature is designed to protect you from accidental deletes and changes
 to your on-premises directory which would effect a large number of users. You may refer to the following steps to temporarily disable the threshold or adjust the threshold:<br />
1. Open PowerShell on Azure AD Connect server.<br />
2. Run “Import-Module ADSync”.<br />
3. Run the PowerShell cmdlet: Disable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold<br />
4. Trigger another sync or just run the Export run profile in the miisclient.exe.<br />
5. To re-enable the protection run the PowerShell cmdlet: Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold<br />
<p><span>6. Adjust the threshold using the command: Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold -DeletionThreshold &lt;value&gt;<br />
<br />
Besides, please provide the entire error message you found so we can further check this issue.</span></p>
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang

                    <p>All of a sudden yesterday, many sites I go to often won't even open videos. Either a still picture of the video shows with no arrow or X or anything, or else a black box with nothing on it shows, or else just an empty white space, or nothing at
 all among the rows of printed words.</p>
<p>Some sites have videos show up and even start playing without me trying to play them. youtube works.</p>
<p>I tried Tools/Internet/Security, and clicked on Reset all zones to default, also Show Pictures and also Animation. It didn't help.</p>
<p>I also added sites to Trusted Sites. It didn't help. I had restarted IE.</p>
<p>I think it is windows 8.<br />

<h2>            Downloading and installing Access 2010</h2>
                    I have just set up Windows 10 64 bit on a new computer. I had Microsoft Office 2010 Home and Business, and a stand alone copy of Access 2010. I downloaded and installed Microsoft Office 2010, on the new computer using the original product key. I am having
 trouble downloading and installing Access. When I tried to download and install using the product key, I got a message telling me that the key was invalid. Can anyone out there help me?

<p>I appreciate that you took the time to reply, but I know that Access didn't come with Microsoft Home and Office, but I wanted to be able to install Access without purchasing any new software. Guess I have no other choice. Thank you all.</p>

            If you hover your mouse over the horizontal live just below the place where Outlook.com shows the number of messages you have in the Inbox (i.e., "xxx messages"), the cursor will become two horizontal lines with both up and down arrows extending from those
 lines.&nbsp; Click and you can move the separator line up or down to change the height of the message list and give your Reading Pane more room.

            <p>Hello Jamie, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
A quick question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
What do you mean by '<em>sort the Outlook message list with the "Draft" reminder</em>'?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By default, Outlook automatically saves the messsage in <strong>Drafts</strong> folder&nbsp;when you exceed 3 minutes&nbsp;working on it. You can access the saved email from
<strong>Drafts</strong> folder and also sort it with the available options as shown in the below screen shot.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/16b651ba-6a59-47ef-a3a8-13073a1bb7d1" /><br />
<br />
If the above is not what you're referring to, reply with more description about your query to assist you further.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</p>

    <title>Range.FormulaArray limited to 255 chars&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeu2004  say:</h3>
<h2>            Range.FormulaArray limited to 255 chars&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to assign a 265-char array formula to Range("A1").FormulaArray.&nbsp; But I can enter the array formula in Excel.&nbsp; And I have no problem assigning the array formula truncated to 252 char (meaningful Excel syntax, but not meaningful for the application).</p>
<p>After some experimentation, I found that the limit is 252 char.&nbsp; Anything longer results in an error.&nbsp; But Range("A1").Formula is not so limited.</p>
<p>EDIT....&nbsp; Oh, the limit is 255 char when I count the equal sign and two quotes in my experimental formula below.&nbsp; But I coulda sworn I am limited to 252 char -- 253 including equal sign -- when I experiment with the __real__ formula (numerical).&nbsp; Oh well,
 somewhere in that range.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to avoid the limit, short of breaking up the formula into multiple cells?</p>
<p>That is not a viable option for my purposes.&nbsp; I need to put the entire array formula into one cell.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the problem (not representative of the real formula), I am doing the following:</p>
<p>Sub doit()<br />
Range("a1").FormulaArray = "=""" &amp; String(252, "a") &amp; """"<br />
MsgBox Len(Range("a1").Text)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>The above works.&nbsp; It fails if I change 252 to 253.&nbsp; Yet 253 works if I change FormulaArray to Formula.</p>
<p>I am using XL2003 with VBA 6.5 (v 1024) and WinXP.&nbsp; Does the above macro work with 265 and larger on XL2007 or XL2010?</p>
<p>Extra credit....</p>
<p>The FormulaArray Property help page says nothing about any such limitation.&nbsp; But it does say that array formulas must use the R1C1 reference style.</p>
<p>However, I have no problem with the __real__ array formula truncated to 252 char (meaningful Excel syntax, but not meaningful for the application), even though it contains the A1 reference style with various forms of absolute references.</p>
<p>Just dumb luck; I shouldn't count on it?&nbsp; Or is the VBA help page simply wrong?</p>
<p>(Certainly not the first time ;-&gt;.)</p>

<p>for xl2007 says the 255 limit is still in effect.&nbsp; Has been as long as I have been around.&nbsp; These limits are usually measured in R1C1 style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a comment by someone in the link saying that A1 referencing is acceptable.&nbsp; That has been my experience in the past as well.</p>
<p>formulas, even way back could be 1024 characters, so I am not sure why the VBA FormulaArray has this limit - but it does.&nbsp; 255 has been a limit for a lot of things in VBA in the past.&nbsp; Might be a memory allocation thing.</p>

<p>New phone coming (Samsung Omnia i900)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I'm familiar with the Palm Desktop where you can insert contacts/addresses, then sync the data to your Palm Pilot (Zire 72, etc.)&nbsp; If you're sitting at your computer you can simply open the desktop and check a name.&nbsp; If you're gone, but
 armed with your Palm, you can open up the date file and check for names, addresses, numbers, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there is Microsoft Activsync, but I don't see a desktop set up like the Palm Desktop.&nbsp; Am I missing something?&nbsp; Is there a desktop applicable to Microsoft Mobile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Links to photos of what it will look like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I'm using WinXP.&nbsp; Can I use the most recent version of the Microsoft Moble?</p>
