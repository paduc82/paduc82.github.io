            Check your antivirus software
<br />
<br />In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software companyâ€™s website.
<br />Check for an outdated webcam driver
<br />
<br />    Select the Start button, type Device Manager, and then select Device Manager from the search results.
<br />    Find your webcam under Imaging devices or Sound, video and game controllers.
<br />    Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select the Driver Details button, and look for a file name that includes stream.sys. If itâ€™s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.
<br />    If you don't find a file name that includes stream.sys, try rolling back your webcam driver.
<br />
<br />Roll back your webcam driver
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Roll Back Driver, and then choose Yes. (Note that some drivers donâ€™t provide a rollback option.)
<br />    After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If rolling back didnâ€™t work or isnâ€™t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />    In Device Manager, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select Properties.
<br />    Select the Driver tab, select Uninstall &gt; Delete the driver software for this device, and then select OK.
<br />    In Device Manager, on the Action menu, select Scan for hardware changes. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
<br />    If your webcam still doesnâ€™t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturerâ€™s website.

    <title>Profile corruption on resume from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gondolier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile corruption on resume from sleep</h2>
                    My user profiles are all getting corrupted (or the registry pointing to them or something) upon a resume from sleep.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a home-build computer with an MSI Z77 chipset motherboard with an Intel i5-3570K processor. &nbsp;I have 8GB of RAM, a Crucial M4 64GB SSD as my windows drive (C:) and a 500GB hard disk (D:). &nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Home Premium.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to keep my User data on the D drive. &nbsp;I followed these instructions (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5467758/move-the-users-directory-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/5467758/move-the-users-directory-in-windows-7</a>) to move the whole Users folder
 to the D drive and create a junction point from c:\Users to d:\Users.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes, when I resume from sleep, I start getting I/O errors. &nbsp;And after I start getting these errors, my profiles are completely borked. &nbsp;When I try to login to my account, I get the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>
<div>The User Profile Service service failed the logon.</div>
<div>User profile cannot be loaded.</div>
</div>
<div>&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Generally this affects ALL profiles. &nbsp;So, I cannot login to my own profile (John - which is an administrator) and I also cannot login to my secondary admin profile (admin). &nbsp;When this first started, I was getting logged into a temporary profile on each
 new restart. &nbsp;I tried some things to recover the use of my profile (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7</a>), but none of that helped. &nbsp;The only thing that helps is
 to re-install Windows. &nbsp;I have re-installed Windows several times to try to isolate the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To reproduce this, I install a fresh Windows install, with the following:</div>
<div>-All my hardware drivers</div>
<div>-All the recommended Microsoft updates</div>
<div>-Microsoft Security Essentials</div>
<div>-Copy Users from C to D and then put a junction point from c:\Users to d:\Users</div>
<div>-Chrome &nbsp; (this seems to push it to the breaking point)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I have Chrome running, then I put the computer to sleep and resume, then usually (but not always) I will get some kind of I/O error, and chrome may or may not crash. &nbsp;Here are examples of one set of errors:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>
<div>TITLE: Msg: chrome.exe - Application Error</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The instruction at 0x000000006E1A52BA referennced memory at 0x000000006E1A52BA. &nbsp;The required data was not placed into memory because of an I/O error status of 0xc000009d.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Click on OK to terminate the program</div>
</div>
<div>&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>
<div>TITLE: chrome.exe</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>chrome.exe has stopped working</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.</div>
</div>
<div>&lt;&lt;&lt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In addition, at this point the D: drive is no longer accessible. &nbsp;When I restart the computer or log out, then I can no longer log in to either profile.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem started in June 2012 around when the Microsoft updates were pushed out. &nbsp;Prior to that time, I had no problems with the same setup - running Chrome, Users moved to D with a junction point, putting it to sleep. &nbsp;No problems on resume.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Some more information after additional experiments:
<div><br />
<div>I re-installed windows again, but did not install any Windows updates or MS security essentials. &nbsp;I only installed the drivers that came on my motherboard CD. &nbsp;I then moved the Users directory to D as above and installed Chrome.</div>
<div><br />
<div>While Chrome is running, I put the computer to sleep and then wake it up. &nbsp;When it wakes up, the D drive is no longer visible or accessible in explorer. &nbsp;But, my profile is NOT getting screwed up like before. &nbsp;So, some part of this is clearly dependent
 on one of the Windows updates (or MS security essentials, but that seems unlikely).</div>

            <p>Don't know if you got any improvement since 2012...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp; the same issue with the same kind of config: C: drive is a Kingston SSD and users are on D: with a junction point over directories betweeen them. Everything runs flawless except the resume from sleep, which is just broken all the time with the same
 symptoms you describe: </p>
<ul>
<li>Incoherent behavior of the desktop e.g. the file explorer pretends&nbsp; that "C:" (meaning "D:') drive is missing... nothing works<br />
</li><li>if I logoff, I cannot logon,&nbsp; the profile is either diseapeared of declared 'unavailable"</li><li>I have to reboot </li></ul>
<p>Looking&nbsp; at the event observer (system&nbsp; logs),&nbsp; there is a problem coming from the 1st HDD ("D:\" ?)&nbsp; About 20secs after the recorded wakeup event, it has a burst of error level messages (same time tag):</p>
<p>"Peripheral \Device\Harddisk\DR1 not ready for access" </p>
<p>then also a burst of warning level messages (same time tag than before):</p>
<p>"An error was detected on peripheral&nbsp; \Device\Harddisk\DR1 during a paging operation"</p>
<p>and then nothing relevant, the rest of the systems say "resume from sleep", at information level)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that either the HDD does not wake up properly, or does it&nbsp; wake up irecoverably slow... ?
</p>
<p>Any hint ? </p>

            I gave up on using a junction point for the Users folder. &nbsp;I suspect the problem is due to the HDD waking up too slowly, but I really have no idea.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be due to some bad sectors on the hard drive. I would suggest you to run chkdsk and see if that helps.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730714.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730714.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know the update after you try the above steps.<br />
<br />

<p>Looks like a faulty gpu to me. Just one thing to check before calling technical support. Try doing a graphic settings reset. When your One is off, hold the powerbutton and the eject button simultaneously until the boot beep. Don't be surprised, the grafics
 will look terrible then, as they are resetted to 480p. Reconfigure your grafic settings and then check the result. If the output is still with all the pixel errors call the technical support to have your One replaced and point them to the video for evidence.

<h2>            Windows without gui.</h2>
                    Hi. is there any way i can turn off windows XP graphic (i mean software interupts) so it will use only interupts that are for text mode but could run applications that are in graphic mode as well.<br />
<br />
I need that for portable game server. I managed to get all external interupts that go to graphic card, but microcontroler i use is having problems with overflow every time graphics kicks in.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I know it's probably impossible.<br />

I need that for portable game server. I managed to get all external interupts that go to graphic card, but microcontroler i use is having problems with overflow every time graphics kicks in.<br />

FWIW, I think your question is better suited for MSDN</p>

<h2>            Unable To Use 3-Finger Gesture To Go Back And Forth In Browser After An Update.</h2>
                    <p>Apparently the new update has f***ed some things up, and now my three finger swipe to navigate forward and backwards in browser (alt + left/right) - that I have been using for literally years - instead swaps windows (alt + Tab).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to get a straight answer anywhere on how to get my gesture back!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the "solutions" I find say I need Precision Touchpad, which I thought I had. But I go to the settings and it shows as bog standard w/o the extra options to change any gesture settings!!! I was literally able to swipe back and forth just fine a mere DAYS
 AGO!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?!?!</p>

However, the way this feature works is also driver dependent, as it provides
 a way to modify the gestures. Since you were able to navigate the pages in the browser using three finger swipe previously, it might be that the issue is with the touchpad drivers that is currently installed on your system. So I suggest you to let us know
 the make and model number of your computer, so that we can look into this for you and guide you accordingly.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows can&#39;t save network passwords</h2>
                    
<p>My Windows XP (Professional, SP3, 32bit) can't save passwords for network shares.</p>
<p>When I installed Windows first time (abt 2 years ago) it correctly remembered all passwords for network shares. But half-year ago Windows resetting network passwords each time I reboots my PC. Actually Windows saves passwords only till reboot. I can manage
 them via <strong>Control panel\<strong>User Accounts\</strong> </strong><strong>Manage your network passwords</strong> without any problems or errors, but after reboot all entries in<strong>Manage your network passwords
</strong>are loses.<strong><br />

<p>Strangely enough, this sounds like at some point in the past your user profile was corrupted (it is not that uncommon).&nbsp; Sometimes when this happens, Windows will create a temporary profile that is reset each time you log on.&nbsp; Thus anything saved under your
 previous profile such as these passwords would be lost.&nbsp; To test for this situation, create a new user on your computer and log in as that new user and see if this behavior then goes away.&nbsp; If it does, then follow the steps in the following article:</p>
<p>"How to recover the damaged user profile in Windows XP"<br />

<p>It would have really helped if you tried my test and created a new user and reported whether this was a problem with this new user as well.&nbsp; So let me just explain what's going on here...&nbsp; When Windows remembers a password, it is encrypted to a user certificate
 and stored in the user's personal registry file (HKEY_CURRENT_USER).&nbsp; I can think of two possible causes to this problem...&nbsp; a section of the user registry had something happen to it and Windows can no longer store usernames/passwords there perhaps because
 your encrypting certificate became unusable, or something is wrong with the part of Windows that stores data there.&nbsp; Creating a new user and checking if this is still a problem with that new user would differentiate between a single user problem and a systemic
 problem.&nbsp; If it turns out that the new user does not have this problem, then it is likely that something is wrong with just the one user registry and the steps in KB55473 cited earlier would be an avenue to give the problem user a fresh new registry that may
 start working again (just pretend that your current registry is damaged).&nbsp; If the new user has this problem too, then something in the System is suspect.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

 DirectX diagnostic tool it says these settings are not available. I have tried downloading all the drivers I can find but this is my first time using a PC for this sort of thing as I have been running Mac for the last 4 years give or take and never did gaming
 when I was on a PC before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone is wondering I am trying to run Medal of Honor as the first game but I do believe that the acceleration is my main problem. I have looked in the settings and the acceleration is all the way up but for some reason they aren't activating I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be great as I do want to play more PC games in the future.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could the problem be that my Mac side of my comp isn't letting the pc side use the graphics card?</p>

            I would update your graphics card from the manufacturer to see if there is a later driver.
<br />
<br />
Otherwise,&nbsp;if you set all&nbsp;graphic settings on high you might experience this errro. Try changing the graphic settings to medium.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Startup Failure</h2>
                    I updated my system from 8.1 pro to 10 and everything was fine for a few weeks then the OS failed to startup. I ran the Startup Repair utility but it didn't do anything. I tried reverting back to a previous version but now the computer is stuck in an endless
 "Restoring Your Previous Version of Windows" loop and keeps rebooting. I tried booting from burned&nbsp;Win 10 and 8.1 discs but it doesn't work (I changed the boot order).&nbsp;It will however boot up from a factory Win&nbsp;7 disc.&nbsp;Is there another repair disc I can try
 or can I reinstall Win 10? I haven't&nbsp;create a system image since the upgrade.&nbsp;

<p>1. I upgraded through the automatic upgrade prompt I received from MS.</p>
<p>2. Yes, it should have been activated as I was using an activated copy of 8.1 when I upgraded.</p>
<p>3. No, I had not made any changes prior to this&nbsp;failure. Win 10 was running fine for a few weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have forced the computer off a few times, it didn't help. It just reverts back to the "Restoring The Previous Version" loop upon startup.&nbsp;I am unable to boot&nbsp;using a disc and&nbsp;I am also unable to boot into safe mode due to this.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ever since i upgraded to windows 10 pro, ive been unable to print because whenever i press ctrl-p, in any program like
 word, excel, pdf viewer, anything the print dialog doesnt show up, instead the cursor changes to the busy sign and it just freezes there. i have to manually close the app via task manager. However, ive noticed on one occasion that if i wait really really long
 ( &gt; 15 min) the print dialog eventually pops up. ctrl p works in chrome, but when it loads the default print dialog the same problem repeats.</span><br />

            SFC does not work... &nbsp;Sometimes even a restart of the computer doesn't work but try going to processes and restarting (or stopping then starting again) the print spooler service... &nbsp;"Spooler". &nbsp;Get to it through Task Manager then the Services Tab.

<h2>            No connections are available on Windows Pro Surface Book</h2>
                    My Surface Book shows no connections available. Our other laptops and Surfaces are able to connect to our home network, so our router is working. I tried rebooting; no change. What next?

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you, can you confirm the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did this issue start?</li><li>Did you recently install new hardware or software?</li><li>When and where did you purchase your Surface Book?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also check the WiFi settings and send us a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can do a two-button shutdown. To do this, you can follow these steps:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 1:</strong></td>
<td>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 2:</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.
<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 3:</strong></td>
<td>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Step 4:</strong></td>
<td>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span><font color="#000000">When you perform the upgrade from Windows 8.1 preview, youâ€™ll only be able to keep your personal files, but you'll need
 to reinstall your apps. Make sure you have any original installation media that might be required for apps that were not installed from the

<p><span><font color="#000000">In some cases, an app might be removed from the Windows Store for violating the Terms of Use. When this happens, you'll
 receive an email notifying you that the app will no longer be available in the Store. The app will still appear on your PC if you installed it, but to help protect your safety, it will no longer work.</font></span></p>

            I also have the same problem. Right-clicking on the apps shows no uninstall option, and trying to open them gives an error which takes me to a blank Store page.<br />

<br />
OK -- I FIXED IT.</span>
<div><br />
<div>Through a lot of trial and error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Head to users/user/appdata/local/microsoft/windows/applicationshortcuts</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once there do a search for each file within application shortcuts using the search bar in the top right of the explorer, you might need to play with the search terms. For example, mine found the photo app when I searched 'modern' but not 'photo'. Odd.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used the following terms, camera, microsoft ((for skydrive)), bing, modern.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You need to delete the little white shortcut tile (I had to adjust security settings first and give myself permission to delete within the app shortcuts file, but Windows will guide you through it.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the chat app, just delete and reinstall the calendar/people/mail group and its gone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope it works for you guys too...<br />
<br />
Apparently it's common among people who also use avast! as their antivirus program. Worked for me!</div>

<h2>            Transfer games in family account</h2>
                    
<p>I have had my own xbox live account for a while and bought a bunch of arcade games. &nbsp;Now that my son is old enough he has his own xbox and his live account is a member of our family plan account. &nbsp;I would like him to be able to play some of the games I purchased
 with my account on his xbox. &nbsp;What is the easiest way for him to do this (and I want him logged in with his account, not mine).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Nothing can be transferred between accounts. When you purchase content it is tied to the gamertag that purchased it as well as the console it was purchased on. So he could access the content while he is using your console, but not on his. You could sign
 into his console and do a license transfer which would move the console license to his and allow him to use the content. Your console would have to remain signed into Live on your console in order to access the games after that though.</p>

<p>I thought this solved my problem but I'm confused. &nbsp;I put my gamertag and the games on a usb drive. &nbsp;Moved the games to his console. &nbsp;Then I transfered the license. &nbsp;Now if he signs in he can only the play the game as a trial. &nbsp;If I sign in he can play the
 entire game. &nbsp;Is that my only option? &nbsp;I need to be signed in? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Can you try to re-download the game on the console? It's likely you'd need to actually get the license from the Xbox LIVE servers.</p>

                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Windows 7 has been the perfect OS for me. I bought a full installation disc and installed the system on my newly built computer several years ago.</p>
<p>I upgraded my laptop to Win 10, hated the system and converted back to win 7. The laptop is now little better than useless.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Bearing in mind that I do not want to fall foul of any Microsoft licence rules, my questions are :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When my present main computer dies, can I legally reload Win 7 onto a brand new computer, from my fully licensed Win 7 disc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)If I repair my present computer (say a damaged motherboard or graphics card), can I legally reload Win 7 onto the repaired machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I buy a new and unused Win 7 today, store it for 5-10 years, can I then install it on a new computer and not fall foul of the licencing laws several years hence?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As a pensioner, I use my computer for surfing the Internet, emailing friends and photo and video editing. The hardware in my computer works extremely well on the last two tasks above and Win 7 copes brilliantly with all of them. &nbsp;I do not need, or want to

            No good solution. Installed software needs to be in the same partition as Windows. Consider yourself lucky that you got away with a separate partition in Windows 7.

                    <p>1. My temperature is 50-60 when it's IDLING! (Checked with CPU Thermometer and BIOS)</p>
<p>2. 2 Of my fans are not working.... only 1 out of 3, is there an option in BIOS where you can disable one of your fans? if so maybe I accidently disabled it, or is there an option to enable them or speed them up? If no then tell me that so I'll give it to
 Repair.<br />

            <p>Hello Denis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue. Much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would recommend you to refer to the MSI support for the best answer, as settings in the BIOS are different from different manufacturers and they may also assist you with alternate ways to control the fans, thus making the system perform better.
 You may refer to the following link to contact MSI support.</p>

    <title>Direct Connecting Two XBox Ones using a Crossover Cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldgerhart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct Connecting Two XBox Ones using a Crossover Cable</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is all sorts of information for how to connect two Xbox Ones together without an internet connection available on line, yet none of them seem to work. My friend and I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using a home wireless network</li><li>Direct connecting with standard ethernet cables through a hub and router</li><li>Using a crossover cable that was built and tested by a local reputable electronics shop</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that we both have to have the same games, which supports multiplayer without the Xbox Live option and with the same updates installed. We have purchased Diablo 3, Gears of War 4, and Assassin's Creed Unity with the hope of being able to co-op
 play without the need for an internet connection. So far nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend says that he saw somewhere online that Microsoft removed the ability to direct connect with System Link or a crossover ethernet cable and that Blizzard was annoyed at having to re-work several games, but I haven't found this mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas? Being able to co-op play with my next door neighbor / Army buddy is the whole reason I bought an Xbox One X.</p>
