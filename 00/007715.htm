<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you cannot seem to send or emails on your account. Let me help you with your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I may ask,&nbsp;when you say Outlook, are you&nbsp;referring to Outlook.com or Microsoft Office Outlook? I have created a&nbsp;private message tab for you so that you&nbsp;can provide us the complete message header of the bounce message that you have received and&nbsp;we will
 interpret it for you. This can help us determine the root cause of the issue that you have encountered.

            I'm also having the same problem! almost exactly. &nbsp;I'm using a Mac and my normal browser is safari. I've also tried to sign into my outlook account (outlook.com) via Chrome and It has the same result. I've also tried computers that aren't Mac's. Just to
 be clear, regardless of the computer or browser I can't send or receive emails but all past emails/info, regardless of the folder or location are completely accessible. This is only a new in coming/out going &nbsp;email issue that has been noticed since Oct. 18,
 2013.

<h2>            Time and the Rani....or to be more accurate internet updateing the clock 14955</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been battling with home group&nbsp; (not being found, phantom homegroups etc)) and devices not showing up in network on a few builds now, 14955 being the latest, the homegroup troubleshooter not being able to identify any problems, until tonight "your clock is
 out of sync " a new one to me, any way manually went in to "time settings" and tried setting via the internet, both wifi devices timed out and my cable connected PC was "access denied"
</p>
<p>I tried both windows.com and nist.gov, the two options presented, with the same result on all three devices, the wifi's timing out and the PC denied. I'm pretty sure this is the root cause of the homegroup problem. any suggestions? Forgot to say the router
 is a BT Homehub 6</p>

            <p>I was also getting errors with Internet time on build 14951, but not "Access is denied".
<strong>Update now</strong>&nbsp;button would fail but then closing that dialog box would show that time was successfully updated. Try ignoring this method and use the Settings App to change the time manually. I also noticed that the Settings App would have difficulty
 getting the time if I set it to auto-adjust, so I would just set it to Auto and switch screens to something else, rather than waiting for it to get the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network shares seem to work better for me with 14955, but I have never tried using a homegroup before, so I don't really know what they do differently, compared to just setting up a shared folder.</p>

<h2>            Mail going to Spam folder ignores Safe Sender list</h2>
                    Recently many of my subscribed newsletters have been going into the spam folder. I've tried adding the sender or the domain to the safe senders list but this seems to be ignored as they keep going to the spam folder. I've added them to the safe sender
 list by right clicking it in the list of emails, then "Junk Mail" then adding the sender or the domain to the safe senders list, but does this only apply to the Junk folder, because they still go into the Spam folder. Is there a way to link the Junk rules
 to the Spam rules?

            Ok, here's what &nbsp;think has happened. My isp provided a spam filter that added the prefix "(isp).spam" to anything it considered spam. The mail still went into the inbox but could be identified as spam by the prefix. It seems that I then created a folder
 called "(isp).spam" and a rule for Outlook to put that mail straight to the spam folder. For a long time, so long I'd forgotten that I'd set up the rule etc, nothing much went in, but my isp must have recently changed the filtering process and it seemed to
 think anything that had come from a mailing service or was going to multiple recipients was spam. I've turned off the filter, deleted the folder, and removed the rule. All back to normal.

            <p>I too refreshed the PC and it still does the same. I'm looking at the screen right now. It shows "Installing Windows 10 Technical Preview" at the top. 23% in the blue and gray circle, 79% in setting up. You would think that someone at Microsoft would look
 at this post and be able to figure out what the installer program is doing at that time. The program is hung-up, but what is causing it I don't have a clue. The disk led doesn't blink and I can hit every key on the keyboard except power off and it won't do
 a thing. I would also think that Microsoft would want to figure this out due to the number of people that it is affecting.</p>

            I removed my antivirus totally and the upgrade worked &nbsp;for me. Some AV have certain types of protections that won't allow certain system changes, which may affect your update even if the move from 9926 to 10041 went smooth. Just remember to keep your product
 key on hand.&nbsp;

            I notice that you've left in the Range argument from the TransferSpreadsheet method.&nbsp; With the TransferText method the position occupied by this argument in the argument list is that of the HTMLTablename argument, which is of course inappropriate to this
 export type.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Help the argument should then simply be ignored, but this is not in fact true, hence the error.&nbsp; This should work:<br />

<h2>            Moving a HUP License to my Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus license key that I purchased through my companies HUP program. &nbsp;As I am no longer working for the company, is there a way I can "attach" that key to my current Microsoft account? &nbsp;When I recently tried to
 reinstalled, it opted for Office 2013 Professional and told me the key was invalid. &nbsp;It automatically re-downloaded the correct version (Plus) and I was able to activate by key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also no longer have access to my work email that was attached to the HUP license, but I saved the email with the key and it will still allow me to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to have the product attached to my Microsoft account, but not sure if this is a possibility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nathan</p>

<p>It is not possible to associate Office HUP 2013 with a Microsoft Account. Only Retails (Home and Student, Home &amp; Business and Office Pro - &amp; office 365 ) could be associated or link to MSA. The Product key is an Activation key and not a Redemption Key.</p>

<p>Russ, thanks for responding so quickly.&nbsp; Separately, this morning I spoke to a friend to is more IT savvy than me.&nbsp; He suggested that I&nbsp;find outlook.exe using explorer search, then to right click on the file, select properties, select compatability and uncheck
 the box.&nbsp; This surprised me as I had not made outlook compatable with anything, but found that when I looked it was compatable with Vista SP2.&nbsp; Unchecking&nbsp;solved the problem.&nbsp;I have no idea why Outlook had become compatable with Vista in the first place.</p>
<p>Regarding exporting of PST files, this is very useful as it enables me to swap folders between my work computer and my home computer without me importing personal stuff onto the work machine</p>

            <p>The maths in your case is that you have on the left:</p>
<p>
</p><p>40 0.25% units</p>
<p>20 0.5% units</p>
<p>10 1% units</p>
<p>5 2% units</p>
<p>and so on</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you need to make the same count of units on the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-7 to 1% on the right has</p>
<p>
</p><p>16 0.5% units</p>
<p>8 1% units</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always make these even number counts work, the question is the steps may seem a bit strange. In this case, you can make 10 steps on the right by having 0.8% steps, going from -7%, -6.2%, -5.4%, -4.6% ... and so on, works but not user-friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this is why I suggested leaving your left alone and extending your right to 10 units from -8% to 2%</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then set 2% major steps for both sides, and 1% minor steps. Grid lines are always controlled by the left or what Excel calls Primary y-axis.</p>

    <title>Subreport name in main report total - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accesskay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subreport name in main report total</h2>
                    <p>I set-up two subreports and added them to one main report and created a totals text box to add the two subreport totals.&nbsp; I was experimenting and afterwards decided to delete the main report and create a new one.&nbsp; I also made some changes to my subreports
 and renamed them.&nbsp; I repeated the process of creating my main report.&nbsp; My Totals text box on the main report&nbsp;that I had created before that adds the two subreports had an error and I knew that was because I needed to change the subreport name in the formula.&nbsp;
 The odd thing that had me stumped is that the Totals text box only worked when I left the original subreport name for the first subreport in the calculation&nbsp;but then required the new name of my second subreport.</p>
<p>I hope someone can tell me why my totals text box in my main report wants to use my old subreport name.&nbsp; I've looked in all the properties and there is no evidence of my old subreport name.&nbsp; Any ideas as to why?</p>
<p>I know this sounds unlikely but any ideas might help me to find out why.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It isn't clear if you understand the difference between a subreport's Name and a subreport's Source Object. These are quite often the same but may be different.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When referencing a control on a subreport from the main report, you use the subreport's Name (the name of the subreport control on the main report).
</p>
<p>=MySubReportControlName.Report!txtControlName</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are still confused it might be the "Name Autocorrect" monster attempting to "help" you.</p>

<h2>            Copy and Paste pastes the previous copy instead of current.</h2>
                    <p>It does not matter if I used Edit Copy or the Control C I have to do Copy and Paste three or four times to get the current copy to paste.&nbsp; It will even paste something that I copied a week ago instead of the current copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why do this copies stay on my computer in a place where I did not paste them?&nbsp; In researching a .jpg file I found numerous copies that I had done but there were not where I copied them.&nbsp; They were mostly copies of recipes that I had done.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Messaging Service Update &#8211; Passwords</h2>
                    
<p>Over the past couple of days there have been some reports on this forum and others about Nokia Messaging passwords not working. We looked into this, and found that the service had indeed been impacted by the server migration (we are migrating to a higher

<p>I and many others started experiencing this two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Many people reported this on these forums starting well back in August.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is proof that no-one with any authority at Nokia cares about these forums or the problems users report. Nokia did nothing, *nothing*, until 10th September which they noticed they were getting bad publicity for this problem on the mynokiablog . com blog,
 and only then they acted, and only via a Twitter message on the @nokiamessaging channel, and at the same time as the equivalent channel for the very important market of India, @NokiaMsgIndia, was ignoring reports in the Indian market and still handing out
 advice that is total rubbish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a complete failure of customer service, and leads people into a state of extremely dissatisfaction with Nokia software, which is poor, and services, which are poorly-designed and are run without much attention to quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To me this bug was evern worse than expressed above. I had set up the Nokia e-mail client in the second mode available, the mode (I don't know what Nokia call it) in which I have refused to give the Nokia email server the passwords to my accounts (I do not
 trust Nokia with my passwords) but I have the e-mail client on the handset access my accoutns directly via mobile internet so that only my handset, and NOT Nokia, had the passwords. Under these conditions I had no Nokia messaging account and I STILL was stopped
 by this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I am suspicious that the Nokia e-mail client on the handset is making unauthorised accesses to Nokia messaging when it promises not to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems are very serious, and the fact that it tkaes Nokia weeks to recognise them and then to NOT respond in the support forum directly in the topic where users are crying for help but to post on a Twitter channel that they are doing something represents
 an inconsistent approach that needs fixing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a series of Nokia "smart" phones purchased for my business and we are suffering rubbish servie like this since the beginning, and constantly figthing with bad software that feels like it was written by public servants without a clue. Nokia need to
 get in soem management who have a commitment to fixing the company and changing the culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe put the software lab in Silicon Valley and hire some smart people who can compete.</p>
<p>And constant management changes and the thing is still broken ?</p>
<p>And bringing in a CEO from Microsoft of all places ? Are Microsoft a shining example of success in mobile phones, even in their home market of the USA ? Don't think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(At least Microsoft have done better than Nokia in the USA, where Nokia are virtually non-existent in the handset market. We Nokai users suffer because most of the smart technology is coming out of the USA and the US software developers - Evernote , for
 example - don't find it worthwhile to developa Nokia client for their app. THe Nokia market is just not relevant to them.)</p>
<p>This is sad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I've just tried to spell-check this message and Nokia's spell checker does not know the word "blog". Get modern, Nokia. Everything about so is soooo behind.)</p>

<p>In my E72 nokia messaging is still down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacted with Polish helpline twice, with no success. Today - letter to nokia sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in my case it is decided - BB9700 will be successor of this p....e of s...t - extremly slowly (having the latest software updated via NSU) with no e-mail connection pastiche of business phone...<br />
<br />
I bought this mobile (E72), because I remembered N630i. But Nokia will never ever be the same like then... And now, after almost one year of every-day using this "business" phone I regret this choice...<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>some notice of migrations and warning of possible outages would have been ideal.</p>

            I also had the problem with nokia messaging asking for a password on my Nokia N97. I did not know until today that you were changing servers, so I thought it was an account problem. What I did was cancel my subscription to nokia messaging (through email.nokia.com)
 so that I could sign up to the service again. But for the past week or so I have not been able to do this successfully by going to email.nokia.com. I would really like to use the the application again as I found it really useful to use. If you could help me
 with this problem I would be very grateful.

<p>Not working, Nokia.</p>
<p>The problem started a week ago indeed.</p>
<p>I have re-installed the application in my E71 twice, once from Nokia Store and once from email.nokia,com.&nbsp; The first trial worked for 2days and started to prompt for password again.</p>
<p>It keeps asking for the password and I do not have a clue of which password is it. It is not the&nbsp;current password for the Nokia Messaging website, as I could successful login to it. I've also tried all remembered password for all e-mail accounts I used in
 that application.</p>
<p>I used this everyday to check my personal e-mails; now it is useless.</p>
<p>And the worst is that I don't know where to go for additional help.</p>
<p>Nokia used to&nbsp;have the best&nbsp;phones, but when it came to the smartphone space... It is quickly getting outperformed by companies which care for users of their software.</p>

<p>How about a service status page?&nbsp; Or would that be a bit too revealing...&nbsp; Messaging has been a bit hit-and-miss since I got my new phone a week or so ago.&nbsp; When it works it's great, but there seem to be times when it just won't connect for a few hours -
 when there's nothing unusual about my location or the state of the phone.&nbsp; Odd - and I don't know if it's because of something specific to my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, your users would be happier with your service if they _knew_ when it wasn't working properly.&nbsp; At least then we wouldn't worry, and we'd also know you were doing something about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might seem a bit alien to you to reveal problems so publicly, but your users would thank you for it.&nbsp; Google aren't afraid to say when Google Apps aren't working properly, and that makes me far more likely to use their service.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender won&#39;t turn on, even from Services. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rafinley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t turn on, even from Services.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro version 1709 as of May 9, 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a week or two, I have received frequent notifications that "Windows Defender is Turned Off. Click here to turn back on."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon opening the Windows Defender Security Center, it says "Virus and Threat Protection Unknown". Looking at Windows settings, the Definition, update date, etc. are all blank except for the Client Version, showing 4.12.16299.15</p>
<p>
</p><p>That client version number, as far as I have been told, is VERY outdated. I have run Windows update, and any definition update for Windows Defender has failed to install since the issue began more than 2 weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried enabling on Services, and the error pops up saying: "Error code 2: The system cannot find the file specified." Given that this is a service, my understanding is that the DLL is missing for the version it's trying to find. Upon looking at the
 platform folders located on my main drive at C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform", neither of the two folders match the client version. The two folder names are below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.14.17613.18038-0</p>
<p>4.14.17613.18039-0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the client versions are usually the folder names, the fact that these folder names numerically exceed the client version shown in settings other than dash zero at the end (4.12.16299.15 being the detected version by Windows Settings), my guess
 is a registry issue or some sort of referencing error with the numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to restore the client or platform files for Windows Defender, with either Microsoft-certified tool or advanced troubleshoot method? Any help, no matter how small, is appreciated as long as you have read the steps I have taken above and
 suggest something new. I could be doing something stupidly small incorrectly making all the difference.</p>

<p>Hi rafinley,<br />
<br />
An outdated system files and software conflict may cause the Windows Defender not to start properly. To fix the issue, I suggest that you follow carefully the troubleshooting steps in this

            I've had Windows 10 for a while now.&nbsp; I have NO home internet service, hence I take laptop to the library and go online when needed.&nbsp; I just scanned the computer with Windows Defender on May 9, 2018 yet on May 11, 2018 I'm being told it can't scan and
 I need to turn on Windows Defender.&nbsp; When I attempted to do that I get another message telling me it can't turn on Windows Defender.&nbsp; Is this another of your plans to get more money from users Microsoft?&nbsp; I suspect it is.

</p>
<p>This also leaves my PDA in sync mode (The two arrows on the top are spining around for ever).</p>
<p>It managed to sync only once, and after that the same error over an over again.</p>
<p>I have searched in the forums, goolge, tryied any suggestion but nothing.
</p>
<p>I have restated the pc, removed and installed the software several times, closed the firewall, execute C:\windows\WindowsMobile\setup.exe, downloaded WMDC today again and installed it, no joy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Vista Business with Outlook 2007 SP1, with an HP iPAQ hw6515d with Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition.</p>
<p>I am using WMDC 6.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help please?</p>

<p>The same problem still exists. </p>
<p>This software&nbsp;messed up all my contacts in Outlook, it still fails to sync with the device, leaves the device syncing for ever, and&nbsp;explorer.exe gets strange delays from time to time.</p>
<p>So I have uninstalled WMDC and everything is back to normal. </p>
<p>Of course&nbsp;ActiveSync does not install in Vista, so this all situation is yet another
</p>
<p>regret about moving on to Vista.</p>

<p>And just to add to what Linley is suggesting, before you do all that and while your device is connected, go into Device Manager and remove your device from it .... you should easily be able to see the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After removing, follow Linley's suggestions and hopefully you will be up and running....</p>

            I had a similar situation in which my device was not recognized; for almost a month I looked for help everywhere but no one seem to know the answer. To be short I finally got an answer when I hard reset the unit installed the unit, recognized and I downloaded
 a needed program for my work. Afterward when I reconnected it, I had the former problem; thus&nbsp; I thougth that the program in question had something to do with it, went to their support site and there was the answer. Try to see&nbsp; if any of your installed programs
 might be the culprit.<br />

<p>I'm not sure what to suggest but you make a good point with the possibility of a communication problem with Outlook 2007 which might make me think about running the Office Diagnostics tool (from the Outlook help menu) just to make sure it is
 OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might even consider uninstalling and reinstalling Outlook and possibly considering a Hard Reset just to make sure it is not the device.</p>

<h2>            Previous Versions Tab is not showing</h2>
                    I just overwrote a file and closed the document. When I go back to open the document, there is no sign of the previous version even though I created the document yesterday and know that more than 10 minutes has past to create the restore point. &nbsp;I have
 right clicked the document in the explorer and no restore previous tab. I've gone to the document in word file&gt;info&gt;Versions--no show up. I've right clicked the document in word open dialog box and not restore previous tab there either. Can someone share any
 tips for finding the original I've written over? AND, can you share with me how to look and see if I have the feature turned off? &nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 and Word 2010. Many thanks.

            <p>The ten minutes you mention refer to Word's autorecover feature; it is different from Previous Versions in Windows. The feature in Word only applies when Word has crashed or when you have forgotten to save an
<strong>untitled</strong> document.<br />
<br />
What you can try is the following: In Windows Explorer, right-click your C:\ drive and select Properties. On the Previous Versions tab, see if you find a backup of C:\. You can then open it and go to your documents folder and have a look.</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone10  error 0x80004005 when trying to upgrade built in Photos App</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this issue for several weeks. I was hoping that the next update would fix the issue. I got the update today, but the issue remains. I have seen issues like this with some other apps, but deleting the App and reinstalling fixed the issue. Unfortunately,
 deleting the Photos app is not possible, so that method does not work. Also, the Photos app will not start, so I am stuck not being able to view images on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking around, I see other workarounds for Desktop version that tell you to start in safe/clean mode, but I could not find out how to do that win Win Phone10. I also see workaround where you run PowerShell commands, but again not how to do that with Phone10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that the installs now tend to hand at the Splash screen. I waited for an houe (even though a workaround said only 30-40 minutes is needed) before doing the Power+VolumeDown reboot. That cause the install to complete and migrate successfully, but
 I still have the Photos App not being able to launch or update. I am also seeing the same hang at the splash screen if I reboot when plugged into the charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking both of the issues are related and a file or resource is either corrupt or incorrectly locked. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, RajKumar1949. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! Upon checking the Nokia Store, this application is not available for your device. You'll need to contact the developer to verify if they will release a version compatible for your phone, if you
 really want to use their application on your Nokia 5130:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whatsapp.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.whatsapp.com/contact/</a><br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can download similar apps from the Nokia Store: <br />

 to force quit it. When I do that the following error shows up:</p>

<p>Hi. Sorry for the delay in my response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions, however when I tried to boot the mac in safe mode it didn't work but when I checked, just in case the program worked, it did work and I was able to update the office package. Nonetheless, the next day without shutting down the
 computer, I tried to open auto update and did not open, the initial error happened again.
</p>
<p>It seems that the only time the program works is minutes after the computer is restarted.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>Thx</p>

<h2>            Changing inbox envelope icons</h2>
                    I have a VIP user who is displeased with the icons in the inbox which represent whether the message has been read or not. &nbsp;Is there anyway to change these icons or at the very least change their colors?&nbsp;
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Yeah, it's always good to do what you can for the owners. &lt;g&gt; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd think the sealed envelope and open envelope icons would be easy to identify by shape. Or is she using the Conversation view? The multiple envelope icons indicating 'no read messages in this thread' and 'some read messages in this thread' are very similar,
 even for non-color blind users.</p>
<p>Have you tried changing the auto-formatting colors? Use a lighter gray or another color for&nbsp;unread messages in the message list.

<h2>            Cant sign in to onedrive with personal account</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to login on onedrive with my personal Microsoft account that also has office 365 home on it.
</p>
<p>See image: https://imgur.com/a/6j4D6Co</p>
<p>I already reinstalled onedrive a couple of times but that dint solve anything.</p>
<p>When using the onedrive app from the Microsoft store, everything works. i can successfully sign into that. but with the manual download i cant.</p>
<p>I already tried editing the regex values and have now deleted them all, it it still says the same error message as seen in the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tnx</p>
<p>Ruben,</p>

            Hi:
<br />I based on you completed the steps before, Is it work computer?
<br />THere are somo policies that block it.

<br />
<br />Other Idea can be:
<br />Can you try to disable your antivirus, and your windows defender?
<br />
