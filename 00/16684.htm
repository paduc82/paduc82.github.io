<h2>            OneNote closes itself immediately after opening.</h2>
                    There's no error message or anything. It just flashes onscreen for a split second before going away. How can I fix this?

            <p>I am having exactly the same problem, which started appear roughly a month ago, after some cumulative upgrade for Windows 10 I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to temporarily solve it is to remove the app through powershell by
</p>
<p>"Get-AppxPackage *onenote* | Remove-Appxpackage", and install it again in Windows Store. But this only works the first time after reinstalling. If I start onenote, do some editing and close it, I will never be able to run it again. It will flashes and quit
 infinite times until I do another reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am heavily relying on this app (rather than the desktop version, which has much worse touchpad support), so I have to do the reinstallation five times or even more everyday recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried other approaches,</p>
<p><strong>Wsreset </strong>- not working at all.</p>
<p><strong>in-place reinstallation of Windows 10 </strong>while keeping all my files - not working at all</p>
<p><strong>delete the cache files</strong> in Appdata/local/packages&nbsp; - not working at all ( actually I did not see any cache file in it)</p>
<p><strong>Reregister Apps</strong> by</p>
<p>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} - Not working at all and actually ruined all appxs by deleting every file under /program files/windowsApps/. This was the command that
 should fix everything but was corrupted after Nov.update. You will still find a lot of search results on internet telling you to use it, but , do not ever try it !!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SFC /scannow&nbsp;</strong> reported everything good and did not work</p>
<p><strong>DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth&nbsp; </strong>successfully restored something but did not resolve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also a similar problem for mails and calendars, but usually after start them several times I can always let them stay stable without reinstallation.</p>

            Thanks. I guess I'll just do the temporary fix you mentioned for now. Hopefully a permanent fix will be discovered in the meantime.

            <p><em>the problem lies in the NTdll.DLL file, and is bound to the user profile as seen in the logviewer. (search for 'log' in cortana).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>however i can spare you the work, here is the immidiate permanent solution</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a new 'local account' in settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other users. Dont add an family user.</p>
<p>2. Move all your files over to the new account</p>
<p>3. Remove your old account (make sure you have moved everything over to the new account)</p>
<p>4. Navigate to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Email and accounts, and change your local account to an microsoft account again.</p>
<p>5. Open OneNote and set it up. It will sync your old notes automatically.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for your advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I tried reinstalling the whole system (including wipe away all my personal file and settings), and still onenote and mail started to crash after I upgraded them though store. I guess it is somehow related to the latest version. If I keep the very
 first version that comes with Windows 10 1511, then it works completely fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So right now I've been using the earliest version ever since and nothing goes wrong. Sometimes I wanted to upgrade through the Store to see if any fixes but I really didnt want to risk it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, the other two windows 10 I installed later on&nbsp;different machines does not have this issue at all, with the same Microsoft account.</p>

            <p>Try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On your old account, issue this in a power shell : "Get-AppxPackage *onenote* | Remove-Appxpackage",
</p>
<p>2. Browse to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">C:\Program files\WinowsApps
</span>(which is a hidden folder) and delete all folders with 'OneNote' in its name.</p>
<p>3. Create a new user account and move your files over</p>
<p>4. In the new account run all windows updates</p>
<p>5. Make sure the 'Documents' folder exists in OneDrive. (In your language)</p>
<p>5. Finally install OneNote from the store (since you have uninstalled it on steps 1 and 2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you run all Windows Updates before updating OneNote and mail? It coud be an problem in NTdll.DLL, which is a system file. There is however almost no information about this. You can look up the logs in your startmenu,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know how the log application is called in your language, but the log application will have this icon :</p>

<p>
</p><p>and then navigate to windows logs &gt; application. You can see the error messages there, since UWP apps do not show errors on chrash.</p>

            This is only a poor workaround, not a fix. Wanna get a fix that don't need to move anything over to any other new user profile.

            <p>Folks,</p>
<p>I had a similar problem.</p>
<p>I heavily relied on One Note on my Win 7 laptop.</p>
<p>Switched to Win 10 and it all pulled in right away, life was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I realized that the Win 10 PC wanted me to login using my Microsoft account, which I did not want.</p>
<p>I changed this to use a local account, so that I could have a different password at work.</p>
<p>This also worked fine until I tried to open One Note again.</p>
<p>The screen popup would flash and the program would eventually crash....</p>
<p>So sad, I reinstalled office 2016 a few times and then tried the Microsoft account login option again.</p>
<p>Everything works great again, and this seams to be the issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft, please repair this issue....</p>
<p>I want to use a local account instead.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Samsung Focus weird battery charging status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrislynch06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Focus weird battery charging status</h2>
                    
<p>So I have noticed a weird issue that I hope can be fixed soon.&nbsp; If I plug my Focus into my system, and either let it charge or sync content, the battery icon flashes between the battery status and the plugged-in icon.&nbsp; Well, when I disconnect my phone, the
 battery icon still flashes as if it were still connected.&nbsp; If I were to reconnect my phone to my laptop, neither Windows or the Zune software detects my phone plugged in.&nbsp; No&nbsp;USB Connection audible notification what-so-ever.&nbsp; It will not until I restart it.&nbsp;
 The same behavior exists if I were to charge my phone with the wall plug.</p>
<p>I have two Samsung Focus phones that have this exact behavior, both purchased from two different AT&amp;T stores in different counties where I live.</p>

<p><br />
Sorry Chris, think I was merging info.</p>
<p>IF you are still having the issue I would return the handset for a replacement.</p>
<p>I have been reading here about a few people that are having hardware issues. Seems for some that have replied that has corrected the issues.</p>
<p>Must be a bad batch of phones?</p>

            I had exchanged my phone for a new one, and the problem has shown it's head from time to time.&nbsp; I have noticed that it is both a hardware and potentially software problem that Samsung and Microsoft need to fix.&nbsp; WIth my replacement phone, I can plug in
 the USB cable and get it to charge everytime now.&nbsp; When I disconnect the cable (by removing the Micro USB cable from the phone, and not my USB power source), there are times when the battery icon still flashes as if it were plugged in.&nbsp; The way I resolve it
 is to plug it back in, and then remove again.&nbsp; Everytime this happens, I can successfully resolve it.

                    <p>2015 Retina Macbook Pro Bootcamp</p>
<p>Recently updated. First it was fine, however after one reboot and one log in, all hell broke loose.</p>
<p>Can't open Device Manager, seems can't run Windows Update, etc.,</p>
<p>Can't do much because every time I tried it just <strong>CRASH -&gt; BLACK SCREEN -&gt; FLASH -&gt; ASK ME TO LOG IN AGAIN</strong></p>
<p>And the loop just goes on and on.</p>
<p>The only notification I got was that the <strong>Display Driver Failed to start</strong> which is absurd... I tried using drivers comes with Bootcamp software, tried to download the newest drivers from AMD and none of it works.</p>
<p>Finally, tried to Reset and kept my files.</p>
<p>It worked... for a couple hour without rebooting.</p>
<p>Now... can't really do much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really could use some help. Thanks!!!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Sync Error</h2>
                    I have just upgraded to Office 365.&nbsp; I discovered that if I read emails from my Windows Phone in the morning, they do not show up in Outlook 2013 when I sync my folders in the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked outlook.com and the file is there also; in fact if I
 try a sync from Outlook 2010 on another computer, the files sync correctly.&nbsp; Anybody have any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>Welcome to Microsoft community and thanks for posting the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, the emails are not showing up in Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, I need the sync error logs and error messages if any.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Send/receive</span><span> tab.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Show Progress</span><span> button.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Error</span><span> tab for sync error logs.</span>

            Try installing Windows Live Mail and sync your email account.&nbsp; I did this, and while Live Mail was syncing, Outlook finished syncing COMPLETELY within a couple minutes!&nbsp; I'm not sure why???&nbsp; I've been fighting a NON-syncing issue with my emails and contacts
 for about a week.

<h2>            Emails stay in Outbox</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HTC S710, and just recently I have annoyed a couple of people.&nbsp;I&nbsp;replied to their email,&nbsp;but the reply&nbsp;arrives repeatedly&nbsp;every five minutes. After testing by sending emails to myself, and claiming the problem was their end, I checked
 the other folders and saw the offending email sitting in the outbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone any ideas why it should not delete messages from the outbox after sending them? Any idea how to stop it?</p>
<p>It doesn't happen with new emails i send - only replies I give to incoming mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>Marty</p>

<h2>            No email sound or blue dot notification on Outlook 365 and Microsoft accounts on my Nokia 6.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, for the last couple of days my phone will not sound or show a blue dot when I receive an email on my Nokia 6.1 phone.
</p>
<p>Therefore I have to keep checking Outlook to see if anything has been sent which is rather annoying!!</p>
<p>The is happening on both my personal and Microsoft account.</p>
<p>I have been into my phone settings and checked to see if anything is turn off and everything is set to make a sound, vibrate and show the notification dot.</p>
<p>If I send an email from my phone, I get a sound when it's sent.</p>
<p>In the Help and Feedback settings, there's Troubleshooting and Test push notifications and on trying that, I'm told my notifications is working!!!</p>
<p>Is there an issue that will be sorted out, or do I have to do something to the phone myself?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h3> cpntracy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 2013 - Email Merge - send entire publication as a jpeg</h2>
                    <p>I made an email newsletter using an email newsletter template that Microsoft Publisher 2013 provides. I was hoping to send an email merge with this newsletter, however, some of the text isn't very clear when I send it and I was wondering if I could make
 the entire publication a jpeg and send it that way (hopefully a jpeg can still have embedded hyperlinks found in the publication). I see directions of how to do this online for Microsoft Publisher 2003 and 2007 and how it used to be under tools&gt;options&gt;web
 tab. The new publisher does not have that and I am hoping to do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a way for me to send one Publication in a jpg but also in an html version - depending on what version the person is able to open on their device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I don't have Pub 2013 on this machine but I think it is the same as in Pub 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; scroll down until you find the Web Options button. That will lead to the option to send as a JPG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty sure that sending as a JPG kills the hyperlinks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also pretty sure that sending as an attached PDF that the hyperlinks survive. Also the layout, formatting and clean text will be preserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you do not have many options when trying to send HTML formatted email with Publisher. If you want those options and more dependability then use one of the specialized programs such as:

    <title>Dual Booting with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian p. campbell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Booting with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was originally testing Windows 10 in a virtual computer using VMware Workstation. But, seeing that it has been getting slow, I wanted to dual-boot with windows 10 instead. So I haven't done it yet, but if I did and then windows 10 came out, how would I
 delete the preview partition? Would it be as easy as deleting it then merging the blank partition back?</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced. Hope to get an answer as soon as possible seeing I would like to do this tonight.</p>
<p>BTW, using Windows 8.1. </p>

            yes, simply deleting the windows 10 partition, and removing windows 10 from the bootmanager with msconfig.

<p>2. Enter 5 in cell B2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This indicates 5 months</p>
<p>3. In cell C2, enter this formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>=EDATE(A2,B2*12)</p>

            <p>Hi Trent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delve will show files that you have access to. For personal sites, typically, the user who the site is being created for is the only site admin, meaning only they can see the files unless they are sharing it. However, you can additional site admins for personal
 sites from the Office 365 admin center or from the SharePoint admin center, which makes you have access to the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure this is the case, please try the following suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Go to the user's OneDrive for Business library and see if all the user's file is visible to you. Please provide us with both the screenshot of the user's OneDrive for Business page logged in from your account and the user's account for comparison.</p>
<p>2. Go to the user's OneDrive for Business library&gt; click on the <strong>Gear</strong> icon on the top right &gt;
<strong>Site Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Site permissions</strong> &gt; <strong>Check Permissions</strong> &gt; Enter your account &gt;
<strong>Check now</strong> and provide us with the results.</p>
<p>3. Please also provide us with the name of the specific file so we can identify it in your screenshot.<br />
</p>
<p>Note: If you are not the site admin for the user's site, you may not be able to access the
<strong>Site Settings</strong> for his personal site. In this case, please login using the user's account to check your account's permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the screenshots may contain sensitive information, I have sent you a private message to collect it. You can access your private message

    <title>Outlook Search is messed up after a 365 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> navid sabetian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Search is messed up after a 365 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have office 365 exchange hosted on cloud by Microsoft (unfortunately) and this problem is related to the desktop application of outlook on office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able to select "All mailboxes" when using the outlook search function and be able to search for all kinds of criteria, attachments etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the&nbsp; upgrade button of 365 appeared so many times and I clicked on it this morning. Since the upgrade it appears that the search function doesnt work in the same way as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I am searching for things that I know exist on outlook and search in "all mailboxes" it just keeps searching with the option to search the server appearing which doesnt do anything other than continuing to search with no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I select "current folder" or "current mailbox" then it immediately shows the search results however the issue is that under this search I cannot see what folder I have stored that item under (i.e whether it is in my inbox or one of the subfolders or deleted
 items), it doesnt let me view the folder and there is no way to enable that view either and secondly I dont know how complete the results are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one main active outlook account with 365 and a couple of other inactive ones that are attached to it (previous employees) but they havnt been used for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until this morning everything was working fine but it is really after this upgrade that things stopped working the way they used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to repair office 365 on my computer but that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now set up outlook to completely re-index but I dont know if that will resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a common problem? whats the best way to resolve? why are there so many bugs and issues associated with microsoft products in this day and age?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 autocorrect malfunction</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; For the last several months I've been putting an 'a at the end of words when I intend it to be an 's.&nbsp; Mostly I look at my keyboard when I type and I attributed it to mistakes from peripheral neuropathy in my little finger.&nbsp; However, today I glanced
 up and the screen and noticed that I wasn't hitting the wrong key, autocorrect was changing it to a 'a and then underlining it in red as a spelling error.&nbsp; I've had this version on both my computers for a few years now and it just started doing it 4 or 5 months
 ago on one of the computers.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Custom entries in the Autocorrect library of Outlook 2016 could be the reason that the "'s" you enter changes to "'a". To verify this and resolve your concern, kindly follow the steps below to add and delete entries in the Autocorrect library:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on "File Tab (Button)" in Outlook 2016.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/450fa1b9-916e-4cd8-9d41-b342490c0f73?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/450fa1b9-916e-4cd8-9d41-b342490c0f73?upload=true" /></a></li><li>Then select "Options" from the list shown.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d504339f-39c4-4445-8dd0-25f9f6fb6240?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d504339f-39c4-4445-8dd0-25f9f6fb6240?upload=true" /></a></li><li>Under the Outlook Options menu, select "Mail" from the list and then click on the "Spelling and Autocorrect... (Button)".<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b77d506-9d9e-486d-9105-ee85b3be89ab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b77d506-9d9e-486d-9105-ee85b3be89ab?upload=true" /></a></li><li>Under the "Editor Options" menu, select the "AutoCorrect Options... (Button).<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80a029bf-ca8a-4b93-a3d6-8c6430fba84d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80a029bf-ca8a-4b93-a3d6-8c6430fba84d?upload=true" /></a></li><li>The new window prompt will show you the options in autocorrect. What needs to be done does is to go to the section labeled "Replace text as you type". Once there type "'s" and "'a" in the "replace" and "With" accordingly.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d849b3aa-7c71-4328-9587-38e3bff0ef71?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d849b3aa-7c71-4328-9587-38e3bff0ef71?upload=true" /></a></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a custom entry you will see it in the list. All you need to do to remove it from the list is select the entry and click on the "Delete (Button)". After completing these steps the Autocorrect function in Outlook should no longer change "'s" to
 "'a" automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result once you complete the steps.</p>

    <title>Ovi Player is Useless - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ovi Player is Useless</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you will no doubt notice this is my first post here, I&nbsp;realize&nbsp;I am just ranting but I thought better rant in the right place so maybe my concerns will be heard. I recently got a Nokia X6 with Unlimited Music (aka Comes With Music) and I am SO frustrated
 with the service I have received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia Ovi Player is possibly the most useless and unstable piece of software I have ever had on my PC. I have had this software for just over two months, and since then I have only been able to open and play music about six times. I am so frustrated
 with this **bleep** software, it brings my usually snappy PC to a grinding halt every single time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reinstalled it twice. There is no escaping the nightmare of Ovi Player! I now have a redundant Unlimited Music subscription because I have to use this substandard software to download. &nbsp;Worst of all the player is constantly 'searching' for things
 I have removed from my library. Stop it! Stop importing when I tell you to stop! Please!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone stumbles upon this thread in a search engine, or elsewhere take note: this is a seriously flawed piece of software, avoid downloading it at all costs in fact (and i'm a hater of this too) but rater use the iTunes Store it is far more usable and
 stable.</p>

<p>Ovi Player has some annoying issues indeed, but eventually this software will mature in time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually buy my music and sync them to my phone using Ovi Player and play my music using other software (because of the lack of last.fm scrobbling support). But if the software has issues, at least you can buy music easily using your web browser ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using iTunes, you have to use that extremely resource-consuming software too! Even if it works better than Ovi Player... But then again, you can't sync music with iTunes to your phone. So either way you'd end up having one more&nbsp;music player software
 on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to sum up: if Ovi Player somehow doesn't work properly right now for you, you can always buy DRM-free MP3 music from Ovi Music using browser. While waiting for future updates, move the music to your phone using Ovi Player or Windows's Explorer and/or
 play it with other software. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            How do I reorder my list of signatures in Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I have 25-30 email signatures. They currently appear in the order in which they were created. How do I reorder this list? I've tried renaming the signatures or putting a number (1,2,3, etc) in front of them - doesn't seem to make a difference. They only
 appear in one order: the order in which they were created.

            I had imported my sigs from Entourage and they are sorted alphabetically, but I just tried adding a new Sig and it's in the order created. I see no way to sort. I'll report this but I wouldn't expect a fix until the next version of Outlook is released.
<br />
<br />
I encourage you to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu) as well.<br />
<br />
The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list.<br />

<h2>            Handheld Comp somehow has wrong outlook user - how disconnect and restart&#63;</h2>
                    I have a user who has a mobile intermec cn3 handheld computer.&nbsp; This was deployed a few months ago with windows mobile vista, connects with windows xp system, uses active sync 4.5.&nbsp; User just told me that since deployed, it has constantly synced up with
 a different person's outlook information - never his.&nbsp; I don't know how this happened.&nbsp; To disconnect the user from one outlook to another, I'm not really sure where on the mobile system to start.&nbsp; I will have a chance on the mobile computer in a couple of
 days. <br />
<br />
My approach idea - what do you think?<br />
1) disable activesync on workstation and on mobile<br />
2) on mobile see if I can delete or somehow remove bad user as the default<br />
3) enable activesync on workstation and on mobile<br />
4) cradle mobile and cross my fingers and hope for the best<br />
<br />
All ideas are welcome!

            Hello. I think the only way this could happen is that the Activesync partnership between the PC and the mobile device was made in someone else's user account. The Outlook profile or outlook.pst file is also stored in the user's account. Delete the partnership
 from the device and soft reboot the device. Now log into the correct user account for the person and make sure that he has created an Outlook profile there. Check and see if there is a partnership in Activesync on the PC. I am thinking there won't be since
 it wasn't correct in the first place. Plug in the device to a main USB port on the PC. Follow the instructions to create the partnership. It should now sync to the Outlook profile in that user's account. Hope that wasn't too confusing. &nbsp;

            I will check into this.&nbsp; I just got another piece of information.&nbsp; The mobile handheld was left in the cradle all the time with the USB connection to the Workstation.&nbsp; The other user would just sit down and login and wouldn't know anything about the handheld
 and usb cable.&nbsp; So perhaps something happened there.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I will start by looking for the partnership and removing it.&nbsp; Thanks for the idea.&nbsp; I'll have access in a day or two.

<p>If this is a shared workstation, just make sure that the correct&nbsp;outlook.pst file is being accessed by Outlook when making the partnership to the handheld. And make sure it is in the \Documents and Settings\Username folder and not anywhere else. It just
 has to match up.</p>

<h2>            xlswrite functionality in office 2016 mac</h2>
                    <p>Received from Mathworks</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The full functionality of "xlswrite" depends on the ability to instantiate Microsoft Excel as a COM server, which is a technology developed by Microsoft for Windows platforms. "xlswrite" on Mac operating systems instead operates on limited functionality
 and attempts to create "CSV" files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is this now supported in Office 2015 for mac? kind of a big deal when using MATLAB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any plans to do so?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span>This question was duplicated. If at all possible avoid duplicating post in same day. The Answers Forum is made up of a diverse group of individuals. Most are volunteers and live all over the world. We have at least two MVPS that live and Work in&nbsp;Australia.
</span>And therefore don't get to view questions until we on this side of the world are comfy in bed (If we are not night owls 😉).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So don't expect as Norm answers to show up the second you send out. Could take Several hours , or possibly the next day or several days. Then there is always the Possibility we just don't know. Or some research into the question is needed. If duplicated
 Then people will begin to skip over questions.</p>

            Without a test example, I am only guessing.&nbsp; Have you tried using the "Move or Copy" sheet function and specify your destination is a new file?&nbsp; The other thought woudl be to create a duplicate copy of the file and delete out the unnecessary sheets.

            Dear friend,<br />
<br />
I have heard that you can surf your emails with the help of GPRS service which will be provided by your service provider, but be sure your email is pop enabled.<br />
<br />
Even I like E71, but due to non-compability of blackberry services I am not buying it.<br />
<br />

            There is no BB Connect software for the E71 from Nokia, and probably nobody else, either.<br />
<br />
The version available for earlier Eseries models is not supporting the E71. I don't know if/when Nokia might have a new version for the E71.

<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using e 71 since 6 months and i find it amazing!!</p>
<p>Altough this doesnt support blackberry, there is a service which Nokia provides which is very similar to BB.</p>
<p>You can send and recieve mails on the go just like BB!! You can create upto 10 email accounts. Its called :Nokia Messaging Service":</p>
<p>I have activated&nbsp;"mobile office" the GPRS Option from Airtel and it works fine!!</p>
<p>PLease log on to email.nokia.com</p>
<p>HOpe this helps!!:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Palani</p>
