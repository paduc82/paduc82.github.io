<h2>            converting powerpoint to video in mac 2016</h2>
                    Does anyone have an idea why microsoft removed save as video in the 2016 version. &nbsp;That is the only way to share powerpoint across most platforms. &nbsp;This seems just crazy but maybe there is an explanation. &nbsp;Maybe I should join the flock leaving ms behind
 and switch to other tools.

            <p>This feature was in Office 2011, but didn't work so well. As one example, it didn't capture narrations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2016 for Mac is a complete rewrite of the software. The first versions were bare bones software and features have been added with each update. Microsoft has said that they intend Office for Mac to have feature parity with the Windows version, but
 they still have some considerable way to go in that department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a workaround for the video export problem using QuickTime Player. As a bonus, it includes narrations as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your presentation in PowerPoint and resize the window to the size you want your video to be (i.e. 640x480 pixels, etc.).</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Slide Show&gt;Set Up Show...</strong></li><li>Under&nbsp;<em>Show type</em>, choose&nbsp;<strong>Browsed by an individual (window)</strong>, then click on&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Start your Slide Show.</li><li>In QuickTime Player, choose&nbsp;<strong>File&gt;New Screen Recording</strong>.</li><li>On the&nbsp;<em>Screen Recording</em>&nbsp;dialog, click the&nbsp;<strong>red button</strong>&nbsp;in the middle.</li><li>Drag your mouse to select the PowerPoint window.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Record</strong>.</li><li>Run your slideshow. When you're finished, click on the&nbsp;<strong>square dot inside a circle</strong>&nbsp;on the OS X menu bar to stop QuickTime. Save the video file.</li></ol>

<h2>            &#34;No add-ins currently available.&#34;  when deploying add-in using Centralized Deployment</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to deploy an add-in with add-in commands on the desktop version of office 365, using the Centralized Deployment method.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I followed the instructions for Centralized Deployment and the addin appears as "on" in the Office 365 admin center. I used both "Everyone" and "Specific User/Group", but when I open the Word application and go to Add-ins, under
 "Admin Managed" I see no addins , and the message <strong>"No add-ins currently available."</strong> The addin is'nt visible neither on Word 2016 Desktop (with subscription) nor Word Online. I have also tried deploying addins from office store using the same
 method (Centralized Deployment) but they also don't show up.</p>
<p>I have Word version 1708 (8431.2270), and I am using a developer subscription.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions to fix it or know why it is not working? Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT :&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I noticed that I am getting a 403 Error when refreshing the Admin Managed tab (when calling https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/AddinServiceHandler.ashx)&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Alex,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Publishing an add-in using Centralized Deployment needs to meet all requirements for it to deploy successful in the applications. We recommend that you post your concern

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>After enabling Exchange I managed to deploy the addins from Office store (using Centralized Deployment). But my own addin is still not visible. I also tried with a simple HelloWorld type addin but it still does not show up. Do you
 know what can cause this?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I checked with fiddler and the response from <em>/ews/exchange.asmx&nbsp;</em>contains all addins including my addin, but it does not show up in Admin Managed Tab.</p>

    <title>Access 2016 and Sharepoint Online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rkarlen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access 2016 and Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    <p>Hi, sorry if this is a basic question. I've done some searches in the forum but haven't found my specific scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with a business that wishes to publish an in-house Access Database to a cloud solution, and I've been evaluating different options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have spent a fair amount of time developing the Database and would like to retain that if possible. They have Office 2016 with Sharepoint, but do not have a Sharepoint server at this time. The user base is currently 5 people, but they may grow. All
 have Office 2016 on their laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to publish an Access 2016 database to Sharepoint Online as a web app? If so, would Sharepoint Online give them the shared access they need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can they continue using Office 2016, or would they be required to move to Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help,</p>
<p>Rob Karlen</p>

            <p>Converting your desktop Access app to a web Access app would require a full, ground-up rewrite of the application. If they truly need a web-enabled system, then you would be much better off creating that in a true web language, like ASP.NET, PHP, Java, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, the simplest way to "cloud-ify" your application is by using a Remote Desktop System (Citrix, MSFT RDS, etc) to host it. You can do this with little to no changes in the application, and your investment would very likely be less than with a SP
 system. You can also have hosted RDS systems, which would incur a yearly or monthly fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, we don't really know the reason for their switch, so it's hard to give any focused suggestions. Are they looking to support remote or home-based users, for example, or is there some other reason?</p>

            <p>They are currently using ACT! with a monthly subscription as a CRM solution, but the boss also uses an Access database for additional customer details. He wants to get away from ACT! for functionality and pricing reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are looking to support multiple users (4-9 to start) with the ability to update and review the database. He's put a lot of time into developing the Access solution and would like to retain that if possible, but that's not a requirement if another solution
 would be better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't considered just having a hosted system for them to RDS into. I can propose that one to them also, but I know they want true multi-user access from their field staff when they are out on customer calls.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know other options would be to migrate to a hosted SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL solution, but they were hoping to leverage their current Office 2016 and Sharepoint licenses if possible.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sharepoint is not the preferred solution with Access, and I don't know of many who use that platform for shared Access applications. By far, the preferred method is to use RDS or Citrix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has also introduced Azure RemoteApp:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/</a>. It's basically a hosted RDS system, at least from what I can tell, but it would
 work for your requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as true multi-user access, that is exactly what an RDS or the Azure Remoteapp setup would provide. RDS systems allow multiple users to access the system, and assuming the application is built to accommodate multiple users, you should be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note too that if they move to an RDS-like system you must be sure their current Office licensing allows them to use Office on that system. Having Office365 does NOT guarantee that, so do some research before settling on that sort of solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I know other options would be to migrate to a hosted SQL, MySQL, or PostgreSQL solution</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As I'm sure you're aware, those are simply databases, and have nothing to do with the UI portion. With an Access solution, you have the UI portion (the FrontEnd) and the Data portion
 (the Backend). The biggest challenge you'll face is the hosting of the UI portion. The database portion is easy!</span></p>

            I know that IE8 &amp; XP are outdated and neither are supported any longer. it's not coming from the website, because when I click the update button it goes to the Microsoft website! and they are trying to get me to get windows 10! I have two computers xp
 and 8.1. I have tried windows 10, but I do not like it!! I have&nbsp;two programs (pagemaker 6.5 and corel 8) that will not work on 10, but quicken which will work on 10&nbsp;and&nbsp; is older than methuselah. also, no problem,&nbsp;I installed firefox, which works great!! thanks,

    <title>Is it possible to customize the default bullet styles in the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredrast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to customize the default bullet styles in the &#34;Bullet Gallery&#34; in Ppt 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>Is it possible to customize the default bullet styles that appear in the "Bullet Gallery" in Power Point 2007, i.e. the window that opens up when clicking the "down arrow" next to the "bullet list button" on the Ribbon?<br />
<br />
In the "Bullet Gallery", there are eight slots, one set as "None" and the other seven with different bullet styles -- none of which corresponds to the bullet style that I would like to use as default in my presentations. Is it possible to customize the bullet
 styles in these slots, and have these customizations saved permanently (e.g. with the template) so that the customized styles always appear when opening the "Bullet Gallery"? Most of all I would like to customize the first bullet style (in the second slot),
 which is applied when directly pressing the "bullet list button".<br />
<br />
I'm able to momentaneously change the bullet style in the eighth slot by clicking "Bullets and Numbering..." in the first pop-up window and then "Customize" in the second. However, this change only applies to the very element I was formatting at the time. When
 selecting a new element and opening the Bullet Gallery, the same default bullets are there again.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually i tried MSE and it is good but it is still didn't detect or delete the autorun.inf files . i know that in some autorun files&nbsp; is just one line with&nbsp; a txt with run file.exe but it still effect OS and made&nbsp; the partition un-opened ... so we
 have to delete it . can we just include the autorun.inf signature in the infected files so MSE can remove it??

            The greatest problem here is if its a legitimate autorun.inf that points to a legitimate setup file.
<br />
If we do add this functionality into MSE, how about if this was a CD/DVD file?<br />
This can cause potential issues with other vendors and would also constantly prompt up MSE to delete such files on a read-only media.<br />
<br />
To protect us with such instances of non-legitimate and malicious files of autoruns Microsoft has released a Security patch across all systems.<br />

 each entry is 3 rows long. &nbsp; I want to protect the individual entries from accidental changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I think this can be accomplished with a worksheet event processing macro.&nbsp; I have provided the code for such a macro below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up Data Validation in cell L7 on the sheet, and also set up a few more in L10, L13 and L16.&nbsp; Note that these cells must be unlocked so that you can make changes to them when the sheet is in protected status.&nbsp; I actually copied my first group from A6:L8
 (to include the lock/unlock) cell, into rows below that area to create new 3-row sections quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choices for the cells in column L are Lock and Unlock - you can change those as you want as long as the word/phrase for locking the 3-row group is exactly the same within the code itself.&nbsp; It's set in a Const there, as is the password for the worksheet
 if you are using one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put the code into your workbook:</p>
<p>Open the workbook,</p>
<p>Select the log sheet</p>
<p>Right-click on the sheet's name tab and choose [View Code] from the list</p>
<p>copy the code below and paste it into the code module presented to you.</p>
<p>Close the VBA editor.</p>
<p>Save the workbook as a macro enabled workbook, type .xlsm or .xlsb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unprotect the sheet and set up a cell like L7 using Data Validation and enter the lock/unlock phrases as the acceptable data.&nbsp; Copy that cell as required on down the sheet.&nbsp; I would initially choose the "unlock" word/phrase in the cell - you can lock the
 ones you need to later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp; Const FirstCol = "A"<br />
&nbsp; Const LastCol = "K"<br />
&nbsp; Const LockUnlockCol = "L"<br />
&nbsp; Const LockPhrase = "Lock"<br />
&nbsp; 'if the worksheet is protected with a password<br />
&nbsp; 'enter it here, "" = no password<br />
&nbsp; Const wsPassword = ""<br />
&nbsp; Dim firstRow As Long<br />
&nbsp; Dim lastRow As Long<br />
&nbsp; Dim cellsRange As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 'make sure just 1 cell changed, that<br />
&nbsp; 'the cell was in column L and that<br />
&nbsp; 'No other entries other than Lock/Unlock<br />
&nbsp; 'are allowed in col L, and the cell with<br />
&nbsp; 'the 2-item list must be middle one of a<br />
&nbsp; '3-row group, i.e., L7 is middle of rows 6:8<br />
&nbsp; '<br />
&nbsp; If Target.Cells.Count &gt; 1 _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or Target.Column &lt;&gt; Range(LockUnlockCol &amp; 1).Column Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Sub<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'looks like single cell in column L<br />
&nbsp; firstRow = Target.Row - 1<br />
&nbsp; lastRow = Target.Row + 1<br />
&nbsp; Set cellsRange = Range(FirstCol &amp; firstRow &amp; ":" _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; LastCol &amp; lastRow)<br />
&nbsp; 'unprotect sheet<br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Unprotect Password:=wsPassword<br />
&nbsp; If Target = LockPhrase Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'is "Lock", so lock them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cellsRange.Locked = True<br />
&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'is not word "Lock" so unlock them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cellsRange.Locked = False<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Protect Password:=wsPassword<br />
&nbsp; Set cellsRange = Nothing<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            Mail user bulk creation for AD users</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have an on-premise 2007 box and am running dirsync and ADFS. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have bulk created&nbsp;users in AD without any exchange attributes except specified an email address in the ADUC email field.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp;cannot find a way to make these new AD users have an online mailbox created AND be a Mail Enabled User for the GAL and group permissions etc.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Ideally I do not want to create a mailbox on premise, then migrate them, then make them a MEU.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
What are my options to do this to bulk users? I know for a single user I can mess about with manual targetaddress and aliases etc. but what about 365 bulk user mailbox creation and also make them a MEU on-premise in bulk?<br />
<br />
New to 365 admin so would appreciate any help</span></p>
<p>

            <p>You cannot do this natively with the 2007 tools. Only way is by doing a Hybrid configuration and creating remote mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need a script to automate this, just do a search on google/bing, there are lot of examples available. In a nutshell, you need to provision the on-prem user objects (for example, via New-ADUser),&nbsp;set their attributes accordingly (Set-ADUser), then
 force a dirsync. This part will depend on the tool you are using, for the latest AAD Connect version you can use something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Invoke-Command -ComputerName AADConnectServer -ScriptBlock { Start-ADSyncSyncCycle }&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to put some delays in the script at that point, using the Start-Sleep cmdlet. 5 mins should be enough, but adjust it to match the size of your org.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the accounts are provisioned in O365, you need to set their Usage location and assign licenses. This is done via the WAAD PowerShell module and the Set-Msoluser and Set-MsolUserLicense cmdlets respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need it as a bulk script, make sure it takes input from a CSV file or via the pipeline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why no one wants to make or update windows store apps. &#40;more of a discussion that question&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, Im Ron.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp; mentions the main issues i have with MS mobile. I started using iphone when the 3g came out and been through 3 or 4 of them till the 5s; when that one broke i decided to try new technology adn MS mobile was what i wanted to try first but decided to
 get an android first because it was the cheepest i could get hold of. I could get many apps and all in all it wasnt a bad phone,&nbsp; neither was the next one right after that, but i really wanted to try the MS phone to have the seamless operability with my PC
 and tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when that last android broke just after a month or two i knew what i was going to get and the MS phone was on sale for $45 at the ms store. it had 8.1, i had a few issues adding contacts or editing them as it seemed to be a longer process than other phones
 but the phone worked great and i love(d) it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest issue is that companies dont seems to be making apps for microsoft or updating apps they may have previously released. Like GoPro for example, they have an app in the ms store that doesnt support anything higher than the gopro 4 and their web
 site doesnt even list an app for the ms store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the new social chatting software 'Discord' also not realeasing their app for microsoft store...&nbsp; And there soo many apps i could have used for the ms phone that was not available i just can pick them from my memory at this time but im sure you guys know
 what im talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i am just curious; WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive already heard; "well MS got in late in the game with ms phone", but that still doesnt make sense to me; its been like 6-7 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be sooo little effore for GoPro to update their app to support their new device but they chose not to and the same goes for most other companies who arent making or updating their apps in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It almost seems like these companies want to scorn MS and prevent new MS customer, what are your points of view on this?</p>

<h2>            Input text inside iframe doesn&#39;t work when iframe is allocated in a page with a frameset</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a page with a frameset, where I add an iframe with an input text field that is not working as expected.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
The mouse focus is not positioning over the text input, and it doesn't printing the characters that i'm typing. However, the keypress event is being dispatched and captured correctly, and also the "focus on" event.<br />
<br />
I reproduce this behaviour in Internet Explorer 11 and Windows 7, but I think It's ocurrs in older IE versions as well. In Edge, and other vendor browsers, the input component is working as expected.<br />
<br />
An example of this scenario is available at: https://jsfiddle.net/yomfbv8t/4/
<p>
</p><p>Exists any workaround to solve this?</p>

</p><p>Obviously, what I want to include inside iframe is more complex than a simple input. The example only shows the behaviour of the browser with this kind of components, because other components included inside iframe are working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding a new frame is not an option, because I already have two existing frames inside the frameset, and .... the goal of having an iframe is to have a piece of code over the rest of the page that remains inmutable when frames refresh are performed.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You are right. The iframe should not be included in that point. But, all content included inside iframe is rendered perfectly except text input. This is the reason I don't discard using an iframe yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are right, is functional equivalent.</p>

</p><p>We are working to change the frameset/frames to body/iframes, but we are having problems with several browsers when the change is performed, that requires a more complex refactor of the code. This is why we want a short-term solution with framesets.</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hello HernanDiaz
<br />
<br />Some very simple and basic guidelines which will keep you safe
<br />
<br />#1 - Always have an up-to-date reputable system-level anti-virus program running on your system. Note - there's no need to install any Outlook anti-virus addin which more often then not, cause more problems then what's claimed to prevent
<br />
<br />#2 - Never click on a link in an email message that you're not sure about especially messages that "appear" to come from major vendors such as Microsoft, Apple, PayPal, Amazon, your financial institutions etc. No major vendor is going to ask you to "confirm your credentials" via a link in an email message
<br />
<br />#3 - Don't open an attachment unless you're confident about it. Specifically, avoid attachments that claim to have things like "order details"  for an order you never placed or "payment details" for a payment you never made etc etc. If you're unsure and you actually have an account with whatever the attachment claims it represents, log into the account normally and check your account there.
<br />
<br />#5 - Best practice would be to never use the same email address/password combination when subscribing to any kind of account (i.e. email, financial sites as noted above etc etc).
<br />
<br />#6 - Use 2 factor authentication for your email account where available
<br />
<br />#7 - Understand the difference between an email account being "hacked" versus being "hijacked" - I have a background article on the subject at
<br />
<br />Understanding the difference email account/address hacking and hijacking
<br /><a href="https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-difference-email-account-address-hacking-and-hijacking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.contactgenie.info/understanding-dif...</a>
<br />
<br />#8 - Finally, ignore all the garbage related to winning any kind of "email lottery" or something about a rediculous amount of money waiting for you - just send your personal details etc. Golden rule to everything - "if it sounds too good to be true - it probably and usually is".

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Excel is waiting for another application to complete an OLE action&#34; keeps popping up ...</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel with macros that creates a Word document. All was created by a freelancer for Excel 2011 for Mac and worked fine. Since I upgraded to MS 365 for Mac, I get the error ...</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue after upgrading from Office 2011 to the latest version of Office 2016 (installed a few days ago). Unfortunately, even changing back to Office 2011 by deleting the Office 2016 apps does not fix the issue, with macros that were working
 until installing 2016 no longer working in 2011. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Question for those suggesting it is an OS sandboxing issue rather than code issue, wouldn't the programs being sandboxed prevent the opening of Word from Excel, not just make the process slow and buggy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had code working previously (from online suggestions):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Sub CreateXYZ()<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dim wdApp As Object<br />

</p>
<p>I've tried PasteSpecial (followed by most of these&nbsp;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/excel-vba/articles/xlpastetype-enumeration-excel), and a few of them open the document and don't give the OLE error, though just don't paste anything. If I just hit Command-V
 at that point, the data pastes properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep seeing Apple fans blaming Microsoft coding, Microsoft fans blaming Apple sandboxing, though I haven't found any solutions that actually allow tables/ RTF to be automatically sent to a word document.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, Word validates each .xsl (probably checks the XML/XSL, and also looks for the "entry points" that it needs. The latter changed a few years ago so if you have an old .xsl it probably won't appear.</p>

<h2>            Added styles when opening Word 2010 document in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a template with a number of recommended styles; all other styles are hidden. I use this template in Word 2010 to create and save a document.</p>
<p>Now, when I open this document in Word 2016, a number of styles are added, like 'Intense emphasis', 'Intense quote', etc.</p>
<p>I have tested this with documents created from 2010 and 2016 templates. Result is the same for documents created from both templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: how can I prevent Word 2016 from adding styles when opening a document?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Jos<span>√©</span>,
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Intense emphasis</strong></em> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong><em>Intense Quote</em></strong></span> are styles in Word 2010 as well. Both are recommended styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7cd7d24-3223-4a8d-b4a8-c1d0816f1969?upload=true" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want, save a sample document and template with the problem on OneDrive or Dropbox and paste a link here. Remove any confidential or sensitive information first. I or someone else can take a look at it.
<br />
<br />
I suspect, but do not know that the option has been set to update styles from the template.
<br />

<p>Hi Charles, thanks for your quick repons!</p>
<p>Here is a link to a document in Dropbox, that has been saved in Word. When opening it in Word 2016, you will find the added styles. These styles are not visible when opening the same document in Word 2010.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ejvnzdjpzuopeu3/Test%20document%20saved%20in%20Word%202010.docx?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/ejvnzdjpzuopeu3/Test%20document%20saved%20in%20Word%202010.docx?dl=0</a></p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
I've looked at the document. I can verify that these styles show up when I open the document in Word 365. My guess as to the option to update styles being checked was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshots below are from your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebba2406-fe49-44b9-b389-8ec59c3020da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebba2406-fe49-44b9-b389-8ec59c3020da?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c88dca25-b179-4a0c-be8c-0b9112a6d1dd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c88dca25-b179-4a0c-be8c-0b9112a6d1dd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a work around, try changing your style options to show styles in the document, they are not in the document.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ceba76f9-b6fa-4ddf-b78f-fed6249e9e12?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ceba76f9-b6fa-4ddf-b78f-fed6249e9e12?upload=true" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a><br />
<br />
Note, though, even with that option change, these two styles still show up in the Quick Styles Gallery. You could change them to not be in the Quick Styles Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e7ea708-c19f-477a-a9de-cdd241df5551?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e7ea708-c19f-477a-a9de-cdd241df5551?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: left">You would want to remove them from the Gallery in the template rather than the document.
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I can not explain this and consider it to be a minor bug. You can use the feedback mechanism in Word to point out this anomaly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Charles, many thanks again. </p>
<p>I feel more confident now that you have found the same results. </p>
<p>I have already tried to updating the template, but this does not have any effect.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Willie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for my late reply.<br />
Thanks for the detailed information you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I test in the same version of Project desktop application but cannot reproduce the issue. I suggest you try the followings and check the outcome:</p>
<p>1.In Project desktop application, sign out all accounts by going to File&gt;Account&gt;under User Information&gt;Sign out&gt;Yes&gt;close Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Go to Project web app&gt;Project section&gt;select the project you need&gt;go to PROJECT tab in the ribbon&gt;Open&gt;In Microsoft Project or In Microsoft Project for Editing&gt;Yes&gt;sign in your account and password&gt;
 check if you can open the project in Project desktop application successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information for troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1.For the type of the affected project, is it Enterprise Projects?
</p>
<p>Please create a new Enterprise project in Project web app, try opening it in Project desktop app from online&gt;Open or from desktop app&gt;File&gt;open,<span>&nbsp;
</span>check if you can open the new project successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Can you open projects which are created in Project web app in desktop app before?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>What did you do before the issue happens?<span>&nbsp;
</span>(Update Office or your operation system?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

            I have done all that. The specific site is <a href="http://www.seahawks.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.seahawks.com</a> While using metro IE it will not even give an option for full screen. When using the desktop version it won't even play the video without me trying a few thing, one being mark off active x filtering refreshing, then removing active x filtering
 then refreshing. it then plays in full screen. I also have similar issues when using the directv nfl sunday ticket. I can't view full screen on metro IE and then desktop doesn't load at all, but my fix above doesn't always work for the directv site. Please
 help, I hate using chrome and prefer IE but of late I have had to go to chrome as it works with no issues on these sites...
