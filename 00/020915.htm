<h2>            How to remove &#34;Unsubscribe&#34; button from Outlook 365</h2>
                    My company recently moved from Outlook 2013 to Outlook 365, I know, big oops but it did happen.&nbsp; So now with 365 I randomly get the word "Unsubscribe" in blue letters wedge in between my email and the header.&nbsp; I know super annoying.&nbsp; Does anyone know how
 to disable this from randomly popping up here and there.&nbsp; How do I unsubscribe from the "Unsubscribe" button.&nbsp; This button serves no true purpose other then to bog down my emails and make them appear clunky, not to mention all the extra scrolling that I have
 to do.&nbsp; I am not sure how people that come up with this stuff have jobs, but then again Microsoft has never cared about customers, just employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Miracles do happen and I'm not just referring to the Cleveland Browns winning a game (LOL).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidently stumbled upon the solution as I was having problems with a real add-in which my company uses called Integrity Data.&nbsp; I originally was attempting to remove this horrible "Unsubscribe" through the desktop version of 365.&nbsp; Since Microsoft wants
 to force things on you that you do not want, this add-in is not listed on the desktop version.&nbsp; I accidently went to the "WEB Add-Ins" for Outlook and sure enough that is where it is hidden.&nbsp; This Add-In was&nbsp;provided by and installed by Microsoft, all without
 my permission and then&nbsp;hid the options online so that the users have trouble finding them.&nbsp; Just look, the experts on this thread couldn't figure it out.&nbsp; It took an accidental miracle.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, problem solved.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I do appreciate all of you taking a look into this.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<h2>            emails going straight to Deleted Item folder</h2>
                    For the past few days, some of my incoming emails are being sent straight to the Deleted Item folder instead of to the InBox, and one other person said the same has been happening to her new emails. &nbsp;Oddly, this never happens to the usual spam-type emails,
 only regular emails.

    <title>ceprolad.a occamy.c showing up after a while on every boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> î£ð˜ð¨î”î ð¦îžä¿  ç¡•å£«é»‘å®¢  say:</h3>
<h2>            ceprolad.a occamy.c showing up after a while on every boot</h2>
                    <p>hello im wondering if defender just got buggy after dealing with some malware i apparently downloaded not long ago, ever since it keeps detecting "behavior:win32/ceprolad.A" and "trojan:win32/occamy.c" every few hours or so, and it turns on UAC for some
 reason after every detection I think, no other odd behavior so far, its only a PID and when its a file it isnt there when I look for it, maybe it gets deleted right away?, and when it is, no other av software can detect it, defender itself cant find anything
 in quick or full or even OFFLINE scan after the alleged threat is detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried malware bytes running all day and it found nothing even with hyperscan, hitmanpro only found a "suspicious" wimbot.sys file that I was afraid could prevent me from booting but it didnt even though it was deleted, I tried microsoft safety scanner,
 also nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>this thing only comes up randomly on defender and it asks to restart to finish cleaning it up but clicking restart doesnt work, and it often disappears from the list of detected threats, if i click take action when it shows up, it just hangs there</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far these files keep showing up and defender apparently deletes them every time
</p>
<p>
</p><p>file: C:\Users\EspHack\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\IE\MIPY49MB\MicrosoftSecurity[1].exe</p>
<p>file: C:\ProgramData\update.exe</p>
<p>file: C:\Users\EspHack\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content\5CEA8CFB8047B569B331D0E79D28457D</p>
<p>
</p><p>they look sketchy enough but why is it only defender seems to think they are malware? if defender is right then this is a exploit that can infect a running process and deliver the payload(those 3 files) and defender cant fix that "suspicious behavior" threat
 other than blocking it every time</p>
<p>
</p><p>im running 17134.165, latest threat definition as of july 12</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw this windows defender thing just feels buggy af as usual, almost every time a notification comes up I click on it and it isnt on threat history, or I cant tell if its there since its already in quarantine? I even have those alerts turned off and they
 just keep coming anyway, is there anything that works as intended on w10? </p>

<p>karspersky found the script making this thing coming back I think, its a bat &amp; vbs file on programdata</p>
<p>
</p><p>goes to this url http://adobep.xyz/gate/update.php to get the payload I think, i blocked the domain at the router, lets see whats next...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: got rid of it, finally</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the trail, the files it was creating were downloaded from the script I mentioned in programdata, after deleting the folder along with it all I had left was an error message about a file windows couldnt find every half hour or so, so I went to
 task scheduler and gave up, then tried autoruns from here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns and it was a simple click on the sketchiest checkbox ever under the task scheduler tab, now its all good</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for all the feedback, hope this helps someone later</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950XL  Reply on the fly duplicate messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't know how long exactly but since several updates I noticed, that using the 'reply on the fly' functionality on my Lumia 950XL causes the message to be sent twice. That's not the case using the messaging app directly. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Version is:</p>
<p>1703</p>
<p>Build: 10.0.15063.483</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and kind regards</p>

<h2>            Account clash &#47; &#34;There is a problem with your Microsoft account. To fix this, sign in to account.live.com from a browser.&#34;</h2>
                    <div>Good day.<br />
<br />
I have been using my e-mail address "removed email address"for my university e-mail since office365 took over the outlook log in.<br />
However, recently I subscribed for Office365 Home Premium but I cannot log in via the Office application. First I get this message:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>It looks like you use the same email address with more than one account. Please select the type of account which you would like to use to sign in. [Options:&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Microsoft account</em></strong><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Organization account</em></strong><em>]</em></div>
<div>
<p>Afterwards, if I select the M<span>icrosoft account, I cannot log in, receiving the following message:&nbsp;"</span><em>There is a problem with your Microsoft account. To fix this, sign in to account.live.com from a browser."&nbsp;</em><span>If I go to account.live.com,
 nothing seems to help me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, if I log in with my organizational account, I do so successfully but I get informed that Office is not associated with that account.</p>
</div>
<div>I clearly need to have access to my account to manage my subscription, but this problem won't allow me, even though I have been recently invoiced for the next month's use.</div>
<div>Thank you and I am looking forward to your solution.</div>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
However, I have previously done this and it has not worked. I will sum up again what the situation is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my e-mail address used as both organizational account and separate Microsoft account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If after I enter my e-mail address and password I select "Microsoft Account" from the prompt-window, I get the error message.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if I select "Organizational Account", I *can* log in, but when I go to "Manage my account" (via Office), I get redirected to a page which says that there is no Office account associated with that e-mail address. Hence, I cannot manage my subscription
 and I do clearly need this service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I was more clear now.</p>

    <title>Calculated Field on columns with space in naming - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Calculated Field on columns with space in naming</h2>
                    <p>Hello the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to create a calculated field in a Pivot Table. I want the difference between the values of the fields
<em>Total Cost</em> and <em>InHouseCost </em>that are columns of&nbsp;my database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the calculated fieldname: <em>ExternalCost</em>:</p>
<p>Formula: = Total Cost - InHouseCost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel automatically interprets <em>Total Cost </em>as 'Total Cost' and the formula becomes automatically = 'Total Cost' - InHouseCost</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is due to the space character&nbsp;and I think this creates an error.</p>
<p>Actually, the result of the calculated field is&nbsp;<em>minus InHouseCost.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Ex: </em></p>
<p><em>Total Cost = 10,000</em></p>
<p><em><em>InHouseCost = 8,000</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>Expected ExternalCost = 2,000</em></em></p>
<p><em><em>Value </em></em><em>returned </em><em><em>ExternalCost = -8,000</em></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to work this around or should I just rename the column <em>Total Cost&nbsp;</em>without space character?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Hi there:</p>
<p>I'm affraid you should avoid the blank space. If you still try to display a space, then try using the special character ASCII 255 (type 255 with numeric key pad while holding the 'Alt' key), but it shoul be better to choose a visible character, like the
 underscore '_'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

    <title>I have lost my Contacts in Outlook 2013. How odo I get them back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natureman am  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have lost my Contacts in Outlook 2013. How odo I get them back please&#63; I have tried lots of MS advice to no avail.</h2>
                    I had three versions of my email account in Outlook 2013. I deleted 2. Everything worked fine except I have no Address Book/Contacts!
<br />
<br />
I retrieved the 2 deleted versions of my email account from the Recycle Bin back into Outlook 2013. No Contacts still.
<br />
<br />
Tried \Users\Username\Appdata\Local\Microsoft\OUtlook as advised by MS website. Nothing there.
<br />
<br />
I searched for .pst files and .wab files on my back up disc and only found files from 2007!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I found a .cvs file as LIve Mail Contacts (which I no longer use) but it is 5 months out of date.
<br />
<br />
Why when I delete a duplicate email account does my Address Book go as well?<br />
<br />
I have no idea where my current Contacts in Address Book for OUtlook 2013 have gone and how I can restore them. My business is on hold till I can restore them.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know more details before we proceed:</p>
<p>How were the deleted email accounts setup on Outlook (POP3/IMAP/ Exchange Active Sync or Exchange Server)?</p>
<p>When the email account was removed, did you also remove the Outlook data file setup with it?</p>
<p>Did you search for Outlook data files on the local drive? Maybe the contacts are present in those files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you better.</p>

<p>A related problem.&nbsp; I found my *.ost file in the form *.ost.old&nbsp; I thought I would open it, export Contacts and Calendar and import both to the new file.&nbsp; However, Outlook gives me no options for opening this file other than *.pst.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how

<p>You'll need to provide a lot more information about your specific configuration such as&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) type (POP, IMAP, EAS) account(s) configured</p>
<p>2) Is this a new install versus an in place upgrade of Outlook '2013</p>
<p>3) any other pertinent information of what may have transpired (steps followed, accounts configured and in what sequence etc) on this system</p>
<p>
</p><p>One scenario where it's very easy to lost all contact info is having those stored in the contact folder for an IMAP account which has the "This Computer Only" as part of the description and then deleting the IMAP account in the profile.</p>

</p><p>Hi, I need help-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out Look 2013 using Windows 10 Enterprise</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I had an IMAP account</p>
<p>2. The IMAP account was set to auto archive so all old emails were no longer available
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;I updated my .OST File with all Old emails and Sent files and Contact information so that my existing IMAP account now contained all old information</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I imported my updated OST File into my IMAP Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I created a POP3 account </p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Of course there was no mail in the POP3 Inbox and nothing in the Sent Files</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. BUT I found my contact list completed in the new POP3 Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. I copied the mail from the Inbox of the IMAP into the new inbox of my POP3 account</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. I copied the mail from the Sent Folder of the IMAP account&nbsp;into the new Sent Folder of the POP3 Account</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. I went over the new POP3 account carefully, making sure all email. sent mail and contacts were in place</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. In Outlook 2013 I went to&nbsp;File/Account Settings then selected the IMAP account and deleted it&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. I returned to the POP3 account and my contact list was gone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need it back what can I do? </p>

<p>
</p><p>There is something seriously missing in your description in your points #7 / both #10's and #11 - very specifically</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - &lt;IF&gt; your contacts were actually contained in the folder tree for the PST file associated with the POP3 account - then there is no way those would have been deleted in Item 10b - just wouldn't happen (absolutely no IFs ANDs or BUTs)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Adding a POP account would never result in any contacts being "copied over" automatically any other contact folder - also simply would never happen</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what I think happened&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - You still had your IMAP account configured when you added the POP3 account. That would have resulted in the POP3 account using the contacts in the "default data file" for the profile - in this case, most likely in a contact folder with the added words
 "This Computer Only"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#4 - You deleted your IMAP account which would have also removed/deleted the OST file for the account where the contacts were stored</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above is true - you are unfortunately out of luck unless you have a back up of your contacts in something other then an .OST file. If you have an orphaned .OST file with your contacts, you'll need a 3rd party OST2PST conversion tool</p>

 it does still not allow to to create the new notebook but I don't have existing notebook to try. This is account using office 365 online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have another account with the MS office desktop on my laptop but the iPhone version doesn't have option to switch that account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi J-H-J,<br />
<br />
To create a new notebook with the OneNote for iOS application, we can touch the More options icon at the top left corner and select Create New Notebook. To switch your accounts, please select the Settings icon like a gear &gt; ACCOUNT &gt; access the current account
 &gt; Remove Account. Then log into the app with another account (Office 365 account or Microsoft account). If we log into the Work/school account, the new notebook will be synced to OneDrive for Business. If we log into with a Microsoft account, the notebooks
 will be synced to personal OneDrive. &nbsp;<br />

<br />
For the issue about â€œnot active accept typing when creating nameâ€, I would suggest you change the network connection on your iPhone or reinstall the app to see if the issue can be fixed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Franklin,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>The issue may be related to the app itself. Would you try the following steps first to check the outcome?<br />
1. Remove all Office 365 Mobile apps.<br />
2. Install OneDrive app via Google play store and login with your account first.<br />
3. Install other apps and login with your account.</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any updates.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan</p>

<h2>            Help me get Outlook to open.</h2>
                    I'm trying to go to Outlook from Eudora Pro. When I open Outlook the second screen lists upgrade options and shows Eudora as the only one. After I click on next it just closes, nothing happens at all. I have waited for hours thinking it was working in
 the background, but no. How do I get this to work?

I'm not trying to open Outlook from Eudora.<br />
I have been using Eudora pro and now want to use Outlook. When I open Outlook for the first time the second screen lists upgrade options and shows Eudora as the only one. After I click on next it just closes, nothing happens at all.<br />
<br />
In other words, just like any other email program when you open it for the first time when you have been using another program, Outlook tries to help by importing all your settings and folders for you so you don't have to spend six months doing it manually.
<br />
<br />
However every time I try, Outlook just closes.<br />
<br />
I purchased Office 2010 professional specifically for Outlook, otherwise I could have saved a lot of money and just went with home and student.
<br />
<br />
In case anyone is wondering, I cannot just start Outlook and then manually move everything over from Eudora. I am well over my prime and have been using Eudora for over 25 years. I couldn't remember my passwords if my life depended on it, and I really don't
 want to try manually moving 25 years worth of emails and folders with all the pictures of grandkids and all.<br />

<h2>            Slide sorter display malfunctioning</h2>

            <p>I've seen this problem (typically in Word on my PC) and believe it's a screen refresh problem.&nbsp; Consider disabling graphics hardware acceleration:

Does this happen with all presentations or just one/some?
<div>Do you have a 64-bit version of Office, or is it 32-bit?<br />
<div><br />
<div>A couple of things to try. &nbsp;After each, have a look at your presentation again to see if there's any improvement.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Change video driver modes; try different resolutions and/or color depths.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Quit PowerPoint if it's running.</div>
<div>Press Ctrl+Alt+Del, click Task Manager, click the Processes tab.</div>
<div>Look for and end any instances of POWERPNT.EXE on the list.</div>
<div>If there were any instances to end, start PPT again and check for problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Quit PPT and restart in Safe Mode. &nbsp;Hold down the CTRL key while you start PPT.</div>
<div>Keep the key down until you see a message box asking if you want to start in safe mode.</div>
<div>Say yes, of course. ;-)</div>
<div>Check again for weirdness.</div>

<p>So I have a user that is using ScanSnap to scan docs directly to their email, it has been working with no issues until the beginning of Feb. Now everytime she scans to email using ScanSnap and sends it out, the email body is blank to the recipient. Although,
 after trying it in safe mode, the email body is present and can be seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what can be the difference between Safe mode and Normal mode that can be causing this issue?</p>

</p><p>I already tried Disabling hardware graphics acceleration which had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 930 phonebook not importing to Honda CRV 15Year Model</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A customer has bought a new 2015 year model CRV. We can connect via Bluetooth ok, but its seems that the phonebook option only works once. For example, turn the car on, phone connects, access the phonebook, import ok. Go off of the phone&nbsp;options on the car
 untit to audio or nav - go back in to phone and&nbsp;it says it is unable to import phonebook??? Any ideas???&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found the HandsFreeLink feature in Honda vehicles to be slightly flakey. &nbsp;Not just with Windows Phones, but with iPhones as well. &nbsp;You mignt want to try to see if you can get your Honda to unpair from your phone and pair it back again. &nbsp;I have a 2014
 Odyssey and we needed to do that with my wife's iPhone 5S. &nbsp;My Lumia Icon never had any problems, but the iPhone did.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. It really does&nbsp;seem quite odd. I am not too familiar with the windows phones as it had a 'drive mode' also. However manipulating this doesn't seem to have any effect. I have unpaired/deleted the phone. Every time it connects you
 can access the phonebook straight away. However if you use any other function then try to re-visit the phonebook option on the unit, it will not import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the drawing board!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would check with the Honda dealer and see if there are any updates available for HandsFreeLink, &nbsp;The only Bluetooth setting on the phone that is car related is with how audio is sent over, which has no impact here. &nbsp;Can you make a call via voice commands?</p>

            <p>Hi chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Making a call is fine. The only problem seems to be with the phonebook only working when you firs access it&nbsp; after the car and phone are connected via Bluetooth. As soon as you try and re-visit the phonebook it has an error message.</p>

            <p>Morning Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have already deleted the phone from the Honda Connect System and re-connected and still no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am more of an iPhone kind of guy and that&nbsp;links in straight away, so I am surprised that this Nokia Lumina 925 doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try and take the Honda&nbsp;UK dealer route and try to resolve that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would the the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Make sure your phone is up-to-date.</p>
<p>2.Make sure your car kit is up-to-date.</p>
<p>3.In your Lumia 930,go to Menu&gt;Bluetooth and use an alternative Bluetooth audio</p>
<p>4.Pair the phone and the car kit igen.</p>
<p>5.You might wanna check the Honda site(Bluetooth compatibility) if they have made any test with Lumia 930.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Luke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Honda's HandsFreeLink, it imports the first 10000 phonebook entries from the phone and stores it. &nbsp;When you go back to the Phonebook, it's pulling the numbers from the car's memory not the phone. &nbsp;If you are getting an error just going back to the phonebook,
 then it sounds like a problem with the Honda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that you try is in the HandsFreeLink Phone settings, turn Automatic Phone Sync to off. &nbsp;That will set HandsFreeLink to not update the call history or phonebook from the phone, only use what is currently stored in HandsFreeLink. &nbsp;If you turn it
 off and no longer get the error message, then the problem is when&nbsp;HandsFreeLink requests updates from the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which phone is it, the Lumia 925 or the Lumia 930? &nbsp;You have mentioned them both. &nbsp;I have a Lumia Icon paired to my 2014 Honda Odyssey. &nbsp;The Icon is basically the Verizon only version of the 930 and has the same Bluetooth radio. &nbsp;I can't imagine that&nbsp;HandsFreeLink
 changed dramatically between 2014 and 2015, but it may have.</p>
