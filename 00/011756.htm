<h2>            Office 2016 OneDrive for Business unable to connect to a sharepoint site</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded Office 2013 to Office 2016, everything seems to be working fine except for OneDrive.</p>
<p>When I try to sync it , it gives an error "The server you are trying to access is using an authentication protocol not supported by this version of Office".</p>
<p>I can access the sharepoint site from microsoft edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have cleared the onedrive cache and installed the latest Office 2016 patches.</p>
<p>Any fix?</p>

<p>Hi Rene,</p>
<p>The procedure you're telling me to do is basically reinstalling the Office 2013 from the Office 365 portal, correct?</p>

<p>Hi Exch2013Exch2013,</p>
<p>Rene’s suggestion is to re-install Office 2016 to see whether there is any improvement.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm whether you are in the scenario like
this thread. If so, some community members solved this issue using Pstoric’s method, could you also try it to see the outcome?</p>
<p>If it is not this scenario, please update us with some more detailed information for our further troubleshooting. Some related screenshots will be highly appreciated. To insert a screenshot, please click on

<p>I had the same problem, Now got clean Windows 10 and Office 2016 installation (Office 2016 downloaded from my Office 365 Personal subscription). OneDrive works fine.
</p>
<p>BUT - using my Office 365 Business Essentials subscription tried to install OneDrive for Business.
</p>
<p>I am not able to install as installer says I have newer version of Office!</p>
<p>Is there any way to solve it?</p>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>Yes my issue is the same as the link to a thread you posted. I have tried Pstoric's method and it did not work. Well I guess I just have to wait for a fix from Microsoft. Oh by the way I installed Office 2016 ProPlus deployed from Config Manager. I'll be
 postponing the deployment to end users until a fix became available.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac version 15.19.1 iCloud email authentication problem</h2>
                    <p>My iCloud email @me.com was working fine until Outlook for Mac updated to version 15.19.1. Since then it will not synchronise with the server returning this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server for account "Me" returned the error "[AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Authentication failed." Your username/password or security settings may be incorrect. Would you like to try re-entering your password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing my user name to just the prefix (dropping the @me.com) as suggested elsewhere, but this hasn't fixed the issue. All my other settings for incoming and outgoing servers are as recommended here https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2648915</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something has clearly changed in the latest update...help!!!</p>

</p><p>I had the same issue where my iCloud account set up as iMAP would not send out email, returned an error message, "5.7.8 Bad username or password (Authentication failed)". &nbsp;I had just installed the Outlook upgrade a week or so ago (15.19.1) and then a new
 upgrade for El Capitan (10.11.4) a few days after that. &nbsp;I first noticed the issue when I realized I was not receiving iCloud emails to my MAC outlook account that I was sending and receiving from my iPhone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending 6 to 7 hours of my life I will never get back putting in my apple password, which I was relentlessly asked, deleting and opening a new iCloud account, changing my apple password, doing inordinate amount of research on this board and many other
 sources, I took a piece of advice from a related, older issue with outlook for mail, specifically eliminating the 2 step verification process for iCloud email in my Outlook account. &nbsp;This seems to be an issue when using iMap account set up with ICloud email
 in Outlook for Mac 2016. &nbsp; Not sure why as I did not have this problem prior to this Outlook for Mac version and recent update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, turn off the 2 step verification process to fix this specific issue.</p>

            If it is just Check Spelling As You Type that isn't working, check to make sure that "Hide spelling errors in this document" isn't enabled. It's a very long shot nowadays, but when CSAYT was first introduced, "Hide..." was automatically turned on in all
 older/previously created documents. I still sometimes encounter it in very old .doc files.

            Hi DarrellFunchess  
<br />there is no option to print the saved passwords (security issue?) but you can view them or back them up using the credential manager
<br />click start, type credential and select credential manager from the results
<br />click on the site you want to see the password for and then click show
<br />you will be asked for your windows password to verify that it is you, then the site password will be displayed.
<br />to back them up click on windows credentials then click backup credentials.

            Hi DarrellFunchess 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />You can not print a windows username and password for security reasons.
<br />But you can view username and passwords for web sites in a program called credential manager.
<br />If you go to search type credential manager.
<br />From there you will see your stored username and passwords for websites.
<br />
<br />There is a programs like Keepass that you can use to store all your credentials in a central location.  I use this myself.

    <title>No Virgin Media&#47;NTLWorld Bin in Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silverpulser  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Virgin Media&#47;NTLWorld Bin in Folders</h2>
                    <p>I have build 10074 with the Outlook Mail/Calendar App. One problem that is irritating me to death is that the folders do not seem to sync exactly the same. The main problem being how deleted items are dealt with by the Outlook Mail App. When I delete a message
 from the Inbox on Outlook it goes into a Deleted Items folder and not into the Bin, as t does when I use the Virgin Media web mail. This means that to remove&nbsp;the items forever I have to go into the Virgin Media web mail and delete the items that have been
 moved to the Deleted Items folder by Outlook so that they are then moved to the Bin, where they can be deleted forever. I cannot see any way to make Outlook move deleted items directly to the Bin and as there is no Bin folder visible in Outlook&nbsp;I cannot Move
 them to the Bin either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, Live Mail does not suffer with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anybody.</p>

<p>Hi PCMan 365,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You &nbsp;can change the complexity password requirements in Azure AD B2C, if you have this kind of subscription in your organization. For your reference&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-password-complexity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-reference-password-complexity</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, &nbsp;you can use powershell to set it up: &nbsp;Get-MsolUser | Set-MsolUser -StrongPasswordRequired $false. &nbsp;You can see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.protosoft.com/tricksheet/how-to-disable-password-expiry-and-password-complexity-rules-in-office-365/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.protosoft.com/tricksheet/how-to-disable-password-expiry-and-password-complexity-rules-in-office-365/</a></p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer. But that's not my question / goal, maybe i'm not explain the existing environment before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Existing Now:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm already&nbsp; run <strong><em>"</em></strong><span><strong><em>Get-MsolUser | Set-MsolUser -StrongPasswordRequired $false"</em></strong><em>.</em> But when user want change password using web GUI (Office 365 portal)
<strong><em>menu settings - change password</em></strong>, but like it doesn't apply.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e609e4a8-e6de-4439-bada-c9ffb498d902?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e609e4a8-e6de-4439-bada-c9ffb498d902?upload=true" /></a></li><li>But when i change using powershell using simple password it can be set and applied to user.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>Set-</strong></em><em><strong>MsolUserPassword -UserPrincipalName *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -NewPassword "cd123456" -ForceChangePassword $false</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So My Question is why when i'm already set strong password false to all users but when user want to change it on menu change password (web gui) "like picture on point 1".&nbsp;strong passwords are still needed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>From the picture you provided, the password for Office 365 web UI is required for strong password, and we cannot change the password requirements for Office 365 Web UI ( like signing into Office 365 portal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The powershell command as far as I know it is used for users passwords in Auzre AD , not Office 365 portal. They are totally two different scopes.</p>

<p>I think this page has the direct answer to your question:</p>
<p>https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/the-academy/journaling-with-onenote/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there are lots more calendar templates for Word and Excel on the web than for OneNote.&nbsp; Try googling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following links have templates or tell how to create templates that you may be able to adapt for your specific need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Onetastic is a tool that is recommended by many users. Here is their monthly template:</p>
<p>https://getonetastic.com/macroland&amp;id=D2FDC7FB1940482386EACA5B74B0AFBC</p>
<p>You may be able to massage it to create a daily version. You could also submit a comment asking for your specific design. They are pretty responsive and may do it for you.</p>

</strong>One of the popular uses of Excel is to maintain a list of events, appointments or other calendar related stuff. While Excel shines easily when you want to log this data, it has no quick way to visualize this information. But we can use little creativity,
 conditional formatting, few formulas &amp; 3 lines of VBA code to create a slick, interactive calendar in Excel. Today, lets understand how to do this.</span></p>

</p><p>I've created a form which is fine but I have selected the 'choice' option and its created a drop down list.&nbsp; This is perfect but when I try to create another drop down via 'choice' if only allows me to select radio buttons as a option rather than a drop
 down lists.&nbsp; See below question one which is how I want the choice to look.&nbsp; However, every other time I try to recreate this it only offers radio buttons .&nbsp; Can someone help?</p>

            I would avoid Msft Forms - as you can see, Msft doesn't seem to know much about them. It's their rather poor attempt to copy the Google docs forms concept ( a form based on a spreadsheet) but as usual with Msft has far more limitations and problems. If
 you need a SP form, create a list.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to deploy Skype for Business 2016 via SCCM.</p>
<p>I'm trying to download only the Skype installation through Office Deployment Tool 2016 but I can't. It downloads 1.7 GB. I'm using this configuration:</p>

&lt;Product ID="SkypeforBusinessEntryRetail"&gt;<br />

&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good to know you have modified the xml file and are able to install Skype for Business. Regarding the activation question, you need to sign in with Office 365 work or school to activate Office to use. If the issue persists after the activation, please raise
 a new thread in our forum for proper handling.</p>

 the "O365ProPlusRetail".. I've try this one:</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;<br />
&lt;Add SourcePath="\\server\SkypeforBusiness_2016_x32bit" OfficeClientEdition="32" Branch="Current"&gt;<br />
&lt;Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail"&gt;<br />
&lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Access" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Excel" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Groove" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="InfoPath" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="OneDrive" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="OneNote" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Outlook" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="PowerPoint" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Project" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Publisher" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="SharePointDesigner" /&gt;<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Visio"<br />
&lt;ExcludeApp ID="Word" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&lt;/Add&gt;<br />
&lt;Updates Enabled="FALSE" /&gt;<br />
&lt;Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" /&gt;<br />
&lt;Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="0" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this one:</p>
<p>&lt;Configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Add SourcePath="\\server\SkypeforBusiness_2016_x32bit" OfficeClientEdition="32" Channel="Monthly"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Product ID="SkypeforBusinessRetail"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Language ID="en-us"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Product&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Add&gt;<br />
&lt;/Configuration&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>with no luck.... I'm using my work email (I have Skype license) but the activation pop-up keeps appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kostas</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Who is your email service provider?<br />
2. Does the issue occur only when you are using Internet Explorer?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
4. Which version of Internet Explorer is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

            <p>I have the exact same problem, and it's random, I haven't found a pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, selecting the next song works, but when it stops working, you can never resume the current song.
</p>
<p>Sometimes it works even after a long time pause (at first I thought it was the problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another random problem is when it seems to loose the media keys bindings. The play / pause /&nbsp; next keyboard media keys doesn't work. And then they work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm finding a lot of random issues with Groove Music at the moment. </p>

            <p>We are 18 months out since your inquiry..........I will be putting a fresh one to take this up if no one replies to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kind of a problem should not exist......adding favorites and accessing them from any device........simple to get your Internet organized - a basic need in an Internet age that Windows CANNOT AND REFUSES TO PROVIDE.</p>
<p>I hope your Yippy-yi-yo...........meant wt window is this? No sync of favorites in IE 11 via the 2 most recent versions- Windows 7 &amp; 8 cannot do so.........!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Anil states&nbsp;and I agree our&nbsp;Microsoft account user profile resides in the cloud; then why can't Windows 7 IE11 Explorer sync those favorites in Windows 7 or Windows Mobile or Windows 8.1...........7 &amp; 8 are the two most recent platforms and being currently
 supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this inquiry does not get ignored for a basic feature so essential ..........</p>
<p>If no reply then I will start a fresh one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone from Microsoft notices this feed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to anyone and everyone who can add comments and options to get this going.</p>

Reloading an old computer again and looking for a way to actually get some use out of IE11....Guess I'm off to download Chrome again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The #1 reason I use Chrome is this feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I log in from anywhere on any computer/tablet/anything
 with a Chrome browser and Viola! - All my settings/bookmarks/history/everything - is right there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really thought that maybe Edge would have done this too - on my other computer with Windows10 - but it crashes so much from heaven knows what that I abandoned Edge for Chrome again on that computer....without any problems.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2007- Enter Network Password Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psu curt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007- Enter Network Password Problem</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I'm using Office 2007 Pro Outlook 7 with Windows 7 to access email from my Verizon.net FIOS account.&nbsp; Just today it has started popping up a window that reads "Enter Network Password" and requesting the user name / password (pre-filled).&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't matter
 if I click OK or Cancel; the window keeps popping up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Outlook won't receive emails and I can't get past that to send email.&nbsp; I CAN access my email on the Verizon Webmail site using my Verizon account - and the passwords match on Verizon and Outlook. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I update Windows and Office as new updates occur.&nbsp; I run MS Security Essentials and Malware Bytes weekly.&nbsp; I've gone thru the various forums and suggestions, beginning with MS Mr. Fix-It; and followed all 3 suggestions in Microsoft Knowledge Base article
 290684.&nbsp; I tried to change the ports for SSL success.&nbsp; I even did a restore to yesterday when I know it was working - no luck.
</p>
<p>This just started today and I don't know what else to try.&nbsp; Any suggestions??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>After about 2 hrs in chat with Verizon, I finally got it fixed.&nbsp; Try this:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Make sure your system is <u>CLEAN</u> - run a Registry&nbsp;Cleaner as well as up-to-date Anti-Virus &amp; Malware Security.&nbsp; I use&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials&nbsp;&amp; Malware Bytes (free), but there are others&nbsp;on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;Re-Boot&nbsp;your system in Safe Mode with Network </p>
<p>&gt; Turn-off your Firewall &amp; Security protocols &nbsp; </p>
<p>&gt; Go into Verizon and change your Password </p>
<p>&gt; Go into Outlook and delete your account</p>
<p>&gt; Re-build the account with the new Password </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; Manually enter the Server Access Information - Auto-Detect of the Server Setting won't work
</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;On the&nbsp;Internet Email Settings screen fill in&nbsp;the information and select More Settings</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;On the Advanced Tab </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incoming POP3 Port is 995</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the Server Requires Encrypyted Connections (SSL) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outgoing SMTP port is 465</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the following type of Encrypted Conncection - pick SSL from the drop-down box
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check Leave a copy of the Messages on the Server </p>
<p>&gt; Click OK - Next - Finish&nbsp; </p>
<p>&gt; Close &amp; re-start Outlook </p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;Go into Verizon Webmail &amp; send yourself a test message to make sure it works
</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-boot your system in normal mode and restore the Firewall and Security &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After much trial-&amp;-Error, this is what finally worked for me.&nbsp; If it's still doesn't fix your problem, get into a Chat with Verizon Suport.&nbsp; The problem is&nbsp;that Outlook will not recognize or cannot find the Verizon Server settings.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Luck!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have beta tested AOL and those of us that used Security Essentials found that turning off real time protection speeded up the install process.</p>
<p>I had forgotten about that with Defender, but will try it with the next build.</p>

<h2>            Blocking stolen phones ...</h2>
                    Hi, I recently sold a Nokia N73 on eBay and was paid by cheque but it seems that the cheque may not have cleared and I have already sent the phone, I have the IMEI for the phone but it is unlocked and I was wondering if this would be a problem - it was
 locked to T-mobile but I paid the fee to get it unlocked - if I contact T-mobile will they still be able to block the phone?<br />
Also is it possible for the person to change the IMEI of the phone - I have heard that it is possible to do this with some phones and I guess if they do this I won't be able to do anything about it.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Matt

            If you've got the IMEI number, you should contact Tmobile asap, it can be blocked, depending on how long ago you sent it, it could be worth saying you'd swapped phones for a while and went to swap it back, and realised it had been pinched or something
 like that.

If they're told the truth, there's a good chance they'll just advise to contact the Police, who will be able to look into it, but will probably take time.

            report it to the police, they will also block the imei number, when people are arrested the imei numbers of all phones they have are checked against blacklisting.<br />
