    <title>unstable connection of Outlook 2013 to Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unstable connection of Outlook 2013 to Exchange</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 2013 to connect to&nbsp;my university-sponsored Office365 Exchange account.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use three different PCs all running Windows 8.1&nbsp;(a desktop PC, a laptop, and a tablet) to connect to this account.&nbsp; On two devices this works perfectly. But on the tablet
 the connection works forma few hours, after which Outlook disconnects from &nbsp;Exchange and will never reconnect again, even if Windows is shut&nbsp;down and restarted. When this happens I delete the email account and recreate the account. This will establish a connection
 with Exchange which will access email, etc. for a few hours, after Outlook announces that it is disconnected and once again, no connection can be established again.&nbsp; What is the problem. FYI, the tablet is a Dell Venue 8 Pro.</p>

    <title>Battery authetication code failure-any suggestions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustyacd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery authetication code failure-any suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new Nokia 2630 phone, together with the battery, headset, user manual etc. The purchase was made in one of the established retail shops in Zagreb, Croatia, which is supplied through the authorized dealer and servicer of Nokia
 for Croatia.<br />
<br />
Following guidance on the official Nokia web site, I wanted to authenticate if the battery inside the purchased phone was genuine, however, upon repeated attempts, I kept getting the failure message that the code could not have been authenticated: "Authentication
 Unsuccessful: Invalid 20-digit code"<br />
<br />
The battery does, however, bear the hologram label, which appears to be authentic.<br />
<br />
I then took the phone to the dealer, who were only too unable and unwilling to try and authenticate the battery code; instead, I got an unpleasant reply that "everything is ok with the battery, because it says it's Nokia, therefore, it must be genuine"! Needless
 to say, the authentication was made just by visual inspection of the battery. On my refusal to accept such an unprofessional explanation, I was being persuaded that the authentication code failure doesn't mean that the battery is fake, and that it actually
 doesn't matter if the code passed the authentication or not. Furthermore, I was told that due to the relatively fresh date of manufacture, the code might have not been uploaded to Nokia's web site yet (I seriously doubt that this is done manually, therefore
 refuse to believe this statement)!<br />
<br />
Another issue was the FCC code inside the phone, underneath the battery. Previous Nokia I've owned, had the label with FCC code clearly visible, and was traceable, too; however, this new one lacks the FCC code on the label inside. Is it necessary for the phone
 to have such FCC code stated on the label, and is there a way that can I find out why it's lacking on this phone?<br />
<br />
As you can see, there's basically nothiing I can do from here, so I sent an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, as suggested, but haven't received any reply so far. I was wondering has anyone had a similar problem, and how did you go about it?<br />
<br />
I am willing to explore every option possible to clarify this situation, because I don't feel comfortable bearing in mind that there is a possibility of non-original battery being sold to me under the Nokia license.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice!

IMHO Highely unlikely that your phone/battery is a fake.<br />
<br />
If your still worried post up a picture of the label under your battery and I will compare with Nokia 2630s that I am going to buy.

            Thanks, mate;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how much help they would be, but I tried to take some close-ups of the phone and the battery, small letters are illegible, unfortunately, the camera I have is pretty basic stuff...<br />
Anyway, I haven't heard from that email service they have, but I did however write a letter and sent it directly to Head Office in Finland-no joy from them either...Strangely enough, recently, there's no battery code check feature on Nokia's web page anymore
 lol :) just instructions on how to check the hologram...<br />
<br />
If you can figure out anything from the photos, please respond!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! Cheers!<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Thanks for going to the effort, mate.<br />
<br />
For solving the question of fake/real the pics are very helpful but...... Unfortunately I have not yet purchased the two Nokia 2630s that I had on my wish list.<br />
If I do get them will ensure to post a comparison on this thread.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I hope someone else with a 2630 passes by to give their opinion.<br />
<br />
With the battery presumably the talk time and standyby time would be less then an authentic one. So probably a good idea to compare that with the stats for BL-4B.

<h2>            Hard disk latency&#47;poor performance</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
I've been running the preview since October, and the only major lasting issue has been the bizarre hard disk performance. I find that the disk (a 500gb WD Blue connected to my Dell Inspiron 1545 via SATA II) idles just fine, but under load it often jumps up
 to massively high response time. As in ~5ms jumping to 2000ms or more. This obviously locks up the system for many minutes until it drops down to the baseline.<br />
I figured it was just a failing drive, so I replaced it with another copy of the same model and the results are the same. Same with a clean reinstall.<br />
Can anyone give me a hand?<br />
Simon

    <title>Magic Mouse in Excel 2016 Not So Magic - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Magic Mouse in Excel 2016 Not So Magic</h2>
                    Does anyone have any solution to the issue with the wireless mouse in Excel 2016? I have a great deal of trouble with the mouse click in Excel. I have to move the mouse out of the cell I'm working in, click on a cell far away from it several times, and
 then come back and try it again. it's really very frustrating and a complete productivity killer. So distracting and anxiety-provoking.&nbsp;I saw another thread that mentions this issue, but no good suggestions other than using a different mouse... does anyone
 know of a fix for this? Thanks...

<p>You have&nbsp;turned on the &nbsp;lockscreen pass code on the phone. After failed attempts to enter your pass code the phone locks. Each time you try and enter the wrong pass code more minutes are added to the lock.

<p>Hi Exchange_Engineer_4L,</p>
<p>
</p><p>IP reputation filter in Office 365 will check the tenant allow list, tenant block list first, and then the Global exclusion list etc. I suggest you Whitelisting the IP to see if it works fine since the send is blocked by the third party Internet Blacklist
 group. However, since the sender is flagged in Blacklist for some reason, I think you can advice them to delist themselves from the blacklist following the requirement of that third party group. Which is better for the security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<h3> todd_wcimaging.com  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana responds from all my devices when I say Hey Cortona</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows Community-</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC and Phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love they Hey Cortana feature. My problem is that I have a work, home, Windows Phone and Surface Book. So when I say "Hey Cortana"&nbsp;usually more than one device responds, making it unusable. A solution would be turn off all other devices each time I enter
 my office or home or living room but this become irritating. Or I could disable Hey Cortana from the other devices. Not your fault, but is there a better way to get the device you want to respond?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution 1)</p>
<p>Hey Cortana Surface</p>
<p>Hey Cortana Office</p>
<p>Hey Cortana Home</p>
<p>Hey Cortana Mobile or Phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only accounts for my devices but I have my wife on a Surface 3 and Windows Phone as well. Luckily we trained her to her only our voices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution2)</p>
<p>Another solution what about Windows 10 devices be aware of the other device that are nearby based on geolocation. If there was a setting that has rules for Hey Cortana.&nbsp; Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Geolocation Rule: If multiple devices available and its my voice, Work PC&nbsp;only respond, if only one device present please respond. Environment: Ignore Surface Book and Windows Phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kitchen&nbsp;Geolocation Rule: If multiple devices available and its my voice,&nbsp;Surface PC&nbsp;only respond, if only one device present please respond. Environment: Ignore Windows Phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Living Room Geolocation Rule: If multiple devices available and its my voice,&nbsp;Surface Book PC&nbsp;only respond, if only one device present please respond. Environment:&nbsp;Windows Phone&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution 3)</p>
<p>Windows Device Awareness- If multiple devices are present only respond to the device that's active or currently being used. Environment: I'm surfing the web on a Surface Book,. When I say Hey&nbsp;Cortana only Surface Book responds. Windows 10 Phone ignore. &nbsp;</p>

            I was just explaining this exact same issue to someone this morning and was thinking that some type of rule system for Cortana would be great. &nbsp;It's so annoying when my desktop PC, Surface, and Windows phone all try to respond at the same time when I say
 Hey Cortana. &nbsp;And now with Cortana on Xbox it's going to add another listener in the room. &nbsp;It would be very annoying to have to turn off the devices manually when you don't want some of them to be listening. &nbsp;You would think that someone at Microsoft would
 have already experienced this. Hopefully a solution will happen soon.

 is an issue that should be easily remedied.</p>

<p>Hi Chau,<br />
<br />
To clarify, a tenant is an Office 365 work or school account, but abc.com and xyz.com are domains that can be added into the Office 365 work or school account and can be set as the suffix of user accounts. We can add many domains into one Office 365 work or
 school account, and all those domains will be managed by the global admin.<br />
<br />
Given the situation, it's not feasible to separate two domains in each admin page under the same Office 365 work or school account.<br />
<br />
The admin roles under the same tenant in Office 365 are divided depending on different services rather than domains. If they are divided based on domains, we aren't able to manage all the users at a time. If you want to achieve the requirement, you need to
 sign up for another Office 365 work or school account and delete the corresponding domain domains from the previous one, then add it and the corresponding admin &amp; users into the new Office 365 work or school account.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Cannot access my Skype account</h2>
                    I've been using my Skype account for years and I have 1 paid monthly subscription attached to that account. Today I couldn't&nbsp;access my account as Skype asked me to enter Microsoft credentials, which I never had and never associated Skype with microsoft
 account. Now my usual password for Skype doesn't work. I've tried to recover my password using email address associated with the skype account, but it didn't accept it since this email was never associated with Microsoft account (only with SKype). Now, I have
 lost my Skype account, I've lost all contacts and, moreover, I am now paying for the services (paid subscription), which I cannot use AND cannot even cancel. There is no answer to my questions anywhere on the Micosoft or Skype help page, I cannot contact support
 since there are no contacts anymore. Where can I get help?

    <title>On exit available with content controls&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lenny33  say:</h3>
<h2>            On exit available with content controls&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a form template that was created in Office 2003 using form fields in protected sections of the document.&nbsp; One of the fields is a dropdown which drives the insertion of text in two other fields as well as a UserForm and MsgBox with Select Case macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am migrating my engineering documents into 2010.&nbsp; Depending on the type of form, I will be leaving the form fields and vb alone.&nbsp; Others, because or requirements to use most of the functionality of Word, am migrating to content controls and read-only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, in a test document, I am able to replicate the dropdowns, bookmarks and default text, however, one of the vb fields references an On Exit Macro.... is there a way to reference the macro so it pulls up the select case entries from the content control?&nbsp;
 I have not been very successful in Googling a direct answer to this, if it can be done at all....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clarification please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards - Lenny33</p>

            Content controls don't have exit macros in the same way as legacy form fields. Instead, there is a Document_ContentControlOnExit event that fires whenever the focus exits from any content control anywhere in the document. The handler for the event has
 a standard set of arguments that Word populates when the event fires, and the first argument is the control that was just exited.<br />
<br />
A good description with sample code is at <a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/insert_content_with_content_controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/insert_content_with_content_controls.html</a>.<br />
<br />
I'm not quite sure what you mean by "the select case entries from the content control". If you're dealing with a combo box or list box content control, your code can use the passed-in content control argument to get the item the user selected.<br />
