<h2>            Selecting&#47;highlighting more than one drawing, using iPad Pro 4 running the windows 365 app Microsoft Word and Apple Pencil</h2>
                    <p>Context:&nbsp; Using iPad Pro 4 running the windows 365 app Microsoft Word, creating multiple drawings with the apple pencil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:&nbsp; The app only allows you to select one drawing item at a time.&nbsp; Using the cmd + A highlights all (Text and Drawings) however you cannot deselect a single drawing, they all deselect.&nbsp; Holding cmd and screen tapping also fails to highlight multiple
 drawings, same with Shift, Ctrl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate anyone who knows the solution or has experienced the same.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information you provided. With the current design of Microsoft Word, the option you're referring to is not yet available. The feature you are inquiring about is really a good idea and would be a great feature to have.

<h2>            No mouse functionality with Modern UI apps</h2>
                    <p>I'm not on the latest build(having issue with build updater--will do this manually), but this shouldn't occur regardless.</p>
<p>Standard .exe applications work well. Modern UI apps somehow remove mouse functionality and force me to use keyboard keys, DOS style. Sometimes teh apps lose focus all together, and I have to alt-tab to them. Anyone experiencing this?</p>

<h3> jon_claridatacorp.com  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 links not opening.  Not previously answered in this forum</h2>
                    <p>First, let me say that I have searched this forum and went through 7 pages of postings.</p>
<p>This is not a file association problem.</p>
<p>This is not an "Operation has been cancelled problem"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get an email in my inbox.&nbsp; It has a hyperlink in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hover over the link and the full link is displayed in a small dialog box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>for example:&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=outlook+links&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Office&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=outlook&amp;askingquestion=true">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=outlook+links&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Office&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=outlook&amp;askingquestion=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on it, the typical file association box comes up saying "cannot open Search?SearchTerm=outlook+links&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Office&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=outlook&amp;askingquestion=true"&nbsp; Do I want to select a program or use the web to find a program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every link that I click on always truncates the link after the last forward slash ( / ) and then cannot open it.&nbsp; Another example:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/subscriber/help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/subscriber/help</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; becomes JUST help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not any program that opens a file called help with no extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that clicking on the link tries to open a truncated (shortened) link that only includes the link text after the last forward slash in the link.</p>

            <p>The joke was on me.&nbsp; Since I could just click on links in Windows Live Mail and they would open, and I could click on them in Word, Excel,&nbsp;&nbsp; I ASSUMED that it was not a file association problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The operating System is Windows 7 premium with Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solutions was to go and adjust the UAC User access control setting to the minimum.&nbsp; Reboot the computer.&nbsp; Then go into the default programs area and set some additional program defaults. Cannot remember exactly which ones but I was amazed when I saw
 what the settings were.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I was amazed when I could open links in every program but Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Guruprasad Ra for the replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I had booted Outlook in safe mode.&nbsp; </p>

<p>With a bit of dificulty.</p>
<p>The addressbook is relatively easy. Simply export as a CSV file and import that in Outlook.</p>
<p>Emails are a whole different ballgame. Not having Office 2010, will Outlook 2010 still import from Eudora?</p>
<p>If so you need to download and install it, and copy the mailbox files WITHOUT extensions into the Eudora folder, open each one within Eudora to create the index files and then import in Outlook.</p>
<p>Unless anyone knows of any other way, good luck!</p>

    <title>Pasting text into new template overrides template - how to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pasting text into new template overrides template - how to fix&#47;avoid&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2010 on a Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; This is my first time posting to this community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be specific:&nbsp; I created my own template for printing recipes.&nbsp; I can print a recipe onto 8 1/2" x 11" cardstock, then cut it into a 4" x 6' card.&nbsp; I can print two cards on one piece of cardstock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set the page layout, margins, and text formatting so everything fits, and prints correctly.&nbsp; I've even set up mirrored margins, to print the back side of the recipe card and have it print in the right place.&nbsp; I use several different styles, including
 a modified Heading 2, Heading 3 and Heading 4, and my own Body Single and Default Text styles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the problem:</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll save several recipes from the internet in one single standard (default Normal.dotm) Word document.&nbsp; I will apply my styles as noted above.&nbsp; The formatting may not be the same (I may have chosen a different font and text size for Heading 2,
 for example), but the style names are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, when I want to print one of the saved recipes, I'll copy just that text from the original file (standard &lt;ctrl&gt;+C).&nbsp; I'll open a new document with my recipe card template.&nbsp; But when I paste the text into the new document, the margins of the new template
 are overridden by the old margins.&nbsp; In other words, I don't have a 4x6 card layout, I have an 8 1/2" x 11" layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should be able to copy the text into the new template, and have it look exactly as if I'd typed the text into the page manually.&nbsp; Setting up the correct margins took a LOT of time, and the whole point of the template was to remove that need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I prevent the old information from overriding the new template?&nbsp; I don't want to lose all the formatting, or I'd just paste it into Notepad first.&nbsp; I want to EASILY paste the text into the new template and have it look right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be glad to attach or send sample files if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, all!</p>

            <p>There are two things you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>In File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced, under the "Cut, copy, paste" heading, make sure the option for "Pasting between documents when style definitions conflict" is set to "Use Destination Styles (Default)". It probably is set that way, but check it anyway.</li><li>When copying from the first document to the second document, be careful <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not to include any section breaks or the final paragraph mark of the document.</span> To be able to see and avoid those things, turn on nonprinting characters by clicking the ¶ button on the Home tab. It's in those places that Word stores the information from
 the Page Layout dialog (paper size, margins, etc.), and copying them from one document to another will override the destination's settings.</li></ul>

<h2>            Excel not able to save to OneDrive</h2>
                    I am on 16.24 (190318) and starting with the last previous update, Excel won't let me save new files to OneDrive and won't let me change existing files in OneDrive. &nbsp;The alert message is "Document not saved". If I open an existing file from OneDrive, it
 opens in a "read-only" mode. &nbsp;Accordingly, the AutoSave feature won't engage due to this. &nbsp;This only happens in Excel -- PowerPoint and Word can save to OneDrive (new and existing files) without issues. &nbsp;And as another person wrote, OneNote is not syncing.

<p>Usually it would pop a bar at the top of the page to allow editing. If it isn't showing there, it sounds like some issue with file access. If you download a local copy of the file from OneDrive before opening it, does that allow you to make edits?</p>

<p>Downloading to my mac and saving it locally works as it should. &nbsp;After saving it locally, if I try to upload it back to OneDrive as a new file name, I get the same error. &nbsp;To note, saving to OneDrive was not an issue a couple of builds ago so something must
 have changed during the build (I have been using the same OneDrive folder for a couple of years now).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other point is that for files that were in the same OneDrive a week ago, I can open it from there and it will save via AutoSave.</p>

<p>After additional testing, I found that this issue only happens with files in a specific folder. &nbsp;If I create a new folder, then the issue disappears. &nbsp;Normally, you see issues like this on local drives if a sector of the disk is corrupted but as this is
 in the cloud, I would not have expected it. &nbsp;Thinking deleting the folder and emptying the recycle in OneDrive would not solve the issue. &nbsp;After emptying the recycle, if I create the folder with the same name in the same location, I get this issue.</p>

    <title>Install applications manually to Nokia Lumia 820 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kasunchaturanga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install applications manually to Nokia Lumia 820</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to know how can I download programs via my computer and install it to the Nokia Lumia 820. I don't have a wireless connection. So I can't log on to the internet using my phone. All what I want to know is that, how to install a software which has been
 downloaded from a computer and install in to the phone? <br />
<br />
Is there any particular way to install the softwares using the computer while phone has been connected to the computer? I'm so exhausted about finding these things. I don't have a SD card. So I have copied the downloaded .XAP file in to the document folder
 (in phone) and couldn't even find the documents as well using the phone. <br />
<br />
Please note that I'm a new comer to this Windows Mobile. So could you please provide me guidance to get rid of bad experiences.<br />
<br />
Thank you! <br />

<h2>            Windows Installer and Cleanup Tool</h2>
                    I ran the Windows Installer and Cleanup tool and it has trashed my Office 2007 Suite.&nbsp; Though it has not uninstalled the apps, they will not start and give various error messages from 'Not enough memory to run this application ...' to "xxx_app failed to
 start correctly last time. Starting xxx_app in safe mode will help you ..."<br />
Of course, it will not even start in safe mode. <br />
<br />
MS has since, and wisely, removed this from its site. But, the damage is already done. So, is there a place where I can download the product again, as I still have the keys but not the CDs, or is there a known work around for this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ... not thanks MS. But, to anyone who knows something about this.

http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also for reference, other victims of this failed utility may find it easier to do what I did, and locate the link to the Office 2007 download, enter your CD key, download the product and
 reinstall it.&nbsp; Cheers, mate. <br />

                    I am having trouble viewing all of my calendar entries. When I open my LIST VIEW ...
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">all </span>my appointments are visible. But ... when I open the CALENDAR VIEW ... all items
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">except </span>recurring appointments have disappeared.
<br />
I have searched and searched several help sites and several forums. I have wasted so much time! Please can you help!?<br />
Kind regards Andrea L<br />

            I did try your suggestion ... and no luck ... BUT ...<br />
This may well be the RIGHT FIX ... because I actually worked out that I had 3 calendars listed ... due to copying from old computer. Once I had deleted the incorrect calendars (after copying all necessary info to the default calendar) ... all the items appeared
 again in the calendar view!<br />
So ... perhaps your idea would have worked ... if I had the right calendar in the first place!<br />
Thanks so much for your help. I am definitely using this service again!<br />
Kind regards<br />
Andrea <br />

<h3> terence green  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 will not print</h2>
                    I have a Samsung ML-1610 Mono Laser printer and Windows 7 Ultimate. Since the last update for Office I cannot print documents, Word, Excel etc "do not respond" when I try to print and I have to use Task Manager to close program. The printer works with
 other programs and the Windows Printer Test Page prints fine. Any ideas other than a complete re-install of O2010?<br />

<h2>            cannot see when contacts are online</h2>
                    really do not like this new skype on windows 10,but trying to get used to it,because we have all been forced to use it ,my real problem is when I am signed in,it never shows when one of my contacts are online,this is really frustrating,why cant the people
 at skype put the contacts in the left box, instead of pointless past conversations,i do think they have gone a bit backwards

<p>
</p><p>The list that you see when you open Skype is the recent list. There's a separate tab for contacts on the previous version. On this version in the Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) version, there's a separate Window for the contact list and you have to click the
 phonebook icon to open the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say you are unable to stop or disable&nbsp;this version from running in the background, have you tried to sign out and close the application?</p>

</p><p>We appreciate that you find the classic version more appealing. However, since there is an issue with its installer, we have removed it from our download center. The installer file for Skype Classic has a known security vulnerability and our developers are
 working on restoring the official Skype Classic installer as soon as we have fixed this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We strongly advise not to download or install Skype software from third party hosts to protect your security.</p>

<h2>            Re&#58; N8,E72,X6,C6 same wifi &#38;quot&#59;Invalid server name&#38;quot&#59;  Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I also have nokia C6-01. Trying to connect to net using wifi via laptop always gave me the invalid server name error. but now I know what was missing in the setting. all you need to do is to specify the DNS server. and its done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>step 1: setup the wlan first.</p>
<p>a) on laptop(windows 7), switch on the wlan.</p>
<p>b) Start &gt; Control panel &gt; Network and internet &gt; View network status and task&nbsp;.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;Change adapter settings(on the left panel) &gt; right click 'Wireless Network Connection' &gt; Properties.</p>
<p>d) Now select Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) &gt; Click Properties &gt; Use the following IP address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) now type the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IP Address : 192.168.137.1</p>
<p>Subnet mask : 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>Default gateway :&nbsp; leave blank</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prefered dns server : leave blank</p>
<p>Alternate dns server : leave blank</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now click ok &gt; ok &gt; close</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;Start &gt; Control panel &gt; Network and internet &gt; View network status and task .</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;Manage wireless networks &gt; Add &gt; Create an ad hoc network&gt; Next .</p>
<p>h) Give network name "wifi" ( without quotes)</p>
<p>i) security type "wep"</p>
<p>j) security key&nbsp; "1q2w3" ( Any 5 character passeword)</p>
<p>k) check save this network</p>
<p>l) next&gt; close</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now for mobile setting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) menu&gt; settings&gt; Connectivity&gt; Settings &gt; destinations &gt; Internet&gt; option &gt; New access point.</p>
<p>b) select yes when asked for autometic check.</p>
<p>c) select WLAN&gt; select wifi&gt; key in the security key (here 1q2w3)&gt; ok</p>
<p>d) select wifi&gt; option &gt; Advanced settings&gt; IPv4 settings &gt;</p>
<p>e) Phone IP address &gt; 192.168.137.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subnet mask &gt; 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default gateway &gt; 192.168.137.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary DNS Address: 192.168.137.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondary DNS address : 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>back&gt;back&gt;back&gt;back&gt;....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you are done. If you have internet access on your laptop. you will have same internet access on your nokia mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>enjoy :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>let me know if any problem is faced after this. we will then go with more detailed process.</p>
<p>good luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agreed....</p>
<p>But this setup was given to them who want to use their personal Laptops as a wifi hotspot(and&nbsp;DHCP doesn't work)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>If one has more than one laptop and more than 1 phone, one can always specify the IP address as follows:</p>
<p>for laptop: 192.168.xxx.1&nbsp;&nbsp; (xxx&lt;256)</p>
<p>for mobiles : 192.168.xxx.y&nbsp; (y is anything greater than 1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>xxx will derermine the connection to perticular laptop.</p>

    <title>URLs in IE open Firefox windows instead of IE windows. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            URLs in IE open Firefox windows instead of IE windows.</h2>
                    
<p>Intel Core 2 Duo</p>
<p>P8600 @ 2.40 G</p>
<p>790 MHz, 2.96 GB RAM</p>
<p>Windows XP 2002 SP3 (32)</p>
<p>IE 7 (now 8)</p>
<p>Here's the problem. At least, the problem as it stands at this moment. If I type a URL into IE, it opens in Firefox in a new window (or a new tab if I already had Firefox open). If I select a bookmark in IE, it does the same thing. Now, yesterday, if I clicked
 on a link on a web page, it was doing the same thing, but right at this moment, I seem to be able to click on links on web pages and stay within IE.</p>
<p>I have set IE to the default browser - no dice. I have upgraded to IE 8 - that did seem to fix it briefly, but the problem was back, next day.</p>
<p>Now, the kicker. This happened out of the blue. IE, XP, and Firefox were all coexisting nicely up until a few days ago. I know this because I have a specific application that requires IE, and I access it thru a bookmark. I do this on a daily basis. So, for
 months, this combination of apps and OS was stable without issue. Suddenly, a few days ago, I can't get the bookmark to resolve in IE.</p>
<p>Looking around on the internet, I see that some folks reported the exact same problem a few years ago as a result of upgrading IE and leaving 7 and 6 side by side. That was not the case for me here. My laptop is a work laptop and came with 7 installed cleanly.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Okay, got some tech support here at work. Here's the skinny.</p>
<p>I was using Tools, Internet Options from within IE to make it my default browser. Of course, all I could do there was check the box to be notified if IE was not the default browser. But I did that, closed IE and reopened it. No notification.</p>
<p>Tech support had me go thru the Control Panel and set IE to the default browser from there. Going thru that way, there was a button that was for making IE the default browser (as well as the checkbox). Plus, it told me that IE was not the default browser.
 Odd, seeing as it was not complaining about that.</p>
<p>I clicked on the button, restarted IE, and VOILA! It works correctly again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this time, once my problem was resolved, I did not forget to put a note in the thread. ;)</p>

    <title>frontpage 2003 download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twmsr  say:</h3>
<h2>            frontpage 2003 download</h2>
                    Okay, I have Frontpage 2003 and MS Office 2007 installed. I had to do a quick install of Windows XP because of a missing hal.dll error message at power on. (I forget what the install was called, but it stated that data and programs would not be lost.)<br />
<br />
After I did this and applied all 200+/- updates to getup to SP3 and current, I found that most all of my applications still worked and my data was still in place.<br />
<br />
Then I went to start Outlook and it failed, wantiing to go to install. I found the same errors with all other Office programs. Frontoage 2003 did work.<br />
<br />
I reinstalled all MS Office programs, and interesting to me, all data and program settings were found, as in Outlook for example. Magic?<br />
<br />
Anyway, after testing Office programs I tried to start Frontpage, which I rely on heavily to maintain my web sites. It now fails with the same error I was getting with Outlook and the others. Apparently the MS Fixit for my Office problem messed with Frontpage
 registry entries as well.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I took out my MS Frontoage 2003 plastic CD container, snapped it open and to my dismay there was no CD inside. I have looked everywhere and cannot find it.<br />
<br />
All I think I need is an MS Fixit for this, but can't find one. Is it possible to download a copy of Frontpage somewhere? I have my Product Key neatly encoded on a sticker inside my CD case.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />

<h2>            lumia 1020 doesn&#39;t recognize the Lumia Denim update</h2>
                    <p>When I check for software updates on my Lumia 1020 it shows that I am up to date, however it is currently running Lumia Cyan NOT the latest Denim version. I checked all the requirements for the Denim update for Canada and my phone seems to fulfill them all
 so I'm not sure what the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting my phone, connecting it to my PC, reconnecting to WiFi, I have more than 16 GB free, and I've looked through the forums for answers but I haven't found a solution yet. Hoping to avoid having to reset my phone and losing all my data/settings.</p>
<p>
So my question is, beyond the standard advice for how to access your update, how can I get my phone to recognize that the Denim update is available for download or am I missing something?</p>

<h2>            Premium services do not work, map location is wrong, client app has no option to launch at boot&#63;</h2>
                    When I tried to add my phone number, it said that the special text message sent to my phone did not succeed (funny, no one else has problems texting me), and when I tried it again it said now that it failed twice I have to wait an entire week to retry...
 WTF?!?<br />
<br />
When I try to ring my phone using premium services it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
When I tried to locate the last known position of my phone, the website indicated a housing project a block away (I'd get my @$$ kicked if I went over there looking for my phone, particularly if it wasn't there in the first place!).<br />
<br />
Sync works fine - this is about the kindest thing I can say.<br />
<br />
MSMyphone does not have an option to automatically run at boot time and launch itself silently into the background - not much good if my phone gets stolen, is it?<br />
<br />
Explain to me why I would ever pay a dime for this service?<br />
<br />

            Hi Jon,<br />
<br />
Could you try to activate premium services and do a ring again and let me know if it still fails?<br />
Our previous testing shows no issue with Sprint network&nbsp;in Chicago so I am surprise that ring has never worked for you.<br />
<br />
Some things to take note, when you enter the phone number<br />
1) Make sure the country drop down is US +1<br />
2) Make sure the phone number is correct<br />
<br />
If you are stuck in a free trial with no more rings, you can delete or uninstall the program and reactivate My Phone service altogether to restart another free trial.<br />
<br />
Let me know if ringing your device&nbsp;is still failing for you,<br />
Binghuan

            Is there something definitive that states album art must be less than 200kb? All the tracks I have downloaded from the Nokia Music Store have album art that is 240x240 and about 20kb!<br />
<br />
All my own CD rips has album art that is 600x600 but I ensure that every one is less than 200kb. However none of these display on the phone so it can't be the memory size. Oddly enough the album art displays on every other device I have... I have it (jpg) embedded
 in every file and as a folder.jpg file in the album folder.<br />
<br />
Is there a resolution size that must not be exceeded?<br />
<br />

            One more thing?<br />
<br />
Is the picture set as "ALBUM COVER FRONT" or as "USER DEFINED"?<br />
<br />
You need a metadata editor to check this. But only ALBUM COVER FRONT is displayed.<br />
<br />
The 200KB restriction came from my testing in the days of the N91. If the picture was bigger than 200 kB then it wouldn't display at all, but you can check again, maybe now they've increased the filesize allowed.

            It's Album Cover Front. I use Tag&amp;Rename to check all the tags so my downloaded ones are identical to my CD Rips, the only difference being my own are 600x600 (but still less than 200kb), the downloaded ones from the music store are 240x240.<br />
<br />
I therefore conlcude there must be a resolution issue, but how do we clarify what it needs to be?<br />

            I'd advise you to use the programm "Mp3tag" (freeware). Even Covers with a resolution of 600*600 and more than 200kb are working excellent on my Nokia 6210 Navigator.<br />
<br />
It's possible that you first must delete your old cover(s) and than add the cover again. I'd advise you to save the cover first in a jpeg-file.<br />
<br />
Hope I could help you.

<h3> dwightau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Android can&#39;t sign in after November 25, 2015</h2>
                    <p>We're currently experiencing a problem trying to get users on new Android phones to sign in using Outlook for Android. We are following the prompts as we have in the past, using the advanced settings to specify our exchange server details, but after hitting
 the tick to finish setting up the account, the "Attempting to login..." dialog appears for several seconds then disappears, leaving us back at the account details page but with the password field cleared. No error message appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've been having this problem since November 25th, 2015 and I've tested on Android 5.x and 4.x devices. Accessing OWA on the same devices using the browser works just fine, it only seems to be a problem with Outlook for Android. I've tried several times
 each time the app has been updated in the past few weeks, but no luck.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I've noticed is that the authentication attempts don't appear to be getting logged by our exchange server, and if I am unable to intentionally lock an account out by entering bad passwords multiple times (again, no error comes back, just return
 to the account settings page). I'm using the same settings I did before the 25th of November when things worked fine, but now they fail to work. We haven't made any changes in this time to our Exchange or network infrastructure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be a number of other people experiencing the same problem (based on the number of 1-star reviews with related complaints going up on the Google Play store in the past fortnight), but I've not been able to make any progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if there were changes on or around the 25th of November that might be responsible? I'm having trouble finding any official release notes for changes to the app which detail what has actually been modified.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, we're not seeing any logged events on Exchange, so it appears that the app isn't even attempting to authenticate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no changes to Exchange, however Outlook for Android has pushed out a number of updates recently. So the fact that the app was updated and that it doesn't even appear to be communicating with our servers suggests to me that the problem is most
 likely with Outlook, not Exchange. The problems are also completely limited to Outlook for Android. Outlook Web Access, Outlook desktop clients and iOS clients are working without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will investigate the Exchange Server forum all the same, but any suggestions on how to troubleshoot problems on Outlook for Android would be appreciated. The lack of any error messages when the login fails is a real issue from this perspective.</p>

            <p>We also have this issue with the latest Outlook app and Android. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However we were able to configure a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync account successfully on the Android device, so suspect it is not our Exchange services.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a hosted web service that uses our domain name (it uses www.{domain_name}), and during the Exchange ActiveSync configuration the app initially tried to access this hosted site address instead of the exchange mailserver. We found this out due to a
 certificate error that was generated during the configuration. Had to go to the advanced configuration to set it straight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be the issue with the Outlook app? The first error it comes up with is "Your email server certificate is invalid...", but we cannot inspect the certificate. No amount of tinkering with the Outlook advanced configurations help.</p>
