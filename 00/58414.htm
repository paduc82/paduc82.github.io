            As stated above, you would need to contact Microsoft Rewards support for assistance. However, since you bought it before the offer became available it may not be eligible.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when thingsd ont work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs if the current user's profile was accidentally deleted from the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry</p>
<p>&nbsp;1. Log on to the system by using an administrative user account other than the user account that is experiencing the problem.</p>
<p>2. Back up all data in the current user's profile folder if the profile folder still exists, and then delete the profile folder. By default, the profile resides in the following location:</p>
<p>%SystemDrive%\Users\UserName</p>
<p>3. Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>4.Locate the following registry subkey:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</p>
<p>5.Under the ProfileList subkey, delete the subkey that is named SID.bak.</p>
<p>Note SID is a placeholder for the security identifier (SID) of the user account that is experiencing the problem. The SID.bak subkey should contain a ProfileImagePath registry entry that points to the original profile folder of the user account that is experiencing
 the problem.</p>
<p>6. Exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>7. Log off the system.</p>
<p>8. Log on to the system again.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update fails with error 8007000d</h2>
                    Repeatedly the Windows 10 update fails on my Windows 7 system, with error code 8007000D. &nbsp;I have run the Windows 10 Update Diagnostic and it is unable to fix the issue. &nbsp;Doing a search recommended running Windows Restore or Windows Reset. &nbsp;Not wanting
 to do that and lose all my programs, especially with no guarantee that this would fix the problem. What other fixes are available?

            <p>Thank you for the reply. &nbsp;I tried doing the 2 DISM commands from the C prompt, as Administrator. &nbsp;The Scanhealth option worked fine, although it did take a considerable amount of time. &nbsp;However when I do the Restorehealth option, I get the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error:87</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Restorehealth option is not recognized in this context.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM log file can be found at C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hesitate to go on to your next recommendation, as I am unsure if the system is "ok" at this point, or if there is something else I should do before going on to manually restoring the Windows update components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Please help! On Aug 13th I replied to you, indicating what I had tried, and asking for an alternate suggestion, rather than the lengthy 37 commands you suggested I enter. &nbsp;Since I have not received a reply to that response in 5 days, I went ahead and followed
 your earlier instructions. &nbsp;When I tried to manually reset Windows Update components, this is the results I received:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I did enter the commands in exactly the order indicated in the instructions, I am displaying them here by the error messages I received, as several command returned exactly the same error message (with the exception of the file name indicated in
 the error message).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The following commands received this error (with appropriate file/command name):</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; The module "mshtml" was loaded but the entry point DllRegisterServer was not found. &nbsp;Make sure that "mshtml" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regsvr32.exe.mshtml.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe.shdocvw.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe browseui.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe qmgr.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe qmgrprxy.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe muweb.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The following commands received this error (with appropriate file/command name):</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The module "msxml.dll" failed to load. Make sure the binary is stored at the specified path or debug it to check for problems with the binary or dependant .DLL files. &nbsp;The specified module could not be found</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regsvr32.exe msxml.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe gpkcsp.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe sccbase.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe slbcsp.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe initpki.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe wuaueng1.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe wucltui.dll</p>
<p>regsvr32.exe wuweb.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>22 of the commands required to reset Windows update components actually did work. &nbsp;The above 14 did not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got to the end of #7 in the instructions (Reset Windock) I received a message "You must restart the computer in order to complete the reset." &nbsp;The instructions in the link you gave me did not say to restart at that point, so I did not do so, as I
 was concerned that my computer may not reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then #8 ....."If you are running other versions of Windows....type....netsh winhttp reset proxy".</p>
<p>At this point I received the message "Direct Access &lt;no proxy server&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then #9 The first 3 commands to restart the various services went ok, but the last one (net start cryptsvc) returned the error "The requested service has already been started"</p>
<p>
</p><p>#11 - <strong>Install the latest Windows Update Agent" &nbsp;</strong> Once again I attempted to install Windows 10. &nbsp;AGAIN it failed with error 8007000D</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I restarted the computer as it states in #12. &nbsp;AGAIN I tried to run the WIndows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;Failed again, same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what steps can be taken to resolve this issue and get Windows 10 installed on my Windows 7 Home Premium computer. &nbsp;PLEASE NOTE: &nbsp;My normal data usage per month is 25 GB. &nbsp;During the repeated attempts (both MY attempts and the system automatically
 and continually restarting the installation) I have used over 250 GB of data! &nbsp;That's 10 times my normal amount of data! &nbsp;Not to mention the amount of time I have invested in this. &nbsp;At this point I am quite unhappy with the entire process.</p>

<h2>            Insufficient privileges on windows 8</h2>
                    I'm a little new to the whole windows 8 thing. So if anyone can help me with this that would be great. I just installed a game on my notebook&nbsp;and it installed fine. But every time I start it I keep getting this message, "Insufficient privileges: you must
 be administrator when you run this&nbsp;application for the first time." But here's the kicker, I am under the admin. account. if anyone out there can help me with this problem that would be awesome. &nbsp;Thanks

            Hi there,
<div><br />
<div>I find myself having the same issue: running Windows 8 and hoping to install a game (in my case Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, for memories sake). Sadly no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tried to make it compatible and also tried to install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode (every time first a deinstall and then a new installation as per your suggestions), but after what seems a normal installation I am unable to open it, continuously
 telling me I have insufficient privileges. I am definitely the admin here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am at a loss. Read elsewhere that it should be downloaded in a folder of the admin, which is the case. Also made a new user with admin privileges to see if that worked, but no luck either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can try changing the permissions for ‘AppData’ folder and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Go to the location C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Right click on the “Appdata” folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Select Properties and go to the Security tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. At the lower end of the window there will be an Advance tab to change permissions, click on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. On the next window click on “Change Premission” tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. Click on the Add tab to give permissions to the user you want to (generally we add ‘Everyone’ to given permission to all the users on the computer).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Edit the permission to Full Control for ‘Everyone’.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Please post with the result.</span></span></p>

            I have&nbsp;tried all three things that you have said and&nbsp;neither of them have worked. the game that I installed is "The Witcher."&nbsp;On the back it says it will work with Windows XP&nbsp;SP 2&nbsp;and Windows Vista and I have also got it to work on my old notebook which
 had Windows 7 on it. But nothing I have done will allow it to work on this notebook. I'm at a complete and total loss on this and&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know what else to do with besides get Windows 7 and put it on this notebook even though this one came with Win. 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            THE WINDOWS 8 IS NOT WORKING FOR YOU BECAUSE THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS CREATED.&nbsp;I have the same problem with windows 8. On 5 other games I have tried 8 or 9 other &nbsp;sugestions the people at Microsoft will not help they created this bug in there program. I
 even tried to contact HP the company who built this fine mess and they would want more money. I bought my window 8 HP pavilion g7 in Febuary and have not been able to play any games on it yet due to the same you do not have administrative privileges. my unit
 has a AMD PROCESSOR A6-4400M&nbsp; and should be able to play some of my games but the win 8 program sucks and will not let the owner /the administrator play games. All I can say to the fine people at Microsoft is Shame.....

 great.<br />

<p><span>Hi dan leclerc,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Print to a file</span></strong><span>
 would appear only when it is enabled.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Print a document to a file</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Printing a document to a file instead of to your printer saves the document in a format that a different printer
 can use.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if you want to have your document printed by a commercial printing service that uses higher-resolution
 printers, you can print the document to a file, and then take that file to the commercial printer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;When
 you print to a file, you must first determine which printer—&nbsp;for example, a PostScript printer—&nbsp;will ultimately print the file.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>File</strong> menu, click <strong>Print</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Name</strong> box, click the printer you'll use to print the file. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the
<strong>Print to file</strong> check box, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </span>
</p>

<p>No, you won't find movie maker in Windows Update.<br />
No, you don't have to purchase. The movie maker program is free for download.<br />
No, movie maker is not included in Win7 package.<br />

Offcially, you have 2 versions of movie makers for you to select :<br />

<p>What happens when you right-click on a web page is a function of the browser you're using. There is no
<em>email a link </em>option on the right-click menu in Internet Explorer or Edge, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>... to email a link using Windows live. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Send link by email </em>function will pass the request to Windows, which will open the default mail program for you to compose the message in. It's possible that the browser will only display the option if Windows knows which mail program is the
 default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Live Mail, when viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. Check the bottom two settings on the
<em>General</em> tab to ensure that Windows knows which program you want to use as the default.</p>

</p><p>In a video conference call, my app currently shows a maximum of four people in the large screen. And when the built-in screenshot functionality is used, only a maximum of five random people will be in the image. Those apply to both desktop and mobile apps.
 Is there a way to increase the count? I've seen screenshots of eight to ten people shown in when I search "skype".</p>

            <p>I have a similar problem with my Lenovo IdeaPad 500. Installed W10 and used it for a week, then the screen started flashing blue and looping the circle dots. On reboot I usually get the restore screen and have tried all the options to no avail. I received
 these messages:</p>

                    <p>Windows Live Mail 2012</p>
<p>In Windows 7, everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in Windows 10, I am receiving this error when trying to download mail from one server using POP3 over SSL on port 995:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed on the server</p>
<p>I can download mail using a non-secured connection on port 25</p>
<p>I can send mail to SMTP over SSL on port 465</p>
<p>None of my account properties have changed</p>
<p>Email on a different server connects and downloads&nbsp;without error using these settings</p>
<p>I have tried with Defender turned off</p>
<p>I have tried with Firewall turned off</p>

            <p>These links seem to be specific to syncing with a Microsoft server.&nbsp; In the post by Firedog, item 5, states "Mail accounts configured to use POP3 or IMAP will continue to work as before"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is with POP3 connecting over SSL&nbsp;to a non-Microsoft server, and it definitely is not continuing to work as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the server is terminating the connection, and since this only began happening with the upgrade to Windows 10, &nbsp;there must be an issue with WLM not connecting properly over SSL.&nbsp; Is there a dll or something like openssl that may have changed with the
 upgrade, that may be buggy or corrupted?</p>

<p>Every server has its idiosyncrasies. We can't do any investigation without knowing which server it is you're trying to connect to.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I can download mail using a non-secured connection on port 25</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt it - that's the port for unsecured SMTP, so I don't think you can use it to connect to a POP3 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the differences between servers, for example,&nbsp;is their support for security protocols. I think that there are some that will no longer allow connections using TLS 1.0 and insist on TLS 1.1 or 1.2. If these are not enabled on your computer, you won't
 be able to make a secure connection. Outlook.com, for example, will use TLS 1.2 if the client computer supports it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're quite right about the references made in another reply to this thread - this has nothing to do with update KB3093594.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Oops, my bad on the POP3&nbsp;unsecured port number.&nbsp; Should be 110.&nbsp; This is how I am connecting unsecured right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Different security protocols could be the problem. AFAIK the server uses TLS 1.2.&nbsp; I can browse websites using TLS 1.2 so I assume I can also use this for email SSL though I don't know how to verify that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strangest part to me is that I can connect securely to SMTP but not POP3.&nbsp; I know they are different things, but isn't the SSL connection the same?</p>

            <p>Further testing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I borrowed a Windows 10 PC and installed WLM and set up an email account exactly like mine with POP3 over SSL.&nbsp; I received the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled WLM and opened the Windows 10 native mail app, and set up the same&nbsp;email account.&nbsp; I was able to connect and download mail with&nbsp;POP3 using SSL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this, it seems highly likely that WLM is the problem.&nbsp; I created a log file which instantly became huge, but these two lines stood out:</p>

<p>Sorry, I've not come across that error before, so I wonder if it's something strange about the server you're connecting to. While there's nothing wrong with the certificate (check it yourself here:
<a href="https://cryptoreport.rapidssl.com/checker/views/certCheck.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cryptoreport.rapidssl.com/checker/views/certCheck.jsp</a>), I see that it's only a couple of weeks old (18 Jan 2016) - when did your problems start?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could test by setting up a different secure POP3 connection, e.g.&nbsp;to your Microsoft account (server&nbsp;pop3.live.com, port 995). If this works,&nbsp;something's wrong&nbsp;at the gnservers.com server. If it doesn't, something's wrong on your machine.</p>

            <p>POP3 over SSL&nbsp;was accessible on this server&nbsp;with Windows Live Mail on Windows 7 only 2 days ago.&nbsp; Now on Windows 10 it is not with WLM but it is with Windows 10 Mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems that Windows 10 must have replaced the service that WLM uses for SSL with something that is buggy AND that it is not the same service Windows 10 Mail app uses. This puts it beyond the scope of anything I can fix, and I doubt there will be any quick
 resolution since it is not a problem for everybody.&nbsp; Too bad, as WLM is the best client for the way I work.&nbsp; The Windows 10 Mail app is definitely not a viable replacement.</p>

<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/260729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB260729</a>, you might find in Event Viewer what it is that's causing this 'internal error'.&nbsp; Since it seems to be unique to your setup, it would be worth looking at third-party software you may have
 installed.</span></p>

            <p>Schannel error logging is on (set to 0x0001) by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event viewer, I found quite a few Schannel events with Event Id 36888 that seemed to correspond to my failed connections.&nbsp; In the General description section it said "</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even though it was about Outlook on Windows 8.1, it turned out to be the correct solution.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 and 10 require a minimum Diffie-Hellman key length of 1028.&nbsp; Apparently my server has not been updated to this and is still set at 512.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link provides a registry edit to override the minimum value and set it back to 512 (00000200):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start, click Run, type regedit in the Open box, and then click OK. </p>
<p>2. Locate and then click the following subkey in the registry: </p>
<p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\KeyExchangeAlgorithms\Diffie-Hellman
</em></p>
<p><em>Note: if the </em><em>Diffie-Hellman key does not exist, add it.</em></p>
<p>3. On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value. </p>
<p>4. Type ClientMinKeyBitLength for the name of the DWORD, and then press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Right-click ClientMinKeyBitLength, and then click Modify. </p>
<p>6. In the Value data box, type 00000200, and then click OK.</p>
<p>Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will contact the server support and try to get them to update this value.&nbsp; In the mean time, I can now connect securely again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help Firedog.&nbsp; Much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            rundll32.exe and CryptSvc crashing constantly on windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, hope you can give a hand with this.<br />
<br />
I've a desktop <a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit - quad processor. It has
 installed the SP1. I recently updated several windows files and now I am getting a lot of appcrashes from the rundll32.exe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the Cryptographic Services&nbsp;is the culprit causing the rundll32 crash messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently, the CryptSvc service is stopping and starting, and stopping and starting - constantly. It has done this more than 100 times and it happens every
 few seconds to a few minutes.&nbsp; I manually disabled this service, but the problem persisted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure which is the problem. Is the CryptSvc malfunctioning? Or something is messing with that service? Why did the CryptSvc start after I disabled it?</p>

            <p>Hi Tushar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the clean boot and things you suggested, but I was continuing to have a very difficult time.&nbsp; I decided to back up all my data and do a complete reformatting and reinstall of Windows 7.&nbsp; The back up took forever, as the system was very sluggish
 and transfer rates to my external hard drive were below 1MB a sec.&nbsp; I finally backed up everything I could and after reformatting the computer at the boot prompt told me that the hard drive was SMART capable and status BAD.&nbsp; I decided to continue with the
 reinstall and the system worked fine, other than telling me that the SMART was bad on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to install a new hard drive and it has been working great, no issues.</p>
<p>So, I think the problem was in the system files, as the issues was gone when I reinstall the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well... thank you for your help and time.</p>

<h2>            ITunes wont start minimized&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed itunes for my iphone. I asked on the apple forum how i can run itunes minimized on startup. They instructed me to put itunes in startup folder which worked, and to right click and select run minimized.</p>
<p><br />
This worked once, but since then it wont work again, it always runs maximized instead. Is there anyway to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Hello Ghost Division,</p>
<p>Another option to start Itunes minimized would be the following:</p>
<p><strong>From Itunes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>&nbsp;&gt; Click <strong>Preferences</strong> </li><li>Click<strong>&nbsp;Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab </li><li>On the bottom of this page, place a check by <strong>Show iTunes icon in system tray</strong>&nbsp;&gt; under this place a check by&nbsp;<strong>Minimize iTunes window to system tray</strong></li></ul>
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            Could you start by running the Bluetooth troubleshooter?
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Select Bluetooth
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart, then check if its working. 
<br />
<br />There are issues to prevent Bluetooth from working. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:
<br />
<br />    Check Windows Update for the latest updates then install them.
<br />    If Windows Updates does not have any updated drivers, check the manufacturers website. Updated Chipset drivers might also be available, apply them to see if it improves connectivity.
<br />    Launch Device Manager, right-click the Bluetooth driver, click uninstall, then restart your computer.
<br />    For the Bluetooth device you are connecting to Windows, make sure it is fully charged and is within range.
<br />    If other Bluetooth devices are on, disable them temporarily.
<br />    Reset the device to see if it works. This usually involves holding down the power button until the device is powered down.

<br />
<br />Try running the hardware troubleshooter specifically:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Select Hardware devices
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart, then check if its working. 
<br />
<br />If this does not work, I recommend returning it for a refund, since this seems to be a common problem with this particular bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

<h2>            Removed a user account but it&#39;s still there</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had two computers linked to the same MSFT account. I unlinked one, set it to local user and that works fine. The other computer is still linked to the MSFT account, but it still reads the settings from the first computer. I removed it, reset language,
 but it still by default goes to the settings that I had on the first computer. When I check out the connected accounts, it doesn't show up in neither control panel nor the PC settings. But for some reason all the apps are still showing the other device as
 an active account. Also, the language on the first computer was Danish, I deleted the language from the second computer, and it does not show up as an installed language in settings, but all aps use it as the default language. How do i untangle this mess?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your answer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I unlinked my other computer is because my MSFT account is personal, but the other device is for work purposes. When I purchased a personal computer with Windows 8, I did not realize that it would sync both devices, and I did not want my personal
 settings to be applied on my work computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I realized that it has already synced too late and while the local account on the work PC works fine, the sync has affected my personal computer and I cannot find my way around it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only one account active, the setting do not show any linked devices because I removed the other computer from all the lists (apps, user accounts, app store...) but the settings the other device has somehow has been set to default on my personal laptop.
 All the settings show that I have&nbsp;<em>technically</em> changed them, however the change does not happen, therefore I don't know what to do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot from the troubleshooter, when i click on additional actions, it of course directs me here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/080fc54f-906b-4904-bd9e-6923a7c42c74" /></p>

</p><p>Yes, I did, the accounts page shows that there is only one account - the one that I am using on my private laptop. It does not show any additional accounts or devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I unlink that, restore the device to factory settings and start again? Not the most fun thought to be honest.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before performing factory restore, I would suggest you to <strong>refresh Windows without affecting your files</strong> to unlink Microsoft account.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Note: Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us updated on the status of the issue.</p>

<p>I am having this exact same issue. </p>
<p>A little background detail : earlier in the day my wife was watching Netflix on the XB1 and it was working perfectly normal. She turned it off when she left for work. When I woke up, I turned it on and all was normal. I tried to launch a game (COD:AW if
 it matters) when the screen went black and would not respond to any input from the controller. I did a hard reset using the power button on the console and when it boots back up, the Controller will not Connect to the console and the console will not output
 any video either through my receiver or directly to my TV. I have tried to reset it into the low resolution mode but nothing different happens when I try to boot that way. I have swapped hdmi cables and unplugged everything from the console and waited 5 min
 and plugged everything back in but still no luck. </p>

Dear Mr. Lant, <br />
 <br />
thank you for your e-mail.<br />
 <br />
According to the logfiles you sent us Nero StartSmart crashes due to a file named "aclayer.dll".<br />
This DLL file is a so-called Browser Helper Object which is used to customize the Internet Explorer.<br />
I would suggest to try to replace this file. Either ask Microsoft for a download of this DLL file or try reinstalling Internet Explorer.<br />
Please get back to us if the issue persists.<br />
Thank you!<br />
 <br />
Should you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us again. <br />
 <br />
Best Regards <br />
 <br />

<p><span><span>Hi Richard Lant,</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>•
</span></strong><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>•
</span></strong><span>Does this happen only with Nero or with any other applications?</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Aclayer.dll has been reported as a Trojan before and it will pose itself as a Microsoft BHO (browser
 helper object).</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><strong><span> You may
</span></strong><strong><span>run a virus scan</span></strong><strong><span> and check if it helps:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.html</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><strong><span> You may also try to
 manually </span></strong><strong><span>disable the tool bands and Browser Helper Objects</span></strong><strong><span>, follow these steps:
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>1. Open Internet Explorer and click tools.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>2. Double-click Internet Options.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>3. Click the Advanced tab.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>4. Under Browsing, click to clear the Enable third-party browser extensions (requires restart)
 check box.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>5. Restart Internet Explorer.</span></strong><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step doesn’t work, then you may try to delete the aclayers.dll. from the following locations:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>C<strong>:\WINDOWS\system32\dllcache and delete aclayers.dll</strong>.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;<strong>delete aclayers.dll</strong>
 from <strong>C:\WINDOWS\AppPatch folder.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to our support page: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA297/how-do-i-request-a-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I request a refund?</a>, there are two ways on how you can request for a refund:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/purchasehistory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Sign in to your account</span></a>&nbsp;and from your purchase history,&nbsp;select the order you want a refund for. Select the
<strong>Refund</strong> button. If you're eligible for a refund, we'll automatically refund it to the payment method you used to make the purchase.</li><li>Start a <a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">live chat</span></a>&nbsp;and chat to one of our Customer Service agents. If you’re not signed in to Skype, enter your Skype Name and password, then click
<strong>Sign me in</strong>.&nbsp;If you get a warning about a pop-up, you will need to allow it; that's the live chat window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I will send you a private message with the steps to connect with a live chat representative. Please click the envelope icon at the upper right side of the page to view your Community inbox.</p>
