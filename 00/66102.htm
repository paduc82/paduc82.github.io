<div>Assuming you are trying to install the "Windows XP" operating system&nbsp;from your installation media (Windows XP CD) and are speaking of your product key sticker - it's supposed to be a combination of letters and numbers - not
 just one or the other.&nbsp; It's one reason some people make mistakes when entering it (depending on the font, some letters/numbers look the same at a glance: "O" and "0" or "D", "1" and "l" or "I", "5" and "S", etc.)</div>

    <title>My first hours with Skyrim &#40;spoiler free&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> netshadex  say:</h3>
<h2>            My first hours with Skyrim &#40;spoiler free&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well as it turns out Skyrim has pulled an Oblivion in Europe meaning it was released early yesterday morning, I have had the chance to spend a few hours with the game (PS3)&nbsp;thought I'd let people know what's up.</p>
<p>First off, I can confirm the game required a 4,3 GB install on the PS3 putting those rumors about the full game being 3,8 GB on consoles to rest.&nbsp; Second, the minute you boot up the game it is patched with a 58MB day 1 patch.</p>
<p>Onto the game itself then. I promised this post to be spoilerr free so I'll keep this impression limited to the technical side of things split up in a good and bad section.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<p>- It's still an Elder Scrolls game but it's much more refined, everything from the interface to the character animation and detail in the environment</p>
<p>-The inventory system for the game is completely new. You&nbsp;can&nbsp;label items in your inventory as "favorite" meaning they will show up on your screen by pressing up on the d-pad for quick acces. The dual wielding is made easy by pressing the shoulder buttons
 to assign weapons, spells&nbsp;or items to each hand. I't's ever so slightly more cumbersome than the old system but the only logical option with the new dual wielding ability. Another cool feat is the sneaking which now comes with a rumble feature. Your controller
 starts to vibrate increasingly as you are about to be noticed, simple but brilliant!</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Bad:</strong></p>
<p>- My only gripe with the game is performance, at least on PS3, the game visibly taxes the hardware, framerate is iffy in places and the overall look of the game is pretty crude when compared to other releases. Coming of Battlefield 3, Gears 3 and Uncharted
 3 myself. Skyrim kinda&nbsp;falls flat on it's face. I'm convinced most internet footage is the PC version because my game certainly doesn't look like that. Part of the "problem" is that everything looks drab and grey to illustrate the harsh Northern environment
 of Skyrim. As a result the game doesn't have the fairytale like look of Oblivion anymore losing some of the initial wow factor in the proces. There's also some strange problem with glitchy shadows which will no doubt be patched</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Overall:</strong>&nbsp; If you don't let the slightly&nbsp;underwhelming look of the game ruin your day, this is still unmistakingly an Elder Scrolls game and any excitement you have is justified. The best argument in favor of this game is still that I popped
 in the disc and when I switched off my console 3 hours had past. 3 hours that I could have sworn, were just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls is back and you know it !</p>

<p>@ Fearecon:</p>
<p>Well the detail is doubled if not tripled. everything from the characters faces to the armor they wear has much more detail to it. The only thing is that this game is released among some real graphical showcases like Gears, Battlefield, Rage, Uncharted etc
 etc.. and coming off those games it's a pretty steep drop to Skyrims look. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want to nag about the graphics too much because the game is absolutely fantastic and when playing you are so caught up it doesn't really matter. I just mentioned the graphics because it's something I noticed and I wanted to be straight up with you
 guys and not just sing haleluja...</p>
<p>Another thing that's changed from Oblivion is that this has a much moodier and darker tone, there's decapitations and the game just feels grittier than Oblivion. I like the look and feel !</p>

<p>I've seen that pic as well. I can't confirm it's a fake but the PS3 has a 4,3 GB install and when playing there's still data being streamed off the disc meaning the total filesize is well above that. The game doesn't have DTS sound so it copies the 360's
 Dolby Digital meaning there's no extra audio data on there. I don't see how the 360 version would be smaller than a partial PS3 install.</p>

<p>What's to chill out about? I am just stating my honest opinion and a fact for all the Xbox users (seeing as this is the xbox forum) so they wont be scared that the graphics might dissapoint them and that they preordered the game for nothing. I don't see
 how my post should have offended you, and i prefer not to be refered to with "dude"</p>

<h2>            Error 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 during 8.0 &#62; 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have an Alienware m17x R4 laptop running Windows 8.0 and I cannot update to 8.1. When I start the update procedure from the Windows store, everything goes fine until the first reboot, where I get a BSOD saying that Windows could not be updated and that the
 old OS is being loaded. The error code here is 0xc0000225</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I get sent back to Windows 8.0, which announces that the upgrade procedure failed with the following error code: 0xC1900101 - 0x20017<br />
<br />
I have a SSD and a HDD. Windows is installed on the SSD. Everything looks fine in device management and I have no (known) hardware or driver issues. Windows 8.0 itself works great and so do my games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a lot of information for this error online, but none of the posted solutions work for me. A list of the many things I've tried (probably missing a few still, I've been working on this for 2 weeks now):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Complete reinstall on the SSD (tried both RAID and AHCI), including drivers (in the order that Dell recommends)</li><li>Upgrade of all drivers</li><li>BIOS update (now using the latest A12)</li><li>Disabling safe boot</li><li>Disabling internet just before the update (dns issue perhaps)</li><li>installing all (I think about 118) Windows updates</li><li>Disconnecting all external devices</li><li>Trying an update straight after a plain Windows install (so pre driver install)</li><li>Resetting store cache</li><li>... and everything I've forgot to mention</li></ul>
<p>I have logged the contents of the latest <strong>setuperr.log</strong></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, I fixed it last night after being on the phone with Dell support for a while.<br />
<br />
The problem was with the hard disks: the Windows partition was on the SSD, but the hidden system partitions were on the HDD, which caused significant problems. I took out the HDD, did a full format and reinstall, put the HDD back in again and it works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Remember - This is a public forum so never post private information such as email or phone numbers!</strong></p>
<p>When I go to the Pictures Libray to view pictures, all I see are icons for each photo, but not a small icon of the photo itself.&nbsp; In XP, you could view the actual photo icon in Explorer.&nbsp; We jad a choice to view it as a thumbnail.&nbsp; Now, the only way I can
 see the photo is to double-click and it opens with Windows Photo Viewer.&nbsp; I would like to be able to see a thumbnail of the photo before I open it with any other graphic editor or viewer.</p>
<p>I'm new to the Windows 7 world, so I may have overlooked something obvious.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Internet connection problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my problem is that my computer lost internet connection out of nowhere. When I look at the internet icon, bottom right it says that I have plugged my cable in and the connection is fine, but when I try to go on some random website it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no internet connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something wrong with the proxy server, or the address is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I pressed "DETAILS" it showed me a guide on how to fix it, but I can't access LAN settings since it's grayed out. And underneath there is a highlighted message that says: "Some settings are managed by your system administrator."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I only have one account, which also has the administrator rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it happens everywhere, I can't access Steam and Discord, since both of them require internet to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize if there are any mistakes, I wrote this on my phone.</p>

<h2>            Yahoo bridge</h2>
                    My wife has been playing yahoo bridge for years and has tried to continue with our new computer and Vista. But some reason the system shuts down and the screen only shows no signal. She has to restart and the cycle continues. She might I be on it for 5
 minutes or 30 minutes and then the screen gets shaky and fuzzy.<br />
<br />
We have a Dell Inspiron 531s with Vista and a Acer monitor.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You might have an addon or similar causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Try these :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / Ok<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Startup Programs<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unsual with<br />
Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. I have many scanners and they never find anything of note since I started using this setup.
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
BTW I too am a long time bridge player - tell your wife to check out Bridge Base Online which is free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://online.bridgebase.com/intro/installation_guide_for_bbo.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://online.bridgebase.com/intro/installation_guide_for_bbo.php</a><br />
<br />
Download and install the software - start it up and create a user name and password. Simple and free.<br />
<br />
BBO has Events from around the world on vugraph too, including the Cavendish, World Championships,<br />
USA, European and other major area championships. My nick on BBO is Mariner1 and I am a regular
<br />
commentator on the BBO vugraphs.<br />
<br />
Upcoming Vugraphs<br />
<a href="http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php</a><br />
<br />
She can&nbsp;play, learn, or watch vugraphs all free.</p>
Using BBO will in no way interfere with her Yahoo or anything else, it has no memory resident functions.<br />

<p>The file listed is probably being driven to fault by something else, such as another driver
<br />
or memory issues (as examples).<br />

<br />
======================================<br />
======================================</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This error (7E) is usually a driver issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though
<br />
it could be others. Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software
<br />
issues can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my
<br />
generic methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.</p>
<p>Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows
<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.</p>
<p>When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to
<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007E</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To
<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
<br />
For a complete list of exception codes, see the Ntstatus.h file that is located in the inc directory of
<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>Resolving the Problem<br />
If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space. <br />
If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
<br />
manufacturer for driver updates. <br />
Try changing video adapters. <br />
Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. <br />
Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. <br />
If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2
<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system
<br />
was started with the /NODEBUG switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,
<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the /DEBUG switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<p>Hardware incompatibility. Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
<br />
Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. <br />
Faulty device driver or system service. A faulty device driver or system service might be
<br />
responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
<br />
and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. <br />
If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable
<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup
<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe
<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process
<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer
<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the
<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also
<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.
<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or
<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system
<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk
<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary
<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and .chk files that
<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more
<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.</p>

<p>Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info
<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other 4 entries on the lower left. And any other error
<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.</p>
<p>As examples :</p>
<p>BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000</p>
<p><br />
<strong>This is an excellent tool for posting Blue Screen Error Information</strong></p>

<p><br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however
<br />
there are other causes.</p>
<p>You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or
<br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.</p>

<p>Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party

keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred
<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks
<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it stuck in a loop? If so the below will help. If not in a loop we need a lot more accurate<br />
information describing what you see and have tried. The below methods will help with a<br />
lot of startup issues anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
-------------------------</p>
<p>You can use the solutions&nbsp;in this KB&nbsp;- 4 methods and I listed a little help for them below<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Start Windows Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;with the Windows installation media, and then<br />
use the Repair feature <br />
<br />
How to Do a Startup Repair in Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91467-startup-repair.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91467-startup-repair.html</span></a><br />
<br />
You can also do a Startup Repair from Safe Mode accessing the Recovery Options if you<br />
have them available or use the DVD as above.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options - Vista<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: Start the system in safe mode, and then use the System Restore feature<br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista <br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span></a></p>

<br />
<br />
You can also do a System Restore by booting up with a Vista or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>: Use the Downloads at the end of this article - note versions for Vista x86 32 bit<br />
and Vista x64 64 bit.<br />
<br />
The update is not installed successfully, you receive a message, and the computer restarts<br />
when you try to install an update in Windows Vista and Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong>:<br />
<br />
At the Command Prompt or Recovery Options or a Vista disk boot<br />
<br />
Type or copy and paste these in one at a time (not the press ENTER)<br />
<br />
c:windows\winsxs\ in the commandprompt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
press ENTER<br />
<br />
DIR pending.*<br />
press ENTER&nbsp; and you should see the pending.xml<br />
<br />
ren pending.xml pending.old<br />
press ENTER.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is the older complete Method 4<br />
<br />
Use the System Recovery options or Vista Boot Disk to rename the Pending.xml file and<br />
edit the registry:</p>
<p>On the System Recovery Options page, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Type cd C:\windows\winsxs, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type ren pending.xml pending.old, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Type regedit, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.</p>
<p>On the File menu, click Load Hive.</p>
<p>Locate the following folder:</p>
<p>C:\windows\system32\config\components</p>
<p>When you are prompted for a name, type Offline_Components.</p>
<p>In Registry Editor, locate and then delete the following registry<br />
subkey:</p>
<p>HLKM\Offline Components\AdvancedInstallersNeedResolving</p>
<p>HKLM\Offline Components\PendingXmlIdentifier</p>
<p>Exit Registry Editor:</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type exit to exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>Press ENTER.</p>
<p>Restart System<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once you are in Windows again I would run the Reset here as a precaution.<br />

------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If you can't get into Windows you need a Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have one<br />
you can borrow a friends as the are not copy protected and the system maker will usually<br />
sell you the physical disk cheap (you are only paying for the DVD as you already own<br />
Vista/Windows 7). Or you can make a Repair Disk.<br />

            Hi Davey 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            trying to install medal of honor airborne on vista 32bit and having problems with windows firewall not starting. </h2>
                    
<p>ok, im losing my mind.</p>
<p>i bought a copy of airborne for my vista 32 bit system and found initially&nbsp;i had to do some tricks to install and play it like un-installing ageia phys-x, it was pretty simple. well i had since stopped playing it and would try to un-install to no avail.&nbsp;i
 tried repairing and using "C-cleaner".</p>
<p>i got a few of the files off but i think my registry got a little bugged so i tried fixing it with c cleaner, it of course found many errors and fixesd them.</p>
<p>well i am now trying to re-install MOHA and when i put the disk in and hit autorun button the games pre-boot window pops up with the usual options, play, update, website etc... i hit play, it doesnt do anything. i have tried uninstalling from the disk and
 half way through it says "MOHA has stopped setup wizard prematurely try again later". i cant repair or uninstall or install. i read somewhere that its a firewall issue with windows and if i run my win firewall "which i never have it on", it should work if
 the software is added to the 'allow' list on the firewall.</p>
<p>now i find out i cant get my firewall to start. i researched and found some forums where people explained the services command prompt and i tried to "start" several "stopped" programs in there and firewall will not start giving me this error- windows cannot
 start the windows firewall service. and error code- 6801.</p>
<p>i am a novice at tooling around under the "software" hood of PCs. i know a little about hardware and thats about it. does anyone have any ideas for me? otherwise im looking at another troubled vista install, which i had a hard time installing the 1st time
 and im not looking forward to trying it again...</p>
<p>thanks in advance, cheers- a fool losing his mind.............</p>

<h2>            svchost registry file deleted, computer crashed. Virus is the culprit.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I found a virus in "<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/software/microsoft/windows/CurrentVersion/run, svchost</strong> " that I believe was
 causing some major problems with my PC. So the svchost registry file got deleted. A few moments later my PC crashed (blue screen, then nothing), and it took me a couple hours to get it working again because it kept crashing on restart (wouldn't even get to
 login screen before blue screen and crash). </span></p>
<p><span>Now the virus is still prevalent on my computer, but the svchost registry is still missing. I'm using Vista 32-bit, and what is happening
 is that the virus is changing my internet proxies so that I have to manually change them each time I open the internet (to "<em>no proxy</em> ") to get it working again. Also, every now and then it redirects my Google searches. Is there a fix for this? And
 should I replace my svchost registry file? If so, how? </span></p>
<p><span>Before deleting the infected registry file I did the steps to fix the "Google redirect virus", but when I checked my "<strong>hosts</strong>
 " file, it was fine, so I don't know if I had the exact Google redirect virus, or a strain of it, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks everyone, I really appreciate your help.</span></p>

<p>I did everything you guys suggested, and it didn't help at all. I have also done approximately 20 scans with different, trusted scanners, as well as scanning in safe mode and boot scans.</p>
<p>The virus is still changing my internet proxies every time I open my browser, though. What would cause that? How could I manually fix it?</p>
<p>Also, since my svchost registry file was deleted, is it important that I replace it? If it is, how do I replace it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>EDIT: I just reinstalled Firefox. Now whenever I open my browser (either IE or Firefox) my proxy settings are unchanged! So I guess the virus was affecting some sort of Firefox file itself? I don’t know… Does this mean
 the virus is gone? or..?</b></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installation stuck and not startingHi</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>After a lot of hesitation and insecurity feeling, i finally accepted the free windows 10 upgrade from windows 7 dell laptop. &nbsp;On the first attempt i cancelled at the step after the download was completed. In the next attempt i let it do what ever it wants.
 It did so many things and reboots. After the &nbsp;'files back up' step it rebooted the machine some times and got stuck on blank screen. Now even if i reboot, it loads bios and shows windows 10 logo and then stops on blank screen. I dont know what to do. I am
 worried about my data as i have not taken any back up. Please help me out.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0x80070520 on xbox one</h2>
                    <p>I bought halo wars 2 when it first came out. Because I was running out of storage space I deleted the game, as I have done to other titles such as Rainbow Six Siege, Battlefield, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to re-download those games I just go to my games &amp; apps and re-install everything. However, when I try to re-download Halo Wars 2 all the add-ons, dlcs, and season passes download correctly except for the actual game. At which point it only gives
 me the "Installation Stopped" notification with error code <strong>0x80070520</strong>. So far, this is the only game that gives me this error.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried clearing the cache, restarting my xbox, deleted and redownloaded my profile and nothing seems to work. I have seen this is a problem on windows 10, but I haven't found a forum post of someone having this issue on xbox one.</p>

<p><strong>Cause</strong> <br />
<br />
Frequently, you can determine the cause of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check from the error status (Parameter 2). Some common status codes include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, typically indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000000E, or STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE, indicates a hardware failure or an incorrect drive configuration. Check your cables and check the drive with the diagnostic utility available from your drive manufacturer. If you are using older PATA (IDE) drives, this
 status code can indicate an incorrect master/subordinate drive configuration.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that can be returned, see the Ntstatus.h file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><br />
Another common cause of this error message is defective hardware or failing RAM.</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check. <br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving a bad block problem:</strong> An I/O status code of 0xC000009C or 0xC000016A typically indicates that the data could not be read from the disk because of a bad block (sector). If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs automatically
 and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore. </p>
<p><br />
If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the computer because of the error, use the Recovery Console and run
<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><br />
Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the integrity of your hard disk
 from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a defective hardware problem:</strong> If the I/O status is C0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a failing RAM problem:</strong> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><br />
Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p><br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p><br />
If the preceding steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a virus infection:</strong> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run DriverVerifier.<br />
(Remember to use the Windows 8 methods posted at the top&nbsp;of the original reply above.)<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.</p>

Hope this helps. </p>

            Sounds like it is a Tune up Utilities program. You could try reinstalling that application and see if your errors are fixed.

<h2>            Win 7 Sound recorder- audio recording device cannot be found</h2>
                    
<p>Fresh install (new drive) of Win 7 Hiome Premium 64 bit&nbsp;on Dell XPS 420 Quad Core.&nbsp; When I launch sound recorder it gives an error that audio recording device cannot be found.&nbsp; Mic is plugged in front jack.&nbsp; This worked with Vista.&nbsp; I enabled show disabled
 devices and sho disconnected devices.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; I also tried rear mic jack.&nbsp; I scanned for hardware changes.</p>

<blockquote>I did the things you mentioned above:<br />
<br />
1.) method 1:&nbsp; Windows 7 responded that it could not identify&nbsp;the problem<br />
2.) method 2:&nbsp; checked the show disabled devices and still no devices appear.&nbsp; It still says no audio devices installed under the recording tab.<br />
3.) method 3:&nbsp; attempted to update driver and Win 7 reports I have the most up to date driver already<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
There is really no other solution than a better driver for the device.
