    <title>Outlook Contacts Permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulhirdler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Contacts Permissions</h2>
                    <p>I have a subscription to Office 365 on a standalone laptop running Windows 8.1. I am both the&nbsp;owner and administrator. I recently found that I could not add or delete to my Contacts file. This happened just after my "upgrade" to Windows 8.1. The error message
 when I try to add or delete&nbsp;says:</p>
<p>"You don't have permission to create an entry in this folder. Right-click the folder, and then Properties to check your permissions for the folder. See the folder owner or your administrator to change the permissions."</p>
<p>When I right-click the folder, then Properties, there is no Permissions tab. Can anyone help me figure out how to fix this issue? Thank you.

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us create a new profile in Outlook, re-configure the email account and check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following article on how to create and configure an email profile in Outlook and check if it helps:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p>Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Girish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the only way to completely eradicate the problem was to uninstall Office 365 and reinstall it.&nbsp;This action&nbsp;wiped out all the "offending" data and allowed me to configure the email profile I wanted. Your advice was well put and thank you, but nothing
 really worked until I took the uninstall/reinstall step.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Freezes- using imap.aol</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook for mulitple years via imap for my aol email account.&nbsp; I have had no problems until the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; Now, I get frequent freezing thoughout the day- sometimes it will work for an hour or two and then it will freeze up.&nbsp;
 Either I restart- which doesn't work or just wait and it comes back.&nbsp; I have tried starting in safe mode but there is no change in the performance.&nbsp; I have Vista Home edition.&nbsp; I don't think it is an aol issue as it is fine on my phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas for me?&nbsp; </p>

            I found a forum thread that leads me to believe the problem stems from the latest update to Avast antivirus software (which I use). Here is a link:

<div>I will follow up with Avast and then report back here with any final resolutions. Thanks.</div>

<h2>            OneNote cross-platform sync problems</h2>
                    <p>I have just started having the same issue. I have the OneNote app on my Android phone, on my iPad and on my Windows 10 PC (the newest, Win10 store version). My main notebook "Personal (Web) is refusing to sync on the PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91a98c8c-6afd-4ddb-b58e-be19b58f7977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91a98c8c-6afd-4ddb-b58e-be19b58f7977" /></a></p>
<p>Hitting "sync again" doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, i can resolve sync errors on Android and iOS versions by signing out of my account and signing back in, but that doesn't work. I have the Office 365 version of OneNote too, which gives the same error, with the slightly more helpful error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"It looks like the notebook folder was deleted, so OneNote can't sync to it.&nbsp; If it becomes available again, OneNote will resume sync. You can also sync it to a new location in Notebook Properties, or close the notebook if you don't need it anymore".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't (deliberately) deleted or changed the location of the notebook. (D:\Dropbox\Documents\OneNote Notebooks\Personal (Web)"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign into Onenote.com I can see the notebook, but it's very out of date (several weeks' worth of notes are missing). Same on iOS -- it's saying it can't sync and hasn't been able to do for 9 days. But the Android app isn't reporting any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the version of the Notebook I am seeing on my phone (the Android app) is more recent than the versions on my other devices, but I can't see how to update the others with the Android version. I thought I had it sorted yesterday, but when I try
 to synchronise today, I get "Error code: 0xE0000063".</p>

            Useless generic advice, but luckily I found people online who knew what they were talking about: created a new notebook, copied sections across, deleted the old notebook.

<h2>            Cannot list messages in Yammer group &#40;android&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Using android Yammer app 5.4.14.1341</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one particular group I cannot display the list of messages at all. &nbsp;When I press the group from "My Groups", a message is displayed "Sorry, we couldn't connect to Yammer. Please check your data connection and try again later." &nbsp;In all other groups I can
 get the list of messages just fine and all works well, just this one group. &nbsp;The only difference I can see is that it happens to be a group that I created, the rest were created by someone else. &nbsp;It is marked "Public" like the rest. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that I can see the conversations in that group (in which I am involved) if I display my Profile and press "See Conversations" at the bottom. &nbsp;Still I cannot LIST the messages in the group as a whole.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hello Stuart,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would request you kindly login to yammer in browser and check in that the group is still active or not. Are you able to post from browser in that group or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using yammer enterprise network and a verified admin than you can navigate to yammer network -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network Admin -&gt; Export Data -&gt; Export.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the downloaded zip folder you will find a file as groups.csv in that you can find that group is currently active or not by checking the value in deleted column as true or false.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please let me know if you have any further query or concerns. Please to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes I can post into the group using the browser, as can other users. &nbsp;We use it daily. &nbsp;In fact, even when the error message displays that it could not connect to Yammer, I can still post into that group using mobile, but cannot list messages in that group.</p>

 access my emails because the UI interface seems to be having some problems with it's coding and is covering all the emails I need to get to. My email currently looks like this:</span>

<div>Anything I click just refreshes the page and doesn't allow me access to anything. I've tried all the browsers I have too, and tried to access it on my phone. I've even tried clearing my cache. It makes no difference.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to report it as a problem to Microsoft but that page and MSN.co.uk are also suffering from the same problems. I tried chatting to a MS assistant via web chat, but they've just sent me here.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Thank you for bringing up this issue to our attention. We can imagine how inconvenient it must be for you to be unable to access your emails properly. We'll be happy to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please verify what you mean by this: it started loading funny meaning that I couldn't access my emails because the UI interface seems to be having some problems with it's coding and is covering all the emails I need to get to. Did you get an error message?
 If yes, what are the complete details of the error message? This will help us identify what could possibly causing the issue.

            Same here. First the pages take a very long time loading, then the outlook email display is in text-only, left aligned. Buttons either don't react to click/ double click or take a very long time to carry out commands, such as open email or sign out.
<div>I, too, tried to report it as a problem to Microsoft but as you said, that page and MSN.co.uk are also suffering from the same problems.&nbsp;</div>

Hi, I've resolved the problem now. It seems to be an issue with the DNS and my ISP, Virgin Media. As I said in my original message, I could not access the status page as the problem was causing all pages on that network to respond incorrectly. The DNS problem
 was causing the code on the page to malfunction, thus not allowing it to display correctly. I have changed my DNS server settings to those suggested in another thread and the problem has been resolved. Thank you for your response though.&nbsp;

<h2>            Outlook hijacked all of my AOL email. How do I remove the mail from Outlook and restore on AOL&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded iTunes on my PC with the intent of using it to sync my iPhone to the PC in order to backup calendar and contents on the PC. (I have no intention of using Outlook for email). &nbsp;As soon as I opened Outlook (MS Office Small Business 2007) all
 of my AOL mail (over 2000 pieces) dumped into Outlook and were longer accessible on AOL. How do I move these 2000 + pieces back to AOL?

            Well, the answer is...you probably can't.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>MAYBE if you set up Outlook to use IMAP to connect to your AOL account you could see if it will sync the messages back to the AOL inbox. &nbsp;More likely...AOL doesn't have any mechanism for pushing messages back up to the server once you've downloaded them.</div>

            Thanks Ben. Not exactly the answer I wanted to hear. I'm barely familiar with using Outlook for calendar and contacts and nothing else. Consequently I don't know how "setting up Outlook to use IMAP to connect to AOL," as you've said,&nbsp;would work. I'm waiting
 on a call back from 2nd tier tech&nbsp;support at AOL but am not hopeful. The scariest thing is that I don't know this happened to begin with so would have no idea how to avoid in the future. It would appear that Outlook was set up as a default of some sort.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that the display issue is specific to Google website. I would suggest you to refer to the section “<b>Why are webpages blank or displaying incorrectly?”</b>
 in the following article to resolve the issue:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Videos won't play or webpages don't display correctly</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Do not try to reset the Internet Explorer settings. The Reset Internet
 Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before
 you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hello. Your title and question don't match up. Your phone can't be running XP so I am assuming it is running WM 5. Cingular did have an update for this phone but all the links appear to be broken. You will have to go to a Cingular store and ask them to
 find the update and instructions for you.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You can upgrade your .net framework but what version are you running now? Is there a program you are trying to run that requires a different version?</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can't upgrade the phone to Windows Phone 7 due to hardware limitations.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t open PDF within Excel Workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beaumonts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open PDF within Excel Workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel Workbook with some PDF's inserted. &nbsp;I am having problems opening the PDF's within the Workbook on 1 PC. &nbsp;It works fine on all the other PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message i get is "This workbook contains links to one or more external sources that could be unsafe. &nbsp;If you trust the links, update them to get the latest data. &nbsp;Otherwise you can keep working with the data you have" if i click Update or Don't
 Update the same thing happens a second message "We can't update some of the links in your workbook right now. &nbsp;You can continue without updating their values, or edit the links you think are wrong". &nbsp;I click continue the Workbook crashes. &nbsp;If i click Edit
 Links a new window opens giving me various options to Update Values, Check Status, Open Source etc but whatever i do the Workbook crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Workbook is stored on a Server and everyone in the office can open it no problem apart from one person. &nbsp;All the PC's have Windows 7 and Excel 2013 same version on each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-installing Excel but not made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any ideas?</p>

            <p>The installer file for Office for Windows can not be used to install Office on a Mac. The installer is a completely different file format, not a Windows executable program (.exe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Marby suggested, you should download the Mac installer. However, be aware that the product key for Office for Windows can not be used with Office for Mac. If you purchased the wrong version, you're not out of luck. You can install Office for Windows if
 you buy a copy of Microsoft Windows and install that into BootCamp on your Mac or install Windows in Parallels (not free) on your Mac.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have just installed Office 2010 and have kept Office 2007 and I am having a "problem" with Word. Each time I open either version&nbsp;it goes through the configuration process. Is there any way to stop this? It doesn't take long but I'd rather not have it if
 possible. It doesn't happen with Excel and PowerPoint.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            That is a common problem with dual installations. Windows and office work from the base assumption that there is no reason to have more than one version of office installed. Therefore, each time you start an app that is a different version than currently
 active in the registry, it must mean you just installed it and obviously want to replace the currently installed one. WRONG.&nbsp; The fix is a simple registry "hack".<br />
<br />
Here are links to the articles I've used to make multiple copies work reasonably well together:<br />

<p>
<span>This tip describes the specific steps and choices during the 2010 custom install. After you have the multiple versions installed you still have some additional steps to do. They are described in this tip:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762</a>
</span></p>
<p>With multiple versions installed, there is one issue you can’t avoid, Default Windows File Associations. Only one app can be used to open the files by double clicking in Windows Explorer. You have to pick which one.</p>

<span>Personal Supplemental instructions</span>
<p>MS tends to put everything in separate folders and with long wordy names.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to consolidate things somewhat.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I navigated to the “Start” menu and edited folder and shortcut names to be more concise.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created a single “Microsoft Office” folder and migrated all of the shortcuts into it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created shortcuts to the 3 “2003 to 2007 Interactive Command References”. Then I started renaming the shortcuts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In my case I had Office 2003 and Office 2007, so I renamed them as follows:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>“2003 Excel”<br />
“2003 PowerPoint”<br />
“2003 Word”<br />
“2007 Excel”<br />
“2007 Excel 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 Word”<br />
“2007 Word 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
etc…</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Word 2003<br />
Word 2007<br />
Word 2010<br />
Word 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
Excel 2003<br />
Excel 2007<br />
Excel 2010<br />
Excel 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
etc…</p>
<p>As well, I decided to keep both sets of ``Office Tools`, so I kept one folder and renamed the shortcuts using the same pattern, ie starting with the year.</p>
<p>I also do custom installations, specifying unique installation folders to further separate the installations. It isn't completely successful, some common folders are still used, &nbsp;but it seems to help.</p>
<p>Microsoft's recommendations are incomplete regarding Word - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</span></a> for further recommendations with regard
 to shared resources that are better not shared.</p>
<p>Office apps also work better also if their startup folders are not shared.</p>
<p>In the case of Excel I would relocate the contents of the (Excel 2003) XLSTART folder to a new sub folder of the existing XLSTART -The start-up folder location is stored in the registry at<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>Set the value to match the sub new folder name e.g. Office11XLSTART. That should sort out Excel 2003. Create a similar sub folder and registry entries for Office 2010 i.e.Office14XLSTART and at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Xlstart</p>
<p>The same idea applies to Word’s startup and template folders.</p>

<p>For the last two weeks Office 365 undergoes "maintenance" for about 3 hours in the morning and documents are in read only mode.&nbsp; How long will this continue for?&nbsp; As a business using 365 we need access to it and if this maintenance is scheduled why is it
 not scheduled during a time when people are not using the site?</p>

    <title>Problem adding the EU Zoho Projects Tab to Teams - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem adding the EU Zoho Projects Tab to Teams</h2>
                    We're trying to add the Zoho Projects tab to a Teams conversation. I click the + in the conversation, I get the list of available options, I click Zoho Projects. A new window pops up in which I'm to choose .com or .eu and then click Proceed. If I click
 .com and Proceed I get the login screen for Zoho. Instead if I click .eu and Proceed nothing happens. I thought this might just be a temporary bug, but it's been a few weeks with no change. I guess not too many people are using this feature. And just to pre-empt
 the question if you log in to zoho.com with zoho.eu credentials it will tell you to logout and use the right creds. Additionally this happens in the App or in the browser version (in any number of browsers) so this is clearly an issue on the backend. Also
 how is Teams not one of the "category" options for questions here?

            <p>Hi eager2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased to help you receive emails from that certain sender again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to make sure that someone gets in your inbox is to add them to your
<strong>safe senders list</strong>. This is to make sure that the incoming emails from that address will&nbsp;go directly to your inbox. To do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. From the Hotmail Options screens under <b>Preventing junk email</b>, click <b>
Safe and blocked senders</b>.</p>
<p>2. Click <b>Safe Senders</b>. </p>
<p>3. In the text box, type in the email address or domain you’d like to always receive email from, and then click
<b>Add to list &gt;&gt;</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">It will also help if you can provide us with your <strong>
</strong><font><strong>affected email address</strong> and the<strong> sender's email account</strong> that you are having problems with<strong>.</strong></font> This will allow us to investigate the issue in our end and provide an appropriate solution.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Note</em></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: For security purposes, please post&nbsp;the email accounts on the

            Hi Cherry Anne,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for offering to help me. &nbsp;I first want to say that I did enter the sender's email in the safe senders list. &nbsp;But I did this after the company had sent the test email to me, so I do not know if it actually helped. &nbsp;However I do know that none of
 their emails ended up in the Junk email section. &nbsp;I always check that list before I delete those emails. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My email address is xxxxxxxx.com</div>
<div><br />
<div>The sender is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com</div>
<div><br />
<div>I look forward to what you find.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div><br />

<h3> ireneab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking one form field to multiple tables</h2>
                    <p>My employer wants 1 form created that&nbsp;places information out to multiple tables. Many of the tables overlap with similar information. (Ex: Each patient fills out a packet depending on their pain and localization of the pain. Many of the packets have the
 same questions, and many of the patients have overlapping pain, so they fill out multiple packets. He wants to enter the information in a form 1 time, but be able to analyze it depending on the packet (ex: back pain or hip pain or shoulder pain)).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am lost as to how to link the tables to one form, so that the information only has to be entered one time, but will be placed in multiple tables. I have tried to do a LookUp table with the packets as entities and the questions as attributes, but each question
 has a specific numeric or short text answer to it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am lost. Please help!</p>

            Duplicate data should never be stored in more than one table; that is one of the basic rules of the database relational model.&nbsp; Each table's columns must represent attributes of the entity type which the table is modelling,
<em>and only of that entity type</em>.&nbsp; So a Patients table would, in addition to a numeric PatientID or similar as its primary key, have columns such as FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth etc.&nbsp; In the language of the relational model these non-key columns are
 said to be <em>functionally determined</em> by the table's primary key.<br />
<br />
I can't be categorical about what other tables you'd need without knowing a lot more about the real world situation being modelled by the database, but you almost certainly should not have separate tables for each locality of pain&nbsp; being experienced by patients.&nbsp;
 The locality of pain is data, and data is represented in one way only, as values at column positions in rows in tables.&nbsp; Having a table for each locality is encoding data as table names, and is not legitimate within the rules of the relational model.&nbsp; So you'd
 model this with a table&nbsp; PainLocalities say, which would have column PainLocality and one row for each locality in which pain might be experienced.<br />
<br />
A patient's experience of pain is a many-to-many relationship type between Patients and PainLocalities, and is modelled by a third table, PatientPain say (I'm sure you can think of more appropriate names for the tables which better describe the entity type
 being modelled).&nbsp; This table is the database's representation of the packets being filled out by the patients, but while the physical packet will include their personal details the table does not as these are already stored in Patients.&nbsp; It resolves the many-to-many
 relationship type into two one-to-many relationship types by having two foreign key columns, i.e.<br />
<br />
PatientPain<br />
....PatientID<br />
....PainLocality <br />
<br />
In addition it will have other columns which represent non-key attributes of the relationship type, i.e. the information a patient enters into each packet in relation to their experience of the pain at that locality.&nbsp; So other columns in this table might be
 PacketDate (when they fill it in), and columns about the severity, duration etc of the pain.&nbsp; Some of these columns may well be foreign keys referencing other tables.<br />
<br />
For data entry in a case like this you would normally use a form in single form view based on the Patients table, and within that a subform based on the PatientPain table.&nbsp; The subform would be linked to the parent form on PatientID, and can be in single or
 continuous forms view as desired.&nbsp; The PatientID column's value is entered automatically by the linking mechanism, so you'd have controls in the form bound to the other columns only.&nbsp; Where the column is a foreign key referencing another table its control
 would be a combo box, e.g. the control for PainLocality&nbsp; would be combo box with a RowSource property of:<br />
<br />
SELECT PainLocality FROM PainLocalities ORDER BY PainLocality;<br />
<br />
For analysis of the data on the basis of a specific pain locality a simple query can be created which returns only the data for that locality, e.g.<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS [Enter pain locality:] TEXT(255);<br />
SELECT FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth,<br />
PacketDate, PainLocation, Severity, Duration<br />
FROM Patients INNER JOIN PatientPain<br />
ON Patients.PatientID = PatientPain.PatientID<br />
WHERE PainLocation = [Enter pain locality:]<br />
ORDER BY LastName,FirstName, PacketDate DESC;<br />
<br />
This would return rows for all patient who have reported pain at the locality entered at the prompt, with rows ordered by patient, and for each, by the date of the reports with the latest first.&nbsp; Opening a form based on this query for instance would prompt
 for the pain locality and open the form restricted to that entered at the prompt.<br />
<br />
While a simple parameter prompt like that above is a cheap and cheerful way of restricting the rows returned, a better and more flexible way is by using controls in an unbound dialogue form to enter the parameters.&nbsp; You'll find examples in MultiSelect.zip in
 my public databases folder at:<br />

            <p>As indicated, this all starts with table design. You need to spend some time designing the tables properly. As Ken said, data should only be in one table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to enter data into multiple tables from a single form you use subforms. Since what you are referring to is primarily a survey, you need a specific structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblQuestion</p>
<p>QuestionID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblResponse</p>
<p>ResponseID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>PatientID (FK)</p>
<p>ResponseDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblAnswer</p>
<p>AnswerID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ResponseID (FK)</p>
<p>QuestionID (FK)</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also seem to have a many to many relationship between Questions and Packets. A question can be in multiple packets and a packet can have multiple questions. So you need 2 more tables to model that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblPacket</p>
<p>PacketID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>Packet</p>
<p>
</p><p>tjxPacketQuestion</p>
<p>PacketQuestionID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>PacketID</p>
<p>QuestionID</p>

            First, you should NEVER have to exit out of an app to allow a user to do data entry. That you had to do that indicates your&nbsp;environment&nbsp;is not&nbsp;designed&nbsp;properly. Your app should be split between a back end (the tables) and a front end (everything else).
 The back end is then stored on a network share while the front end is stored locally on each user's machine. At the least you have a production front end stored on the network.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then you have a development front end. THAT is where you make all your changes, test them, make sure they work properly and THEN put the new front end into production.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now to answer your question, did you try doing a compact and repair? Having a single file for an app is an invitation to corruption. The only thing I can tell from that info, is the crash probably occurred running some VBA code. Try the Compact and repair,
 then split the app and set it up properly.</div>

<p><b><u>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </u></b></p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys for retail licenses, but not for Retail sale. They are intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a
 subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. It is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>What probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/</a> Click the 'Validate Windows' button. If the validation check fails, then you are going to have to buy your product again. You should contact
 the vendor for a refund. Depending on where they are in the scam cycle they may give you the refund or they will string you along with delays. You should also contact your credit card company to cancel the transaction or to at the very least give them a heads
 up on the scam so that they can deny the scammer any further sales.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to report the vendor to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-7-ultimate-activation/www.microsoft.com/piracy">

<p>Second, it may be an access rights problem. There are 2 possible fixes for it. Either activate using "Run As Admin" or "Take Ownership" of the problem drive folders and registry entries. I have provided links to several articles for these
 types of fixes. Pick one that you can follow and try it.</p>

</i></span></p>
<p><span>FYI: for this situation, you can consider Vista and Win7 to be essentially interchangeable with only minor differences between the user interface in the 2 versions.</span></p>
<p><span>In Win7, even when you are logged in as administrator, UAC no longer gives you “Full” administrator rights. To get all of the access you now also have “run as administrator”
</span></p>
<p><span>It appears there is an error where your userid is not being allowed to update the activation information in the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>The general process is :</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Close all of the office apps</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start one of the Office apps using any one of the following “run as admin” techniques</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Activate office</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Close the app</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start it normally, confirm the message has “gone away”</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If the message is gone, reboot the computer</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start the office app again to confirm that the message really is gone for good (was saved in the registry)</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>What you need to do is "runas admin":</b></span></p>
<p><span>•<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Go to the start menu and find the program icon you want to start</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select “Run</span> as …”</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>If that doesn’t work try this: </b></span></p>

</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;runas</span> admin should be there.</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Activate the application/office: </b></span></p>

    <title>Microsoft 2010 home and student backup installation and product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baharener  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 2010 home and student backup installation and product key problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have recently downloaded the backup version of my liscensed Microsoft 2010 product. It asked me for the product key and I used that to install the setup program to my computer. However when I tried to use the office programs, a small window to verify my
 product key opened and I cliked the online verification/validation button to finish the activation process of the office. However it gave me a message that my product key was not valid and since then I have been using the microsoft office as the trial version.
 The online activation tool is not accepting my valid product key and I do not know how else to download it to my computer as I can not use the disk for the installation. I was refferd to the call center but I could not find a contact number for Turkey so basically
 I have nobody to contact. Can you please help me with this situation?</p>

 &gt;</span></p>
<p><span>please try the steps below to see if there is any improvement (some of the steps you may have done before, please go through the whole process again):</span></p>
<p><span>1. Delete the previous credentials via Control Panel &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials and remove all Office related credentials one by one.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do a full online repair via Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Select the Microsoft Office 365 product &gt; click Change &gt; Select Online Repair.</span></p>

<p>It appears to be a new feature &lt;sarcasm&gt;.&nbsp; MS takes your money and runs ... &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, all you can do is contact MS Support and waste many hours fighting with them to get what you paid for.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>If you just bought it, you can also contact your credit card company and ask them to reverse the charge because the product is defective.&nbsp; Hitting MS in the wallet is one way for small customers to get their attention.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>You can also take your problem public. Post on twitter. A public expression of your problem is more likely to get their attention.

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Sorry, there is no good answer to that. If you, and all the others with this problem start tweeting it, making it more public, maybe then MS will finally be inspired to find the fix to the
 problem.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has a number of dedicated teams that do this kind of support explicitly:
<a href="https://twitter.com/winphonesupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@WinPhoneSupport</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/xboxsupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@XboxSupport</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/microsofthelps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@MicrosoftHelps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/windowssupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@WindowsSupport</a>.</p>
<p>Social media teams on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@Office</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@Surface</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@Microsoft</a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it is a product key problem, the best place to contact is the activation center.&nbsp; Start the activation process, and select Phone Activation to get the phone number you need. When you phone in, don't reply to the first prompts. Wait until you are given
 the option of talking to a live Service Rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem. If the first person you talk to can't help, ask to speak to a supervisor.</p>
