<h2>            Exporting contacts &#40;with Photos&#41; from Outlook 2016 MAC to Google&#47;Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Working in local (no exchange server) and because there is no sync between Google/Contacts &amp; Calendar and Outlook 2016 i am continuing using Outlook on my Mac and use Google to sync with my other devices (iPhone, iPad). I face a challenge to move all my
 5,000+ contacts from Outlook 2016 Mac to Google contacts mainly because the CSV format doesn't support the photos in the contact cards... Do you have an idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks !</p>

            <p>Dear Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support. I did manage to solve the problem as follow:</p>
<p>- Moving all my contacts from Outlook into a dedicated folder on my desktop</p>
<p>- Moving all my contacts, now in VCF format, (including the pictures) from this folder into "Apple contacts" (drag &amp; drop)</p>
<p>&nbsp; by hundreds each time in oder to find those having a problem to move (famous
<strong>No importable cards were found.)</strong></p>
<p>- All together i found ±25 contacts out of 5,088 with this problem. I tried but did not succeed to understand where the problem is coming from... Nothing particular in these contacts, no blank characters, no special characters neither.</p>
<p>- If you move the 5,000 in one shot, when it reaches the one having this problem, the move stop there. This is the reason i had initially a lot that were not moving...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very unfortunates that Microsoft is not developing the sync capability between Office/Outlook and Google for the contacts and the calendar the same way they did it for the emails... I acquired the license a complete license of Office and I am not able
 to send an email accessing the contacts that are now in a separate application... a mess !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks !</p>

<h2>            ieframe.dll application crashes caused by KB2977629&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The September 9 patch cycle brought KB<span>2977629, the </span><span>Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 11.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Never experienced any issues with IE security updates in the past, I was surprised to find out&nbsp;that
</span>ieframe.dll caused a crash in Internet Explorer 11 or Cubase Elements 7. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To test the hypothesis, I removed the patch and the issue seems to be gone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it a faulty patch or a faulty installation? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this issue be resolved?</p>
<p>

            <p>It turned out the problem has nothing to do with our custom IDocHostUIHandler implementation as the AV is reproducable without it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is that terminating the last WebBrowser control which has a delayed background JavaScript code causes TLS (shared memory) becoming garbled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We fixed the AV by creating a hidden WebBrowser control on first demand and keeping it alive for the lifetime of the process. Still testing but seems stable for now.</p>

            <p>I agree with this assessment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many software vendors recommend removing this update (and others in some cases):&nbsp;AutoDesk's is to uninstall this update (and two others). They seem to suggest there are a number of crash scenarios related to this update issue.&nbsp; Recommendations of this ilk
 are <a href="http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/AutoCAD-crashes-after-installing-Windows-security-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, our application opens a HtmlHelp window. As long as that window remains open, everything is fine. Once that window is closed... boom our app crashes. &nbsp;Uninstalling update&nbsp;KB2977629 resolves the problem.</p>

<h2>            Why does the &#34;undo&#34; function keep getting greyed-out in MS Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using the MS office 365 proplus. When I'm using Word, sometimes the undo button is greyed out, and I can't undo with ctrl+z, it just doesn't do anything, as if there's nothing to undo even though I typed a lot of stuff right before.</p>
<p>I corrected this problem before manually by editing the level of undo in word in the registry entry, which somehow became "0" even though I never changed it. But now it is happening again.</p>
<p>It would be extremely frustrating to modify the registry entry every now and then (if that's even the problem). So I would like to know what's causing the undo button to lose function in the first place.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            There are certain actions, such as locking/unlocking forms, that clear the Undo stack. I believe I've seen this behavior with content controls as well.

            If holding the Esc key (or Cmd-.) down - try for more than just a few seconds - doesn't work, your only recourse may be to Force Quit. With any luck, AutoRecover will have saved all or most of your work.
<div><br />
<div>To force VBA to scan for the Esc key, put a DoEvents function command within your loop during debugging, e.g.:</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Public Sub MySub()</div>
<div>#Const cbDebug = True</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;your code here&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;#If cbDebug Then&nbsp;</div>
<div>DoEvents</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;#End If</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;your loop code here&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Loop Until &lt;something&gt;&nbsp;</div>

After much conversation the chat session just ended abruptly without even a comment about finishing from "(Manager) Steven".

I have checked my paypal account and as of this morning there is still no refund of this money which was taken erroneously.

<br />
<br />
I spent some considerable time talking to (Manager) Steven trying to resolve the issue and he then cut off the communication.&nbsp; I waited for some time for him to contact me either by mobile (Mod Removed), email to the account holder&nbsp;(Mod Removed) or by email
 to the Paypal account (Mod Removed) from which the payments were taken.&nbsp; Nothing!
<br />
<br />
He told us that there would have been email notifications sent 2 weeks prior to billing but we can find no trace of any email notification for these payments although we did get a confirmation email when we cancelled the music subscription.
<br />
<br />
I am amazed that (Manager) Steven thinks so little of Microsoft's reputation that he would take such a cavalier action and just drop the link without attempting to resolve the issue or re-establish communication.
<br />
<br />
I will wait for your comment on this before taking things further.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>They have a wide range of tools, and are the only people that can issue refunds. Please also note: Once you pay for your first membership though the Xbox Live marketplace, this turns on Automatic Renewal for that membership once it has come to an&nbsp;end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For help cancelling auto renewal, please look at this article here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can follow the on screen instructions, as it tells you how to turn off auto renewal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to point out, there is no way of emailing Xbox support anymore. If&nbsp; you had used the email option, from an old game book or a friend. Then this option was abandoned two years ago.

            This is&nbsp;**** I have now have several, SEVERAL, isues with billing from Microsoft/xbox! I have contacted a lawyer due to the nature of my commplaints. Although i have canceled SEVERAL times my auto renewal and have talked in person with a couple representatives
 and EMAILS.. it had been fixed at one point and I am still getting charged for services I have not asked for. When i call i get put on old for hours and if/when i ACTUALLY talk to someone it seems as though they hang up on me. XBOX IS THE WORST SERVICE EVER!
 I would never reccomendem nor will i ever purchase another xbox product. Its unfortunate that Microsoft is almost a neccessity or i would boycot them as well.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Internet Calendar won&#39;t sync until &#34;Clear offline items&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a stubborn outlook 2016 internet calendar that doe not sync until I go into that calendar properties and "Clear offline items". It works for couple of days until I have to "Clear offline items" again.</p>
<p><span>That calendar is maintained by someone else, I have "read-only" access, but because of this sync problem I have lost some events.</span></p>
<p>Recently I moved to a new PC and recreate all the Outlook accounts (so that calendar's OST file is brand new) but the problem is the same.</p>
<p>Is there a way to make it not to cache or automatically clear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>L.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you are sure there are records that meet ALL of the criteria maybe the parentheses are causing a flawed logic. Remove all of them and also change this:</p>
<p>Table_1.Field_7 like "*"&amp;"Ret"&amp;"*"</p>
<p>-to this-</p>
<p>Table_1.Field_7 like "*Ret*"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further debugging would be to start with one criterion and test. Then add the next one and test. And so forth.</p>

<h2>            SUGGESTION&#58; Scheduled modus&#47;profiles</h2>
                    
<p>The following functionalities already exist on - for example - a E72:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Moduses</li><li>Timed Profiles</li><li>Calendar</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets combine these things. It would be great if you could make a schedule for automatic change of modus and/or profiles.</p>
<p>For example you specify that on working days from 9:00 till 17:30 you want the business-modus and the meeting-profile activated. Then at 17:30 the phone should&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;switch to personal-modus and normal-profile.</p>

<p>Weid1374, sure that would be great to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, whats the use of teh 2 modes really? I do not understand it as ALL your appointments, contacts, etc are visible in BOTH the modes, so why would anyone bother changing the modes (when all you see is the same info, only in a different background screen
 color)??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone care to explain what the modes function really is? Or give is some example?</p>

<p>The Modes are simply to give your phones desktop a different look. So like you say you can have a different&nbsp; looking theme, wallpaper...but also you can specify different email account notifications and application icons to appear and use when at work for
 instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I don't work anymore and simply only use one mode and I doubt I would have used different modes anyway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are applications out there that can alter various settings depending on GPS and/or cell location and also by scheduling - I've tried a few on trial but they ain't for me :smileywink:</p>

<p>There are 3rd party applications that have those options plus lots more.</p>
<p>I use Best Profiles from Smartphoneware. It's awesome, google it.</p>

<h2>            Carrier dependant features missing and what to do about it</h2>
                    <p>I'm on my 3rd Windows Phone, with a 3rd carrier.&nbsp; [Nokia920 w/AT&amp;T, HTC-7HD w/T-Mobile, now Nokia Icon w/Verizon]</p>
<p>
</p><p>My <strong>two previous phones had </strong>the Settings&gt;Lock Screen Timeout&gt; NEVER option.&nbsp; Out of the box, the new 2014&nbsp;<strong>Verizon Nokia Icon was missing
</strong>the NEVER timeout setting.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Black (Cortana) update, same thing.&nbsp; So&nbsp;my brand new&nbsp;phone locks and goes dark every 5 minutes.&nbsp; Great if you are driving, or watching a stock ticker, or doing anything else where you can't fuss with the phone 20x per hour to keep it from
 sleeping.&nbsp; Live tiles are not so cute if the phone is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even want to dwell on whether this community prioritizes the issue.&nbsp; Its some kind of issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its&nbsp;a user setting that has nothing to do with a carrier, but apparently is carrier build&nbsp;dependent and unaffected by Microsoft OS version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who's problem is it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who do you inform?&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Why&nbsp;would this simple Settings issue be a carrier dependent problem and not a correctable Microsoft OS problem</strong>?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 4 years, I've posted the bug to Microsoft, HTC, Nokia, Verizon, T-Mobile boards.&nbsp; The typical answer is "That's not our issue, its (insert Msft/Nokia/CarrierX)".&nbsp; The other is usually some points troll saying you should not use your phone while driving
 and that its a non-issue to them.&nbsp; Both great answers.&nbsp; The most honest reply came from HTC, who said "some settings are carrier build dependent and out of our hands unfortunately".&nbsp; I believe them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>History FYI: The HTC-7 started out at T-Mobile with the NEVER setting missing.&nbsp; It appeared after Mango, and&nbsp;after an update about 2 months later.</p>
<p>A year or so later I upgraded to their HTX-8X at T-Mobile it was MISSING again.&nbsp; So I returned the device, dumped the carrier and went to AT&amp;T because the 920 had the setting.&nbsp; After the Cortana update, the AT&amp;T phone still HAD the setting (ie not OS version
 dependent)&nbsp; Now at Verizon, its back again.&nbsp; I</p>

                    I would like to take notes and use the pen on microsoft word. Whenever I use my pen, it goes directly to the "draw" tab. However, whenever I want to erase something, it erases the entire stroke that I drew. How do I get it so that I only erase one part
 of what I've drawn?

<p>I understand that you would like to use your primary email address for sending emails using Outlook.com. What you can use is our Send and Receive from other email accounts option. You would be able to use a different email address when sending emails, you
 can also receive emails from other accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the steps below to use this option: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to your <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account</a>.</li><li>Click on the cog on the upper right hand corner next to your name.</li><li>Click on <strong>More Mail Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under Managing your account. click on <strong>Your email accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Add a Send Only Account</strong> under Add an email account.</li></ol>
<p>This would give you the option to use this email for sending only.</p>

    <title>Nokia 9300 Screen colours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuart294  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 9300 Screen colours</h2>
                    I have bought a second hand 9300. The colours in the Colour/Symbol marking for the calendar are very 'pastel'. The entries copied from my 9210 have very bright, strong colour so I know the phone is capable of displaying brighter colours but any new ones
 I make come out dull. Also the colours of the phone interface are likewise lacking in strength. I have tried various colour schemes and altering the contrast but nothing seems to strengthen the colours up to 'normal' (what my 9210 was capable of). Is there
 some way of setting the colour 'strength'? Has some application installed by the previous owner modified the colours and how do I get them back?<br />
<br />
Ideas anyone?

            I'm afraid the phone operates as designed in this respect; different display, different colour schemes.

                    &nbsp;Hello! I have a wm 5.0 (os 5.1.478 build 15706.3.5.2) device with msfp(messaging and Security Feature Pack).Plus i have a sim-card that allows me to connect to vpn.<br />
Ive set&nbsp;the configuration of it and when i tried to connect to internet i've recived&nbsp;"The answering modem has disconnected.To check your connection setting and change them if needed,tap Setting".<br />
Then i tried that sim card on other PPC(without msfp and it had wm 6.1)-it worked...i suggest the reason in msfp(maybe it is blocking the&nbsp;connection)-i&nbsp; haven't exchange and&nbsp;i didnt set&nbsp;its properties for device,so can it be truth?If so can msfp be disabled?

            Hey&nbsp;carlislenichole,
<div><br />
<div>Well the best way to fix this is to ask your husband to stop deleting files he doesn't recognize. =D</div>
<div><br />
<div>But on a serious note, I've never heard of this error before. If your husband deleted the Microsoft User Data folder out of your Documents folder, I could easily see something like this happening. If that's the case, you'll need to reinstall Office for
 Mac.&nbsp;If you need to re-install, please be sure to remove Office 2011 as described on the following links:</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/outlook/item/9e879258-ed91-43d0-94b8-002c3292fdc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video |

 2011</a></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your Microsoft User Data folder is still intact, let’s see if your issue is machine or user specific by creating a new user account and then testing. Follow the steps on the link below to create a new user account:</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you've created the new account, log into it and test. Does the same issue occur?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me know the results!</p>

<h2>            when I open a document on word the font size isn&#39;t what it says it is supposed to be.</h2>
                    When I open the same document on a different computer, it displays it correctly. &nbsp;On the messed up computer, it displays it in a much smaller font size, but says it is a larger size. &nbsp;Example, It says Times New Roman 14, but it is really font size 9. &nbsp;Also
 with columns and tabs are in the wrong place.

<h2>            Switch from 32-bit to 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    My have&nbsp;Windows 7 Professional, 64-bit. Last week I installed Office Professional 2013, 32-bit. Upon reflection, is it possible to uninstall it and&nbsp;install the 64-bit version instead? What's involved?

            Yes.<br />
<br />
Nothing fancy.&nbsp; Just uninstall the 32 bit installation, boot the computer, download the 64 bit installer, run it, activate it with the same product key.<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
Do you NEED to do it? MS still recommends you use 32 bit unless you have specific need for 64 bit. That need is typically defined spreadsheets that use 2GB of RAM or any file that is nearing 2GB file size.<br />
<br />
The reason for the 32 bit recommendation is simple. Many addon providers still do not provide 64 bit versions of their addons. That includes MS!<br />

<p>Hi Simon,<br />
<br />
In Outlook 2016, you can set up auto BCC to your CRM with a new rule. To set it up, please perform the verified solution provided by
<strong>snavely8</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_other/set-up-auto-bcc-in-outlook-2016/04bb2807-16d4-4641-a48e-19ba3f34ff26">link</a></strong>.<br />

            We apologize for the delayed response due to a technical issue. As of now, you can only set up auto CC to a CRM especially when we create rules in Outlook client. This was also informed by one of our Microsoft team on the link I provided in the previous
 post. However, we would appreciate if you could raise this to our Outlook team as a feedback by using the
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Suggestion Box</a></strong> so that we they could add this as a new feature in Outlook.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Instant Search  - Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have a situation where an old email address comes up in the Instant Search Box in O365 when I am selecting for a particular recipient of an email, and I want to permanently remove the old email address which is very similar to the new email address. Both
 emails appear, but the old email&nbsp;keeps getting selected by mistake. I do not even want the old email to be available for selection.</p>
<p>When the&nbsp;addresses came up in the search window, there is a small X at the right of each email, and I clicked that, but that just removes it from the current recent list. The next time I searched for the old address, it appeared again! I need a way of removing
 the very existence of the email address from the Instant Search box.</p>

<p>Many thanks</p>

            Window management on multi-screen systems can be a problem.
<br />
<br />Especially if you always want to have certain windows in certain sizes at specific positions, then you can not handle that just using the Windows functionality.
<br />
<br />Just a suggestion, have a look at this tool:
<br /><a href="https://www.actualtools.com/windowmanager/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.actualtools.com/windowmanager/</a>
<br />
<br />I've been using it for many years and it's really great.
