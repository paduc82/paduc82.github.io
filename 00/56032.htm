<p>Unfortunately, that is the norm. Like other people said, there are things you can do to get rid of the messages and mute people but you can really never get away from it. It sucks but don't let that stop you from playing a good game.</p>
<p>Off topic but I've always wondered what it would be like if I came home and I found my dad playing BO. Personally, I think that would be cool as hell.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that, OP.&nbsp; Unfortunately, abuse and ridicule are things that fuel multi-player online.&nbsp; These kids rank up to 15th prestige and dominate noobs for fun.&nbsp; That's how they get their kicks.&nbsp; For most of the kids on there, it's not abuse, but rather
 harsh sportsmanship (like egging on a rival).&nbsp; But for some of the more sensitive players, the environment is unfriendly at best.&nbsp; That's why "online play is not rated".&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype Account Was Hacked, Contacted Support And Couldn&#39;t Verify The Account.. Need Professional Assistance</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Skype Agent / Community Moderator,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in now going on to be a 2-year or so battle for recovering my Skype account which I had created over 10 years ago, before Microsoft had even adopted Skype, and have now been forced to create a new account in order to post this question/request
 for regaining access to my original hacked account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I am living abroad in Japan, away from Canada where I had originally created the account over 10 years ago, and have attempted to log in only to have it display that "someone else may be accessing your account".&nbsp; &nbsp;Upon looking into resetting the
 password, I see that the email address has been changed to some random *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email which I have never heard of in my life, so now I can see that someone has hacked my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Skype support through the live chat a multitude of different times, only to be told that "the only method of reinstating the account is to fill in a reset request form".&nbsp; I have done that multiple times a year or so ago, to no avail (despite
 remembering a good amount of the friends who were on this account I have been building up over the 10 years I had it), and I am sure that the address used for creating it and postal code are also correct (along with my name of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all being said, I have been contacting with live chat support again this evening after seeing if the situation has changed a year later, and yet I am still met with the same dead end situation.&nbsp; I was escalated to a manager who said they would file
 a complaint that there is no way to have human-intervention and an investigation into the account details launched, and even offered "a voucher for a new account to use Skype on"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that everyone in support is just doing their job given the resources and processes which they have at their disposal, however my information is perfectly correct, and I need someone who can personally look into and move forward with an investigation
 into this in order to get back this account which I have been in ownership of for over 10 years, which is a part of my childhood with tons of family, friends, and other contacts' information which I will never have access to again by "creating a new account"
 ... and the voucher, while enticing, is nothing but an insult and an excuse for not being able to escalate this any further... making a new account solves nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I don't mean for this to turn into a rant, so any personal assistance from someone who can launch an investigation would be much appreciated. If it helps, my case# from support today was "1448047641".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jon J.</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience in recovering your Skype account. As you stated above, you have gone through several processes to recover it and you even contacted our chat support team.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in Skype community forums, we have limited access to your information, thus we can only advise the same process. Our chat support team is the last point of contact that you can speak with regarding your concern. All the information given by the representative
 is true and correct that the only way you can recover your account is by filling out the verification form. The account recovery process is fully automated and there is no one can have it manually checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not feel being insulted if we are offering you a voucher, this is only means that despite this unfortunate event,&nbsp;we&nbsp;value you as a customer of Microsoft and we want to retain you and stay with us enjoying our services.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to agree that it is so hard to move on especially if you want to get the contacts in your old account, the bond that was established through Skype&nbsp;with your friends, colleagues and family is everything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have to say it again, that I can only suggest is for you to create a new Skype account so you can still take advantage of Microsoft services.

 everything suddenly disappeared? Any explanations?</p>
<p>I can't provide much info on the recovery process, I don't know my secret answer, the only thing I know with this email is 1 person who I emailed before (it is a very old account) and the last 4 digits of the credit card info because I purchased a game using
 paypall on that account before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the profiles are no longer located on the storage device altogether, it means someone either went in and deleted them or the storage device itself had some sort of failure that caused it to lose some of its' saved files/data. &nbsp;I would recommend checking
 around in the memory area to see if you note any other data is missing as well, since it's unlikely that just those 3 things would be gone. &nbsp;Without you doing some basic troubleshooting and reporting back, it would be difficult for us to determine if just
 a few things are missing and you would be okay to redownload the profile or that it could be more severe and the entire storage device is wiped clean (which could be a total failure for the device itself, which makes trying to redownload the profiles a waste
 of time).</p>

            <p>Calculator in scientific mode no longer displays decimals. And I need to ran hex to decimal and viceversa conversions so it's annoying to have to switch between them all the time. Also, for some reason, the new calc takes forever to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with paint I miss the capability to paste an image and make transparent on it the currently selected secondary color:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ff6b03a-ad25-4924-92d1-8da76a100b44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ff6b03a-ad25-4924-92d1-8da76a100b44" /></a></p>
<p>It was really useful as a workaround for running color replacements.</p>

<h2>            Old drivers&#63; &#40;for old scanner&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, i found my old HP ScanJet 3400c and wanted to get it running. The&nbsp;<strong>PROBLEM</strong> is that the drivers are meant for Windows XP (I'm running Win 10).</p>
<p>Also, i found the old driver disc, installed drivers (SOMEHOW in compatibility mode), but no program detects it as connected.</p>
<p>Any solutions or bad luck trying?</p>

<p>Hey guys, sorry to hear about the sign-in issue! Have you had a chance to reset your network hardware? You can reset your modem and router by unplugging power to both for about 15 seconds. When restoring power, plug the modem in first, and then wait for
 all of the lights on the modem to come up. When those are all active, plug in the router. Once those lights are flashing normally, go ahead and run a LIVE connection test on the console.

<p>You can add me to the list of people with this problem. Have had the issue since yesterday (although my Xbox had been off for about a week before that, so who knows when it may have started).</p>
<p>Have tried restarting the router multiple times with no effect. If I keep retrying to connect, sometimes it will let me connect (after a long time thinking about it) and it will let me play online. Managed to play a couple of games of Gears 3 last night
 with the NAT shown as Open, and no noticeable speed errors. However, I was also playing Fruit Ninja after managing to connect, and my Xbox froze at the point of accessing the Live Leaderboards. This was repeatable each time I rebooted my Xbox. Unplugging my
 console from the network and playing offline didn't freeze.</p>

<p>I had this problem for a while after the power went out while I was installing an update. When I put the console back on it just flat out refused to sign in. Anyway what worked for me was deleting my profile from the xbox and then recovering it again. So
 for anyone else who has this problem you may want to try that.</p>

<h2>            High CPU usage when using Groove Music App</h2>
                    <p>From about a day, I have noticed that the Groove Music app uses a lot of CPU (86-95%) when the app is open, and it makes my mouse pointer stutter and takes a while for the music to load. I've tried to reset, change directories, etc., but nothing really helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before this, music would load instantly, and I could run about four or five apps without any problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove Music version: 10.17032.1033.0</p>

<h2>            &#34;WindowsUpdate_8024000E&#34; &#34;WindowsUpdate_dt000&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm a newbee at this sort of thing so please bear with me. I couldn't sign into one of my online bank accounts so I rang them and was told they had detected a virus on my laptop so they'd suspended my phone and internet banking. I have a firewall, anti-virus
 and keylogger so I didn't believe them and had them reinstate it then I checked my other accounts at another bank and found they had been hacked and well over $12k was gone in three transactions. The bank had me download a program called rapport.exe which
 runs in the background and in my IE browser it has put an icon that when I wish to protect a site I click on it and say yes which turns the icon green. The first time I ran it after installing it a box appeared saying something about zeus but I didn't get
 to read it as another box appeared on top of it telling me I had to restart my Win 7 HP 64 bit laptop which I did. I also did a full antivirus scan and deleted all threats. I had received no odd emails or sms or have any&nbsp;strange thing occur suddenly although
 my firewall kept alerting me that it had blocked offspon.exe I think it was called but I couldn't locate it on my disk and my anti-virus didn't find it either so I thought I was protected from whatever that was and it may have had nothing to do with the problem
 but it's been gone since I did the full scan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then I can no longer open any word starter 2010 documents-click-to-run 2010 problem, the dvd rom won't copy cd's or even open them, task manager processes under the heading memory (Private working Set) it now says "k" with no figures and I can't
 install any updates with windows update-they all fail with the above error message although I think the error message number may have been different before but the end result is the same. My system came preinstalled so I have the first backup on dvd's howeer
 I also have a 1TB usb backup disk that has an iso copy of the hard drive that I made 2 months ago but the backup and restore function is broken too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an expert geek out there who knows and understands what I've been describing who can tell me the cause and very hopefully the quick fix for these odd problems? I have many documents and program .exe files that I don't have copies of and I don't
 want to lose any of it. I suffer from Fibromyalgia and C.F.S. so I have the inability to sleep at night which is fine if whoever answers my query lives up top in the U.S.A. as I'm an Aussie&nbsp;from down under so we'd sleep at the same time if you get my meaning?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I.E. works as does my internet connection so I can surf, download and install programs. Tonight I will attempt to copy my files to DVD-RW-fingers crossed. Thank you in advance.</p>

            Yes, you can.
<br />
<br /> Microsoft’s Show or Hide Updates tool (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>) can be a first line option. This small wizard lets you choose to hide the Feature Update in Windows Update. After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select the Feature Update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. When future versions are released in the fall and spring, you will see either 1709 or 1803.

    <title>Windows 10 BSoD crash with UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> extraterrestial  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSoD crash with UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION</h2>
                    <p>So I've suffered a number of simultaneous BSoD crashes. They started infrequently but then made the laptop unusable. At the time of the series of crashes it was running in high performance mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initally crashes consisted of BSoD with "UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION" error<br />
<br />
Later the BDoD was coupled with error message "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED"<br />
<br />
Also there was one crash when following restart the system suffered repeated boot failure, I'm not sure what the system window is called but it went through different boot devices asking my permission each time, each one failed to boot, though it did give me
 the option to boot from a USB device i don't have the expertise to do this. <br />

    <title>OpenDNS has blocked my main sites on my main computer, but all other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samjoex  say:</h3>
<h2>            OpenDNS has blocked my main sites on my main computer, but all other devices I can use encounter no problems.</h2>
                    <p>Even though OpenDNS is a DNS provider, the issues I am experiencing may be solvable through Windows Settings, as my main computer is the only device I use that is suffering this problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that websites I use on a daily basis have become blocked entirely; I cannot access them. This includes YouTube, Gmail, Google+, and even the official Garfield website. Here is a screenshot of a failed attempt of accessing YouTube:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/244bef93-da9d-4315-a829-0695c7f4444e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/244bef93-da9d-4315-a829-0695c7f4444e" /></a></p>
<p>This error isn't exclusive to Google Chrome, as I tried to access YouTube with Microsoft Edge, and lo and behold:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c9c4592-2ef6-4fdb-8a4c-e0110a8583da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c9c4592-2ef6-4fdb-8a4c-e0110a8583da" /></a></p>
<p>Like I've said, this has only happened on my main computer. I was able to access the websites until sometime after 1:30 PM, and then it was blocked out of the blue. My access point is not the problem, or it would have also affected the other devices. It
 cannot be a virus either, as a Malwarebytes scan returned with a report of "No threats detected". It also cannot be an update deficiency, as I just updated Windows, and the block is still in effect. I also restarted the computer at least twice, but still no
 progression. Oddly enough, the Google Search Engine still works.</p>
<p>At this point, I believe the solution lies in a setting for Windows. The question, though, is which setting? If computer settings are not the issue, then what is?</p>

            <p>1. I am not sure how not to use OpenDNS, as it is the DNS server for my access point, and only my main device is blocked. I did do a Windows Diagnostic Test, and it encountered a 403 Forbidden Error while testing the connectivity to YouTube.</p>
<p>2. Yes, but it did not work.</p>
<p>Apparently, while looking at the security details, there was an "antitrust certificate" that is effective from 1/29/2017 to 2/3/2017, with both of their times being 7:52:36 PM.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9fbd0ce-b211-433f-80fe-2a690100d132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c9fbd0ce-b211-433f-80fe-2a690100d132" /></a></p>
<p>What's odd is that the sites still worked until yesterday (2/1/2017) at around 1:30 PM. It even enabled me to use the blocked sites for a brief period near the end of the day before blocking me again.</p>

            Okay, so I decided to use Ethernet instead of Wireless, and now it's working perfectly. I'll use Ethernet for a while before trying Wireless again.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 player are you using to play video?</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Reduce the hardware acceleration and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>To determine whether there is an issue with the video adapter or the video driver, reduce the graphics hardware acceleration setting. To do this,
 follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the desktop, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Settings tab, and then click Advanced.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Troubleshoot tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Move
 the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left. The Hardware Acceleration setting should not be reduced to less than three notches from the right side. The Hardware Acceleration setting should be the following:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Disable
 all cursor and advanced drawing accelerations. Use this setting to correct drawing problems</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you reduce the Hardware Acceleration setting, you may experience more issues with video rendering.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 OK two times.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If reducing hardware acceleration resolves the problem, you may have to update your video card drivers.</span></p>
