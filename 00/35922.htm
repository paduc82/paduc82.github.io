            <p>Do an upgrade (run the upgrade setup from the desktop) first to register your computer as a Windows 10 Device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you clean install first you will not get the free copy of Windows 10. &nbsp;Once you are running Windows 10 you can clean install it as often as you want without a product key. &nbsp;In fact there is no product key provided to you that you can enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to clean install is from within Windows 10. &nbsp;This is a new way of doing it. &nbsp;Go to Settings, Update and Security, Recovery, Reset this PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer to clean install with media, download the media creation tool from&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>and make either a dvd or usb. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start the computer and insert the media at the desktop to do that first upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Windows is intalled you can start the computer with the media to do a clean install. &nbsp;You will not need a product key even for a clean install and if the installer asks for one make no entry and skip the page.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen of Death UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION</h2>
                    I have been running into BSoDs lately. Haven't had a single BSoD in 4 years up until a few weeks ago. This originally was happening to me on Windows 7 but I fixed it after going through several procedures and running a few disk checks.<br />
Anyways the problem currently is whenever I run League of Legends the game will hang for a few seconds randomly and eventually just stutter out into a BSoD. During the hangs I will hear a clicking noise coming from the computer (the same noise you would hear
 upon turning it off or on) which I believe is the Hard Drive? So I'm thinking MAYBE it has something to do with that. This problem seems to happen randomly. I spent roughly an hour going through several procuders again such as updating drivers running a disk
 check (which came up with little to no errors) and making sure it isn't the RAM.<br />
<br />
Attached are the: <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=4CA81F41854B0428!449&amp;authkey=!ALeB1Q1kP8rZlgQ&amp;ithint=folder%2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Information Log, Disk Scan Results and, Dump files </a>The first dump file was a random occurrence I got right after opening the launcher for LoL, the other 2 are from when in game as described above. Any more information I can provide let me know.<br />
<br />
Also on a quick note just got done with a recent disk scan, apparently corrupted files were not repaired. Working on checking into that and will update accordingly.

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you say that you get the Bluescreen error after you run the League of Legends, we would suggest you to update the latest graphics card driver from the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the dump files we got the following information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ntkrnlmp.exe is a process associated with Microsoft® Windows® Operating System from Microsoft Corporation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-system processes like ntkrnlmp.exe originate from software you installed on your system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since most applications store data in your system's registry, it is likely that over time your registry suffers fragmentation and accumulates invalid entries which can affect your PC's performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check the RAM as there are errors related to Memory Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you have still face issue after updating the latest graphics card drivers so that we can further assist you.</p>

            No problem for the late response! Anyways my system is a HP Pavilion p6716f desktop pc. All the other information should be attached above. I've tried updated the graphics card which made no major changes. Memory was checked and appears to be OK. After
 running a thorough check disk after restart the issue appears to have subsided just like last time.

<h3> duyz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does windows 10 digital license linked to MSA work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an old laptop with windows 10 activated and linked with my MSA via a digital license.</p>
<p>Now I want to build a new desktop and give my laptop to my son.</p>
<p>

<p>3. If no, I have to buy a new windows 10 for my desktop, but can I link my current MSA to this desktop?</p>
<p>4. In that case, the data between the laptop &amp; desktop will be synced. I don't want so. Can I create a new MSA for my son, link this MSA to the laptop and keep the windows 10 activated?</p>
<p>

            With Digital License, there is no need to know your product key or purchase another product key if you lose it. Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on the same computer, just proceed to do so using any of the available options. Windows 10 will automatically reactivate without asking questions. 
<br />
<br />Setup Digital License
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 before the free upgrade offer expired, a digital license should be attached to your device. Microsoft is making the digital license a bit unique by linking activation not only to your hardware but also your Microsoft Account. This will not only make activation easier but troubleshooting common scenarios involving hardware modifications and upgrades.
<br />
<br />To begin, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />There are some interesting changes users will see. The first one is the obvious change from Windows is activated with a digital entitlement to Windows is activated with a digital license. At the bottom is a new option called Add a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />
<br />Click Add an account to start linking your account; you will be prompted to sign in using your Microsoft Account and password.
<br />
<br />After signing in, Windows 10 activation status will now display Windows is activated with a digital licensed linked to your Microsoft account. A mouthful I know, but this is how Microsoft will reduce the need always to know that 25 alphanumeric product key users are accustomed to losing or misplacing.

<br />
<br />
<br />1. Could I install a windows 10 on my new desktop using iso file, then activate it using my current MSA?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Yes, you can. After installing on the new computer, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Sign in with your Microsoft Account previously used to sign in on the other machine.
<br />
<br />You should see your previously activated machine listed. click it then click Next to activated.
<br />
<br />2. If yes, would the windows 10 on my laptop be deactivated? Or I can use the both devices at the same time?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; The other machine should no longer be in use, since this will cause a conflict and prevent activation. 
<br />
<br />3. If no, I have to buy a new windows 10 for my desktop, but can I link my current MSA to this desktop?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; You would need to purchase a new license, but you can link it with your existing Microsoft Account. You can have up to 10 registered Windows 10 devices under the same MSA.

<br />
<br />4. In that case, the data between the laptop &amp; desktop will be synced. I don't want so. Can I create a new MSA for my son, link this MSA to the laptop and keep the windows 10 activated?
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; No, doing that will not activate Windows 10, Windows 10 requires own unique product key/Digital License on each machine.

    <title>Defragmenting after Fresh Re-Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Defragmenting after Fresh Re-Install</h2>
                    
<p>I just did a fresh re-install of Windows XP, Office 2003, all service packs and updates. Then downloaded and installed lastes versions of essential programs such as adobe, Java, Flash, Quicktime and Security software. Then imported settings and configured
 Outlook. I thought I should defrag the hard drive at this point (before installing all my other 3rd party programs and all my backup files) so that the&nbsp;Windows operating system&nbsp;would perform at optimal level. However, When I ran the analyzer tool it said I
 did not need to defrag at this time. Should I still defrag now or is it best to leave it alone and&nbsp;install all my 3rd party programs and backup files. Then wait until the analyzer tool reports the need to defrag.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing&nbsp;advice about this. Thanks !</p>

<p>The whole issue of defragmenting is still somewhat controversial. Many folks believe it is a valuable tool and needs to be done often to improve the performance.</p>
<p>On the other side are those who feel that defragging is not only not unnecessary, but actually shortens the life of a hard drive.</p>
<p>In the bad old days of FAT and Windows 3.x, files got fragmented quickly and with the speed of the hard drives, this caused a significant degradation of retrieving files, thus slowing the system performance. Frequent defragging was mandatory. With the arrival
 of NTFS, the file, however, the file system became a lot more resistant to fragmentation. This reduced the need for defragging often. With the speed of modern drives, the impact of (and need for) fragmentation has significantly been reduced.</p>
<p>As John John has pointed out, it doesn't do any harm to defrag. I wouldn't count on the assessment of Windows in judging whether to defrag or not. If it's been a while, go for it. In your case, it's not a bad thing to do it.</p>
<p>I actually use a program called Diskeeper that automatically detects and prevents fragmentation and also will defrag if it detects it is needed and does it when there is no demand on the CPU or hard drive. Does it do a good job? You bet. It's so transparent
 that you aren't even aware of it unless you check Task Manager. Is it necessary? That's open to debate. I like it and use it.<br />

<p>Hello I've tried all of this stuff. I've tried many drivers too. I think my internal speakers (JBL sound for Lenovo) somehow were uninstalled when I got Windows 10. I looked inside and can see the speaker wires correctly connected so they should work.&nbsp; When
 I look at the Playback devices, I have 2: Speakers and Realtek Digital Output. When I do the troubleshooting it tells me where the plug for the speakers is, but the speakers are internal (that's why I think the internal speakers are uninstalled). What do you
 think? Thanks for the help, Richard</p>

<p>Hello I've tried all of this stuff. I've tried many drivers too. I think my internal speakers (JBL sound for Lenovo) somehow were uninstalled when I got Windows 10. I looked inside and can see the speaker wires correctly connected so they should work.&nbsp; When
 I look at the Playback devices, I have 2: Speakers and Realtek Digital Output. When I do the troubleshooting it tells me where the plug for the speakers is, but the speakers are internal (that's why I think the internal speakers are uninstalled). What do you
 think? Thanks for the help, Richard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Lenovo on their website for your PC model and sound card, have Windows 10 drivers for the JBL or only for Win7 or 8. If they do not for 10, then you have to use the Microsoft generic drivers for 10. Try in device manager to &gt;&nbsp;uninstall each device &lt;&nbsp;under
 sound or audio. Restart PC and on log on windows should detect and install them all again. See if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of your system?</p>

            Hello,&nbsp; my computer is a Lenovo 40-70 laptop with an i7, 8gB ram, and 256gB SSD. I've tried to install drivers from the Lenovo web site but it did not help. I also installed drivers from the realtec web site but this also did not help. I have 2 audio choices:
 speakers and digital sound. When I choose speakers it tells me the jack to use for sound- does that mean this choice is not the internal speakers? If so, maybe my jbl internal speakers are not installed somehow? Thanks a lot for the help, regards Richard

<p>well there is 25 models for the 40-70. There is one update for just the 40-70 on 1-25-2018&nbsp; try this first I guess, but really would have liked the complete model # 40-70- ???????</p>
<p>Try this first</p>
<p>It can be the most obvious things we overlook but its best to check if your audio device has been disabled wrongly or automatically.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the sound icon in the taskbar located at the bottom right of the screen and select
<strong>Playback Devices</strong></li><li>Select Mixer</li><li>Make sure none is disabled</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Device Manage</strong>r, expand category “<strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>“.Under this category, right-click on your sound card&nbsp;device name. A context menu will pop up. Then select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />

 the many things I've tried to get my internal laptop speakers to function. Thanks for the help, regards, Richard

<p><span>Hi JMart60,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since when are you facing this issue? Do you recall making any changes to the computer before this happened?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put the computer in clean boot and test </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow
<strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable and re-enable Windows Media Centre</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Programs and Features.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Turn Windows Features on or off</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand
<strong>media feature</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Uncheck
<strong>windows media centre</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Ok and then restart the computer
</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the same steps, now re-enable Windows Media center by placing a check mark.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if it makes any difference, if the issue still persists,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Run an online scan for any threat
 and try to fix them</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 1803 wont install in may HP stream 7 . Keeps on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lester968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1803 wont install in may HP stream 7 . Keeps on failing&#33;&#33; Pls help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have a HP stream 7 tablet running on W10 1703 version. A week ago I was prompted to install W10 1803 feature update which I installed right away. The tablet went through the process of installing but it keeps on failing at "Preparing to install" part.
 I cancelled the installation but it keeps on trying to install the 1803 repeatedly&nbsp; and it keeps on failing at same part at 40%. I read a thread that I should try to clean my&nbsp; installation folders and so I did, through "disk clean- up. " I was able to remove
 the installation files thru this process. I also deleted all the files under "software distribution" located in the "Windows folder" as suggested. However the Feature Update 1803 appeared&nbsp; and downloaded again.&nbsp; There was likewise a suggestion at same Microsoft
 support thread that I should try to install through the media tool and so I did. However this process also failed after trying for 3x. BTW,&nbsp; I selected "Keep Nothing" when I was given a choice. I also used an external hard drive as I was prompted that my disk
 space is low. The installation keeps failing and I was getting this error. Please help me as I am going nuts because of this.

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi Lester, you would be amazed how many users with HP Streams ask the exact same question here every day . . . 
<br />
<br />If you are, honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 and then turn off Automatic Updates - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Noise of a loose tiny ball moving inside console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mateusfz08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Noise of a loose tiny ball moving inside console</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my xbox 360 console for almost one year and just recently I noticed a strange noise inside the console when I moved it to install it at my mother's house.<br />
<br />
It's like if there is some tiny ball (or something like it) loose inside the console that moves from side to side when the console is moved or swung &nbsp;in any way. I hear it every time I turn off the console, lift it and swing it a little.</p>
<p>Despite this noise, the console works normally.</p>
<p>Is it normal? Does any one have had some similar issue with their consoles? Considering that my warranty is near its end, should I contact support and ask for repair?
</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>If its working properly, I would probably leave well enough alone. But that does not mean that this is right. Something inside has either broken off, or maybe gotten in somehow. Right now it is not causing a problem, but that does not mean it will not cause
 a problem sooner or later. It might be best to send it in for repair, but that would be up to you to decide. For the time being I would avoid moving the console very much as it might cause whatever is moving inside to damage the console.</p>

<p>If you still have warranty send it in now. </p>
<p>You can call support or you just request a repair by clicking on your account in the top right on here.
</p>
<p>Then go to "Manage Devices" and then request a repair. </p>
<p>If you did not register your console, do it before the repair service it will show the date your warranty ends.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting a mobile device to a computer, an option is usually set to be enabled so it can be detected by the system. Regarding this concern, we'd like to confirm if the setting for the MTP option has appeared. If yes, was the option enabled from there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the error code 28 that you've encountered means that the driver needs to be installed manually due to software conflicts. To resolve this concern, we suggest that check this

<p>Welcome to my hell. &nbsp;So *** with this process.</p>
<p>I went through the steps to create the acct, told MS up there's about my cc but now on a brand new 360 I can't find any place whatsoever to actually log in with my acct info. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I actually hit 'sign in' it takes me to the stupid local profiles.</p>
<p>HOW DOES ONE SIGN INTO XBOX LIVE ON THE XBOX 360 ITSELF????????????????????????????</p>

<p>Mother scratcher.......... &nbsp;Hopefully this helps you.....</p>
<p>You have to sign OUT of all profiles, hit the big green x button on the controller and go to download profile. &nbsp;Sign into xbox live and start the whole process over for your profile. &nbsp;Then you're back in as you and you can start playing in/with your xbox
 live acct on the 360 itself.</p>
<p>F'd process; it should scream at you to have a live acct. &nbsp;Some folks have young kids that don't need a live acct until you're f'n hosed by the game maker and FORCED, practically at gun point, to have the live acct to play the $40 game you just paid for.
<strong>&nbsp;[Mod Removed]</strong> &nbsp;May you suffer the bite of 10,000 fire ants someday.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the customized is not getting saved when you apply it as a lock screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to apply a different picture (in place of the default lock screen image) as the lock screen on the computer, it’s not required to delete the default lock screen. What we can do is we will move the customized image file to the location from where
 Windows will look for lock screen pictures. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste the folder location below into the address bar of File Explorer, and press Enter.</li></ul>
<p><strong>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First you will need to change the owner and permissions of the <strong>SystemData</strong> folder in the location above to be your user account's name.</li><li>Right click or press and hold on the <strong>SystemData</strong> folder, and click/tap on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click/tap on the Security tab, and click/tap on the <strong>Advanced</strong> button.</li><li>At the top to the right of the current Owner, click/tap on the <strong>Change</strong> link.</li><li>Select your user account name to be the owner.</li><li>Check the Replace owner of <strong>subcontainers</strong> and objects box, and click/tap on
<strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Yes.</strong></li><li>Click/tap on OK in "<strong>SystemData</strong> <strong>Properties</strong>" window.</li><li>Right click or press and hold on the <strong>SystemData</strong> folder again, and click/tap on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Next, we need to add <strong>SYSTEM</strong> with "<strong>Full control</strong>" permissions.</li><li>Click/tap on the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and click/tap on the <strong>
Edit</strong> button.</li><li>Click/tap on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li><li>Type <strong>SYSTEM</strong>, and click/tap on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Select (highlight) <strong>SYSTEM</strong> at the top, and check the Full control box under Allow.</li><li>Click/tap on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</li><li>Check the Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object box, and click/tap on OK and Yes. Click/tap on OK in "SystemData Properties" window.</li><li>Open the <strong>SystemData</strong>, <strong>S-1-5-8</strong>, <strong>ReadOnly</strong>, and
<strong>LockScreen_Z</strong> folders, and delete the image file(s) inside the LockScreen_Z folder so it will be empty. (This is the cache of the current default lock screen image. It needs to be cleared to be able to use the image you add later on).</li><li>In File Explorer, go to the folder location below, and open the Screen folder:</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\Windows\Web\Screen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Change the owner of the img100.jpg file to be the Administrators group, and set permissions for Administrators to have Full control.</li><li>Rename <strong>image100.jpg</strong> to anything you like (ex: image100X.jpg).</li><li>Copy a 1920 x 1200 .jpg image you want as the default lock screen into the <strong>
C:\Windows\Web\Screen</strong> folder, and rename it to be image100.jpg.</li><li>Sign out all users on the PC to see the new default lock screen.</li></ul>
<p>Check if it resolves the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>

            That's too wide a subject to give an appropriate answer. You should narrow the question down to specific games which are of interest to you. Every game has its own issues, and the cases where you'll find a patch to make the game Windows 7 compatible are
 very rare (some sites like&nbsp;Good Old Games, <a href="http://www.gog.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gog.com</a>,&nbsp;offer remastered copies of their favorites&nbsp;which are&nbsp;compatible - but that doesn't apply to all games you may prefer&nbsp;and isn't for free).

                    My computers don't show up under network. They don't show up under sharing. I've turned network discovery on. This shouldn't be so damned difficult! Why can't there just be a simple, password protected way to share files over a network?

            Hi Citicat.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />They've broken networking in Windows 10.  Many think this might be intentional to force us to OneDrive which is an alternative I'll discuss below.
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for files sharing problems so at least something will work. If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />See here for how to share files and printers over network after removal of HomeGroup:

<br />
<br />If Windows 7 is involved make sure if applicable you have the WIndows Update released to fix Windows 7 sharing issues here:  <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-kb4487345-update-to-fix-windows-7-share-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft...</a>

<h2>            Dead Pixels on Screen Surface Pro 6</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the device, and there are still two bright little dots that are only noticeable when I pull up white back grounds, but not black. I have deduced based on another post that had the same issue, that this is a dead pixel. However, I have two
 of them, almost right next to each other. I noticed this issue on March 17th, and I only just bought my Surface Pro 6 in January or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering how to go about getting this issue fixed. I have a warranty with both Microsoft and Best Buy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please and thank you!</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7d47d0ed-0545-4a79-a7ab-434afb6de0e5" title="RachaelGold">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your concern here in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd say that this may be a hardware issue, specifically on the screen panel, that is if those two bright little dots are present on all the windows or applications you open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that can help us determine if this is a hardware&nbsp;issue is&nbsp;we can boot the device to the UEFI screen to see if the issue is present.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>UEFI is an environment that exists completely outside of Windows and other installed applications.
</em><span><em>If the issue exists in UEFI, then we know it’s a hardware failure and the device needs to be replaced.
</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>If you see the two little dots while you're in UEFI, my best recommendation is to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contact support </a>so that they can discuss what options you have for your device.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>But <span>If the issue does not exist in UEFI, then we know the symptom is being influenced by software such as Windows or other applications, we can go ahead and run some troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to boot to UEFI:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once the device is shutdown, press and hold the volume up button, and single press the power button.
<span>The device will boot to the Surface Logo, and you should see spinning dots. After the Surface logo, the device should boot to UEFI.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response</p>
<p>

            The yellow question mark indicates that there's a problem with the PCI serial port.&nbsp; I don't think that could be slowing down your satellite connection speed, which uses a different device to connect to your computer.<br />
<br />
Right-click the PCI serial port and click<strong> Properties</strong> .&nbsp; That should give a description of the problem.

            <p>Hello Zjosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to play an ITunes playlist on windows 7 computer using task scheduler. I would recommend using Windows Media Player as your default media player to enable it to open when the .MP3 is called. I am unsure if iTunes
