<h2>            My Windows Mobile 6.1 Barcode Scanner keeps turning itself on&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I appreciate any bit of help I can get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My company purchased a few Dolphin 9900 scanners.&nbsp; They use WinMo 6.1.&nbsp; If you leave them alone, after turning them off, they turn themselves back on.&nbsp; I spoke with a Dolphin tech guy, he told me that it's a Windows feature, that it was checking for Push
 Email (even with no email accounts set up), and that there was no way to stop it.</p>
<p>Every search for Windows Mobile Push Email and assorted terms only brings up reviews for phones or tutorials on how to turn it off, so I've gotten nowhere looking for an answer so far.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem at all?&nbsp; Well, due to the nature of our business, we have all power saving turned off, and the scanners are locked in a box overnight when no one is in the place where we are working.&nbsp; When they turn on the temperature in the box increases
 heavily and there is concern we are going to prematurely burn through our scanners.</p>
<p>Looking at the Windows Mobile site, it says that the Dolphin 9900 does not even have Push Email capability, so color me confused.&nbsp; Any thoughts on why my scanners are turning themselves on?</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p>Greetings Matthew!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your patience!</p>
<p>Apologies for chiming in so late in the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had several Windows Mobile (now called Windows Phone) devices that were version 6.1, and none of them had Push-email enabled as a default, so I would begin to doubt Honeywell on that tact right out of the gate.&nbsp; Additionally, none of my 6.1 devices&nbsp;woke-up
 unless I had a program installed on them that specifically had to wake-up in order to perform a particular function.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if I have Pocketwit set to check for Twitter updates every 30min, then the device would certainly be "on"&nbsp;by the next morning
 (if it wasn't already drained).&nbsp; The Microsoft application "My Phone" is a really good example of an application that can be set to activate at 2am to perform a Sync, and may unfortunately leave your device "on" the rest of the night.</p>
<p>Retail inventory devices (bar code scanners especially) have a habit of "walking away" from the business location, so it may be that Honeywell has defined some kind of Asset Protection scheme in place, and the device is simply calling-home to ensure that
 the GPS location is correct (for example), or something along those lines.</p>
<p>If you have one of the Dolphin 9900 scanners that you can spare being offline for a day or two,<strong>and it doesn't interfere with your warranty</strong>, I could consider uninstalling any customized Honeywell applications, so that all you have is a basic
 6.1 OS (well, as close as you can get anyways) to see if the problem goes away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Failing that, I would see if a "Hard Reset" of the device helps clear the rogue software/settings that might be causing the problems.&nbsp; This presumes that Honeywell hasn't loaded their own customized version of 6.1 into ROM, which a lot of Wireless Phone companies
 do.</p>
<p>If either of these two strategies help, then that&nbsp;should serve as sufficient proof that the problem is Honeywell's to fix, and hopefully they will acknowledge the cause and fix it.</p>

<p>I am assuming you have push email setup .... yes?&nbsp; You could change the number of times it checks or enen set it to manual.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;did see&nbsp;this tip&nbsp;on how to "<strong>save more battery turn off push email"</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.wmexperts.com/showthread.php?t=175404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">over at WMExperts</a> and thought I would offer to you.&nbsp; Possibly this will help alleviate the issue you are
 experiencing:</p>
<p><em>I know everybody wants there email quick and with wm you have to set it to check for new mail all the time and the more you set it to check for you it kills your batt ,so heres the work around turn off your push email set it to manuly check it yourself
 then go to your email provider and options and chose to forward your email to another adress and leave a copy and for the new adress put your number like</em><span><em>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</em></span><em>
 and it will send you an mms instantly that you have new mail and then you can send&amp;recieve to get it that way its not checkin all day works awesome and its fast and will defenitly save your battery power enjoy<br />
<br />
ps. you can also reply from this and all the links in the mms will open in your browser just like the email would hope this helps</em></p>

<h2>            How to stop automatic updates in O365  - SharePoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; We have a customized portal in SPO. If Microsoft rolled out their patches and automatic updates, it may impact our portal. Is it possible to stop automatic updates? Please confirm</p>

<p>Hi Balaji,</p>
<p>It is not feasible to stop patches and automatic updates from being deployed in the tenant as it's a multi-tenant architecture, which means tenants share farms in the backend. The patches and updates are deployed at farm level.</p>
<p>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Plan-customizations-solutions-and-apps-for-SharePoint-Online-b7898ebf-69b7-4196-81e3-b04e1a4e7d67" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p><span><span>Hi Jonard,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To assist you better, please provide few details.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) How exactly you are trying to setup Windows 10?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Do you receive any error message on UEFI setting?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue might occur if
<strong>Secure Boot Control </strong>is disabled in UEFI settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Shut down (power off) Surface.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface, and at
 the same time, press and release the power button on your Surface. </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: When you see the Surface logo, release the volume-up button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The UEFI menu will display within a few seconds.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: Press Tap to enable
<strong>Secure Boot Control </strong>under <strong>Secure Boot Control </strong>option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: If Secure Boot keys aren't installed, you can tap
<strong>Install All Factory Default Keys</strong> and then tap on <strong>Windows only</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 5</span></strong><span>: To save your changes and exit, tap or click
<strong>Exit Setup</strong>, and tap or click <strong>Yes</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/ UEFI settings incorrectly can cause serious
 problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/UEFI settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            The article you need to look at for this issue is <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Right-to-left-language-features-17d8a34d-36d6-49ad-b765-257cb7cd22e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Right-to-left-language-features-17d8a34d-36d6-49ad-b765-257cb7cd22e2</a>.&nbsp;When RTL is enabled in Word, you will have RTL and LTR buttons in the
<strong>Paragraph</strong> group on the <strong>Home</strong> tab, making switching the text direction easy. I'm guessing that you don't have RTL enabled, so you will have to enable it in order to get this functionality. That article provides the needed steps.

            What have you done to fix the issue? run troubleshooter? remover 3rd party Virus programs? remove anything plugged into USB's/Media slots? searched the forums for any tips? if you done all that, than at this point you need to do a "clean" install. Here

            Hi Harsh_Mehta,<br />
<br />
We can’t activate Office without the desktop version of Office licenses. If your school is not registered in Microsoft, we can use Office for mobile and Office Online for free. Office clients in computers are not available.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For a free Office version, I would suggest you install Microsoft Office for Mobile Devices and do the homework on it. After downloading it, we need a
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12059/what-is-a-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a> instead of a Work/school account to log into the applications. To get free Office apps, please see:
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-sg/mobile/office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get the free Office apps</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, for the computer or Mac, we can use Office Online to open or edit documents. We also need a Microsoft account to log in. Access the link:<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Free Office Online apps</a> and click Sign in with a Microsoft account.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I bought a Microsoft office product key from a store and was given a paper with a long code, and no CD was given. When I opened microsoft office, I inserted the product key and it didn't work. It showed that the product key is not activated and I couldn't
 activate my microsoft office. I spoke with the store and told them about the case and they advised me to talk to microsoft support. I need an immediate help. your immediate response is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Inbox Sub-folder and Contents Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamb_62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Inbox Sub-folder and Contents Disappeared</h2>
                    As I was reading my mail in my primary inbox subfolder, "Bill's Mail"&nbsp;(POP account) and filing messages, that primary inbox subfolder just vanished along with all messages. I have gone through Deleted Items folder in detail to locate either the missing
 folder or unread messages within. Cannot find anything. Many of the 70+ messages in the folder were set to follow-up for further action. I am quite certain, I didn't do a permanent delete. "Bill's Mail" still shows up in Account Settings as my default account,
 and new messages are now going to Inbox, but I need to recover the important messages that were in "Bill's Mail" when the subfolder disappeared. HELP!

<p>Since you're using POP email server settings in Outlook, all of the emails you have in your email provider's server will be moved to Outlook. It will be difficult to recover any POP emails that was permanently deleted and the only way to recover deleted
 POP emails is the one that <strong>Gabriel Bratton</strong> mentioned. We recommend you always make a copy of your emails so that you will have a backup in case one of your emails got deleted. We also highly recommend you post a suggestion in this
<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> if you want to have a feature in Outlook that will allow users to recover POP or IMAP emails in case they got deleted. Once you post your suggested feature, our Support Engineers can look into it and add it in the future update of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have any questions, kindly reply to this thread.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have often found that when checking I have not been able to get a connection and other times I do get through but there are no updates.&nbsp; Even though tghe feature is there, I don't it is ready for Prime Time yet ....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your email, as long as you can surf the net so you know you have a good data connection, I might consider deleting the email account and setting it up again on your device.&nbsp; Verify your settings from Bell South.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to determine how to either get an RSS feed for the "Popular Searches" on the MSN main page (upper right-hand corner of page) or the one that appears on Bing.com page (the slider). I would like to be notified when a new search trend updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please and thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it is not possible to have most popular searches on msn.com and you need to search&nbsp;RSS feeds to view it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to use simple keyword such as<strong> feed:microsoft </strong>to get the feeds related to Microsoft. Unfortunately there is no way to get the feeds automatically using the Bing search. You can follow the steps given in the link below to filter
 RSS Feeds&nbsp;using the&nbsp;steps given under <strong>Advanced search keywords</strong></p>

    <title>Windows Defender turns off on full scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshuastruck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender turns off on full scan</h2>
                    <p>I am having this issue where, if i run a full scan, the defender will just deactivate about 50-90% through the scan. This doesn't happen with quick scans or updates, just full scans. It's made me resort to using a 3rd party checker to make sure i didn't
 have any malware or viruses causing it.<br />
I use Spybot S&amp;D, but I only installed that after the issues started to appear. If anyone knows a way to fix this please help me.

            No, as i said in the initial post, it does not do it during quick scans. It has been doing this for a while now, i just thought it was a minor issue that would fix itself.

            I use HDD. I ran a de-fragment, ran a scan, still crashed. As for searching for this issue, of course i already did that. Searching for this issue only leads to a similar issue that is more severe than what i'm dealing with.

            Update, I have successfully done a full scan. Defragmenting seems to have helped, though if a 1% fragmentation can cause WD to shut off, that needs to be looked into.

                    Looking at the inbox, when I move the mouse from e-mail to e-mail each line is highlighted.&nbsp; In my case the background is grey and the mouse hover-over changes each line to cyan.&nbsp; That is separate from using the arrow keys to highlight each line.&nbsp; The
 arrow keys make each line dark cyan.&nbsp; The arrow key highlights the actual e-mail that will open when I press enter.&nbsp; Is there any way I can turn off the mouse hover-over color altogether?&nbsp;

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my experience, it is not feasible to turn off the mouse hover color function. In most instances, this can highlight the emails and notify the user where the mouse is now. I think it is a good feature request. I have searched in the Outlook 2016
 UserVoice and found a similar feature request. Please vote in this link to help use improve the user experience:

<p><em>This applies to Word 2007.</em></p>
<p>Ok so I've been working on this document for days. Everything'ss gone ok so far. But I just went to save and it told me "A file error has&nbsp;occurred." It will not let me save in the docx format, however it will let me save as a Word 2003 doc file. Luckily
 I manually save almost every minute. What is causing this? Can I get it resolved? Docx is preferred here.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I also encounter this problem from time to time and it's very frustrating. It has happened to me several times over the last year or so with Word 2010 and always with documents with track changes on. What tends to happen is that I am working on a document
 that I have been working with for some time (weeks, say). I'll leave my computer for a while - enough time for it to have autosaved - which may be important, and then come back and make some more changes and find that it wont save. Instead it just says "A
 file error has occurred".<br />
<br />
The above answer isn't really a solution.<br />
<ul>
<li>Turning off track changes doesn't allow me to save the document.</li><li>Track changes are a crucial part of the document, and so removing them is not a solution.</li><li>Closing Word and opening it in safe mode is not an option either, since all unsaved changes are lost.<br />
</li></ul>
I have tried saving under a different filename, but this also doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The only solution that has worked for me in the past is as follows:<br />
<ol>
<li>create a new document based on the same template as the one which wont save,</li><li>turn off track changes on both the new and corrupt documents,</li><li>copy and paste the entire contents of the corrupt document into the new one, and</li><li>turn track changes back on on the new document</li><li>save the new document under a new name.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>... but just now I had Word crash on me when I tried to save the new document at stage 5. In this case the corrupt file had compatibility mode off and the new one had it on when I first attempted a save so pressed cancel and turned off compatibility mode
 and then tried to save - at which point Word crashed.</p>
<p>After the crash I reopened the autosaved corrupt version of the document - which is still corrupt, retried the procedure on a new document which had compatibility mode off from the start - and am now in a situation where "A file error has occurred" happens
 when I try to save the new document too. So, the corruption appears to have got copied across.<br />
</p>
<p>I had a&nbsp; suspicion is that this is a bug related to modification of tables (such as deleting a column or cells - which prompts the "this modification wont be marked as a change" message) in documents with track changes.</p>
<p>Has anyone else been modifying tables when this has happened to them?</p>
<p>I seem to have been able to confirm this suspicion since I was just able to save a copy of the document without error by following the procedure above, except I copied over everything
<p>So, in summary, here is what I think Microsoft need to investigate: Problem related to modification of tables (and table structure in particular) for documents with track changes on, possibly related to autosaving.</p>
<p>Hope that helps Microsoft and others with the same problem.<br />

            I've found a solution to this, still not a great one but better than what others have been suggesting.
<div><br />
<div>Word should still be able to autosave, so simply wait until the next autosave, then go to Task Manager - Processes and end winword.exe. This shuts down word in the 'non safe way'. Next time you open word, you will have a list of the autosaved files, and
 the your ability to save as .docx will be restored.</div>

    <title>Cross Reference and Caption Numbering with IncludeText - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andy_321x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cross Reference and Caption Numbering with IncludeText</h2>
                    <p>I have a master document, which pulls several sub-documents together using the INCLUDETEXT fields. The sub-documents contain number sections (i.e. 4.2.1.1 System Overview). They also contain figures and tables that need to&nbsp;have captions&nbsp;numbered in accordance
 with the section number (i.e. Figure 4.2.1.1-1 System Diagram). There are also cross references to the figures (i.e.&nbsp;...see&nbsp;Figure 4.2.1.1-1 System Diagram).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When working in the master document, I select all (ctrl + a) and press F9 to update fields. Although the section headers update correct when all of the INCLUDETEXT fields are pulled in, the captions for tables and figures and their cross references are not
 getting updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, they remain numbered as they are in the sub-document (i.e. 1.1.1.1.1-1). How do I force this update in the master document?</p>
<p>

            <p>If you can live with unlinking the INCLUDETEXT fields, you could run a macro containing the following code to do that and then update the remaining fields</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dim i As Long<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = .Fields.count To 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .Fields(i).Type = wdFieldIncludeText Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Fields(i).Unlink<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Range.Fields.Update<br />
End With</p>
