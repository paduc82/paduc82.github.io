<h2>            Finally, Lumia 521 has got the GDR3 update. Let&#39;s talk about it.</h2>
                    <p>My first impression is that&nbsp;my phone gets faster! We've got ceasing button while navigation the on going applications. And also, we've got auto screen rotation configuration menu in setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But&nbsp;I&nbsp;found out&nbsp;the screen shakes a little bit&nbsp;when I&nbsp;scroll&nbsp;it up and down&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;my finger&nbsp;touched to the&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>I guess they made it too sensitive to fingers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, it is also about the scrolling and it&nbsp;might be dabatable. Did you notice that when you move the screen up and down and then after you remove your finger, the screen stops so suddenly at the last moment? Someone would like it better, but I prefer
 the former movement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yeah these are pretty much that I found playing with my phone. I want to listen to your opinions on this update. Have a good one guys.</p>

            <p>Thanks for answering, but it is already set to the normal mode and no other settings have been changed. Yet, the movement is changed.

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2016 Professional&#59; Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Windows10....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When My PC boots up I get this popup message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail Client"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading that message, it is saying open Outlook and somewhere in Outlook you need to set it as the default Mail client....I know of nowhere within Outlook where there is a setting to make it the default Mail client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is, I have gone to Settings/Apps....Default Apps...Mail was shown as Outlook 2016...so I changed it to a Mail....then back to Outlook 2016...that did correct the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Control Panel/Default Programs....scrolled down to Outlook 2016, clicked set as Default...it showed This program has all its defaults....also for Outlook 2016 clicked on Set Assoc for program, all items in list were checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 does run as it should, but this annoying Popup keeps popping up....&nbsp; Have I overlooked some setting?&nbsp; How do I stop this Popup from displaying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of these suggestions have resolved the issue....this annoying POPUP keeps displaying.&nbsp; Makes no sense because; Outlook appears to be running fine.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked/unchecked the Make default within Outlook 2016, I have gone to Settings/ default Apps; Outlook 2016 is set as default, I went to Control Panel/Default apps; Outlook 2016 is the default and all attributes are checked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This popup only displays after I power on my PC for the 1st time ...I power off at night.&nbsp; It gets weirder.&nbsp; It popup.....and goes away without me doing a thing...in about 2 to 3 mins (like it has a timer on on it...surely that isn't so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it displays, when I open Task Manager...it shows 2 Apps running, Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host (32bit)....and under that, Microsoft Office Outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;(See Image Below).&nbsp; After the POPUP disappears on its own, Task Mgr no longer shows these
 2 Apps running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't quite recall but seems to me there was something I read about Outlook needs to be run 64bit, or 32 bit??? just cannot remember ....it seems it is running 32bit/OS of course is 64bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe Microsoft Windows Search Protocol Host (32bit) was a SERVICES...went to Services...nope, its not listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a resolution; looking thru this Forum others have reported this same issue going back many years.......and hopefully...this thread will be the one to come up with the Fix for all to use.....</p>

<h2>            I have this Setup Error&#58; You cannot install the 32-bit version of Office 2010 bc you have 64-bit Office products installed....</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I am very frustrated, I clicked the Microsoft advertisement that came with my laptop when I was in Xcel, to purchase the standard edition and upgrade from the starter version.
<br />
<br />
I have the message that I "cannot install the 320bit version of Office because you have 64-bit Office products installed. These 64-bigt products are not supported with 32-bit installations:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office Single Image2010<br />
<br />
If you want to install 32-bit Office 2010, you must uninstall all 64-bit Office productsfirst, and then run setup.exe in the x86 folder. If you want to install 64-bit Office 2010, close this Setup program, and then either go to the x64 folder at the rotof your
 CD or DVD and run setup.exe., or get the 64-bit Office 2010 from the same place you purchased 32-bit Office 2010.
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>I do not the run setpup.exe option in the x86 folder.&nbsp;</li><li>the 64-bit Office was installed on my laptop when I purchased it, there is NO CD or DVD that came with it.</li><li>I would LIKE to have the 64-bit Office 2010 from where I purchased it: Microsoft.com!</li><li>At this point I am reluctant to uninstall anything until I get a copy of the 64-bit Office I am in need of, this seems like the simplest option if only someone could show me where and how to get it in the most efficient way!
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Thank you in advance. <br />

<h2>            Lumia 950 Calendar is suddenly blank</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I woke up this morning to find my Lumia 950 has lost everything in my calendar app.</p>
<p>This was NOT during any kind of syncing, downloading, installation or updating.</p>
<p>i just went to put something in just now and found it was totally blank, so I have lost all birthdays, doctors appointments and scheduling.</p>
<p>I have restarted and done a soft reset and nothing has been restored.</p>
<p>Please could someone advise on how I can restore my calendar as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response - I figured out what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I had two accounts on my phone, and the syncing of contacts and calendars was not compatible, and nothing changed when I simply recallibrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had to install my outlook account first and sync only the contacts and calendar and not the email because I dont have an putlook email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I had to install my gmail account, but only the email, othewise the phone would use my gmail contact numbres (of which I have none) and my google calendar (which I dont use) and overwrite what I had physically entered into the phone with nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had both accounts at the same time and it hasnt been a problem until recently, and I have no idea what happened as I dont recall changing any of the properties for either of my accounts, but it took me 4 hours to finally figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps others who experience this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the blanking side of things, I have no idea how it happened as it seemed pretty random and unrelated to anything I had done to the phone before that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou</p>
<p>

<p>Which Windows 7 Phone will have internal or built-in GPS capabilities.&nbsp; Why would I use my phone to connect to an external GPS - Kinda redundant isn't it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will get a new windows 7 phone as soon as they are available to Verizon Customers.&nbsp; I like my 6.5 phone but there is no internal GPS and that drives me crazy.</p>

<blockquote>Which Windows 7 Phone will have internal or built-in GPS capabilities</blockquote>
You can expect uniformity for the availability of the basic functionality of Windows Phone 7 hardware. All Windows Phone 7 devices have internal GPS. They also have a magnometer (compass).
<blockquote>Why would I use my phone to connect to an external GPS - Kinda redundant isn't it?&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>Depends on the scenario. There's a few for which I would expect one to use an external GPS. But those are all developer, industrial, and business applications.</p>

<h2>            Is SKYPE spying us&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have my PC always on during the day. Several times happened to me that suddenly one of my contacts starts speaking to me without prior ringing. More than that: while I was in another room suddenly I heard&nbsp;my contact speaking and asking if I were home.
 Only by accident, I heard his voice (it's my brother) and run back to my PC room. There was no ringing, not at all. Suddenly he was there with his live camera!&nbsp; How is it possible?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why it's not ringing when somebody calls me&nbsp; Skype to Skype? It is as if Skype is spying!</p>
<p>Any idea how to bring this software to RING when calling? (my audio and video are working OK).</p>

            This might be problematic - as far as I know, you can only set a custom page size in design view. The basic code can be found in

    <title>IE9 download renames file extensions to _exe from .exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ganeshaxi  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE9 download renames file extensions to _exe from .exe</h2>
                    Basics: Fresh install of Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit, all Windows updates installed. Avast Internet Security installed.<br />
<br />
The problem: Any file downloaded (when the file will actually download, because it fails about 50% of the time) will rename itself, making the extension useless. For example, instead of itunes64.exe, the download renames itself to itunes64_exe and will not
 execute, it asks how to open it. The easy fix is to rename the extension to .exe, the file then installs properly. This happens on multiple file extensions. The Avast license file renamed to _avastlic instead of having the extension of .avastlic, but changing
 the underscore to a period makes it function properly. Google Chrome downloads the files properly, and downloads every file every time.<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting: Uninstalling Avast does nothing to help. I uninstalled IE9, and IE8 would refuse to download any file at all. Uninstalled IE8, reinstalled IE9 from a download, all proper reboots done. Same problem: file fails, or if it does download, it renames
 itself. Virus scan shows no problems.<br />
<br />
I have done a good deal of researching this problem, but have found no answer, and I'm stumped!<br />

Both 32 and 64 yield same results.<br />
Fresh install was a Dell installation disk on a new drive.<br />
All add-ons disabled.<br />
When clicking a file download and choosing "Open," it does absolutely nothing, the download dialog bar remains there. The bar will not go away by choosing "Cancel" or clicking the X after choosing "Open." Choosing "Save" downloads it with that underscore. "Save
 As" allows me to change the file extension, but that is not fixing the problem.<br />

<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/the-dot-in-download-filenames-always-gets-changed/57b6b7c4-75c3-4a7a-ad45-1debfbe5ebae">
this thread</a>. However, it did nothing. Ask.com toolbar has never existed on the computer. I disabled Protected Mode, and it has disabled the file renaming. Re-enabling Protected Mode renames the file again. I do not want to send out a customer's computer
 with Protected Mode disabled. <a href="http://imgur.com/hiaoo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This is what the file download looks like</a> in Protected Mode, note the underscore before exe.

            <p>Your User profile is corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix, go into Control Panel from the Start menu and create a new administrator user profile&nbsp;(any name you want, you will delete later) or use an existing&nbsp;one (other than your current) with&nbsp;admin privileges&nbsp;and another similar to your current user profile
 (same name as your current with a 1 on the end? doesn't matter you can rename later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log into the new similar one to set up the default folders and desktop. Then log out and log in as the admin user.&nbsp; Using Windows Explorer, find the user folders (C:\Users typically) and copy all the folders in/under your current user folder to the new similar
 one you created. (Ctrl-A in the right pane selects all, cut and paste&nbsp;if you don't have enough hard drive space to copy)&nbsp;&nbsp;When it asks if you want to merge the folders, accept or choose yes.</p>
<p>When all the folders are copied, log in to your new user profile and try downloading something in IE9, it should work fine.</p>
<p>Log back out, and log in as the admin user again and delete your old user profile (since you've copied the files you don't need to save the profiles files&nbsp;to a backup file as suggested when you do this, but feel free to if you want).&nbsp; You can now rename
 the new similar profile to your old profile's name if you want to change it.</p>
<p>If you created a new admin user profile, you can now delete that after you log in to any other user profile with admin priviliges.</p>

<h2>            Access Report Does Not Consistently Display Correct Result</h2>
                    <p>I have a database that scores competitions and uses&nbsp;subforms that collect scores, queries that calculate scores and reports that show results.&nbsp; The reports calculate a place finish but 1% of time&nbsp;it does not catch and correctly display ties.&nbsp; I have checked
 all of the decimal places and formats in forms, reports and queries and it does not impact the results.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The report uses a Total Score Header with a text box with =1.&nbsp; The detail area displays the results and a text box with =Place.&nbsp; As the report displays the results on the report in Total Score descending value the place will increase, except that scores
 that have the same value should reflect the same place.&nbsp; This does not always happen.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Here is the process: &nbsp;Scores are entered into a subform that populates a table. &nbsp;A query then gets the appropriate athlete records and scores and adds the scores, for example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple scores, then:</p>
<p>1 Column has: &nbsp; TotalPass1: ([scoJudge1Pass1]+[scoJudge2Pass1]+[scoJudge3Pass1])</p>
<p>2nd column has: &nbsp;TotalPass2: ([scoJudge1Pass2]+[scoJudge2Pass2]+[scoJudge3Pass2])</p>
<p>3rd column has: &nbsp;TotalScore: ([TotalPass1]+[TotalPass2])</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more advanced levels there are other scores that get included, but I have the problem with the basic one above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A report displays the results for the specific group of athletes and the TotalScore field. The report groups on TotalScore and displays from high to low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The header for TotalScore has a text box with =1</p>
<p>The records are included in the detail area of the report with a text box =[Place]</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the records display on the report the largest TotalScore has a place of 1. &nbsp;The next highest a place of 2. &nbsp;When there are multiple scores that are the same the place should be the same number. &nbsp;This generally works but on some occasions the same score
 is not recognized and the place is the next consecutive number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on why the TotalScore is recognized correctly by the place or is there a better way to calculate the Total Score and assign a place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks your any suggestions that you may have.</p>

            <p>First, I don't agree with your table structure. In the words of a good friend, "you have committed spreadsheet". A properly normalized solution would have each score in its own record with columns that store the judge and the pass. You would then sum across
 records rather than across fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't change your table structure the first thing I would do is change the 3rd column to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>TotalScore: (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[scoJudge1Pass1]+[scoJudge2Pass1]+[scoJudge3Pass1]</span>+[TotalPass2]+<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[scoJudge1Pass2]+[scoJudge2Pass2]+[scoJudge3Pass2]</span>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same questions:</p>
<p>Again where does [<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Place] come from? Is this a field in your query?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are any text boxes set to Running Sum?</span></p>

            Rather than ranking the total scores in the report by means of the RunningSum mechanism, you can so in the report's RecordSource query.&nbsp; You'll find examples of such queries in RowNumbering.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates a number of queries for computing row numbers and ranks.&nbsp; While that using a join is the most efficient, that using a subquery is perhaps easier to understand:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionAmount, CustomerID, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT COUNT(*)+1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.TransactionAmount &gt; T1.TransactionAmount) AS Rank<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1<br />
ORDER BY T1.TransactionAmount DESC;<br />
<br />
If it is necessary to group the ranks, e.g. per customer in my demo, then it is just a question of correlating the subquery with the outer query on CustomerID also:<br />
<br />
SELECT T1.TransactionDate, T1.TransactionAmount, CustomerID, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT COUNT(*)+1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM Transactions AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.CustomerID = T1.CustomerID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AND T2.TransactionAmount &gt; T1.TransactionAmount) AS Rank<br />
FROM Transactions AS T1<br />
ORDER BY T1.CustomerID, T1.TransactionAmount DESC;<br />
<br />
In these the Transactions table would be the equivalent of your query which returns the total scores, and the TransactionAmount would be equivalent to the TotalScore column returned by the query.&nbsp; CustomerID might be equivalent to something like an event in
 your case, to return separate rankings per event.&nbsp; A report based on such a query can then be sorted by the Rank column.<br />
<br />
Note that when using such queries as the RecordSource property for a report, the ORDER BY clause should be removed from the query, and the report ordered by means of its internal sorting and grouping mechanism.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table that contains the results is normalized. &nbsp;There is a field for each score. &nbsp;I did not sum the data in the table. &nbsp;The calculations are just in the queries. &nbsp;I did not want to add calculated fields to the table. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reports, i need to show various subtotals of the scores, so I did not want to add a lot of calculated fields. &nbsp;I thought that would destroy the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the totals and subtotals are in queries and I display the results in the reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You got me on Place. &nbsp;This is a field that someone helped me with years ago. &nbsp;It is only in the report and not in a table or query. &nbsp;Being a novice I always thought it was similar to the count function.</p>

            <p>I expect [Place] is the name of the text box containing the =1 control source. I also expect its Running Sum property is set to Over Group or Over All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The table is not normalized. You are storing data in field names. [Judge3Pass1] contains two pieces of data: Judge number and Pass number. If I were to normalize this, my table/fields might look like:</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might also like to take a look at UnecodeColumns.zip in the same OneDrive folder.&nbsp; This illustrates how to automatically fix an incorrect table structure like yours by inserting rows into a set of correctly related tables.<br />
<br />
If you are unsure why encoding data as column headings is incorrect, a fundamental principle of the database relational model is the Information Principle (Codd's Rule #1). This requires that all data be stored as values at column positions in rows in tables,
 and in no other way.&nbsp; With a correct structure the <em>addition </em>of values from fixed multiple columns becomes a matter of the
<em>summation </em>of values over a variable number of rows.<br />

            <p>Thanks for all of the comments. &nbsp;I stand corrected that my tblResults is not normalized. &nbsp;I am working on changing that but it will take some time. &nbsp;However, I am still having issues with the report recognizing the same numbers as being in the same group.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use the query that was in the same database to rank the results, but even this query did not identify the same numeric results as being the same. &nbsp;This query had the same result as the report for not group. &nbsp;Sometimes the same numbers are recognized
 and sometimes not. &nbsp;There are times on the same report that they are caught and sometimes not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the way the queries add the numbers to ensure that the equation considers every field and also tried to use calculated fields in tables. &nbsp;(I had to change the database to the accdb format to do this). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have not been able to fix the problem. &nbsp;Any additional suggestions?</p>

            Post back with the SQL of the query, and with full details of the current table design, i.e. the name of the table and the name and data type of each column.&nbsp; It would also help if you could post some sample data in a format which can be copied and pasted
 into a tab delimited text file in which the first line would be the column headings.&nbsp; This would enable us to recreate the table with your sample data, and test whatever solution we might come up with.

            That sort of display suggests that you may need to update the display driver. As a start, however, you could try checking the box for "Disable hardware graphics acceleration" at

<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the confusion the&nbsp;skype for windows 10&nbsp;have brought you.&nbsp; Just&nbsp;a heads up, skype for windows 10 only allows a&nbsp;Microsoft account&nbsp;to sign in.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you have signed in using your email on the skype for windows 10 app, it created you a Microsoft account using that email address and another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to use your account for the skype for windows 10, you can just merge your skype with your email [Microsoft account].
</p>
<p>If you don't want that option, you can just use the other skype application &nbsp;which can be downloaded from
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype website.</a></p>

<p>Hi Nile,</p>
<p>Firstly, may I know whether you sign in to OneDrive with a personal account (login with a Microsoft account like
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) or a work or school account (using an Office 365 work/school account with 1TB of storage)?</p>
<p>If it’s OneDrive, since our forum focuses on Office 365 for Business Online services, for OneDrive related questions, I would suggest you post the issue in our specialized
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/forum?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=Threads&amp;status=&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=All&amp;tm=1420179380690&amp;auth=1">
OneDrive forum</a>. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>If it’s OneDrive for Business, to narrow down the issue, I’d like to confirm the following information.</p>
<p>1. Please provide us a screenshot of the error "There's no network connection"?</p>
<p>Note: To upload screenshots, click <b>Use rich formatting</b> under the reply box in the forum and then click the icon of
<b>Insert/Edit Media.</b></p>
<p>2. Do you have other devices? To rule out the possibility of the error being caused by the device, does the issue occur to other devices?</p>
<p>3. To check the effected range of the issue, does it happen to others in your organization?</p>
<p>4. Have you updated it to the latest version?</p>
<p>If not, you can download the app from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Google Play Store</a>, and install it according to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-and-set-up-OneDrive-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-B8ED509B-C068-4EC8-8E69-60FFE8AF23CE?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#BKMK_AddAccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Exchange Server &#40; Hosted &#41; - and Outlook for Mac 2015</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Apologies for any ignorance on this.</p>

<p>I have subscribed to Office for Mac 2015.</p>
<p>I want to use a hosted Exchange service for my team, so we will all subscribe to Office for Mac.</p>
<p>What i want to know, is ....</p>
<p>Is Office 365 Business Premium, a service that uses Hosted Exchange ?</p>
<p>This may be obvious, but our current subscription is "Office 365 Business" at £7 per month, but i see that "Office 365 Business Premium" is only an extra 80p per month at £7.80, but says that it includes email. Is this included email a hosted Exchange account
 ?</p>
<p>Any info on whether this £7.80 account includes a hosted, full feature exchange account for an extra 80p, or if i am missing something !</p>
<p>Really appreciate any clarity on this, so i can get the rest of my users set up.</p>
<p>As our ideal scenario, is for us all to use Microsoft Outlook, and that we use this client, to access hosted Exchange accounts.</p>
<p>Also, is there any limits to Outlook for Mac, that would prevent us from sharing accounts, and sharing categories, and tags ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance, much appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Yes - 365 Business Premium gives you Hosted Exchange as well as desktop software.</p>
<p>when you refer to "sharing accounts" - I assume you mean having shared mailboxes, rather than having one subscription used by multiple people.</p>
<p>Each "£7.80/mo" subscription is for one, single named user. Yes, that user can personally install and use the software on up to 5 computers, but that's 5 computers they use.</p>
<p>You can't buy a single subscription and use it for 5 people.</p>
<p>Apart from that, yes - it all works perfectly the way you describe, as a full hosted Exchange system.</p>
<p>You should be able to get a 30 day free trial, so you can even ensure it fits your business needs</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Yes, Office 365 Business Premium plan includes hosted email services which is Exchange Online instead of Exchange server. It also has the Office software.</p>
<p>Here are the articles for your reference:</p>

<p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Exchange Online</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, can you please give us more details regarding your requirements “sharing accounts, and sharing categories, and tags”?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How to fix &#34;Better voice navigation is available&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am getting a popup message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Better voice navigation is available</strong></em></p>
<p><em>You're missing the language files that are needed to hear things such as street names. If you continue wilthout them, you'll still hear basic directions, or you can open speech settings to download your language now.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the speech settings and added English (United States) and now I have Australia and United States english in there and still getting the popup. I do not have Recognise non-native accents for this language ticked and the voice is Microsoft Catherine
 Mobile.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I am not sure what this message is asking of me. This is my first Lumia and I am loving the phone but this is a little frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance...</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Now I do not know how to delete English (United States) from the speech settings.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>After Latest Update to Windows 10, Network will not log onto Hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelegionofno  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Latest Update to Windows 10,  Network will not log onto Hidden Networks</h2>
                    <p>I actually noticed that Windows 10 seemed to be failing to remember hidden network settings prior to the most recent update.&nbsp; I could connect if I did enter the information and login by re-entering the network information each time I booted to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This previous weekend I allowed the most recent major update to install.&nbsp; Afterwards I found it impossible to logon to my wireless network even after I reintroduced the appropriate information multiple times.</p>
<p>I first attempted to remedy this problem by telling Windows 10 to forget my past settings for that wireless connection.&nbsp; I added the connection information multiple times,&nbsp; each time I was told that Windows could not connect.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Finally,&nbsp; I made this wireless connection visible and connected through normal procedures (Clicking on the connection name,&nbsp; adding passwords and choosing security and sharing preferences.)&nbsp; This connection was successful.</p>
<p>I again made that wireless identity invisible and connectivity continued without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I wanted to report this experience in the case that others might be having the same problem.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are lucky because I couldn't never ever connect to an hidden network. I tried to setup hidden network manually but I cannot connect anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 10240</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot un-hide the wifi because I'm in a friend's house and he is away for some months</p>
<p>But anyway, it's a bug because it should work without un-hidding network. Does anyone know if MS is working on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe we should use a third-party program? if yes, which one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>for your situation, I offer a "shot in the dark" guess since it is clear that you are unable to configure the wireless router.
</p>
<p>Often there is a button on the modem-router which enables a local user to automatically configure a nearby device.
</p>
<p>Also assuming that there might be other wireless devices left behind by your host, they are probably connected to the proper SSID which will not be hidden on that device.</p>
<p>Perhaps?</p>

<h3> guardian_452  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macbook Air 2010 &#47; windows 10 discussion</h2>
                    <p>I am having a few issues with Windows 10, one is my touchpad does not work very well. The cursor moves fine but there is no right click, scrolling, etc (multitouch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My speakers are not working. I can see the levels move in device manager but no sound comes out. If I plug in a headset the sound plays through it. The speakers are not muted and the volume is turned up ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function keys are not working. I.e. screen brightness, volume, play/pause, etc. It is like the FN key is stuck down all the time (e.g. it is sending F1-F12 even without holding down FN)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 devices with problems in device manager: Bluetooth, iSight, Coprocessor (?), and SM Bus Controller. I had installed *all* the bootcamp drivers which are for windows 7 but it made the system too unstable, so I re-installed windows and might have
 to hand pick them. I let windows update do it's job this time for the nvidia and etc. drivers. I think the SM Bus controller will solve the brightness being unable to adjust, and I guess I need some utility to remap my F-keys to work properly again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be other people out there that have had the same issues and came up with a fix already :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 works great on my ancient Lenovo T61 but there is no battery and the power cord is rather loose, these problems make it.. interesting.. to use. But support wise it is almost perfect, except I tend to use the middle button for scrolling and the
 behavior is different depending on the app in use (doesn't work well for new/metro (?) styled apps ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, it would be great if my macbook had the same level of support. It's old so the battery only lasts 3-4 hours but much better than no battery at all.</p>
<p>

            <p>This doesnt work for me. I cant get the trackpad to work (late 2010 macbook air) no matter what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest bootcamp for this model only supports windows 7, when i try to launch in in windows 10 it says it wont run in anything other than win7. Tried manually installing the trackpad-driver from the folder, no luck. Tried trackpad++, wont work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill probably have to roll back.</p>

            <p>For unsupported Macs, you need to run BootCamp.msi with msiexec in a Admin Command Prompt. I think the command was</p>
<p>
</p><p>msiexec /i "C:\Path\to\BootCamp.msi"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then you have to keep the Boot Camp 5 drivers around because if you want to update them, you need the original MSI to reference.</p>

            All you need to do is go to "Programs and Features" in the control panel, right-click on "Boot Camp Services" and choose 'Repair' after restart all the Fn key combos, keyboard backlight, and mouse gestures should be back to normal.

            <p>This is a job for Templates! Use Word's File&gt;Save As command and change the Save as type to Word Template (*.dotx). Double-clicking on a template does not open it: instead it creates a new document that includes all the typestyles of your originals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To apply a template to an existing document, open the document in Word and follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the File tab, choose <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Add-Ins</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom of the dialog, change the <em>Manage</em> dropdown to <strong>Templates</strong> and click on the Go button.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Attach</strong> button.</li><li>Navigate to your template, select it and click on OK.</li><li>Check the box <em>Automatically update document styles</em>.</li><li>Click on OK. The styles in the document are updated.</li><li>Highly recommended: repeat the above steps. When you get to the Templates and Add-Ins dialog, UNcheck
<em>Automatically update document styles</em>. This will will keep the new styles constant in the document even if you later update the styles in the template.</li></ol>
<p>A note about how styles update when you attach a new template: </p>
<ul>
<li>For styles that have the same name in both document and template, the document styles will be updated.</li><li>For styles that are in the template, but not in the document, the styles will be added to the document.</li><li>For styles that are in the document, but not in the template, the styles will remain unchanged.</li><li>For all text that has been locally formatted, the styles will be ignored and the local formatting retained. Local formatting is selecting text and change the font and paragraph, but not applying a style. The majority of Word documents are locally formatted.</li></ul>

    <title>how to step through a list box, selecting each row sequentially - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> upright twin  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to step through a list box, selecting each row sequentially</h2>
                    <p>I have a report interface that the staff uses. There is a list of reports available and several controls that are used for filtering the reports. All works fine with manual&nbsp; selections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a batch of reports every week, printing them and saving them as PDF files. What I want to do is automate this and let Access do the set for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am having trouble with is setting the selection in the reports list box, using either the index or the row number, so I can loop through the reports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the obvious stuff but can't find a way to set the selection with something like Me!lst_Reports(i) or Me!lst_Reports.Selected(i) or numerous other mixtures of the standard available methods or properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It fails in the row where I put the asterisk. This is where I tried several things; none of them work so far.
</p>
<p>(The Echo part is for the user's benefit, so they can see what is going on. From experience I found that the spinning donut isn't enough, they expect feedback of some kind.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' set the PDF file name based on the report <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 0 To 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' index in lst_Reports<br />

If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file, amongst other things, does something similar to what you are attempting.&nbsp; If you click on the
<em>Create Multiple Invoices as PDF File(s)</em> button on the main invoices form this opens a dialogue form in which you can select multiple invoices from a list box and out put them either as a single PDF file or as multiple files.&nbsp; If you select the latter
 each file is saved to the relevant customer's subfolder in whatever folder you selected in the opening form as the location for the PDF files.&nbsp; The subfolder is created if it does not yet exist.&nbsp; The code to do this is:<br />
<br />

<br />
A few explanatory points:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; A report output as a PDF file by means of the OutPutTo method of the DoCmd object cannot be
<em>filtered </em>in the way that it would be if opened by means of the OpenReport method.&nbsp; Its recordset must be
<em>restricted </em>by parameters in the report's RecordSource query.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; To identify selected items in a multi-select list box you need to loop through the control's ItemsSelected collection.&nbsp; This is a collection of variants, each of which identifies a selected row.&nbsp; The value in the bound column can then be retrieved by means
 of the ItemData property, a value in another column by means of the Column property, with the value of the variant identifying the row in each case.<br />

            <p>I had thought of the query def as an alternative way and probably the easiest. I have plenty of code bits to recycle for that. I could simply use the list source lookup query to do it, reading the values and using MoveNext to the end of the recordset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wanted to do the visual thing, showing the selection in the list box for the user's sake. That's why all the Echo stuff, to refresh the display each time through the loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that would be cool and I always look for something just a little different from my usual automation - give the user something&nbsp;to see other than the spinning donut.</p>

            <p>It looks like I will need to set the MultiSelect on the list box. I'll give that a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking this would be a good idea for looping through the list in the code but I like to avoid users doing something they shouldn't. Since they should only do one report at a time I had set this to None. Users can find plenty of ways to crash an app
 without me giving them one more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, a piece that hit debug yesterday worked (kinda) today. I had tried this:</p>
<p>Me!lst_Reports.Selected(i) = True</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it didn't pass the muster. Today it went on a couple of lines but failed with "Err 94 Invalid use of null" when trying to read the row that was supposed to be selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the caveat on the Report.Filter property. I can use my query def rebuilder to get around that one. I was trying to avoid that so the base queries would have full recordsets but if I make the automated version a separate DB I can get around that
 problem.</p>

            <p>OK, I got it to work. Cut down about 20 minutes of manual report stuff to less than 3 minutes. Not bad for 16 reports.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks to Scottgem and Ken. Even though you didn't have a copy/paste answer you both led me in enough of a different direction to figure it out. As someone once said to me, sometimes you just need to talk it out and the answer comes on its own.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I set out to not only automate the report batch, but also to give the user as much visual feedback as possible that something was actually happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to show one selection in the list box at a time, telling the user which report was running. On one of the reports where another list was a filter, I did the same, visually selecting one filter at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of notes before the code bits:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the MkDir, if the directory already exists it throws an error: # 75. I don't remember the exact description but it was something about a file/path error. Just trap it and Resume Next.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Before I did the query rebuilding part I tried using the command code that gathered the filter parts and ran the reports. I figured since the reports would pop up in Preview it might work. I lucked out and it does. This is a cut-down version of the big report
 app so there are less filters and choices but it may work for you if you have a solid report tool already.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My reports have suffixes depending on what you are looking at, how grouped and sorted, etc. The base is what the suffix is added to. Be aware that you have to get the base on each time through the loop if the base is the same but the suffix changes (instead
 of before the loop) or the appended suffix on the variable makes a report name that doesn't exist. Crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the report is run, printed and saved, close it. What I ran into was if not closed you end up printing the same report over and over without the new filtering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cut out all those Echo False lines. I liked the way the user not only sees the list boxes change, but also sees the pop-up that shows printing and the pop-up that shows saving.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that there are 2 Print commands. One pops up the Print dialog, the other doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, before this is all put to bed I will make constants that define the loop indexes. That makes it easier, not having to go back and forth between the lookup queries (sources for the lists) and the code to see which one is next in the list when you
 get back in here next year.</p>
