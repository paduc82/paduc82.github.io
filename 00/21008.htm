<h2>            Nokia Lumia 640 - photos disappearing from camera roll</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife is using a Lumia 640 and has experienced several times the same problem recently. She takes a lot of picture with her phone but sometimes those picture simply vanish from the phone. If I connect the phone to my computer, I can see that all files
 are still there, I can transfer them to my computer but they are not visible on the phone anymore. If I copy them back from the computer to the phone, they re-appear on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a very annoying problem, it looks like the phone index doesn't list the pictures anymore while all the files are still there. It happened quite a few times in the last couple of weeks. The phone is using Windows 8.1 and has the latest update.<br />
<br />
I have a Lumia 930 and I have never experienced the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea of what's going wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
Laurent</p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/71c7e970-0c7a-4864-909d-6532107c82f3" title="KlintIstwood">
Laurent</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query to Microsoft Community. We understand that you're having issues with your wife's Lumia 640, wherein the pictures are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have quoted the description of the issue that you're experiencing, and it is normal. Moving the pictures files from the phone to your computer, will remove the said files from the phone. The picture files will re-appear on the phone if you've moved them
 back to phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to troubleshoot further, please provide the following information below:</p>
<ol>
<li>What changes did your wife did before the images started missing?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ol>
<p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say that files are not visible on the phone anymore, I mean that I cannot see them before connecting the phone to my pc. That's the whole problem. For some reason photos and some other files too cannot be viewed anymore from the phone while all files
 are still there when you use a pc to browse the content of the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When photo cannot be viewed anymore from the phone, the only way I have found to have them back on the phone is to transfer them to my pc and then transfer them back to the phone. When all photos disappear and if you take a new photo with the camera, only
 the new photo is visible until all photos disappear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started recently while nothing change with the phone, no update, no change in configuration, no new application installed, ... I can't really find a reason why this problem suddenly happened (and repeated itself)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks<br />
Laurent</p>

            <p>Thank you for clarifying the symptoms that you're experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the phone has an SD memory card, it is possible that it is corrupted. Please perform a scan disk maintenance on the memory card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn off your phone and remove the SD card. Use a SD card reader and plug it in to your computer.<br />
</li><li>Open <strong>Computer</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking Computer.</li><li>Right-click the SD card drive that you want to check, and then click "<strong>Properties</strong>".</li><li>Click the "<strong>Tools</strong>" tab, and then, under <strong>Error-checking</strong>, click
<strong>Check Now</strong>.</li><li>Put a check mark on the "<strong>Automatically fix the file system errors</strong>" and "<strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong>".</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Wait for the maintenance to complete, mount your SD memory card back to the phone and try to view the images again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us posted.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.<br />
Unfortunately the phone has no SD card. It appears that the problem also affects text messages as they recently also disappeared from the phone.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I am having the same problem with my lumina 640 I took the batterout for about 20 minutes since it seemed to not hold a charge after putting the battery back in all my photos are gone. It says take a picture and the photo will appear here. Where did all
 my photos go and why would taking the battery out cause them to disappear? Where are they on my phone? How do I find them? I do not have a SD card and there is no lumina care center near me so do you have other help ?

            Hello, i haven't figured out what was the problem but i did a factory reset and the the problem did not happen again. You can find your photos by connecting to a computet and going in the camera roll repertory.

<p>I know this sound strange, but most problems I've had with my phone seem to start when I travel by air. The disappearing photo problem started a couple months ago on a trip to LA. Also, I've notice that when traveling by air, the settings for MS Weather
 &amp; News apps get corrupted. So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only conclude that the TSA airport x-ray scanners must be responsible for corrupting phone memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experienced this issue?</p>

<p>Hi Nate,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying your requirement.</p>
<p>However, it is not feasible to put one's reply that&nbsp;close to a post, since it is an expected behavior that all the replies will be sorted in the time order, and as I said before, the oldest/newest reply always comes first regardless of who replied .</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Emails from my VPS are being silently discarded by Hotmail and put in the junk mail folder of Office 365 Recipients.</p>
<p>SPF and DKIM are setup correctly and I have no issues sending emails to GMail recipients. I've checked that the IP address is not in any blacklist as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if a Technician could contact me to sort out this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forefront Spam header in one email as example:</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you have issue with Hotmail/Office 365 emails.</p>
<ol>
<li>When you say "VPS are being silently discarded by Hotmail and&nbsp;put in the junk mail folder of Office 365 Recipients.", what do you mean by that?&nbsp;</li><li>How are you trying to access your account, by using a browser or email client?</li></ol>
<p>If you are using a browser, try with different browser and computer.</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li>When you say "VPS are being silently discarded by Hotmail and&nbsp;put in the junk mail folder of Office 365 Recipients.", what do you mean by that?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Exactly what it says. Emails are sent correctly and logged as received by the sending mail server but never appear in the users inbox/spam/junk folders (in Hotmail) and go straight to the Junk mail folder in Office365.</p>
<ol>
<li>How are you trying to access your account, by using a browser or email client?</li></ol>
<p>Tested with Chrome (latest), Firefox (latest) and IE11 as well as the users email client (Windows Live Mail)</p>

                    Microsoft Outlook 2010 Pop up box keeps popping up when sending/receiving E-mail. It keeps asking for server,&nbsp;username, and&nbsp; password. This will not go away even though I check save password, cancel or X out. My password and user name are correct. Very
 annoying. My wife has the same issue on her lap top. It started happening after the last update. I have windows&nbsp;Vista and my wife has windows 7. Thank you for any help

the text of my computer has changed on its own, I have no idea why.&nbsp;
It's not blurred but the graphics of it look a bit weird. I checked on the resolution and I've also tried to reboot my system but nothing helped it. It's not only&nbsp;the text but also emoticons like the:&nbsp;😃&nbsp;��&nbsp;💻&nbsp;🔥&nbsp;
I
 don't know why or how this happened, I would really appreciate&nbsp;it if somebody could help me fix this problem.
Does
 anybody know how?

<p>Thank&nbsp; you for posting at the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try tor restart the phone, remove the battery.</p>
<p>Click on Internet Explorer (...) settings and change the "open links from other apps in" from a new tab to the current tab or opposite.. Try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint animation timing repeat until next click</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how the PowerPoint animation setting for timing “ Repeat: Until Next Click” is supposed to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve tried all sorts of combinations with other animated shapes and animations on the same shape but seem unable to stop the animation repeating when the same or another object is clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems nothing on the web about this feature or in the online help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Interesting.&nbsp; The phone is an AT&amp;T 8525 which is made by HTC, same as their "Hermes."&nbsp; HTC told me to download the upgrade for WM6
<u>from their HTC site for the AT&amp;T 8525 phone</u>, so it would be correct for the device.&nbsp; When I called HTC about the missing "Old Phone" ringtone, they said to go to Microsoft.&nbsp; There must be some place for a simple download of this sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks !</p>

<p>Mr. Mike McA, I am quite grateful that you provided that ringtone as that one was my favorite on my MDA before I just got my Wing.&nbsp; However, as mentioned earlier in this blog there were others that were available on the older version of Windows mobile that
 no longer seem available, namely Terrestrial and Mystic.&nbsp; Would you (or anyone else viewing this blog) have them available for me to download?&nbsp; I have searched the internet and have failed to find them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and help with this issue.</p>

<h2>            When Automatic Numbering happens my normal font changes.</h2>
                    I'm in Microsoft Word 2016, and since updating every time my Word document auto numbers, the font changes back to Cambria, instead of the font i've been using throughout. How can I make it so every time I make a numbered list the font doesn't revert back
 to Cambria?

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Styles pane (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S), click the Manage Styles icon; in the dialog box, choose your preferred font on the Set Defaults tab. If you want to transfer these settings to your template, select "New documents based on this template" before clicking
 OK.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with number values.&nbsp; It does not work with an array because match returns either a row or a column number but not both.&nbsp; The array needs to be column or a row vector (a 1-dimensional array).</p>

                    <p>I generally use OneNote 2010 on my PC but have begun to use OneNote for Mac when I travel, and love having the freedom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create notes in the Mac version I creates I blank page. Is there a way for me to utilize templates in the Mac version. Ideally the same one, but I can recreate a new one if needed.</p>

            <p>I don't know if this will be helpful to you or not but here's my workaround for the lack of Templates in OneNote for Mac (which should also work for iOS versions since they also lack templates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had TextExpander installed on my Mac so I created a note with what I wanted in my template. Then I selected and cut that and pasted it into a new snippet in TextExpander (set to formatted text, not plain text). &nbsp;Now I can create the new page and
 type in the keyboard shortcut and I get exactly what I wanted. &nbsp;It's an extra step and you have to have TextExpander but it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already have a template defined from a Windows version of OneNote (or it sounds like that) you could create a new page on a Windows workstation and then open it on your Mac to get the text. &nbsp;That would save typing it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope OneNote for Mac gets templates soon but TextExpander is very useful in its own right so this isn't too bad until then.</p>

<h3> vetrivelmurugan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 5230 touch display issue</h2>
                    Hello there, I bought Nokia 5230 more than a year before in India (Chennai). Its about 1.5 yr old. Now am facing an issue with the phone's display. The screen gets distorted at times. Especially when I am inside the Air Conditioned rooms. After locking/Unlocking
 (using the strip given in the right side of the phone) about 10 times sometimes it works. Everytime when I want to use the phone I have to come out of the A.C room and stand outside 10 to 15 minutes for the display to get ready. But I am able to traverse through
 the music player and listen to songs (by using frequent of times, I know the path) though the screen is distorted. I mean to say the problem is only with the display and not With the software and others. I took my phone to the Nokia Care centre in Chennai
 (India) The inspector just after seeing the screen told that "This is display issue sir and it is common across all Nokia touch screen mobile phones". I was shocked to hear that. Based upon the trust we have with Nokia,
                </div>

            It's a bit hard to tell exactly if it's common as there has been sold millions if not billions of these type of phones, but from looking at what happens here on the forum, there has been quite a few reports on this. It seems to be an issue with the resistive
 screens.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you what to do, as I have no impact on what your local care point does, but I can't say this is a common issue with capacitive screens used on newer Nokias.<br />

UdaykumarT</a>. If you're still trying to revert back the&nbsp;device to Windows Phone 8.1 commercial software, close the Windows Device Recovery Tool:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987</a>, re-open and take the update to the latest version of the tool. Once the new version is installed, try recovering the phone's software again. Make sure that it has a good
 power source. If your Lumia device is not recognized, click "My phone was not detected" button and continue the attempted recovery process. We'd appreciate it if you'll let us know the result.</p>
