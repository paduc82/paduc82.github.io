<h2>            Can Send, but not Recive</h2>
                    I can send but not receive emails. I have tried all of the suggestions listed on other posts. It is not my settings, and it isn't going into junk. If you respond, I will give you the email address in a private message. Thank you.

<h2>            Microsoft Publisher 2010</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Dell laptop in 2010 from QVC, it came with windows office but not publisher. I went to Microsoft website and purchased and down loaded Publisher 2010 ( expensive $200.00 to $300.00) &nbsp;also I had a backup disk sent $12.00 or so. &nbsp; Last fall the
 Geek Squad down loaded windows 10 and my publisher disappeared, did I mention I don't know what I did with the MS key. Geeks Squad says the program is gone but files still there. &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft says to old can't (won't) help me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get a key?????</p>

            <p>I originally downloaded from Microsoft and they emailed me the key &nbsp;and what else, I cant find the email and Geek Squad looked in my Outlook and couldn't find it. I paid Microsoft extra for a backup Disc and I have it still in the shipping sleeve it came
 in with their name and my name &amp; address. </p>
<p>You would have to believe somewhere on that disc there's a number that would led back to me or the shipping sleeve would be enough to warrant them giving me a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not a cheep program, I want to say $300.00ish and I am very unhappy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no I don't have a receipt.</p>

            <p>Sorry to say, but I think you will find you are totally out of luck if you can't find the Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance you still have the original purchase confirmation email? The product key would be there. Use the search feature in your email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fundamental problem is that MS expects you to keep your own records of your product key. If you don't, MS won't help you. So you can try that Parth provided, but I don't think it will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In THEORY, the switch to Win 10 (personally I won't call it an upgrade from Win 8.1) is supposed to carry over any programs that work.&nbsp; In practice it seems carrying over Office 2010 has been hit or miss. It worked for some people but not for others.&nbsp; After
 the initial "upgrade" you had a 30 day time period when you could "back out", return, to the original version of Win.&nbsp; During that time you could have used a tool to "extract" your 20101 product key from that "old" version.&nbsp; MS is treating this as a bonus
 opportunity to make more money by forcing people to buy new copies of Office programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you buy Office programs online, that purchase is recorded with your email account. But from what I understand, they only keep that record for a max of 5 years, so it MAY be there, but probably not.&nbsp; Log in to your MyAccount page and look around there:
</p>
<div>
<span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://account.microsoft.com/</strong></a><strong> - MS Account Home page</strong></span>

<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an absolutely tiny chance that you can still find that key.&nbsp; It MAY still be in your "recycle bin". Open the recycle bin and look for the file "Tokens.DAT".&nbsp; If you find it, restore it and use one of these tools to extract the keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: you should extract your Office 2010 key and record it somewhere it won't get lost in case you need it again in the future.</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>You can use any of the following tools to extract the Product Key from you computer. These tools report on many installed programs on your computer, not just Office.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>PS</span></strong><span>: you should keep a copy (printed and/or file copies on external storage devices) of the report(s) generated by these tools so you have all of your
 product keys / registration numbers available for future re-installs</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>FYI</span></strong><span>: I (Rohn) have not tested these tools in Windows 8 (just haven’t had an excuse to make/waste the time), but I don’t expect any problem. The underlying
 mechanics of Windows 8 are essentially the same as Windows 7 if you ignore the Metro User Interface. Think of metro as “lipstick on a pig”. The pig is not changed by adding a little paint on the surface.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>Normally you have several resources to find your Retail Product Key.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>o<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Activation backup utilities </span><span>From what I’ve read, MS uses a file called
<strong>TOKENS.DAT</strong> to store encrypted product activation keys:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\<strong>Tokens.DAT</strong>
<br />
<br />

<br />
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Do not expect the Windows.OLD folder to be there until you delete it. Many people have complained that windows 8 and 8.1 automatically delete
 it WITHOUT WARNING<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/windows-8-has-deleted-my-windowsoldprogramfiles/dbdf75c0-09d9-4992-b8eb-d9fac3efe9b8?page=2</a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you extract the Product Key, make sure to write it down and keep it in a safe place. Burning a copy of the installation file to a CD would also be a good idea if you don’t have the installation disk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: OEM (factory install and activated) licenses use a different key than the one reported.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Only the factory can use the PK from the original factory activation. You would have been provided with a separate piece of paper with a Product key for reactivation.</span></p>

 may appear a little overwhelming, don’t worry it’s not that complicated and your not going to break anything else. Select the circle next to “Load the product keys from external Software Registry hive”. Now from here you may have to browse to a slightly different
 location depending on where your windows.old folder is located, but you want to basically browse to the following and open this file:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><span>C:\Windows.old\Windows\System32\config\RegBack\SOFTWARE</span></p>

<h2>            X6 random beeping &#47; bleeping</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new X6 16gb on the UK O2 network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every so often the phone beeps / bleeps, like a warning beep.</p>
<p>Nothing is displayed on the screen, it doesn't even light up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not asking for any user input, it just beeps / bleeps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is really annoying as no matter what I've done I can't get it to stop.</p>
<p>There is no pattern to beeps / bleeps, it's just every so often! Including the middle of the night!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone any ideas?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can't resolve I'll have to get rid of it and get another phone (not a Nokia!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a random single beep, the middle button/key does not light up/flash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It beeps then nothing - screen doesn't light up, buttons don't light up - just a random beep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really annoying!&nbsp; I've checked all settings, all warning tones and notifications have been set to off, yet it still does it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's driving me mad, so much so I'm actually considering ditching it and swapping it for another manufacturer and staying clear of Nokia phones for good!</p>

<p>Hi, Anyone have any ideas how to fix this ? I have the exact same problems that the original poster described with my new X6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have another problem that when a text comes through the screen does not light up to tell you that you have a message, it just stays blank. If you miss the message alert tone or you have the settings on meeting then you have to take the key guard off
 to see if you have any messages.</p>

            I dont know how to solve the beeping, but for the texts, the menu button light should flash if you have new messages.<br />
<br />
If you have breathing light set to on, when you have no messages, it will just light up and turn off in a slow manner, but if you have a messages, it flashes rapidly for three times every 30sec or so.

    <title>Is it possible to put check boxes into a catalogue merge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is it possible to put check boxes into a catalogue merge</h2>
                    Can anyone tell me if it is possible, and if so how, to put a check box into a Publisher catalogue merge.&nbsp; I have Yes/No fields in my datasource, an Access database, which appear as ticked or blank check boxes in both the table and form.&nbsp; When I try to
 merge this information into a publisher document I get a True or False statement in the merge document.&nbsp; If at all possible I would like to convert these to ticked or blank checkboxes in the publisher catalogue.<br />

            <p>Can you somehow insert a symbol or the character code for a symbol into your database field?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see what I mean create a text box in Publisher and format that text box for Wingding font. Then Alt + 0254 will give you a checked box symbol. Alt + 0254 will give you a box with an X in it, and Alt + 0168 will give you an empty box. Or Windings 2 font,
 character code 0082 gives you a 'less bold' version of the checkbox. You can look at your alternatives in Publisher by going to the Insert tab &gt; Text group and click on the down arrow beside the symbol icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Access much so I don't know if you can format a cell to include an image, symbol or character code, but perhaps you can figure out a way to do it? Perhaps you save the checkbox symbol as an image and them merge the image?</p>

            <p>A checked or empty wingding symbol can be placed in the publisher document, but this is not what I need.&nbsp; I need an interactive check box that will pick up the command from the Access database for each individual record selected in catalogue merge.&nbsp; It probably
 needs to run a script to verify if the field is True or False and then check only those fields that return True to the query.</p>

            <p>I think you are missing David's point. What he is suggesting is an additional field in Access that will derive the check box character from the True/False value and use that field in your merge. It is certainly possible to do this in Excel, and I suspect
 it will be in Access also, though the example shown below was created in Excel and imported into Access for the purpose of demonstration:</p>

            <p>What I have is an extremely complicated Access database formatted with multiple checkbox entries (62 in total) throughout, which print fine in Access (as forms and reports) but do not transfer through to Publisher in catalogue merge.&nbsp; I can insert images
 and photos into the database and merge them into Publisher.&nbsp; It is only the checkboxes that default to True/False.&nbsp; I'm using Access 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experimented with one column to start, following your excellent instructions above (thank you both, David and Graham).&nbsp; When I put in the additional column in Access for the checkbox true/fasle statement, it would not accept a checkbox symbol inserted
 through alt+0254, probably because checkbox formatting is included in Access programming.&nbsp; Nor was an insert checkbox option available in the Insert - Object menu.&nbsp; Checkbox formatting is included in Access in design view for datasheets, forms, reports, etc.
 which seems to exclude other forms of insertion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An additional problem is that the particular section I am trying to print in Publisher consists of three separate entries under each month of the year, so I would need 36 additional columns in all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried approaching this problem from a different perspective to see if I could export the section I need to excel and import that into Publisher along with the remaining information through Access.</p>
<p>That opened has a whole new series of problems!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep working on it.&nbsp; And thank you for your time and effort.</p>

    <title>How To set Focus the Contact item field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malikz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To set Focus the Contact item field</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am validating the contact item fields for required fields say email address, phone number. How can I set focus in the field&nbsp;when user closes message box is shown stating the fields are required.</p>
<p>I think it can be handled in Windows API, Please let me know any possible way if possible sample c# code.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Malik Z.</p>

            This is with a custom form? (The <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/outlookdev/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook for Developers</a> forum would be your best choice in the future for custom form questions.) Are you using validation formulas set on the individual controls? If so, you'd need to get rid of those formulas and instead write code for the Item_Write event
 handler to (a) check for a valid property value for desired fields and (b) return the control and call its SetFocus method. See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.outlookcode.com/article.aspx?ID=38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Syntax for Outlook properties and controls</a> if you need a primer on control
 syntax.

<p>Regardless of what fields they are, you would still use the technique I described if you want to keep it simple and confined to the customform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to try hacking at it with Windows API calls, that would require an add-in or VBA code, since the Windows API isn't programmable from VBScript.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"however, that if the user changes only the data in an unbound control -- and not the data in any bound control -- Item_Write will not fire when the user clicks Save.&nbsp;"</p>
<p>This is my issue, I am writing add-in code in C# for validation and displaying the message box. When user enters the value&nbsp;in the required fields and click on saveandclose button the value in the required fields are not set before validation unless user
 manually click somewhere else in the form controls.</p>
<p>"The CustomPropertyChange event fires only after the user presses Tab or Enter or otherwise moves the focus to another control."</p>
<p>SO I need to programitically set focus to say name field so that the vales are set and available before validation on saveandclose click.</p>

<p>You should have told us from the beginning that you were working on an add-in. That changes everything. Next time, please use the<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/outlookdev/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook for Developers</a> forum for programming issues,
 rather than posting in this end-user forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not using a custom form, then there's no method within the Outlook object model to move the focus. And I can't help you with Windows API hacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you're validating for required fields as your original post described, all the data should be available when the Write event fires. CustomPropertyChange would be useful only if you were interested in validating specific entries as the user enters

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try the following steps to check the outcome:</p>
<p>1)Sign out your Office 365 account from Office applications.</p>
<p>2)Quit all running desktop applications.</p>
<p>2)Clean Office credential by the steps below:</p>
<p>2.1 Type Credential Manager at the Windows search bar and click to open it.</p>
<p>2.2&nbsp; Under the Generic Credentials, select the credentials which related to "MicrosotOffice16". Then click the drop down list and click remove to delete it.</p>
<p>3)Restart your Windows and try signing in again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps doesn't work, please also try the methods( who has similar experience as you )in the following thread :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some problems with the current Nokia C3-00 firmware, especially where the operators tweaked them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check this thread, perhaps the settings <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/1D0FCB99-CD80-4AAF-A876-D57837BC8354">
here</a>&nbsp;could help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you could try to do a factory reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Nokia Mail asks for the connection method to be used? Does it displays the G icon when it should connect using WLAN?&nbsp;Does the Communities app work? Can you watch youtube clips in the media player?</p>

<p><span>Thanks your reply.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I made the factory reset, but no change. Nokia mail ask for connection method. but its egal what i choose wlan or mobil internet same error message. No G icon is appearing after wlan chooseing. The E icon (Edge) is appearing only if i choose mobilinternet.
 Yes, the communities is working, and all other internet application is working. (Opera, Bolt, Skype, Ovi store, Nimbuzz are ok.) Yes i can watch youtube videos.</span></p>

<p>HI C3 usewr;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me give you seme more ideas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email access is dependent on the data plan in use<br />
Some Operators provide only web browser access in their basic plan and subscribers need to purchase a premium plan to use email.<br />
Operators can detect port-specific traffic and can block the email unless the customer is subscribed to the appropriate plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the subscriber is trying to use Wi-Fi, but without a valid SIM card, it won’t work (although data can be transferred over Wi-Fi, a valid SIM card is still required for Nokia Messaging).<br />
Action:&nbsp; Have the subscriber switch to cellular reception with a SIM card and a valid, appropriate Operator data plan.<br />
If the subscriber is using cellular reception, but still can’t connect…<br />
Action:&nbsp; Check they configured the correct Access Point on their device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the device Home screen, have the subscriber go to the Applications menu, then…<br />
Select “Settings”<br />
Scroll down and select “Connectivity”<br />
Select “Network”<br />
“Operator selection” should be set to “Automatic”.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail blocking never &#42;really&#42; BLOCKS the sender, how can I&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Running Win 8.1 and have a *lovely* Hotmail account.</p>
<p>When I get junk mail (more and more every day), I try to BLOCK the sender.&nbsp; In most cases, Hotmail tells me the sender is-
<em>get this</em>-&nbsp; 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; However, if I do a review of the email Properties, in 99% of cases it clearly states where the email is sent from.&nbsp; I have to cut and paste, cut and paste EVERY email in my Junk Folder, then manually add
 them to my Blocked Senders list.&nbsp; (Sorry, I already spent an hour tonight cleaning mine up, so I don't have an example to post.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me, Hotmail has the lamest way of handling Junk mail.&nbsp; And lamer for adding to the Blocked Senders List.&nbsp; You can't export or import a list, I don't know why it does not recognize the actual senders' name (though I usually block the Domain, due
 to the randomness of the Username@Domain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've added it to the Blocked Senders List, the&nbsp;column itself is only so wide, so you often cannot even see the full name of what is in the list.</p>
<p>On occasion, I have reported junk mail as a 'phishing mail' if the subject contained anything related to Mortgage, Funding, Warranty, Investments-&nbsp;without opening the email- to protect myself- why would I open the email when I don't need any of those things
 and therefore cannot really review them to verify if they are truly asking for personal information?&nbsp; Much less click on anything in that email that might offer me to "unsubscribe".&nbsp; MS claims to handle 'phishing' email more seriously...</p>
<p>They are usually classified as Newsletters, but in my experience, just like robo-telephone calls- if you acknowledge you've received it, you'll just get your email address propagated further.&nbsp; And who know what website it might take me to if I did choose
 the link to "Unsubscribe"?&nbsp; Danger at every option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When reviewing the Properties of the emails, I often see things like (forgive me, I don't have a fresh example, but this is pretty close) &lt;sender: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; or &lt;From: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; but when I try to Block (the
 Domain), the only thing that Microsoft offers is that "account-security-noreply..." email address I listed above.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>And it does NOT show up in my Blocked Senders list!</em></span>&nbsp; Even though MS says it has been Blocked.</p>
<p>Tonight I added it manually to my list just to see if it will make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this?&nbsp; Or frustrated by it?&nbsp; Or have a workaround to better deal with it?&nbsp; Even my old dial-up free email used to allow import and export of any type of sender you wanted, had more flexibility.&nbsp; It does no good to simply delete
 them, I WANT THEM TO BE BLOCKED!&nbsp; MS should know better and handle it better, in my opinion, especially if they are so concerned about disk space (the real reason accounts get closed after x-many days and your data is deleted- been through that H*** too, and
 lost everything- their questionnaire wanted to know things like the email address of the sender of the last few emails- they were in my Contacts!&nbsp; How could I answer that without being able to access my account?&nbsp; So they send me a code, I key it in and it
 says it needs a six-digit code, not the 4 digit code they sent me- don't get me started...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any feedback, comments or ideas will be greatly appreciated- the Community has been of help before, I am hoping someone out there can help once again!&nbsp; Thank You!</p>

    <title>Keeping Data in Order in Rows when Reordering the Columns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristinemarie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keeping Data in Order in Rows when Reordering the Columns</h2>
                    
<p>What I want to be able to do is have my information that is spread across rows stay associated with the other information in that row even when I reorder a column.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>My information starts like this:</p>
<p>Tests --- Teachers</p>
<p>Vaccines --- Doctors</p>
<p>Pocket money --- Parents</p>
<p>Flowers --- Boyfriends</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want it to alphabetize the second column and have it end up like this:</p>
<p>Flowers --- Boyfriends</p>
<p>Vaccines --- Doctors</p>
<p>Pocket Money --- Parents</p>
<p>Tests --- Teachers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOT:</p>
<p>Tests --- Boyfriends</p>
<p>Vaccines --- Doctors</p>
<p>Pocket Money --- Parents</p>
<p>Flowers --- Teachers</p>
<p>Does that make any sense? Thanks!</p>

<p>unfortunately you cannot lock the cells in a row together, if you usually don't sort the information or if you are the only one doing it, you might consider protecting the sheet, before protcting the sheet be sure that the protection is locked for that two
 columns, to do that highlight the columns, right click on the mouse, cell format, go to the last tab called protection, check the box that says locked, then protect the sheet</p>
<p>P.S. If any post answers your question, please mark it as the Answer (so it won't keep showing as an open item.)</p>

            Normally, you go for your retailer. Then, your retailer sends that phone to a local but authorized repair facility. However, if you want to go for Microsoft Mobile directly: In which country are you right now? By the way: What is the issue? Perhaps there
 is an easier solution than sending it in.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Clean Up command doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2016 to access a GMail mailbox using IMAP protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given to a bad integration between GMail and Outlook, every message I send is stored twice in my
<em>Sent Mail </em>folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the suggested workaround and solved the problem but now I have to cleanup all the duplicated messages in my
<em>Sent Mail</em> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try using <strong>Clean Up command</strong>, as suggested in some articles I found, Outlook tells me that there is nothing to clean.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Build 10074 - Mail and Calendar all close shortly after starting</h2>
                    <p>The new mail and calendar apps all open fine and will run for about 30 seconds then they mysteriously close themselves out without any user action or error messages. I have two accounts one Outlook.com and one gmail.&nbsp; I have rebooted, tried the powershell
 hack that was needed in prior builds and nothing seems to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue,
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Conflict between antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span>2. &nbsp;Apps are not updated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the steps listed here:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></strong><span>I suggest you to disable Antivirus software/ Firewall and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span>1) Please make sure to re-enable Antivirus software after performing troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Antivirus software/ Firewall can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><br />
If the&nbsp;issue persists, I suggest you to try the steps in the article and check if it helps.<br />

<li>Uninstall "mail and calendar" from the settings app&gt;Installed apps</li><li>Re-install with Store(beta)</li></ul>

            <p>Unfortunately, on my Asus T100 the Settings&gt;Installed Apps never gets past about half way in determining app sizes, so it's impossible to uninstall any apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it appears that the Build 10074 update nuked my Avast Anti-Virus completely - not even a trace in Programs and Features or its former home on my hard drive. Lovely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With troubleshooting step 1 a non-issue,&nbsp;and no update or license sync functionality in Store Beta, the Mail and Calendar apps are as useless as the completely dysfunctional People app.</p>

<h3> frank mccormick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using INK in Powerpoint</h2>
                    I use a tablet PC and use ink to mark up slides during presentations. In previous versions of PPT, I could selct the INK option on the first slide, and it would continue throughtout the prresentation. In 2010, I have to select INK every slide, which makes
 it useless during a slide show..is there a way to lock in the INK option for a full presentation?

    <title>Windoes 10 Technical Preview - Absolutely terrible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bricked my computer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windoes 10 Technical Preview - Absolutely terrible</h2>
                    <p>I installed this Technical Preview after seeing that it was publicly available, and being flaunted like it was in "almost ready to go" mode. It didn't have warning of being a pure "Aplha" or anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine I am using is quite average, although I purchased it brand new off the shelf from costco about 6 months ago. Not super robust, but again, juts 6 months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the technical preview, absolutely everything runs MUCH SLOWER. When I click the magnifying glass icon in the bottom right (which I am assuming is their new way to use global search), a blank box pops up and then it says "Something went wrong".
 I think to myself, ok no problem, I'll just use the old way of searching by putting my mouse in the top right corner for charms to appear, and then clicking that magnifying glass. The method of going to charms and clicking magnifying glass to search has always
 worked great, very fast, fluid, great. Oh but guess what, that doesn't work either in the Technical Preview. So you have to right click in the bottom left corner, wait a few seconds for the search to open, and then search that way. But even then, anything
 I want to open takes about 50% longer to do so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be recovering my computer back to windows 8.1 as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>UPDATE:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days after installing, and restarting many times, eventually giving up, walking away, leaving the computer running and connected to Internet, it is now running much better, just about identically to how my machine was performing prior to installing
 this preview (when I had 8.1 installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I constantly forced it to check for updates during day #1 of my experiences, no updates were ever found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple days passed by, updates were installed, and it's running great now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now take back my comments about this being terrible, but what I can say is that the initial experiences with this were extremely bumpy. I guess that I was aware of this, but after it running SO POORLY at first, I felt the need to shares feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is no longer "Bricked" :-)...hopefully I can change my username.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What you have experienced has been reported a bit on these forums,&nbsp;after initial installation the updated device run poorly but after running for a day or so, things appear to sort themselves out &amp; most operation run more smoothly (a bit like a running in
 period). It also appears that during this settling in period the installation of updates is fairly critical for the device to run better.</p>
