            it has been said that retailers should be receiving them by the end of this month in some countries. i would anticipate that a lot of them shall start flowing through more and more in the next month or two, the same happened with accessories for the 920
 and 820, which are now widely available but weren't at the launch of the phone.

<p>It's all very frustrating. It was sold as a big advantage, when i got my new phone everyone wanted to see it, i kept on having to say imagine how good it will look when it has the colourful cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Weeks go by, nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now no one is interested anymore, so a big marketing opportunity has been missed,</p>

            hi guys,<br />
<br />
i've found the same situation here in Australia, but in a desperate bid to get some extra shells for my partner's 620, i found some sellers. Look in Ebay for the seller "2_buy_a" as they have the yellow and magneta shells in stock, and under the seller "eprom2020"
 for orange and cyan covers.<br />
<br />
shipping is pricey, but if you really want it then theres your options for now, until wider availability is confirmed.

<p>Cases have been available in the UK for over a month now, seen many websites selling them like ebay and amazon. If you are wanting to find them in a high street store you'll need to speak to the retailer as it's their decision if they stock them or not.</p>

            They ones on Ebay &amp; Amazon are either people reselling the "free" O2 shells or imports from other regions at inflated prices.<br />
<br />
NONE of the high street retailers have them, they all say "We're waiting for Nokia to release them". Obviously this could be BS but as even the Nokia website hasn't a clickable link I'm not so sure...

<p>I've seen and purchased ones from genuine retailers at reasonable prices. Know someone who bought all of the colours too. I've not put much effort into checking recently so they may well have gone out of stock again since I last purchased one.<br />
<br />
As for the high street the ones you have spoken are clearly telling lies as stock is available to them if they choose to stock them. As with most official Nokia accessories very few high street stores choose to stock them. Sadly Nokia doesn't sell them directly
 to the public so no purchase link will appear on their site.<br />
<br />
Which colour(s) are you looking for? As for prices don't be surprised if they are near ¬£20 as that's similar to the price of the 820's shells in the UK.</p>

<p>Fair enough, wouldn't surprise me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I've seen and purchased ones from genuine retailers at reasonable prices</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got the protective one on order from Amazon for ¬£12.99, the only problem is delivery is 1 - 3 months with the date moving daily... Could be a nice Christmas present for my wife ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just so frustrating buying a new phone and having to wait months for the genuine accessories to become readily available :(</p>

            The protective shell was launched long after the others so no surprise that it is out of stock. Don't know anyone that has managed to buy that one so may be a case of it's just not available yet.<br />

<h2>            Lumia 625 - freezes at Nokia logo during boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi, it's my first post here so I apologize for any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a problem with my Lumia 625 which I can't seem to figure out on my own. Yesterday it froze on me when I used phone normally (Messenger app), so I did a soft reset (like many times before) but it kept freezing just seconds after launching, during
 entering PIN code. I finally managed to do a hard reset, phone worked normally. After configuration I installed some apps and wallpapers and my Lumia froze again when I entered Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the situation is even worse as the device keeps freezing at Nokia boot logo. Can't even do the hard reset for the second time, exclamation mark shows up and then it's stuck again on Nokia logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Phone Recovery Tool doesn't help as well - the phone is detected by PC only for a few seconds after reset, then it's "disconnected" when Nokia logo shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice for next steps here?</p>

Micha≈Ç Palowski</a>. Have you tried using other USB&nbsp;cables? You may also try uninstalling and reinstalling the Windows Phone Recover Tool. If that didn't help, we suggest visiting a Care Point to have the phone physically evaluated by a technician. See this:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en/mobile/support/locations/</a>. Bear in mind that all files saved on the device will be deleted during the repair process. Any physical or liquid damage will void its
 warranty and charges may apply. We&nbsp;look forward to your response.

<h2>            OneDrive missing navigation and link to original site</h2>
                    
<p>When I am on sharepoint online site, I click on OneDrive tile on the office 365 bar and it takes me to onedrive.aspx page. OneDrive does not have any navigation . For example when I click on site settings there is no way to go back to home page of onedrive.
 I turned on publishing feature on one drive site to change navigation and tried to add link to home page and link to original site from which I was directed to One Drive site but it said you dont have access to this page.</p>
<p>After I am on OneDrive site, how do I go back to my original site ? Is there a way to add link to original sharepoint online site on One Drive so that users can go back to their original site after using one drive.</p>

<p>hi dhaval,</p>
<p>my understanding is that you want to figure if it is possible to (1) add a link to onedrive for business in site settings (open from onedrive for business) page and (2) add a link to sharepoint site. if there is any misunderstanding, please let me know.</p>
<p>for the 1st question:<br />
generally, we can go back to onedrive for business site (modern ui) by clicking app launcher &gt; onedrive, which takes us two clicks.<br />
if you‚Äôd like to add a link on site settings page, you can click edit link on left navigation &gt; click
<strong>+link</strong> &gt; enter name and url. the url for modern ui onedrive for business is like
<strong><em>https://&lt;tenant&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/&lt;user&gt;_&lt;domain&gt; /_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx</em></strong>, while for classic ui it‚Äôs
<em><strong>https:// &lt;tenant&gt;-my.sharepoint.com/personal/&lt;user&gt;_&lt;domain&gt;/documents/forms/all.aspx</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8fdef88f-cc22-4f91-b929-f74a9e0a7fe9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8fdef88f-cc22-4f91-b929-f74a9e0a7fe9" /></a><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>since you encounter an issue there, can you capture a screenshot for the error message and the page you stuck at? you can upload screenshots by clicking
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> &gt; the first <strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>
<p>for the 2nd question:<br />
you can<strong> add a custom tile</strong> to link your sharepoint site in app launcher via office 365 admin center. for detailed steps, please refer to the article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-custom-tiles-to-the-my-apps-page-and-app-launcher-1136115a-75af-4497-b693-640c4ce70bc6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Dhaval,</p>
<p>We are not able to add the navigation links directly on the current OneDrive for Business page.</p>
<p>In this case, we suggest you submit your feedback via <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/category/86090-onedrive-for-business?query=nivigation%20link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>. Your providing feedback is the best way to perfect our products and services.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Here is a workaround for you. It only works in OneDrive for Business Classic view.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the following link to change your personal site look.<br />

    <title>Change radius of rounded rectangular callout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukas0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change radius of rounded rectangular callout</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use a "rounded rectangular callout" auto-shape for my PowerPoint 2013 presentation. However, I find the radius on the corners to be too large, and I would like to make the corners a little smaller. The "rounded rectangle" shape has a smart
 handle near the corner that lets you adjust the radius. However, the rounded rectangular callout only has a yellow smart handle for moving the callout arrow, but not one for changing the radius.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is there any way to change the radius of the rounded rectangular callout shape?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>

            <p>A couple of options:</p>
<p>1. Create your own rounded rectangular callout using rounded rectangle and a triangle. After setting the rounded edges to your requirements and the triangle pointing to the required location, merge the shapes together using the Union tool in Merge Shapes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Use OfficeOne ProTools to set the angle of rounded rectangle callout. Shape Adjustment 3 is the one that controls the angle.</p>

                    <p>As a freelance writer, I have a lot of screen time, which can be weary on the eyes. I'd love to change page color while editing to some kind of sepia or pale blue, just to reduce contrast a little bit. I edited Normal.dotm to include a pale blue page color,
 but new documents don't take on the color. On the other hand, other settings, such as margins, fonts, and a macro, are present in new documents.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply but this is not snap assist as I'm not dragging the window to the sides or corner, nor using any of the hot keys.&nbsp; As you can see from this additional screen shot, snap assist doesn't look like this.&nbsp; The light grey area on the blue
 is where the window will snap and re-size to.&nbsp; snap assist does not size that small, it also doesn't partition the window like the pop-up shows.&nbsp; I'm beginning to believe this is a Intel driver feature but cannot find any notes on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did have a look at the support pages to see what software downloads were there for that series of laptops but I couldn't see anything that stood out. &nbsp;Look at some of the startup applications from Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is a Windows 10 specific feature I've both never seen it and don't know how to activate or deactivate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really this post doesn't help. &nbsp;I couldn't find exactly what it is as i said above but I'm fairly certain it is to do with Dell and not MS. &nbsp;But I could be wrong *Shrugs*</p>

                    I am trying to run a table report in Microsoft Project 2013, and I noticed that the table does not reflect all rows in my sheet. For example, the table retains only 75 rows of 150. Is this a limitation is Microsoft Project 2013? It seems ridiculous that
 there would be a limit on the number of rows you could retain in a report. Is there any work around it?&nbsp;

</p><p>This is a really good question, my friend.&nbsp; In Microsoft Project 2013, I created a table in a Dashboard Report and attempted to display EVERY task in the project, approximately 148 tasks in all.&nbsp; At the bottom of the table, Microsoft Project displayed the
 following message:&nbsp; "Showing 85 of 148 rows. Project can only show 85 rows. Try using a filter to get better results."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, based on that warning message, it appears that the upper limit for the number of rows you can display in a table in a Dashboard report is 85 rows.&nbsp; I know of no way to work around this hard limit.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; But hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>The Office 2000 SR1a update is no longer available from Microsoft - something to do with a legal settlement reached in a lawsuit with Sun some years ago. The 44Kb file you referred to is, I suspect, the SR1a update loader - not the SR1a update as such -
 and was intended (AFAIK) to enable an update to download only those parts of the update file that were actually needed.</p>

                    I do not understand why this is so difficult. I set my status to invisible and skype keeps making me available for some reason. It's very irritating. What is the registry setting to make it invisible permanently?

            You will need to log into Skype
<br />Click your profile picture or press Control + i on your keyboard
<br />
<br />Click in the Status box and change it to offline to appear invisible. 
<br />
<br />This might not work in the modern version of Skype, so you will likely have to download the classic version Skype and do it there.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com</a>
<br />Click on Downloads
<br />Click on the dropdown from the blue button:
<br />
<br />Click on Get classic Skype.

    <title>Lumia920 microphone fault - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milansrb---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia920 microphone fault</h2>
                    
<p>I have LUMIA 920 ( upgraded to amber) several months, and I am quite satisfiy.</p>
<p>But, in last few weeks, I find that my secondary (?) mic doesnt work!</p>
<p>Namely, when I have conversation, everything is OK, but if I try voice dialing , phone "couldn't hear anything"!!!</p>
<p>Also, if I try to save some voice notes in one note or evernote - I record only silence!</p>
<p>t's strange situation, because when I record videos - I record also sound!</p>
<p>I try soft and hard resets- but nothings happened - I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Does somebody has solution for this, or I must send my phone on service?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Milan</p>

<p>I'm having a similar problem with my Lumia 925 - only my mic is not working when I use loudspeaker for a call, or when i plug headphones (normal headphones without mic) into the phone and try and take a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But... I also did a factory reset, and found that my phone would not take any voice commands. So I had to select English US as the language, then go back in and select my own language from the list to download. It then downloads the language pack and restarts
 the phone... and I can now use voice commands. However the mic problem I had originally with making calls... is still there!... so if you find a fix, please let me know!&nbsp;</p>

            Among all of the other problems i am encountering with my 920, the main microphone for calls does not work any more and i am forced to call on loudspeaker the whole time, on top of that, there is quite alot of dust under the front facing camera<br />
is there still not a fix?

<h2>            Cant change my password</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im stuck.. So I just bought a new computer and im installing everything into it. My skype name is *********** (dont judge XD)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had it for a long time and I forgot the password. So I pressed the button that I had forgotten it. Entered my current mailadress and was prompted to change my microsoft password. Then I tried again it didn't work. I entered my email adress with the
 new password and I got in but it seems skype created a whole new profile for me since I didn't have anyone in my contact list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I hadn't logged out of my old computer so I checked my profile and it was registered to an old hotmail account I had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did the same process as before but entered my hotmail adress got a new password logged in. But now it created a skype adress for my old hotmail with once again no contacts.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried typing in my skype name but no, none of the passwords worked. I have repeated the same process over and over again I cant find any other options. I went into my old computer changed my primary email to my current one added my phone number. BUT STILL
 IT WONT CHANGE MY FRAKKING PASSWORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparantly I have to log in with my username. ****** but I cant freaking change the password and none of my old ones work..... I cant use my emails cause it creates separate accounts for them... like wtf !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im stuck in a bad circle. I tried contacting skype through live chat but they want me to log into my account which is the problem to begin with !!! im so frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea on what to do ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you guys at skype are reading this, you should have the live chat option available for everyone without them having to log in... it's idiotic if my problem is that I cant log in.....&nbsp;</p>

            The classic model for a bill of materials is by means of an adjacency list, a table in which MajorpartNum and MinorPartNum columns or similar each reference the primary key of a Parts table.&nbsp; In the Parts table each row can represent an indivisible base
 part or an assembly.<br />
<br />
There are various standard algorithms for generating a bill of materials, but they involve recursive querying, which Access does not support.&nbsp; It can be simulated, however and you'll find an example as BoM.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the recursive querying to generate the bill of materials to an arbitrary number of levels is simulated by inserting rows into temporary tables in an external database file which is created at runtime.

            <p>Dear Experts, i am sorry for the delay in replying because i did not receive any of your queries in my email till i came back to this forum again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started creating the database from scratch having the following tables and to have one level of BOM;</p>
<p>1) tblCP - id(running nbr),item,description,uom (no PK)</p>
<p>2) tblFG - id(running nbr),item,description,uom(no PK)</p>
<p>3) tblWIP-id(running nbr),item,description,uom(no PK)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i have created a form that will select the Parent Item from tblFG and the ChildParts from tblCP &amp; tblWIP and inserted into another table below;</p>
<p>1) tblPart - item(PK),description,cp1,qtycp1,cp2,qtycp2,wip1,qtywip1,wip2,qtywip2 ...etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i am trying to achieve here is after the users finish updating the tables, maybe i can have a report that show how many of these CP &amp; WIP consumed when the user keys in lets say 10 pcs of the FG is produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Help needed to move on.<br />

            Hmm, none of us know what CP, FG, WIP stand for or how those tables are related to each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I see each of those tables appears to have the same fields.&nbsp; I'm thinking it should be one table and have a field to identify Type... whether it's a CP,
 FG or WIP but hard to say without knowing exactly what those abbreviations stand for.

            <p>I'm guessing WIP is work in progress. But, as Gina noted, that doesn't tell us anything. And 3 duplicate tables is not good design.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should have one table for all parts and a another table for the assemblies.</p>

<p>Please forgive my brashness, but it looks to me like you had an anxiety attack ... if you did all the things in your list, that should have been enough to kill off any installation that was in process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen that for this build, but numerous builds ago, there was one that did that on a number of machines, and a normal restart of the computer was all that it took to get on with finishing the install.
</p>

How long did you wait before doing anything, and did you try simply restarting the computer?</p>

</p><p>Yep, that what it does, and you did what you should do. The servers were doing what they should do.<br />

</p><p>&gt; Restarting does not start the uploading sequence and leads to same error in Windows Update.</p>

            <p>The restarting that it needed was when it was saying that it was having trouble restarting to complete the install. Restarting after all you said you have already done to it wouldn't do now what it might have done then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, by the way, uploading is not what you would be doing, you would be downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you ran the troubleshooter, it probably deleted downloaded files that you would have needed for the installation, so my guess is that you need to try to clean up the rest of the mess, cleanly uninstall whatever 3rd party security program you may have,
 and start over, checking for updates. You might need to go back to 14971, and begin from there.</p>
