            Hi,<br />
<br />
Set the MP3 to MTP Mode for Sync to WMP11 - MSC mode to treat the MP3 as a drive.

Tips for solving problems with USB devices -&nbsp;and a Mr Fixit<br />

Hardware devices not detected or not working - Mr Fixit<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems</span></a><br />
<br />
Make sure Windows is updated as it should be as there have been several USB updates.<br />
<br />
1st check that the driver letters for them, for a player if the default player drive letter is changed this happens.
<br />
Mine was H: and I added a device which took H: and the player stopped. So I set it&nbsp;back to H: and the other
<br />
device to J: and all worked again. If needed Start - type in Search box -&gt; Disk Management&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list
<br />
- Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Be sure to remember the MP3 has to be set to MTP for synching with WMP and to MSC to copy and delete files
<br />
and updating firmware.<br />
<br />
If no joy do this:<br />
<br />
You may need a powered hub. (all the USB ports on your computer are not powered either, often only 2)<br />
<br />
try these :<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank area - then VIEW - Show Hidden Devices<br />
<br />
Your devices here are&nbsp;the MP3 player(s).<br />
<br />
now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your devices (may not find ANY) and if you find<br />
it RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL them all. <br />
<br />
now go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the category but the category itself.<br />
<br />
APPLY/OK<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the USB stack and hopefully allow the device to install. (You may need a powered hub)<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific devices if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Here is a utility to help but do the above 1st.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all USB devices that you previously used. Run it Options and check the 1st three choices to see if any are there.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html</span></a><br />
<br />
You would remove all instances of the devices then reboot.</p>
</span>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;the above does not work (and it should be considered preparatory work).<br />
<br />
This&nbsp;does work for any MP3 when the USB stack is not corrupt :<br />
<br />
1st&nbsp;Remove Player and Reboot Computer - Switch to MTP mode on your MP3 Player <br />
<br />
<strong>Does not matter what brand MP3 you have</strong><br />
<br />
1. Check this Just In Case<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/42/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/42/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834</span></a><br />
<br />
2. Do this (web page as reference)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/192/related/1/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/192/related/1/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>In XP : Start - RUN - CMD</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In Vista : (do it this way!)<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN</strong><br />
<br />
Copy and paste this command into the XP or Vista CMD windows - hit enter<br />
<br />
<strong>Net localgroup Administrators local service /add</strong> <br />
<br />
3. Then follow these :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/139/related/1/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/139/related/1/kw/e200*/page/2/r_id/101834</span></a><br />
<br />
Hopefully your MP3 is working now.<br />

<h2>            Skype for android - How to stop &#34;Sign in as&#34; appearing.</h2>
                    <p>Interestingly 90% of the questions on here are from people who <em>cannot </em>
sign in to Skype.&nbsp; My question is different,<strong> I WANT to have to sign in with my email address and password every time
</strong>but am frustrated because every time I select the Skype icon I get "Sign in as" with my name underneath and I can sign in with no password with one click.&nbsp; This is very bad for security and privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for this is other people use my phone from time to time so I don't want them being able to read or send messages from my Skype account.&nbsp; How do I set up my Skype or Android (Samsung S7) so that when I want to enter Skype I have to type the full
 email address and password before I get in?&nbsp; If this is done no other person can breach my privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from the community.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately, there’s no specific option. However, the best way for the application not to remember your credentials is by signing out on the Skype
 app right after you use it. You may also clear the cache and data of the Skype application after signing out.</span></span></p>

<h2>            The Sims Deluxe Edition wont run on windows 10, But ran on 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
I have an old legitimate copy of the game The Sims: Deluxe Edition. The game was made in 2000 and its OS is Windows XP.<br />
I bought a Toshiba C50&nbsp;laptop with Windows 8.1. I installed this game and it ran perfectly fine!<br />
Now I have the update to Windows 10 the game does not work.</p>
<p>This game is installed on the PC but also requires disc 1 in for the game to load and be playable.<br />
So I have deleted all the files and 'reinstalled' the game but it still isn't working.<br />
<br />
I deleted the files again and used the compatibility tool, it wanted to run using Windows XP (service pack 3)<br />
But the disc wouldn't load up.<br />
The same happened when I made it load using the Windows 8.<br />
<br />
So I changed the compatibility back to 10, the disc 'installed' but it wouldn't let me play the game, it just stopped working.<br />
<br />
Please please help. <br />
This game as a lot of childhood memories locked in it and I'm desperate to play it once more.</p>

<h2>            My PC continuously disconnects and reconnects to my wireless Wi-Fi.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried doing all of the research that I could, however, I have failed to resolve my issue. Leaving me with an option to find help online, or bring my PC to my local PC shop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I explain what issue I am having, first here are some things that you should know.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>PC's Operating System: Windows 8.1</li><li>PC manufacturer: Hewlett-Packard</li><li>System Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64 based processor</li><li>PC Type: Desktop</li></ul>
<p>In-depth information of my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I have run into a network issue on my PC (all other devices work properly with my Wi-Fi, so I know that there must be an issue with the PC or my Network Adapter and not my actual Wi-Fi itself.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own an online business, so it's safe to say that I use my PC all of the time. Two weeks ago, (this issue still persists) my PC will disconnect and then reconnect to my Wi-Fi (keep in mind that every time that this happens, all of my other devices in my
 home works properly with the Wi-Fi.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a desktop which requires a wireless USB adapter (Cisco Linksys AE2500) to connect to my network. I've had this piece for two years now, so I thought to myself that it may just be an issue with the network adapter -well I was wrong.. I ordered
 a brand new Network Adapter hoping that this may troubleshoot and/or resolve my issue. However, even with the new Network Adapter my problem still persists. Both Network Adapters (new and old) have the latest drivers installed, so please keep that in mind.
 They are also the exact same devices as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some other facts that you may find helpful:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have all Networking/Windows Firewall disabled</li><li>I have run the Windows Network and/or Network Adapter Troubleshooter countless times, however, it can not identify the issue that I am having</li><li>I have all up-to-date network and/or wireless Network Adapter drivers installed on my PC (this tells me that it is not a driver issue)</li><li>I have run an antivirus software (Spybot Search and Destroy) to see if that will identify the problem, though it does not locate any issues</li><li>In this screenshot, you can see that I have "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" unchecked. Reason being is because I have done some research and others say that this method works, however, the problem still persists. The link to the
 screenshot can be found here (https://gyazo.com/beacc37b7f848aaed290807d36e82c3b)</li><li>Even though this may be an off topic thing to say, I have a wireless Wi-Fi connection (not Ethernet.)</li><li>This is the first time that something like this has ever happened, as I have had my PC for over two years now</li></ul>
<p>Sometimes, it doesn't always reconnect to my network (as stated above.) Occasionally I may or may not have to restart my PC so my network adapter will see my network once again. One more thing, then I will wrap this up. Again, rarely it will tell me that
 the USB is not recognized - so if this happens, I have to unplug and plug back in my wireless Network Adapter to reconnect to my network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, I am clueless on what to do. I've tried resolving the issue and doing as much research as possible, though I have found no answer. If you have a solution, or if you may know what the problem may be, please take a moment of your time and comment
 down below what you think I should, or could do to resolve this issue. It would be very much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to hearing from someone soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Below is my usual troubleshooter for this sort of issue&nbsp;however also check these :<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus and use Windows&nbsp;Defender which in Windows<br />
8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a&nbsp;full antivirus. WD&nbsp;provides&nbsp;both exceptional&nbsp;protection and superior<br />
compatibility.<br />
<br />
2. Suspect that there may be an issue with the USB platform on that computer. <br />
In Device Manager check the WiFi network adapter and USB settings for any<br />
detectable issues. You probably need to check with the System/Motherboard Maker's<br />
Support or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service).<br />
<br />
3. Check for any other electrical/electronic devices in the computer area which<br />
could be causing intermittent connection issues. Even phones can cause issues.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Mother<br />
-board Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.
<br />
Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers.<br />
<br />
Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working</a><br />
<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's Support (Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems) and/or
<br />
the actual&nbsp;device maker for driver updates. If there are no newer versions&nbsp;re-install the
<br />
same ones. Ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) about any known issues.<br />

<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run,
<br />
and Settings as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using<br />
<strong>Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and Start Screen.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network and Sharing Center - Troubleshoot Problems<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and/or assistance. If you did not know, I have tried mostly every solution which you have included in your reply (this can be seen on my thread above your post) however, I am certain that this is not a router problem, as all of
 my other devices in my home works properly with my Wi-Fi. This is a PC or an adapter issue only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All latest/up-to-date networking and/or adapter drivers are installed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying a few of your solutions, I am still unable to find a fix to the issue. Also, in regards to your comment that the drivers may not be compliant with Windows 8.1, I am positive that they are 100% compliant, as this happened two weeks ago, and before
 everything worked fine. However, suddenly I had this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is that there is nothing in front or around my computer that may cause issues. The only things around my PC are my keyboard, Bose Speakers, mouse, and monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your advice, though. It's greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            Windows Update April 2019</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop started updating, which stalled at a certain point. I don't know what the percentage was, because the screen turned black. When I rebooted, the screen turned black again after showing the Asus logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several times trying to reboot my device, I tried Windows Recovery, to restore my laptop to factory settings, while keeping my files.</p>
<p>It runs the recovery up to 100% and then the Windows install, up to 93%. Then it drops to 88% and my screen goes black. This happened twice now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>

<br />Try this procedure.
<br />Shutdown/restart three times via power button.
<br />Then Windows recovery environment will open.
<br />
<br />And you will be able to repair, reset or restore in this environment.

            Hi Yupsie
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Steps B &amp; C  (Restore and Reset) can also be performed from Media creation tool if they can't be done as above. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section "Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />E. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Did you change the hardware after you installed the new Operating System or vice versa?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try performing a startup repair from the advanced boot menu (if you have the option) and check if that helps to boot to the desktop normally.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not have the option to perform a start up repair or if that does not help then you may try to boot into safe mode and disable the non
 essential devices from the Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To open device manager follow the link given below.</span></span></strong></p>

            There is no place to download it from (it's ~14 years old) and if you could get it somewhere you'd still need the product key (nowhere to get that either) and there's no telling whether it would install and run in Windows 10.<br />

            It's not supported in Windows 10, so even though it might be working in your current configuration it might not work in a new one, and it's only a matter of time before an update will kill it completely.<br />

<br />Also look for suspicious programs which you may have installed to bring it on. Uninstall them also 
<br />
<br />2. Remove it from all browsers 
<br />This sits as plugin / extension / add-ons. So, you will need to go to all browsers and deactivate them. 
<br />
<br />3. Run Antimalware 
<br />Malware Bytes - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />

            Okay since nobody has replied with a solution i have found one that worked for me. Idle buddy hides in your programs as a different name. Open control panel and open uninstall programs. See if you can find idle buddy unless it disguised its name; for me
 it was “work group inc” try to uninstall it and if that doesnt work then download IObit unintaller and try to uninstall it from there or just watch this<a href="https://youtu.be/-MrYjpEu260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/-MrYjpEu260</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/-MrYjpEu260?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/-MrYjpEu260?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>

<p>
</p><p>figured this out. &nbsp;i went to network in the explorer and it complained about network discovery turned off, which eventually led me to the fact that my home network got changed to "public network" profile. &nbsp;Clicking on the popdown under the address bar (in
 explorer, same bar complaining about network discovery.....) gave 2 options, change my home network to a "private network" profile or change settings for all public networks, I choose the&nbsp;former&nbsp;

The problem the PIN no longer works &nbsp;is&nbsp;because of &nbsp;the update. Dell technician confirmed this. We will have to wait until a fix to the update is done. Hopefully the&nbsp; loading speed will improve as well. You will need to log in with your email password.

            This appears to be an ongoing, unsolvable problem. Have become accustomed to this pitfall. I merely remove the pin in settings and reinstall same pin. Can almost do it in my sleep now. Cheers!

            <p><span>Hi Filippo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, I would suggest you to connect the device to a different computer to check if the issue is with the device.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue doesn’t occur in a different computer, then it could be caused due to some incorrect setting in the computer. I would suggest you to uninstall the current drivers and install the driver in compatibility mode and check. The
 latest driver available for this device is a Windows 7 compatible driver. So install this driver in compatibility mode and check. By reinstalling the driver, we can also eliminate a corrupt driver as the reason for the issue. Refer to these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + X, select Device manager.</span></li><li><span>Expand the “Audio input and output” section and locate the&nbsp;audio adapter.</span></li><li><span>Right click the device and select “Properties”.</span></li><li><span>Click on the driver tab to check the current driver installed&nbsp;for that device.</span></li><li><span>Click on the uninstall button to uninstall that driver.</span></li><li><span>Now restart the computer, download and install the drivers from&nbsp;the following link:</span></li></ol>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/lifechat-lx-3000#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/lifechat-lx-3000#support</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persisted even when you connected to a different computer, then it could be an issue with the device. In this case, I would suggest you to contact the Hardware support for further assistance:</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps below to fix the issue on your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method:</b></p>
<p>How to Format a Compact Flash Card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Things you’ll need:</b></p>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Compact flash card reader</p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Compact flash card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Insert the compact flash card into your card reader. Make sure to face it the correct way to prevent breaking pins and reading strips.</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Connect the card reader to your computer via one of its USB ports. Allow the card a few seconds to connect before continuing.</p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On the pop-up window on the screen select the option 'Explore Files'.</p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigate up one folder until you can see the drive you just inserted. It should something like drive "H:".</p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Right-click on the drive and click on the "Format" option.</p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Make all the settings are at the default level.</p>
<p><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Make sure that the format is set to the "FAT32" file system. This is the file system that compact flash cards require to be navigable by computers.</p>
<p><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Click on "Format" at the bottom of the window. Allow the process several minutes to complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Tips &amp; Warnings:</b></p>
<p>If you recently formatted the compact flash card, you can use the "Quick Format" option in the formatting window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All content on the card will be erased when you format it, so back up any files that you will need in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information helps. Please get back to us if you have any more questions about this issue.</p>

            You should not.&nbsp; You need to get a 2GB Compact Flash and not use the 4GB one.&nbsp; It might not work well or correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your camera is designed for up to 2GB and it will have problems with anything else.<br />

If you haven't already given it a try, power cycle your Xbox One by holding down the power button for 8-10 seconds. If that doesn't help, try removing your profile and add it back. Keep us looped in with how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problem with some programs</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>just as a lot of people, I upgraded my precedent Windows Version (7 in my case) to the new Windows 10.</p>
<p>For now, the experience is very great, bug there is a bug that I dont really understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime, when I want to launch a program,&nbsp;its window appears, without any title or content, and disappear like 12/100 seconds later...It is like flashing on my screen before closing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example : I tried to create a new Windows Account (for guests that would use my PC), but when I clicked the button to Create a new account, the problem occurred. I tried several times but it just wouldn't work. Same for trying to get into the windows parameters
 (the parameters button in the windows menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one having this issue ? Is there any way to fix it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.: sorry if there are some mistakes in this text, English is not my first language :)</p>

            <p>Just a quick update : I placed a Parameters shortcut on my desktop and checked the path it was using to launch the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In his path I saw that ''immersivecontrolpanel'' was written there.</p>
<p>If we look at my previous post, there is an error with that ''immersivecontrolpanel'' :</p>

<p>
</p><p>maybe that error (shown just above) is the source of my problem.</p>
<p>PROBLEM UPDATE : I CANNOT ACCESS THE PARAMETERS WINDOW. (it crashes on launch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt;Creating a new windows account with the cmd and launching this newly created account does not help. The same error occurs on that account as well.</p>
