<h2>            ERROR PRINTING IN WINDOWS 10 WITH IP FOR DHCP BUT WORKING WITH STATIC IP</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have a laptop with windows 10 and this laptop can not print with a printer in the same subnet</p>
<p>Printer ip address: 192.168.10.25</p>
<p>laptop ip: 192.168.10.32 for dhcp</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop have connectivity to the printer but i can not print (Just show error in printing). If i put another ip address in the laptop&nbsp;statically i can print with out any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not the ip address because we changed the dhcp server so the laptop captured another one ip address and that works until we restart the laptop and the problem repit again with the new ip address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the laptop captured any ip address by dhcp it never print but if the laptop take any ip address different of the learnt by dhcp the printing is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: We already check the print spooler service and is running. The printing is working with another laptop with windows 10 by dhcp with out any problem. The problem is just with one laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop with problem windows 10 version 1809</p>
<p>Laptop without the problem windows 10 version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both laptop have antivirus and we also uninstall the antivirus and the problem continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>It's always been a good idea to assign static IPs to networked printers, even aside from the administrative convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the lease on a DHCP IP renews, many printers can't incorporate the new address, so they get 'lost' on the network and show that they are offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been told that the necessary hardware is not included with the printers in order to meet a price point. This makes sense although I haven't been able to independently verify it.</p>

    <title>Cannot Activate Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> generalojb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Activate Windows XP</h2>
                    
<p>I had Windows XP SP3 on my computer upstairs. Recently I've been having problems with it and so I decided to do a repair install. The taskbar was constantly freezing and it was extremely slow. I tried everything; scanning for virsues with malware bytes,
 system restore, and safe mode. The taskbar still froze.</p>
<p>I did a repair install with my Windows XP disk, it's SP2, but I was planning on updating to SP3 once i'd installed it of course. I'd get Windows 7 but my hardware doesn't support it and Windows XP is fine to be honest. I'll probably get 7 when I get a new
 computer.</p>
<p>Anyway, before I did the repair install, I was worried about activating/validating it, and I didn't have the product key for the Windows I was using. So I downloaded a program that gives you the product key for your computer. So I wrote it down as I knew
 I'd need it for the install.</p>
<p>When it was installing, it asked me for the product key. I entered it and it carried on installing. When it finished installing, I got a message saying I couldn't log on until I had activated Windows. I thought I already had, but anyway, when the activation
 window came up, I couldn't connect to the internet as I'm wireless and I can't login to connect to my router downstairs, so I decided to use the telephone option.</p>
<p>I rung up the number, and dialed in the numbers on the screen, and then I got told that it couldn't be activated and I may be a victim of software piracy. What a load of piffle. My grandpa(who is now dead) installed Windows XP on the machine years ago and
 it ran fine. He just didn't write down the product key.</p>
<p>Now i'm locked out of my PC(which has extremely important information on it) and I'm being told I may be a victim of software piracy. This is a load of rubbish.</p>
<p>So can anybody help or guide me? I'm certainly not paying again, it'd been running fine for years. My grandpa paid for the license. I just simply had to do a reinstall and I may need to do more in the future. So yeah, any help would be truly appreciated.</p>

<p><br />
Hello,</p>
<p>This is why they are telling you that the software you have is a pirated copy, you downloaded a product key generator tool. Please note that a product key generator is used for cracked versions of the operating system.</p>
<p>In this case, to check for your product key, if the software is preinstalled in the computer when your grandpa purchased it, then check the tower for the product key. However, if you can no longer find it then contact your computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>If it was a retail version then try locating the disc case, the sticker where the product key is printed is on that disc case. However, if you can no longer locate the case then contact Microsoft Customer Service for a replacement product key, 800-936-5700
 they are open Monday - Friday, 5:00am - 9:00pm PST, Saturday &amp; Sunday, 6:00am - 3:00pm PST.</p>

            Hi John, on the PC running version 1803:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the 'Function Discovery Resource Publication' service
<br />
<br />Double-click that and set its startup type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Then Start that service
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />That's It!

    <title>Why is my computer using so much memory&#63; Why does windows 10 use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrigby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my computer using so much memory&#63; Why does windows 10 use so much ram&#63; I have 8 gb of ram, and the tack manager says 91&#37; is being used, most of it by windows service</h2>
                    <p>So I don't know if this has always been a problem for me, but when I upgraded to Windows 10 I get a pop-up notification saying that I am using most of my memory. This happens within 5-10 minutes of booting up, even if I am not using anything. I
 go into task manager and the thing using most of my memory is "System." I have a very good comp with an i-5 at 3.6 ghz, MSI Z-97 Gaming 5 motherboard, and a MSI R9 270 graphics card. I am a noob so I really don't know what to do. Any suggestions will help.
 Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Erratic or disappearing cursor with wireless mouse &#40;mice&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have seen numerous complaints but no solutions for wireless mice/mouse problems in Windows 10. The problem has existed for me since last fall 2016. I have tried 3 wireless mice including a Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 4000 and 2 Logitech mice M305 and
 M325. The Microsoft mouse is sluggish and the cursor takes a second to catch up with the mouse movement (erratic). Both Logitech mice have the disappearing cursor problem. I also checked both mice for current drivers.
</p>
<p>The problems are not every day or all day. I can be USING the computer and the cursor disappears or becomes erratic/sluggish. Or the cursor will disappear after sleep. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I reset my computer 1 month ago which is time consuming and didnt help. &nbsp;I had no problem activating Windows after the reset, but had to reinstall many programs. And I did check for new drivers for both mice after resetting.</p>
<p>Please help :)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some users had reported that it could be resolved by pressing the function keys on your keyboard. We suggest to try one of the following combinations, depending on your keyboard and mouse model and your mouse cursor may become visible again:
<strong><em>Fn +F3, Fn + F6, Fn + F9, and Fn + F11.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's troubleshoot the issue by performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Start your PC in clean boot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you start your computer in a clean boot state. This process will help eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program in Windows 10. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs in clean boot state, proceed to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware components on the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + X</strong></em> from the keyboard, click
<strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. Type <em><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></em> in the search bar and press
<em><strong>Enter</strong></em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. In the <em><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></em> window, click on
<em><strong>View All</strong></em> on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. Click on <em><strong>Hardware and Devices</strong></em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. Click on <em><strong>Advanced</strong></em> and then click on
<em><strong>Run as Administrator</strong></em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>6. Click <em><strong>Next</strong></em> and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>

<p>Thanks MQ for trying to help. &nbsp;I decided to switch the mouse with my Windows 10 laptop mouse because that mouse is newer than the others I have tried on this desktop. &nbsp;That MAY have solved the problem, though I still notice some lag I think, but it's intermittent.
 &nbsp;I need to use it for awhile to see if that is actually still a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did run the hardware troubleshooter (though there was no offer to run it as an administrator) and it told me that some hardware errors had not been reported and that that issue has been "fixed" but it did not tell me what hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try both of your suggestions if I notice the problem again. &nbsp;The newest mouse I'm using that does not have the problem is a Logitech M325 but this one is just a few weeks old though it is the same model as another, slightly older, Logitech M325. Odd.</p>
<p>Also I will say that my desktop is under no strain when the problem is occurring. I check task manager just about every time this happens and the machine is never working hard.</p>
<p>Thanks again, and I will respond back either way.</p>

<h2>            Looking for a &#42;quite&#42; joystick for fighting games.</h2>
                    
<p>I currently use one of the old Hori full size joysticks (the old one with the DOA4 art on it) for playing fighting games such as MK and SF4. I'm pretty happy with the controller with the exception for the amount of noise it makes. Moving the stick and pressing
 the buttons makes a very noticeable "click" noise which is loud enough to bother my wife and/or baby if they are sleeping while I am playing.<br />
<br />
So I'm looking to replace it with another full size joystick which doesn't make the loud "clicks".<br />
<br />
I want it to have a generic button layout so that I can use it with multiple fighting games, so the new MK one is probably not what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>I own the Hori EX2 and the Tournament Edition Street Fighter arcade stick. They're all about the same when it comes to making noise. Your best bet is to get a fightpad to play your fighting games on. Super quiet.

<p>The EX2 is the loudest stick ever made. You can never get fully away from it, but the Hori Real Arcade Pros are very solid sticks, minus the stigma of Madcatz's unreliability. I highly recommend the HRAP EX-SE, comes stock with a Siemetsu LS-32 stick, which
 (to me anyways) feels a lot less sloppy than the Sanwa's in the TEs.</p>

<p>Like said above the fightpad controllers are probably the best way to get away from the button noise. Pretty much all fightsticks (well all of the ones I've ever come across have the sharp button press noises) may sound lame but you may have to play your
 games in a completely different room :P</p>

    <title>Display problems after Windows 10 creators update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuthdoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display problems after Windows 10 creators update</h2>
                    <p>Please help.&nbsp; I've spent days trying to fix a display problem after Windows 10 Creators update without success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to Windows 10 Creators ver 1709 and still in version 1803 - Windows thinks there is a problem with my graphics driver so shuts it down and substitutes a generic driver.&nbsp; No multi monitors and depending on what basic driver it decides to use
 either 3 choices among 3 low resolutions or only a single mid resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Gateway desktop computer with an AMD Radeon HD 5770 1024MB graphics card.&nbsp; I had been running it on the previous Windows 10 without any problems using two large wide screen monitors.&nbsp; Now I only get a low resolution mirrored screen on one monitor
 or nothing on the second monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now get an error code 43 on start up. I have deleted all the old graphic drivers manually and using DDU.&nbsp; Then re-installing the graphic driver.&nbsp; I tried the 2 most recent drivers for AMD HD 5700 series as well as trying the driver update in Windows.&nbsp;
 Not working.&nbsp; Deleted drivers in Safe mode but couldn't install new driver in Safe mode.&nbsp; AMD no longer updating the driver for the HD 5700 series so tried using most recent ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the version 1709 update in January but after a couple days trying to make it work unsuccessfully - I rolled back to previous version of Windows 10 where graphic driver worked fine.&nbsp; I had to roll back 2 more times because Windows kept automatically
 updating version 1709 again.&nbsp; I finally was able to get Windows to ask first (said I had metered internet) and turned my computer off as soon as I was done using it so I was good until I decided to try again.&nbsp; After updating to version 1709, the next day Windows
 updated me to version 1803 - my AMD driver still determined to not be working so my AMD driver turned off by Windows.&nbsp; After several more days googling for a possible fix - gave up and tried to roll back again.&nbsp; Rolled back to version 1709 but won't roll back
 to previous Windows 10 that worked.&nbsp; So now I am stuck.&nbsp; I can't be the only AMD HD 5770 user with problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix?&nbsp; A way to stop Windows 10 Creator from turning off my AMD driver?&nbsp; Or do I have to invest in a new graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated with Windows updates.&nbsp; Seems I always have some sort of problem when there is a major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<p>I have finally given up trying to find a simple fix or for Windows or ATI (AMD) Radeon to make a fix.&nbsp; So frustrating.&nbsp; I had considered re-installing Windows 8.1 but ultimately decided on a new graphic card which didn't cost that much and was easy to install
 myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new graphics card (PNY Nvidia Geforce GT 710 - $ 62).&nbsp; Uninstalled graphic card via Device Manager.&nbsp; Turned off computer.&nbsp; Unplugged everything.&nbsp; Opened case, removed old graphic card, installed new graphic card, plugged everything back up, and
 turned it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seemed stuck for awhile at opening Windows screen. So turned off with power button, waited 10 secs and turned back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time opened up to windows.&nbsp; Downloaded Geoforce Experience and up dated graphic card driver with it.&nbsp; Now all good so far except had to run trouble shooter to get headphones to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have my multi monitors (2) and high resolution settings again.&nbsp; SO NICE!&nbsp; Also can add 1 more monitor if I want via new graphic card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until the next Windows update problems.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were there any changes or updates made on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you use Norton removal tool to uninstall Norton from the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to create a new user profile and then check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.<br />
Refer:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Create a user profile.<br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now check for the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the new user profile resolves the issue, you can fix the corrupt profile and re-install the applications and programs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer: <br />
<b>Fix a corrupted user profile<br />
</b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not used Norton removal tool to uninstall Norton from the computer, I would suggest you to refer the link and try to run the tool.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://us.norton.com/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080710133834EN&amp;ln=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.norton.com/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080710133834EN&amp;ln=en_US</a>
</span></p>

<h2>            How do i uninstall KB3163018&#63; Blocking VPN&#33;</h2>
                    <p>How do I uninstall this KB31630187 update? It is blocking access to my VPN and I missed work yesterday before I figured out what the problem was. I have been surfing the web for hours and still cant find simple instructions of how to remove it form my pc.
 I have to go to work in a couple of hours and I need it gone now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so sick of spending hours upon hours updating, installing, reinstalling, looking for drivers, looking for backwards compatible peripheral cords - you name it and I have to do it to try an get my Microsoft OS to work well. I have a life where I have
 to earn a living and manage an illness - I WOULD LOVE IT if I didn't have to spend overtime hours working on the brand new things I paid good hard earned dollars for JUST SO THEY WORK! It's too much and we consumers have no real choice because we need your
 products. But why pay for it, work for it, and still not be able to use it? And honestly any help beyond a discussion board is out of the question too. There ought to be a law that says you cant make an OS before you give the other manufacturers time to make
 the right drivers. AND there should be a law that if you make a product, you HAVE to make updated drivers for at least X amount of years because MICROSOFT will FORCE us to upgrade our systems and then our HARDWARE IS USELESS. Its a racket I tell you and I'm
 sick of it. I's much rather be able to spend my money on medicine - but nope, Microsoft and the other vendors need regular payments for things I have already bought and paid for so that they will make them work - and I need the pc to make money - so the medicine
 waits... Yes, it's THAT serious for a lot of consumers and YOU GUYS SHOULD FIX IT!</p>

<p>We get emails from our company tech department and these updates have **** everyone's VPN down. So since my whole department is out of work until they can figure a way around all the updates - we"really in UNPAID training until they figure it out.</p>
<p>So I guess she the updated DID help secure the VPN - from everyone.</p>

<br />If you had a lot of tabs open in your browser this can sometimes trigger it.

<br />
<br />Then back in the left Pane, close up all those folders (keys) again (click in the left pane and press left arrow on your keyboard a few times) 
<br />
<br />In the left pand, navigate to: 
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER - Control Panel - Desktop 
<br />
<br />Then in the right pane, right click in the blank space and choose New - String Value 
<br />
<br />Name the String Value WaitToKillServiceTimeout

    <title>Windows 10 Update B1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas0coolgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update B1809</h2>
                    <p>I recently heard of the November's Windows 10 update and wanted to try it out. To do this I tried via the Windows Update feature but it said I was on the latest version, even though I am on Build 1803. Then I searched for solutions and came across the Update
 Assistant. I tried it and seemed to work well. It went to 100% and it was time for the restart (which includes the update). While it was updating there, on about 16% progress my laptop rebooted and I thought it is okay since it says "Your computer may restart
 several times". So I waited to go back to that screen to resume the update but while Windows were loading (in the black screen) "Restoring previous version of Windows" (or something similar) appeared. I tried it a couple of times but the same thing happened
 and booted back to 1803. This is my problem.<br />

            Hi Andreas,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

                    <p>Okay, so I've got this weird problem....</p>
<p>Monday morning i've tried to start my pc and nothing happens, no screen image, no beep from case, just the fans.... and Sunday i've played like 6 hours continuesly and when I closed, around 10 p.m. , was working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I've waited until now thinking is something temporarily but now i'm not that sure ...</p>
<p>Btw, it is a costum built pc, and i'm afraid it's a pretty old one, like 3 years old and i don't remember the exact name of the components...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've unplug every thing from motherboard except the power cable,CPU, and the HDD cable, and I still don't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me what it has?</p>

<p>A little clarification on the issue I am having. The Z-Engine icon lights up green as it should and the game mode light on the keyboard lights up correctly saying it's loaded the correct game mod. Unfortunately when I use any of the buttons with custom mapping
 (ie I have my Escape key mapped to the Caps button on the special keyset) they do not work correctly as mapped.</p>

<p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by software conflicts with your recent update. We can isolate the issue to provide you the most appropriate resolution. Follow the steps below to restore from a system restore point. This will take your PC back to an earlier restore
 point which generated when you installed a new update. This will not affect your personal files but it can remove apps, drivers and updates installed after the restore point was made. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> (Windows icon), type <em>control panel</em> and then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the&nbsp; update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, check if the issue is the same with your software program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on how it goes.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center"><em>Hello guys, so I bought my ASUS Transformer Book Flip TP300LA about a year ago, and it's great. But just recently, I ran into a bit of trouble.&nbsp;</em><em>Well, I recently downloaded a free game, and inside it's client, it contained
 a 'virus' (name/info about it is posted below). I wasn't sure if it was real/fake and safe/dangerous, so I tried to remove it. I ran malware scans, but nothing came up, I even went to start up and tried to delete it, but I could only disable it. Even it being
 disabled, I didn't feel safe, so I decided to do a system restore, as I had a restore point 6 days back, so it wasn't too bad. After the restore was complete, I realized the 'virus' was gone, but my laptop was really slow, and the touch pad wasn't responding.
 I realized I had to do lots of updates due to the restore, and now even after the updates, my laptops performance (at times) is really slow, and freezes a lot. The touch pad works sometimes, but mainly isn't.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Anyways to get to my point, I would like assistance with the following:</em></p>

<li><em>How to fix touch pad, it still isn't working when use it</em></li><li><em>Performance (was well before the 'virus' and updates)</em></li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD CRITICAL_PROCESS_FAILED and UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month and a half ago I started receiving the occasional BSOD with the UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION which became more and more frequent as January went on and for the past week I've started getting CRITICAL_PROCESS_FAILED quite often when doing just
 about anything on my Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Bluescreenviewer and the bluescreens have been caused by the ntoskrnl.exe driver and 142970 address. I probably should have came here asking for help about a month ago but every time I use my laptop after a few hours I get the CRITICAL_PROCESS_FAILED
 BSOD and my laptop is barely usable anymore so I have now come to ask for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the DMP files from the minidump folder -&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bw-KIg1alQFoSlhtZmx3TFgxTjg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated and let me know if you need any more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>

            <p>Dear Virfranz Man,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to update the display adapters through the device manager in safe mode first and after that out of safe mode. In both instances I selected the 'search for updates automatically' option and Windows decided my drivers were up to date.</p>

            <p>Dear ZigZag3143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my message and addressing my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not over-clocking anything. I just followed the instructions for the driver verifier and I am now stuck in a BSOD boot loop where I receive the message DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (IntelPcc.sys). I have entered cmd and tried to delete all existing
 settings so that it would no longer test my drivers but I can't get to my desktop anymore I just keep getting this blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could get to my desktop I could upload the DMPs but getting past this blue screen is proving to be difficult for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information is helpful,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>

            <p>Sounds like you need to crop the video...<br />
that is not an option in Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Be aware that cropping will result in a <br />
lower resolution video clip.<br />
<br />
There are many programs that can crop <br />
video...some are free some are not....<br />
<br />
The following freeware is one example. <br />
A Google search for Crop Video will find<br />
more.<br />
<br />
Be sure to give the cropped version a <br />
new name so it will not overwrite (replace)<br />
the original version. Then you will have both<br />
versions.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
