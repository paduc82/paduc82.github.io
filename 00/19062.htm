    <title>Arial Bold font Problem Microsoft Office 2016-Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Arial Bold font Problem Microsoft Office 2016-Mac</h2>
                    <p>The arial font converts to bold italics when I click the bold font. I've cleared caches, repaired permissions, and have isolated the issue to Microsoft Office 2016 15.18. It seems that Microsoft Word and Excel (haven't tried PowerPoint) auto format the Arial
 font from Arial Bold to Arial Bold Italics. This isn't document specific as this happens with newly created documents as well. This may be an issue with the 15.18 update since I can't recall this being an issue before hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operating System: OS X 10.11.3</p>
<p>Computer: Mac Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not running Windows 7, but I had to select something in the drop down menu since OS X wasn't listed. If this was posted in error on the wrong site, I apologize.</p>

            Thanks for reporting the issue! Sadly I couldn't repro it with 15.18 update (with text "Arial font"). If it is not sensitive, may I know what text you tried to apply Arial Bold? When you apply Arial Bold, did you apply bold with Bold button in the Ribbon,
 or via the submenu in the font pop up menu?

            <p>Thanks for the reply&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5a29aa17-9d47-4e13-8bbc-6a6c4e199564" title="HarryZhangHZ">HarryZhangHZ</a>. On my system, all I have to do is create a new document (or use existing) with Arial font, type any text,
 highlight, and click the Bold button in the Ribbon. After doing this, the text does bold, but it also ends up bold italics. I've also tried the submenu thinking there was a code error with the Bold button in the ribbon.<br />
</p>
<p>Edit: I might also mention that this issue is also happening with Excel, but not with PowerPoint.</p>

            <p>Do you have Mac Office 2011 installed (or ever installed then removed)? If so, can you launch Font Book.app (you can find it via spotlight search), click on the info button on the top-left corner, then search "Arial" at the top-right corner, and let us know
 how many versions of Arial family you can see, and which is enabled/disabled (location and version number) for Arial Bold, and Arial Bold Italic?</p>

            <p>No, I've never had Office 2011 installed on this machine. Under Font Book there are 4 fonts in the Arial family:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Arial Regular (version 5.01.2x) Postscript Name: ArialMT</li><li>Arial Italic (version 5.00.2x) Postscript Name: Arial-ItalicMT</li><li>Arial Bold (version 5.01.2x) Postscript Name: Arial-BoldMT</li><li>Arial Bold Italic (version 5.00.2x) Postscript Name: Arial-BoldItalicMT</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><span>Restart your Mac in Safe Mode by holding the Shift key down when you hear the startup chime. It will take a long time for your Mac to start up. Try while in Safe Mode. Then restart
 again and let your Mac start up normally without holding the Shift key down. Then try again. Did the problem go away in Safe Mode? After the second restart?</span></p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I still couldn't repro it, even after I upgraded my OS to 10.11.3 (and made sure that the fonts are the same version as you mentioned).</p>
<p>Is this issue only on Arial font family? Can you move these four Arial fonts from /Library/Fonts folder to somewhere else (such as Desktop where system wouldn't look for fonts), then give it a try again? (In order to open /Library/Fonts, you will need to
 select "Go" menu in Finder, then choose "Go to Folder...")</p>

            <p>Same here - It's causing me huge issues. I have a load of stuff that I send to my clients (order forms, reports etc.) and any document with Arial Bold has now inexplicably changed the instances of those fonts to Bold Italic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleared all caches, reinstalled, moved fonts from my MBP (which appears not to be doing it), deleted preferences etc. and it's still doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is maddening - Needs sorting.</p>

            <p>I checked my fonts and have 2 variations: 5.00.2x (Linotype) and 5.01 (Microsoft). Like other people, I'm not seeing this issue elsewhere, and it doesn't affect any other font families in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something has happened to trigger it - Not sure whether it is an update etc. but it has happened in the last week or so. My MacBook Pro version of Office hasn't been updated recently (rarely use it) and on there everything is fine, so it might be fair to
 assume that an update might be the culprit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before reinstalling Office I did delete all instances of the previous one, including the support files from both my user and OS Library folders. I also experimenting with FontBook's option to "reset system fonts" which didn't help.</p>

<h2>            Explorer always running as Adminstrator and I can&#39;t turn it off&#33;</h2>
                    Hey! I am running Windows Insider Preview Build 10130 from Windows Home Premium x64. When I used Win7 I had Explorer to always run as Administrator because it would crash if I tried to update with Windows Update. Now when this is solved I forgot to untick
 it when I had Win7 and it is still running as Administrator. When Explorer is like a shortcut it says that it doesn't run as Administrator but when it isn't like a shortcut then it wont even give me the option of disabling "Run always as Administrator". When
 I boot up Win10 then I need to go to Task Manager and manually run it because of this. This is really making me frustrated because my I can't create new user accounts because of this. Please help me, fast.

<h2>            Payment Notifications</h2>
                    I received an email to update our payment information since our original payment was declined. &nbsp;The reason for the decline was due to identity theft and we had to cancel that specific card. &nbsp;We have since updated the card information. &nbsp;I understand that
 this card should be charged automatically within the next few days.... However, my issue is that the emails regarding the decline were sent to several email addresses, including our outside IT company, since they are listed as a global admin. &nbsp;Please let me

            <p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your organization‚Äôs billing notifications are sent to the Office 365 email address and the alternate email address of every global and billing admin in your organization.
</p>
<p>It‚Äôs an expected behavior.</p>
<p>Please refer to:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-billing-address-for-Office-365-for-business-a25c10d6-c1e9-4299-9185-25178df9eba6#BKMK_ChangeEmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-your-billing-address-for-Office-365-for-business-a25c10d6-c1e9-4299-9185-25178df9eba6#BKMK_ChangeEmail</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, according to the detailed management requirement, you can change the permissions of the external IT company from global admin to one or more customized admin, such as Exchange admin, Skype for Business admin or User management admin.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to Install</h2>
                    I have a 64-bit computer and downloaded the 64-bit Windows 10 version.&nbsp; I easily burned a&nbsp; DVD and confirmed the copy.&nbsp; I then changed and confirmed the boot order for the DVD drive to read before the SATA SSD.&nbsp; The computer refuses to read the DVD drive,
 instead bypasses it to read the SSD.&nbsp; The computer can read the DVD drive, as I cleaned it last night with a CD cleaner.&nbsp; I recently reinstalled a prior version of Windows with that drive without problems.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

This does not exempt the fact that Windows 10 is still under heavy development and we are still in the early days before we are anywhere near the final code.

<h2>            How do I print a long Visio drawing on 1 piece of paper in a plotter&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all, just wondering if anyone can help me with a Visio issue when it comes to plotting it. I have a long drawing that I wish to plot on one continuous long piece of plotting paper, however Visio cannot seem to change paper sizes to fit plotter paper
 lengths and heights; I always have to choose from a set paper size, such as A0, A1, etc. Can anyone tell me how to do this, such that the visio drawing is on large paper that is thinner than normal and continuously printed from a plotter? Thanks!

<p>In the old admin center your could add custom tiles for the app launcher under Company Profile. The new link is Organization Profile and the custom tiles option is gone. I noticed that in the What's Coming Up section Custom Tiles is listed. So has this feature
 been removed to be re-added later? We just moved to O365 and I am trying to make the Dashboard the go to area for all staff. Custom Tiles helped but now it appears to be missing.</p>

<p>Hi David,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You‚Äôre right. Custom tiles in the new admin center is coming up. We suggest you firstly return to the old admin center for custom tiles setting. (Click Home&gt;Switch back to the old admin center)<br />

Thanks for your understanding and patience.<br />

    <title>How do I re-download Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordonbrainerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I re-download Office 2010</h2>
                    In Feb. 2012 I purchased Office Professional 2010 and installed it on my Windows 7 PC. &nbsp;3 weeks ago I installed Windows 8, and Office continued to work. &nbsp;Many other aspects of Windows 8 did NOT work, so I finally had to Refresh my system. &nbsp;Office Professional
 (and dozens of other programs) was deleted. &nbsp;I logged onto my Microsoft account and located my purchase. &nbsp;There is a "download" button which I clicked on. &nbsp;That brought me to another screen which instructed me to click the download button. &nbsp;However, there
 was only an Install button. &nbsp;I clicked the Install button and nothing happened.
<div><br />

<div>How do I get Office Professional 2010 which I just purchased?</div>

<div>By the way, while I was on my Microsoft account (web:&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/ordersummary.aspx?culture=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www2.buyoffice.microsoft.com/usa/ordersummary.aspx?culture=en-US</a>) I entered a Live Chat &amp; asked the same
 question. &nbsp;The answer was for me to call Microsoft Office Tech Support at 866-452-4755. &nbsp;When I called them, they couldn't help me and referred me to answers.microsoft.com so here I am.</div>

            Win8 is a BETA TEST VERSION, NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME.&nbsp; Some things don't work. Sounds like this is an (embarrassing) example. Sounds like a funky interaction between the site and IE 10(?) in Win8.<br />
<br />
Just for confirmation, you say you initially upgraded Win7 to Win8 and Office 2010 continued to work? I wasn't able to test that scenario, but I was under the impression that it wouldn't.&nbsp; As you experienced, that is definitely the case when you use the Win8
 "Refresh" feature: https://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx?Redirected=true<br />
<br />
Off hand, I can think of 4 possible solutions. <br />
<ul>
<li>go back to Win7.&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>assuming you don't want to go that far back, use a different computer without Win8.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>try downloading one of the trial versions. You can install the trial and use your full license to activate it.</li><li>
<b>2010 Full Download</b>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: if you do not have the installation file on an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù MS installation disk, download and save it to your HD. Then you should burn it to one or more DVDs for future
 use. And at the same time, write down the product key on the DVD. You need both items for future installations, say after your computer crashes and you have re-installed windows. At that point you won‚Äôt be able to extract it from the registry and won‚Äôt remember
 where the online account is.</p>

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would just like to confirm, are the verification emails sent directly through the created Outlook.com email address or sent through the Comcast email address connected to the Outlook account?<br />
<br />
If it is the later, possible that their domain provider or internet provider's security settings is preventing the email to be received by the account. Best to have it communicated with the email/network provider support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, feel free to reply on this thread.</p>

            The Outlook.com email was just a workaround for getting the client setup with a Microsoft Account since it could not be setup with the comcast email due to the account requiring a verification email being sent to the comcast email which will not send when
 requested.&nbsp; The email never gets sent even after days of waiting.

<p>Thanks for the information. Possible that either the internet provider is blocked by the Outlook servers, or the network is blocking access through the Outlook servers. If all clients under Comcast service are affected, it is best to have this communicated
 with their support.</p>

<p>This problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to open up a Microsoft account for a client who primarily uses an @comcast.net account. It would be ideal to have this account be their primary login for their Microsoft account so that they can access what they need without an additional
 account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft made an attempt to contact Comcast and get Microsoft email verification emails to go through the Comcast servers?&nbsp;</p>

                    I need help in knowing how to calculate EMA for given period ( say 10 days) If I know the daywise values of all days. I had read that formula is wieght = 2/ time periods +1) but somehow it did not work.

            <p>Thanx Knightrider. I did get the formula for knowing the EMA price for a given day. However, it wud b great If I got the formula for getting the wieghts that I&nbsp;need to apply for a given day's price so that the same can b calculated directly. Thanx once again
 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, In the given forumla, it takes values of curent price and previous days price only. But I was told that in EMA, the wieght extend even beyond the periods shosen, I mean, if 10 day EMA is chosen, then the data prior to 10 days also carries some small
 wieght. But in WMA( Weighted Moving average),if 10 day period is chosen, there is no weight for data previous to 10 days i.e. the sum of weights of all 10 days is 100%. However, in EMA, the sum of 10 days wieght is around ~87%.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pl if u can shed some light on this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> barnzeee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Business Contact Manager Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I installed a new SSD about 6 months ago and updated Office to 2013. I then had BCM installed and everything was working fine for 4 months. About 2 months ago, it stopped loading when I start outlook and intermittently I was able to get it going by
 disabling and then enabling in options. Now it will not start at all. I've tried many troubleshooting steps including repair office utility, have reinstalled BCM but it still does not work. I used to get an error on outlook startup (I can't remember what it
 said) Now I just get an error when I manually try to enable BCM saying there is an external error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I am currently looking for alternative CRM's as this seems to be a common BCM problem and I have been crippled with my workflow and communication. Can anyone recommend a better option than BCM for 1 or 2 users small business.</p>

<p>I have my merge document completed, but now I need to print all of the records to one Adobe PDF with many pages.&nbsp; How do I get it to take the two page merge document and print all records (approx 16,000) into one single PDF with all of the pages?</p>
<p>I've tried doing the edit letters and also printing to PDF and selecting all records.&nbsp; However, it only gives me a PDF for one record.</p>

            "Edit Letters," i.e. "Merge to a new document" /should/ produce a 2*16000=32,000 page document that you /should/ be able to print to any printer, including Acrobat Distiller or whatever you are using to convert to PDF. If you can't get Word to generate
 that large document then what to do would depend on whether you have any way of automating your Acrobat "printer"

<p>In the Mail Merge Toolbar, if you click on the View Merged Data button</p>
<p>¬´*¬ª<br />
ABC</p>
<p>And the use the arrow button to the right of the record number control do you see the data from each record being merged into the mail merge main document, or does it just stop at the first record?</p>
<p>I would be taking a look at the data source.&nbsp; What are you using as the data source?</p>
<p>If it is an Excel Spreadsheet, make sure that there is not a blank (possibly hidden) row after the first row of data.</p>

<h2>            Protect Documents with Microsoft Excel for iPad</h2>
                    <p>I have a company provide Excel template that I use that has protected elements. In Excel on the Mac I'm able to select cells that contact pop-up list and edit static cells. Open this same document on my iPad the tabs in the document are showing as locked
 and when trying to select a cell that has a pop-up list I receive a dialog widow that states that the document is Read-Only. The same dialog appears if try to select any cell and enter data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some process that I need to make sure that the template creator uses to protect the formatting and formulas within the document put will still allow the data portion of the spreadsheet to be edited? Entering data in cells and selecting from lists.</p>

            Thanks for using Microsoft Excel for iPad! At this point of time, Excel for iPad doesn't support different sheet protection levels. All protected sheets are read-only. However, you can still edit other unprotected sheets in the same workbook.

    <title>Magic Jigsaw Puzzles Security Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Magic Jigsaw Puzzles Security Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since downloading Magic Jigsaw Puzzles, I have had numerous sketchy pop-ups while using it. In one case it was porn. In another it warned me (complete with bleeping sounds) that my computer had been compromised and I must dial this number etc. It warned
 me not to shut down my computer or I would lose everything. However, shutting down the computer was the only way to get the pop-ups off my screen. Several times my security program has blocked infections - all while playing Magic Jigsaw Puzzles. I am&nbsp;<em>not</em>
 clicking on the ads while this happens. On at least 6 occasions an adware program has hijacked my browser taking me to some page that never arrives, because I close it - sometimes I have to close it several times before it goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious solution is to uninstall Magic Jigsaw Puzzles - however, I have purchased some of its puzzles. Please fix this.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where did you download Magic Jigsaw Puzzles from?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li></ul>
<p>Since you are using Windows 10, there are a lot of games and puzzles added to Windows Store from which you can download some of the puzzles and check if you&nbsp;did not download Magic Jigsaw Puzzles from Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you received pop-ups and possible viruses in the computer, you may want to run a full virus scan and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case if you are not using any security software, you can run Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            I have deleted Magic Jigsaw Puzzle, run various malaware products, restarted computer, reinstalled Magic Jigsaw Puzzles from the Microsoft store, where I got it originally, and the virus came up again almost immediately with notices on my Google Chrome
 browser about supposed "security risks" with a &nbsp;phone number to call to fix my risks. &nbsp;The app is clearly infected at the source. &nbsp;How do we let Microsoft Store know that app should be quarantined until it is fixed? &nbsp;I love Magic Jigsaw Puzzles and am sad
 I can no longer use it. &nbsp;

            <p>Thank you very much for your courteous reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Magic Jigsaw Puzzles is about the last program I would&nbsp;<em>ever</em> run on my computer (even once, for 5 minutes) without my security software. Just thinking about it makes me anxious. &nbsp;The Safety Scanner you recommended is only for older versions
 of Windows. &nbsp;This really is Microsoft's problem, and only tangentially mine since I can get puzzles anywhere (though I do like the beautiful Magic Jigsaws). &nbsp;I suspect we are not going to get anywhere here. My real intent was to warn other consumers. But thank
 you for your time.</p>

            I agree with you Sky, I have installed Magic puzzles, and from day one, I get pop ups stating malicious websites are being blocked. Although i'm grateful for the blocks, i don't think they should happen in the first place! &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling
 as well, thinking it was a bad download. But all times i downloaded it from the MS Store. I think Microsoft should either fix the app, or remove it from the store altogether. It''s a shame because i did like it, but until they either fix it, or they themselves
 come up with a similar app, i will leave it off my pc, because it may (God forbid) pop up with something my Anti-malware cannot stop!&nbsp;

            <p>RW, I am wondering what anti-malware products you use? &nbsp;Mine do not warn me that they are blocking something when I use Magic Jigsaw. &nbsp;Malware gets through. &nbsp;Right now I am using MalawareBytes free version and SpyHunter paid version, as well as Norton Security
 Suites which comes with my cable subscription. &nbsp;Maybe it is a matter of my settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I have tried the Microsoft Jigsaw app and I hate it. &nbsp;There is no comparison to Magic Jigsaw.</p>

            <p>Avast Internet Security (the lower-priced paid version) blocks most malware and pretty much anything Magic Jigsaw can dish up, except for the browser hijacking. The guy who built my computer recommended it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have had so many problems with Microsoft products - problems that they only address in the forums, and then, in- effectively. Almost all of the best solutions for problems here can be found at 3rd-party web-sites. If you want technical help with Microsoft's
 problems, you have to pay them for it. It really is the most outrageous customer care I have ever experienced, anywhere. &nbsp;My next computer will be a Mac.</p>

            BTW, my problem was fixed after I wrote to the Facebook Magic Puzzles community and to the tech support group at XIMAD. &nbsp;I am happily using the app again.

            Thanks, Kathyrn! I got my app from Windows 10, not Facebook. &nbsp;However, I &nbsp; bought some puzzles that remove the ads, and have had no problems since the ads were removed.

<p>Have 3 Lumia phones 920 , 635 , 520 , which can use GPS for 4 years without having any data or network.

<p>
</p><p>You could store each invoice's data in a single text file. &nbsp;For example, it might look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Invoice number on first line</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed by a line for each row of data, with the column values separated by any unique character you like, so long as it's one that won't be used in the actual data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the file</p>
<p>Read a line to get the invoice number</p>
<p>Then continue reading lines while not EOF and for each line, use SPLIT to convert the line into an array of strings that you can do with whatever you like.</p>

</p><p>It is best you contact GoDaddy support with regards to this as from your post it seems that GoDaddy is hosting the Office 365 Solution. Microsoft and GoDaddy have two different service models when it comes to provisioning Office 365 services. It is best
 you contact Godaddy with your query.</p>

            Hi Frank,<br />
<br />
Generally, if there's a problem delivering an email message that you sent, Office 365 sends an email which is called a non-delivery report (NDR) to let you know. NDRs include a code that indicates why your email wasn't delivered, solutions to help you get your
 email delivered, a link to more help on the web, and technical details for administrators. As a result, you can refer to this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Email-non-delivery-reports-in-Office-365-51daa6b9-2e35-49c4-a0c9-df85bf8533c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to see if you can find any solution at first.<br />
<br />
However, if you cannot find the same NDR in the article above or you have any further concern, you can also share the NDR received via this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">private message</a>. We will help you check it.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to better understand the situation, I‚Äôd like to collect some more information:<br />
<br />
