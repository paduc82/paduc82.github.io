            Maybe instead of entering the key combination for hard-reset, you might have mistakenly entered bootloader. Sometimes, the only way to come out of it is to flash a ROM.<br />

<h2>            Space between words &#40;using a link&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and good day. First of all, I would like to say that I have been 'googling' a fix to my issue for quite a while now to no avail which is why I decided to ask around here in the Microsoft Community. I have seen similar topics but it didn't help me or
 maybe I was wrong...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I would like to ask on how to fix the large spaces between the words in my document. I am currently finishing up my thesis document for college and the editor from our school wants the reference link beside the last word in the paragraph. Here is
 what it looks like.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1894ca8e-eae9-4b55-b8a6-331bde103ca1" /></p>
<p>The whole document is justified. I tried and used these things that I have found on the net that 'worked' for some people but it's still the same.</p>
<p>

<p>I hope there is a solution aside from SHIFT + Enter because the editor says the link should be beside the last word...</p>

            <p>There are several solutions in this kind of situation. One is to edit the text so that the URL will all fit on the same line with part of the text. Unfortunately in this case the URL is so long that it doesn't even fit on one line. So it will have to be
 broken. In this case, you can just insert a space. It's generally suggested that you insert the space
<strong>before</strong> a slash or underline so it is obvious (since the slash or underline will start a line) that the URL has been broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a chance that further editing will cause the URL to fall in a different position, you can insert several possible breaks that will not result in a visible space (somewhat like a conditional hyphen that is displayed only when a word is broken
 at the end of a line). For this purpose you can use either U200C, Zero Width Non-Joiner (which Word calls "No-Width Optional Break"), or U200B, Zero Width Space. The former has the advantage that you can insert it from the
<strong>Special Characters</strong> tab of Word's <strong>Symbol</strong> dialog. When one of those spaces falls at the end of a line, the URL will break.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution will work even if the link must remain active because the editing you are doing is only to the display text. If you look at the
<strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> dialog, you'll see that the "Text to display" contains the spaces, but the "Address" remains the same. You can see the same if you press
<strong>Alt+F9</strong> to display the Hyperlink field code, which displays the unbroken URL.</p>

<h2>            Word 2013 opening files in Read Only</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a new computer, first time using Windows 8.1 and also first time using Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a program that I create invoices with but when it tries to open the invoice template (which has fields which update according to data pushed through from the program) the template is opening in Read Only meaning that my data isn't getting loaded into
 it. &nbsp;The Invoice Template is an RTF file type (I have no control over this) and I have previously used this program to run invoices using Word 2003 without an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking here it seems there are a few people with this Read Only issue. &nbsp;I have tried all the usual things like making sure Read Only box isn't ticked, checking all Trust Centre stuff out etc but nothing I do changes this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

All of a sudden, I’m having a weird issue with existing worksheets. &nbsp;Just as normal, I will open an existing worksheet and edit a cell. &nbsp;However, the cells that have formulas that reference the edited cells are not reflecting any change. &nbsp;If I click my cursor

            Its not clear if this solved the posters question.
<div><br />
<div>There does seem to be another (perhaps bug) situation in 2011 where the calculation is not set to manual and cells are not recomputed automatically. It occurred for me once and it is almost as though there is a permanent flag on some cells to say that
 the contents are up to date so that the part of excel that looks for cells that need updating is bypassed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did a search on this and could not find relevant help other than that like that BobG offered. In the end I had to go through some 30 cells and edit them by inserting the cursor and typing return.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was a little unhappy because I could not be sure I had found them all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just thought I would put it on record. It was not absolutely clear what was going on and I was not sure enough to send in a bug report.</div>

            I believe I have seen this several times now. It appears in my case it may be related to doing a 'save as' with a spreadsheet that has formulas in it. To get new values I have to either re-enter the formula or put the cursor on the formula and hit enter.
 I guess those are about the same.
<div><br />
<div>The file is set up to auto-calculate and file save doesn't help. I haven't checked for cell formatting as some posts have discussed because it's not reasonable to expect a user to check cell formats to see if they've changed from version to version of
 the same spreadsheet. That's almost as unreasonable as going back through all the cells and re-entering the formulas.<br />
<div><br />
<div>This gives me great concern and stress because not only do I not know where in my many spreadsheets this may be occurring I worry for those who's work is more critical.
<div><br />
<div>It seems most of the information on-line is out of date and incomplete. This is a serious outright bug as far as I can tell. It's more than weird, it's a nightmare; catastrophic; words can't convey the seriousness.</div>

            Since it was a single event that was not reproducible, that sounds more like a corrupt workbook than an XL bug (which we would expect to see many reports of here...).
<div><br />
<div>While it's true that there could be a similar issue with the OP, the likelihood that it's Preferences/Calc/Manual is orders of magnitude more likely.</div>

            XL sets its default Calculation mode (Automatic/Manual) based on the FIRST workbook that is opened in a session.
<div><br />
<div>If you have a workbook that automatically opens (including Personal Macro Workbook) in Manual mode, then subsequent workbooks (including the one you double-clicked to open XL) will also be placed in Manual mode for that session (unless you change it).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This has gotten more prevalent with Apple's Restore feature - opening files that were open the last time XL was closed.</div>

            Have you actually checked that your workbook is IN Automatic calculation mode for THAT session?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Ever since Apple introduced the Restore feature, I've been getting increasingly frequent calls from my clients that their workbooks aren't recalculating. So far it has always been an issue that Calculation was set to Manual by the first workbook opened
 during that session.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That's been a feature of XL since, IIRC, XL 1.0 on the original Mac, but that was 28 years ago, so my memory may be fuzzy.</div>

            <p>Yes I have checked that workbook is in autocalc mode. That's the first thing I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appears that the cntrl, alt, F9 keystroke makes it recalculate, but I'm not sure yet. The cells that don't recalculate appear to be random so it's all but impossible to predict where this is going to happen and to verify that everything is updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buttons like 'Calculate Now' and 'Calculate Sheet' don't do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sheesh.... Apples fault. Really?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as no reports and people not seeing it. If the values don't look dramatically wrong no-one is going to notice. Think of the complexity of the millions of spreadsheets out there. It's just not possible to know if every formula has re-calculated. If
 the users don't know about the Cntrl,Alt,F9 sequence of runes and that they need to use that every time to be sure the formulas are up to date it's quite possible that many people are working with bad data and don't realize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly from my perspective I don't see this issue being given the attention that it warrants.

Where did I imply that it was Apple's fault? I simply stated that the frequency of reporting (from my customers) has increased since Resume was added. In my customers' case, the cause is well characterized - they didn't expect the design behavior and didn't
 know to look for it. It hadn't been an issue before Resume, because they only opened individual files.
<div><br />
<div>Again, not anyone's fault - a change in environment often causes a change in observed behavior.
<div><br />
<div>So far I don't see that anything's been established as an "issue". Certainly you should report it via Help/Send feedback, but I haven't seen any indication that there's a bug. Not saying there couldn't be, but nobody has demonstrated a way to reproduce
 anecdotal reports yet - until that happens, it <i>usually </i>reflects either a corrupt file, corrupt preferences, or unexpected design behavior.&nbsp;</div>

            It sounds exactly like my original response posting.
<div><br />
<div>Yes it has happened twice for me</div>
<div><br />
<div>It may be a corrupt workbook but it did not appear corrupt and there seemed no way of knowing that it was.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In my case the auto calc was the first thing to check and it was on AUTO.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In my case the command = key sequence did not force a recalc either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said it was as though those cells had a recalc flag fixed to Don't recalc!</div>
<div><br />
<div>But it is getting back a while.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t receive text message &#40;SMS&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Lumia 540&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I got problem receiving text message (SMS) since the last couple weeks. I'm not sure if it was happen before or after the last system update.</p>
<p>the phone can send text/SMS and other function normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to move the SIM card to other phone, and it can receive text/SMS. So I guest the problem is in my Lumia.</p>
<p>Now I'm considering to "reset to factory setting", but before I do it, I hope to find a better idea for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI,</p>
<p>the OS build version: 10.0.14393.2248</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>Adrian</p>

</p><p>It is possible that the SMS center number on your Lumia 540 was accidentally changed which is why you are unable to receive messages. You may resolve this issue by acquiring the correct SMS center number and changing your phone's message settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please contact your mobile service carrier to ask for the correct SMS center number. Then on your phone, go to

<p>The SMS center number is correct. That's why I still can send text as normal.</p>

<p>Thank you for letting us know. We recommend that you check if the date and time setting is set correctly on your phone. To do this, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; time. </strong>Also, check the signal strength on the phone screen, and/or move to an area with better reception. Then, try to send a text message to your own mobile phone number to test the sending and receiving
 capabilities of your phone. If possible, insert a different operator SIM card into your phone to verify that the phone is working properly.<br />
<br />
If the previous troubleshooting steps didn't help, you may need to proceed with the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset process</a></strong> to further isolate the issue. Note that this will remove everything stored on your phone, so make sure
 to check or create a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup</a></strong> to avoid data loss. If none of this helped, verify with your carrier if there's any maintenance in your area.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Access 2010 Navigation Control - Can not drop a form onto left &#34;Add New&#34; tab</h2>
                    
<p>I've made a navigation form with tabs on top and left.&nbsp; In form design view, the last top tab is "Add New" and each of the others has at least an "Add New" of the left (more if I've dropped other forms there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, I cannot drop a form on the left "Add New" to create a new left tab under one of the top tabs.&nbsp; Specifically, right now I cannot figure out how to drop a datasheet view form onto the sole left hand ("Add New") tab under the sixth tab on the top
 (counting left to right).&nbsp; The normal insertion marker near the left "Add New" tab never appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>

<div>You need to view the form in layout view before the drag + drop will work. So, open the nav form in layout view, not desing view.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You then should be able to drag + drop in a form or report onto the the "Add New" in the nav form.</div>

<h2>            Outlook - Unknown e-mail server in account settings.</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone seen this issue? My e-mail account has been with Verizon.net forever. Verizon stopped supporting their Verizon.net e-mail server couple years ago&nbsp;and all the e-mail accounts were transferred to AOL.com servers. Although&nbsp;my e-mail is now on a AOL
 server I still continue to use my POP settings the same way I always did...pop.verizon.net for incoming and&nbsp;smtp.verizon.net for outgoing. That has worked well until recently I noticed a couple times an error when opening outlook with receiving my e-mails
 and I received a spoofing e-mail that was sent from my own e-mail address. So I changed my password and repaired my settings to the Verizon.net servers but they automatically change now to a yahoo.com server, yet I still receive my email. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't seem to be able to fix it and there's no info on AOL about them using Yahoo servers. Thinking of just using a different e-mail account but I have had this one so long and all accounts are set up with this e-mail.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Now that Verizon owns both, that is a valid server name for Verizon.net addresses and is used with auto account setup.

<h2>            How to add custom monospace font as plain text fonts in Internet Explorer 9</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded a monotype font for my personal use (from <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/lucasfonts/thesans_mono_condensed_regular/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
see here</a>). I want to add the same as plain text fonts in Internet Explorer 9.</p>
<p>But under Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; General &gt; Fonts &gt; Plain Text Fonts list,&nbsp;I cannot see this font.</p>
<p>This is a monotype font and working fine everywhere.</p>
<p>Also I checked it by changing language scripts also, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>So any help or suggestions please....</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>It has to be 'installed' into the windows fonts directory.....{windir\fonts} and be encoded for the selected language script.</p>
<p>refer to the vendors installation instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rarely will web pages (incorrectly) place text nodes in the body tag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for testing of w3c compliance please use the mono-spaced fonts supplied by the w3c or the IE Test center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Some Fonts in Excel not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had windows 7 previously and the fonts used to work normally in Excel. As per the company policy had to upgrade to Windows 10 and since then some fonts are not popping up in the font drop down. The older files where those fonts were used are plain Arial
 to view now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you suggest a solution.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Raghu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded all the fonts to that link. Please access it again to get them. You can replace the existing font folder on your computer.</p>
<p>The fonts should be there when you install the Windows system, not sure why they disappear, but put them there again should fix the issue.<br />

                    Good afternoon everyone! I have an issue. When I have any incoming calls I don't have any notifications of it: no sound, no picture of a person. The only one thing is that the icon of a percon who is calling me is moving up, under the "Search Skype" but
 anyway, If Skype&nbsp; isn't opened on the screen it's impossible to detect that someone is calling. In Settings everythig is done properely. The sound and micropfone is also working If I'm talking with a person. Did someone face with such kind of a problem? I
 will very much appreciate your help and advice. Thank you in advance.

I am a Mac user and have Office 2011 installed. &nbsp;Will I need to purchase Office 2019 in order to meet the Mac 64 bit requirement, when the next version of MacOS is released, or will Microsoft be re-fitting Office with the 64 bit platform?<br /></p>

<p>For quite some time now, Apple has threatened to discontinue support for 32-bit applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2011 will never be 64-bit. It has long been discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac started off as 32-bit. The final version of 2016 is 64-bit. The "retro-fitting" happened to Office 2016 and will not happen to 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Office 2019 for Mac is 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to exactly when Apple will carry out their threat? Who knows? If I were to guess, Apple will do it whenever they announce the next new Mac hardware. Probably in June at the Worldwide developer conference. But that is just a wild guess based on history.</p>

    <title>Form Data in Field is being cutoff in print. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colelinsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Form Data in Field is being cutoff in print.</h2>
                    The data in a date field is mm/dd/yyyy but in preview or print it cuts off the last number of the year. I tried page margins and all that good stuff. I even went into design view and tried changing the width of the field but does not work on print preview.
 I am at a loss any help is appreciated<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/23b04d1d-10bc-43a0-b0c1-7322b09c4025" />

            I'd strongly endorse what Scott has said.&nbsp; In any application worth the name a report should be created, specifically designed for printed output, rather than printing a form.&nbsp; The latter can be done, but like a dog walking on its hind legs, it is rarely
 done well.<br />
<br />
If you want to print the current record you can do so from the form with a button which either restricts the report by means of the WhereCondition argument of the OpenReport method using the expression:&nbsp; "[Client ID] = " &amp; Me.[Client ID]<br />
<br />
or you can restrict the report's RecordSource query by means of a parameter on the Client ID column:&nbsp; Forms![YourFormNameGoesHere]![Client ID]<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to select multiple clients to print you can design an unbound dialogue form in which you can select the client(s) from a multi-select list box.&nbsp; You'll find an example as MultiSelect.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />

            <p>Hello AntoniaHarrison,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for taking the time to post in the Microsoft Answers forums!&nbsp; In case the Zune.net website doesn't re-direct you automatically, are you also getting an error when installing apps from the Windows Phone marketplace at
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Http://www.windowsphone.com</a>?&nbsp; If so, one thing I'd suggest is to access the Online settings of your account at
<a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Http://www.xbox.com</a>&nbsp;to see if the app download option is enabled.&nbsp; After signing in, click<strong>&nbsp;My Account</strong> in the upper right,
<strong>Privacy and Online Settings</strong>, then ensure that the option for <strong>
Purchasing</strong> is enabled.&nbsp; Once this is complete, try purchasing from your phone again.&nbsp; I hope this helps clear things up, please keep us updated with your progress!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Greg</p>

<p>But the file is not empty, all 1200 contact are there.</p>

<p>If the CSV file can be opened properly in MS Excel and it cannot be imported to the Hotmail account - the following response from Natasha would apply:</p>

<p>&nbsp;One thread that may be of particular interest in the WindowsLiveHelp forum relates to how the field names are defined in the CSV file (apparently from various responses&nbsp;CSV field names&nbsp;must match the fields in Hotmail)</p>
<p>How do I import contacts from a .CSV file?<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Meeting Invites Added to Delegate Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I'm experiencing an issue similar to the one found in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_o365b/outlook-2016-delegate-calendar-invitations-dont/da9808d0-837a-4f95-bfe2-6b5865f03f76">
this thread</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>I have a User and a Delegate. User has two mailboxes: Visible and Personal. Anyone can send messages to User.Visible, which forwards to Delegate without keeping a copy in its mailbox. Delegate forwards important emails to User.Personal, as well as managing
 the calendar attached to User.Visible. On the User.Visible account, delegation is set up as described in the linked thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc002577-d41c-4d50-bced-64e0038e46b4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc002577-d41c-4d50-bced-64e0038e46b4?upload=true" height="222" width="306" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So: User receives emails at User.Personal, and uses their calendar at User.Visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When anyone sends a calendar invite to User.Visible, Delegate receives the invite in their inbox and clicks "Accept." The requester receives an email saying that Delegate accepted the invite, and the event is added to Delegate's calendar but NOT User.Visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted &amp; re-added Delegate to User.Visible in PowerShell, the web GUI, and Outlook. None of the changes have had any effect. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>
</p><p>When the "Keep a copy..." option is turned off, Outlook acts as though the user to whom emails are being forwarded was the original recipient of the calendar invite. When I turned this option on, User.Visible's calendar acted as expected and created an event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The forwarded email still creates a duplicate event on the forwardee's calendar, but at least now the event shows up on User's calendar at all.</p>

<p>谢谢回复，已经解决。我想应该是账户和网络问题</p>
<p>我重新开启了我已经关闭的账户。</p>
<p>关闭账户：登录个人账户后按照标准流程关闭，随后发现无法使用onenote的工作账户（两账户为同一邮箱），最后只能重新打开。</p>
<p>同步问题：我是先登出了账户，登入账户时挂载了VPN尝试了半小时，后终于同步成功，现在关闭VPN后已无问题。</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it impossible to post to more than one Yammer group&nbsp;in one email?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently it is not possible to post to multiple Yammer groups at the same time. Content will be posted to Only the first email address in the&nbsp;TO field (even if&nbsp;have multiple email addresses in the TO field), even if you CC a different email address it
 will still post to the first email address in the TO field.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However,&nbsp;it sounds like a great idea and I would request you to mention it as a feedback in the below product feedback link as it is being viewed by the Product Team&nbsp;on a regular basis.</span></p>

            <p>That didn't seem to fix the auto Send/Receive issue. Still not auto sending or receiving?&nbsp; I changed the frequency to 5 min then 15 min, didn't seem to matter.&nbsp; I did install an addon program OfficeCalendar to sync appointments &amp; contacts&nbsp;with my office
 manager, not sure if this&nbsp;may have caused problems?&nbsp;</p>
