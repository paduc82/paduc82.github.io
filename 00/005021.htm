<h2>            Connecting PC to Internet&#58; Using N73 with bluetooth connection</h2>
                    Ive tried to connect my PC to internet over my N73 using a D-link or Belking Bluetooth USB dongle. The connection beteween the laptop and the phone works ok, but when using PC suite/one touch access the "standard modem over bluetooh link #17" doesnt seem
 to be able to connect. (not able to connect to network)<br />
Ive tried to reinstall several times, and when changing the bluetooth dongle to D-link it it DID work but just for one session (!)<br />
<br />
I have changed the settings for the bluetooth on my computer (using DUN and the other services)but nothing seems to help.<br />
<br />
My hardware/software is: Laptop with Vista an PC-suite / D-link DBT120 / Nokia N73 (telia Sweden)<br />
<br />
Is it someone who exaclty can describe how I can manage to connect?

            I'm not sure with Vista but at least with XP in the device manager if you select the modem you should have an option somewhere to turn on modem logs. Switch on that feature and then check the logs, it might give you some information concerning the failure.

            <p>Yes, two options:</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; Go to&nbsp;a local big-box major electronics or office supply retailer and purchase at retail, or order directly from Microsoft at their online Microsoft Store:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/list/parentCategoryID.37286600/categoryID.50726400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/list/parentCategoryID.37286600/categoryID.50726400</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2) Go to the Office folder in your Start Menu and click on Office Anytime Upgrade which will walk you thru an electronic purchase process from Microsoft that sells you a product key that converts your existing Office without Outlook (Office Home and Student
 2010) to one of the two editions of Office that does come with Outlook (Home and Business 2010 or Professional 2010).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming everything else is equal, the upconversion to an Office with Outlook is the better choice as the standalone installation of Outlook does not integrate with the other Office programs as well as does the upconversion to Office with Outlook.</p>

<h2>            N97, Bluetooth audio won&#39;t keep time, keeps speeding up&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've just got my pair of BH-905 Nokia headphones.. they're really very nice and loosing the audio cable is fab (bluetooth audio FTW!) Looking forward to testing the noise cancelling on the train next week</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When playing tracks back, occasioning something crazy happens. The playback speed increases.. only very slightly. It causes the track to speed up and the pitch increase (by about 1/4 tone) I think in actual fact the track starts slow. If I rewind the track
 to before the speed jump, it doesn't happen again and it seems to be playing at the new speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I appreciate bluetooth audio is streaming technology, so I *urgh it just did it again* can appreciate network congestion might be solved with a speed bump, but this is freaky.. Has anyone else ever noticed this behaviour using bluetooth playback?! *URGH
 again.. in the same track, now it feels too fast*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously crazy. To be fair, I've not used wired headphones with this phone, I'd been waiting for to get wireless headphones so maybe I should try that too..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You don't send the raw data over BT. The sound is first expanded on the N97, and a constant bitrate is sent to the phones. This is most likely a problem with the BT implementation on the N97. Yet another bug...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing to point out is VBR changes the bit rate rapidly and randomly so a gradual shift shouldn't be possible..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, A2DP is actually a bit **bleep**. The audio is not sent raw, it is sent in one of many lossy codecs. The main codec is SBC (which is pretty poor) but it can be one of many standard codecs if both devices support it (MP3, AAC, ATRAC are optionally
 supported (Nice one BT SIG, pick codecs that are heavily patented)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the phone either sends MP3 raw to the headphones or it decodes it and recompresses it with lossy SBC.. So the speed up could be caused in the headphones as they catch up on a lossy stream (rather than jump forward it plays the extra buffer slightly faster)
 or it could be caused by terrible MP3 decode / SBC encode software on the phone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, if you replay the bit of track where the speed up happens, it doesn't happen again.. which makes me think this is actually a stream to the headset problem.. Maybe caused by low priority of the sending software on the phone (ie it doesn't
 send the data quickly enough or in crazy packet clumps)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either, this is WELL weird and I'm slightly miffed that A2DP isn't lossless.. how useless is that! Should've checked first..&nbsp;</p>
<p>44.1KHz * 2 chan * 16bit = 1.41Mbit</p>
<p>48KHz * 2 chan * 24bit = 2.03Mbit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, bluetooth 2 couldn't carry 48KHz 24bit, but it should be possible to send 44.1KHz 16bit, just..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some lossless codecs on the horizon as I understand, but they're all closed and a bit **bleep** :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be a problem with the technology in addition to yet more bugs in the N97, may not get solved.. pitty</p>

<p>Hmm. Bluetooth 2 is suppsed to be 3 Mbit/s, so it should do just fine with 2*48Khz @ 24 bits as well.</p>
<p>Bluetooth 1.2 will only do 1.2 Mbit/s, so with that version it won't handle uncompressed data either way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I would assume that the N97 is Bluetooth 2 (but I haven't checked). But anyway, I think this is just another bug in the system. Iv'e seen strange timing issues pop up in a few other places as well, which I need to reboot to get rid of (also related to
 Bluetooth).</p>

<p>according to the 2.0 specification, EDR provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three times the transmission speed ‚Äî up to 10 times (2.1 MBits/s) in some cases.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not that fast in actual data transfer.. its like ATM, the packet sizes are small to reduce latency.. Plus you wouldn't want to have a stream that relied on best case scenario to work..</p>

<p>Yeah, but you should probably have read the whole wikipedia article then (or atleast the whole section you quoted a little bit from). ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I agree with the basic line that you can't trust the speed anyway, so you'd better try to have large margins.</p>

<p>I have the same problem: audio pitch decreases while streaming audio over Bluetooth. I have had the issue mainly on FP2 devices (XM 5630 and now with my E72) using Nokia headsets: BH-103, BH-214 and BH-903. I never had the issue on N95 nor N85.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping firmware update would solve it (V22.007 on E72) as the official changelog reports bluetooth connection issues solved but unfortunately that's not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>did the latest firmware update of the N97 solve it ? I find the issue less obvious on my XM 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyone else having the issue, what model of phone and what models of headsets ?</p>

<p>I have the same problem on my N97 with my BH-905 noise-cancelling headphones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is <strong><em><u>very</u></em></strong> annoying because the speed-up is very often preceeded by two short pauses in playback, like the phone is doing something else and doesn't have enough buffered to the headphones.&nbsp; Even in OFFLINE mode (when all
 other radio circuits should be <u>off</u>) it does it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very poor performance for an over-priced handset and over-priced headphones.</p>

<p>I have experienced this as well with my N97 and BH-903 and actually returned the stereo bluetooth headset to try other options but so far all of the Nokia stereo bluetooth headsets that I have tried have this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have heard that this problem is caused by interference from other wireless devices like wifi. I'm not sure on the validity of this but given the recent explosion in the number of wireless devices (wifi, wireless printers, cordless phones, etc...) it does
 make sense and would also explain why people are having this problem now and not with previous handsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, just another thought.</p>

                    <p>I use Windows 7 on my Dell computer. For the last couple of days my Malware Anti-malware scan has found objects infected with PUP.optional. I've rebooted the computer to remove them, have done it from the safe mode with networking too, but on the next scan,
 the PUPs are found again, usually at around or just over 500. Whenever I've dealt with viruses or malware in the past, removing/rebooting after the scan has fixed the problem. I've never dealt with something that just immediately keeps coming back. Without
 copying the entire results of the scan, this is the basics that the latest one gave me:</p>

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a UserForm, and I would like to add a Tree View control. Does Excel VBA have a TreeView control? I can't seem to find&nbsp;it in the Control Toolbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a 64-bit version of Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Inbox emails disappeared before my eyes</h2>
                    Today when I opened my inbox to check for e-mails, all of the emails in my inbox disappeared within seconds of opening the file. &nbsp;I checked the deleted file and the trash file and the emails are not there. &nbsp;I exited and re-entered my email account and
 the emails are not there. &nbsp;Why would the inbox emails be deleted? &nbsp;And how can I get them back. &nbsp;There are about a dozen very important emails I desperately need. &nbsp;<br />

<li>Have you tried using a different browser and got the same result?<br />
</li><li>Have you also tried using a different device and found the same issue?</li><li>When was the last time you logged in to your Outlook.com account before you discovered your Inbox emails disappeared?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>We suggest that you clear your browser's cache, cookies and history.<br />

Thank you.</p>

            Thanks for your response. &nbsp;I did try logging into my email account using a different browser. &nbsp;I have deleted history, cookies, cache and reset Safari and the emails have not turned up. &nbsp;New emails are appearing in my inbox, but the ones that were there
 yesterday are still gone. &nbsp;I get the same results whether I am using my iPad or phone to download e-mails. &nbsp;Do you have any other suggestions I might try?

<h2>            microsoft edge just broke, Windows 10</h2>
                    I have micosoft&nbsp;edge as my browser from&nbsp;an upgrade to windows 10 from windows 7 ultimate. Every thing was working fine and I enjoyed the new browser. Then this week I was unable to download pics from face book. I have tried resetting, removing, and rebooting
 edge. I have did the registry location of download location as well as confirm ctrl j points correctly. I have cleaned , deleted and verified the caches and history are clean. Internet explorer works fine as does fire fox. My Microsoft edge is also having
 issues showing msn and some web pages correctly and will not open at all some Microsoft support pages but ie and firefox do. Have tried right clicking and choosing save to target but nothing happens. The downloads do appear in the downloads folder but show
 0% complete regardless how long I wait. IE and other browsers work fine and in private edge works as well. So issue is with edge settings. I have run sfc and got no system file errors. Also tried the app trouble shooter

            Since Skype is now part of Microsoft product, deleting Skype account will be the same with deleting a Microsoft account. If you haven‚Äôt updated or migrated the Skype account you want to delete to a Microsoft account, then you will need to go through it before deleting the account. You may use a different Microsoft account (Dummy email address) if you don‚Äôt want your Microsoft account to be deleted. However, if it‚Äôs already updated to a Microsoft then there‚Äôs no option to unmerge it and it will delete the Microsoft account as well.

<h2>            Authoritarianism &#61;&#61; please, does anyone know of another product that lets me have a number and also call phones&#63;  I&#39;m sick of this.</h2>
                    <p>Do all people who get money and power become authoritarians?&nbsp; I mean, first they stopped allowing me to use XP with Skype.&nbsp; I like XP.&nbsp; I have a bunch of applications I use on XP, my routine is worked out.&nbsp; But Microsoft couldn't just let those of us who
 like XP continue to use it, they had to disable Skype on XP.</p>
<p>I had to set up another computer with their win7 on it, and get all the programs I like to work on it, just so I could use Skype.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now, they no longer allow you not to update their software.&nbsp; That is, I prefer a slightly older version.&nbsp; But now they LOG YOU OUT, if you don't have the current version.&nbsp; That's right.&nbsp; I paid for service and I am unable to use the service.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I thought I'd use the skype on the web.&nbsp; I use firefox browser.&nbsp; But wouldn't you know it, they don't allow you to use skype on another browser, you have to use theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not like firefox is an unknown browser, or only has a small user base.&nbsp; It is
 one of the most popular.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Are all authoritarians so afraid of independent thought?&nbsp; Do they all require such strict adherence to what they want?</p>
<p>I would like to know of other products I can switch to .&nbsp; I am tired of being bullied around.&nbsp; They charge me money and refuse service except on an incresingly narrow platform.&nbsp; I like choice and I didn't get skype for them to make all my computing decisions
 for me.&nbsp; Get me outa here!!!</p>

    <title>300&#43; contacts blocked with no feasible way of unblocking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david osbourne  say:</h3>
<h2>            300&#43; contacts blocked with no feasible way of unblocking</h2>
                    One of the latest windows messenger updates had the simply stupid idea of making "appear offline" block your whole list. This turned into so much of a problem that I lost interest with unblocking people every time. Now that skype has taken over it has
 extended this problem to whole new levels. Now I dont have Windows Live Messenger to unblock the contacts, it's left to the graphically orientated "people" menu on outlook or whatever it is. After looking endlessly for a way to actually talk to my friends
 by unblocking them which should be a fairly conspicuous option, I found it was done by the completely negligible 3 dots rather than having the words up there in the space....<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c771db5b-9d9b-45d8-aa3e-2099646a998c" /><br />
<br />
oh but it gets better. Skype took over Live Messenger, so you're thinking do it in skype, right?<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/74cdeb5f-ff31-4368-b8d5-99ccc7623ccf" /><br />
<br />
<br />
No. While skype recognizes theyre blocked, it leaves the option to unblock them blank and instead refers you to a (random) hotmail page that again doesnt help.<br />
<br />
Could someone perhaps offer a way of mass unblocking most of your list? Probably not because I imagine it needs an upgrade. Better yet can someone offer an explanation as to why quite an integral part of instant messaging has been completely overlooked during
 the transfer to skype and/or outlook? It's very, very sloppy<br />

<p>I will be glad to assist you with your concern. I understand that there are some feature that are quite confusing since the upgrade of the Hotmail interface took over. The ellipses on People page&nbsp;is where the other option located.&nbsp;We welcome useful ideas
 like this to improve services Microsoft offers to its customers. If you like, you can go to our

feedback</a>&nbsp;page and post it as&nbsp; a suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to the Skype client that you are using where there the option to unblock the contacts are grayed out, you may need to contact Skype support for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further clarifications, let us know.</p>

            Thanks for replying Kristina. Yeah I did find the ellipses-&gt;block but as you can imagine thats gonna be a very tedious way of unblocking ALL my list. I understand why you've seemingly removed the ability to block/unblock large amounts of people in a list
 format (since there's no messenger I guess?) but it does leave me with this problem that skype wont be able to resolve their end since they werent blocked on skype<br />

            <p>Hi sacomoga</p>
<p>I take it you are referring to it being your main line of defence.</p>
<p>I can certainly have no arguments there, i have always bought my antivirus programs and as we all lnow they are not cheap so for windows 10 to include a much better line of defence like defender in win 10 for free its great.</p>
<p>I no longer use my old system, only defender and malwarebytes to catch the malware stragglers etc and since having it 3 month now I have had only one hit and that was quickly dealt with.</p>
<p>Although there are still old school who remain stubborn and the wait and see mob as well as those still running 2 or even 3 av programs even with all the conflicts that creates.</p>
<p>Antivirus progs along with cars, tv' s, dogs etc are a personal choice.</p>
<p>The thing you have to ask yourself is this</p>
<p>AM I MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE? </p>
<p>I KNOW I AM</p>

<p>Many have&nbsp;agonized over that question.&nbsp;Defender certainly updates itself &amp; auto-runs&nbsp;often...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm expecting an auto-run shortly, but one may run it&nbsp;on demand as well &amp; do a full scan too.&nbsp;It&nbsp;catches them all at...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.eicar.org/85-0-Download.html</span></a></p>
<p>Virus test site </p>
<p>
</p><p>...on the way in (the Real-Time scan), &amp; it gives a nice report about what it quarantined. (Afterward, I found partial downloads to manually delete in the download folder, though. That likely was leftovers after the virus is extracted.) It is an MS product,
 &amp; one must trust MS knows what it is doing &amp; which viruses to include in its definitions. (Read through this Microsoft Community for cautionary tales about Defender. But I'm sure there are cautionary tales about all of them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have also installed a free version of Malwarebytes for supplemental protection. If you do so - Malwarebytes or another - you must not turn on its Real-Time Scanner. That will shut Defender down. You may only occasionally update &amp; run the 3rd party
 app yourself manually. Also take a vow to payoff Malwarebytes ($24.00) or whoever should it ever catch something Defender missed.</p>

    <title>Determining percentage of month of YTD calculations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryno33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Determining percentage of month of YTD calculations</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to determine monthly income from YTD totals.&nbsp; Below is the formula I use to calculate the number of complete months from the Start Date to last Pay Ending Date:</p>
<p>=IF((MONTH(G7)&lt;2),ROUNDDOWN(G33+0.01,0),IF(G7&lt;EOMONTH(G7,0),(ROUNDDOWN(G33+0.03,0)),ROUND(G33,0)))</p>
<p>G33&nbsp;=F33*12</p>
<p>F33&nbsp; =YEARFRAC(G6,G7+1,1)</p>
<p>G6 = Starting Date&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G7 = End pay period</p>
<p>I need to create a function that will determine a the precentage&nbsp;of a partial month worked.&nbsp; My business uses the end pay period day divided by last day of the month to determine a conservative income figure for a partial month(i.e.&nbsp; March 15 divided by
 March 31 = .48387 or Feb 19 divided by Feb 28 = .67857).</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can create a forumla (Basically, MONTHFRAC) to decrease user error by only having the processors input the dates only?!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking a look!</p>

    <title>Insert multiple audio files in powerpoint 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> royrobbins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert multiple audio files in powerpoint 365</h2>
                    I have a 48 slide powerpoint file that I have saved as a powerpoint show.&nbsp; I have inserted an audio file on slide #1 that now plays throughout the entire show.&nbsp; I now want to have the audio file stop playing after slide #24 and then have a new audio file
 start playing on slide #25.&nbsp; I have succeeded in getting the first audio file to stop playing after slide #24 and also in getting the new audio file to start playing at slide #25.&nbsp; My problem is that once you advance to slide #25 with a mouse click (and the
 new audio file starts playing)&nbsp;I can't advance to slide #26 with a mouse click.&nbsp; I have to use the down arrow key to get to slide #26.&nbsp; How do I get the slides in the show to advance throughout with mouse clicks?&nbsp;

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I should have mentioned that I did have the audio set to come on automatically at slide #25 and it did in fact start playing on that slide just as it should.&nbsp; However, I could not get to the next slide using my mouse, I had to use
 the down arrow to get to slide #26.&nbsp; I have no idea why that happens but suspect that with stopping the first audio, starting the second audio, and advancing to the next slide there's too many actions happening all at once.&nbsp; Any suggestions are certainly appreciated.

            I'm not able to duplicate that effect. If you temporarily remove the audio from slide 25, does the slide show work normally with a mouse click?

                    My autocorrect in Word 2010 is not working. All of the proper boxes are checked. It worked yesterday. Sometimes it starts working again if I close Word and then open again, but not today.

    <title>Can I have help doing the simplest &#38; best Hard Reset on my Nokia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I have help doing the simplest &#38; best Hard Reset on my Nokia Lumia 950&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I ask it that way since I‚Äôm pretty sure that I need to do a Hard Reset. That‚Äôs because my phone's clock just recently has occasionally been showing the wrong time &amp; then it fixes itself sometime later and also the Messaging APP has disconnected
 itself from both the live tile &amp; the Notification Bar so I never know anymore when somebody has texted me like I did up until last week.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I hadn‚Äôt changed any Settings before this started happening nor have I added any APPs. I have very few APPs anyhow &amp; I‚Äôm not a gamer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>So, since I know nothing about using OneDrive other than that I noticed that Windows 10 phones are set to use it for Photos and I think I‚Äôve heard it can also share Settings between Devices, maybe it can help get me thru this process much less
 painfully than when I did my last new setup after I fell into a pool with my&nbsp;first</span><span> Lumia 950 in my pocket &amp; ruined it.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I‚Äôve also done Hard Resets and new startups on a handful (5) Motorola MPx-220 Windows phones as I fought them until they died.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Could somebody step me thru a Hard Reset and if so, first answer a few questions?</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What can OneDrive automatically setup &amp; what won't it as far as Photos, APPs, home screen tiles &amp; layout? Do we need to verify where that stuff is saved, on Phone or on SD card or Move anything to the SD card before doing the hard reset?</span></li><li><span>Will all Photos come along on OneDrive, meaning the Camera Roll, Saved Pictures and Screenshots? I have some in each one but luckily not too many as I try to always email myself any keepers so I can Save them on my computer.</span></li><li><span>FYI, my only email Inbox, Calendar &amp; Contacts come from my outlook.com that also feeds the Outlook 2016 program on my home PC so I suppose that simplifies things.</span></li><li><span>I don't care about saving any Text threads.</span></li><li><span>Will my People Groups need to be recreated? If so, I can just PrintScreen them now.</span></li><li><span>I guess that I‚Äôll need to redesignate a Photo as my Lockscreen and my Photo Tile? If so, no problem.</span></li></ol>

<p>I'm sure hoping for some expert help on this soon. Anybody?</p>
<p>I've read that perhaps a Hard Reset using the phone's buttons is better than doing it in Settings?</p>
<p>Is there any truth to that?</p>
<p>It said that to perform a Hard Reset, press &amp; hold the Volume Down button + Power + Camera buttons together until the phone vibrates, and then release the Power button only and hold the other buttons down for another 5 seconds or so, then release all the
 buttons. This is handy when your phone is completely unresponsive and you have already tried the soft reset once.<br />
Factory / Hard Reset using About:<br />
This is to be used only when either you are switching your phone and no longer need data on this phone or when you are selling or exchanging your phone. (DOES THAT MEAN THE BUTTON HARD RESET DOESN'T WIPE OFF MY DATA?) This process completely wipes out all the

<p>
</p><p>Thanks. I don't need to worry about this using data since I can do it on my home Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>But your shorthand is confusing me. Could I ask you to please answer my questions in my little numbered list with numbers? I have a few specific things there plus I don't really understand your ++ and ++&gt; things. Maybe I'm just too old. üòû&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, if I need to reinstall APPs like the old Hillclimb game that Microsoft no longer has in their Store (although I do have a link where I can still get it at, which I've done once and started over after falling into my pool), will it start fresh
 with 0 points or can it be brought in with your current level, or do you know? Would it matter if I Move the game to the SD card before doing the Hard Reset? Could it then be somehow reinstalled or Moved back to Phone after the Hard Reset and my progress would
 be brought with it?</p>

<p>After a phone reset none of the apps installed on the phone will be gone, apps on the SD card will no longer work. In either, all apps will be installed again when or if you restore from a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a phone backup, phone settings, start screen layout, and your installed app list is restored.&nbsp; Backup data content from apps is restored if the app developer designed the app to restore the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your documents, pdf files saved in a pdf app, music and pictures are not backed up if they are on the phone. You will have to ensure all that is saved to your PC or on OneDrive. When you reset you will be asked if you want to format the SD card or not. Apps
 on the SD card have to be installed again no matter what you do with formatting the SD card. Your data on the SD card will be there following the reset if you choose&nbsp;not to format the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts, calendar, email and text messages are part of your Microsoft account and you get all that back. Text messages are restored only if you have sync messages between devices turned on in messaging turned on, this is not retroactive if you turn it on
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is automatically restored from OneDrive except what is part of phone&nbsp;backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure about contact groups. I can only guess they will still be there.</p>
<p>Hope that answers all your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never reset using buttons so I am not sure if you will be asked about formatting the SD card or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not take a chance about phone encryption. I would turn it off if you currently have it turned on and power cycle the phone.</p>

<p>Szilard, please excuse me if any of my previous Reply to you sounded too mean or unappreciative. I'm just looking for a little personal help on certain things since I've been thru this before and I know what a pain it is.<br />
I already knew that everyone here is basically working as volunteers for Microsoft much like the rest of the world is using online volunteer "Communities" (like Facebook does at their
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/community/ask" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.facebook.com/help/community/ask</a>&nbsp;which only lets you ask a new Question using a computer and not if you're on a phone since somehow it knows even if you have your phone's browser set to display the
 Desktop version of all sites).</p>
<p>Anyway, free help is great even if you're Mark Zuckerberg or Microsoft. Microsoft tech support is almost impossible to get to and the Feedback Hub doesn't get you any reply help, it just gives ideas to the programmers and lets them see how many people Upvote
 that same issue.</p>
<p>I bet that "Hill Climb Racing ‚Ä¶. has cloud progress saved somewhere" so I'm sure I'll "lose all your progress".<br />
</p>
<p>That game is really crude and it crashes all the time. I can see why Microsoft dumped offering it in the Store although you can still get it for Windows phones&nbsp;at
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hill-climb-racing/9wzdncrdcwk8?rtc=1&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

It's a bummer that Microsoft hasn't put the newer Hill Climb Racing in the Store that iPhone and Android users can get. That thing is WAY more advanced.</p>

</p><p>On my phone at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Back up &gt; Back up, it was already checked in both "Back up content from participating APPs" and "Back up Settings like my Start Screen layout, accounts and passwords".<br />
That's cool to see but I've never trusted or really even known how to use OneDrive. I might just be clueless about what it does &amp; doesn't do but I just gave up and disconnected my home DELL Inspirion pc from OneDrive because it seemed like too often I would
 Edit a doc and Save it when I Closed it but then the changes wouldn't be there when I opened it the next time. I never knew what I was doing wrong so I just gave up.
</p>
<p>That and with all of the Photos I have on my PC and a few little Videos and DOCs, OneDrive was going to start costing me when they put limits on the free space, so I just gave up &amp; disconnected the DELL from it.<br />
I might mention that I have Outlook 2016 on that DELL also that is also only set up to access my outlook.com email address. I have a few other email addresses, Gmail and a few others, that either forward into my outlook.com or are accessed by outlook.com with
 each Send/Receive.</p>
<p>Hill Climb Racing is the only APP that I have or use that keeps track of any score. I suppose a Maps or Weather APP might keep track of something but that can be reset easily if I need to.<br />
Hill Climb is SO BOGUS when you first start out and it takes you forever to build it up to where you can do almost anything. But, if I lose that, I guess I'll just live with it. ;-)</p>

<p>After a phone reset none of the apps installed on the phone will be gone, apps on the SD card will no longer work. In either, all apps will be installed again when or if you restore from a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a phone backup, phone settings, start screen layout, and your installed app list is restored.&nbsp; Backup data content from apps is restored if the app developer designed the app to restore the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your documents, pdf files saved in a pdf app, music and pictures are not backed up if they are on the phone. You will have to ensure all that is saved to your PC or on OneDrive. When you reset you will be asked if you want to format the SD card or not. Apps
 on the SD card have to be installed again no matter what you do with formatting the SD card. Your data on the SD card will be there following the reset if you choose&nbsp;not to format the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts, calendar, email and text messages are part of your Microsoft account and you get all that back. Text messages are restored only if you have sync messages between devices turned on in messaging turned on, this is not retroactive if you turn it on
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is automatically restored from OneDrive except what is part of phone&nbsp;backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure about contact groups. I can only guess they will still be there.</p>

<p>Thanks garym123. I'm a dummy, so when you say "<em>After a phone reset, none of the APPs installed on the phone will be gone, APPs on the SD card will no longer work. In either, all APPs will be installed again when or if you restore from a backup</em>.",
 are you referring to my doing a Phone Reset and Restoring as different processes or are they considered to be the same thing?<br />
</p>
<p>On that subject, are you saying that I can just leave the APPs on The Phone which is where I think they all are now, and they'll all still be there but they'll need to be Installed again, I guess by just trying to use them, and then as in the case of a game,
 Maps or Weather, the data &amp; settings will still be there or will I need to start over on those?<br />
Should I try to find out if the "reset using buttons" that I mentioned in my first Reply is any different than doing one at &nbsp;Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; [Reset your phone]? Or if you have anyplace that can tell you easily and truthfully, could you tell me?</p>

<p>A reset and restore are separate actions.</p>
<p>After a reset the&nbsp;apps on the phone and SD card will no longer work. They will install again if you restore. you can not even try to use previously installed apps.&nbsp; Depends on the app developer if app data is restored for their app. You will have to start
 over on most apps</p>
<p>When the phone restarts you will be asked to for your account and password. Then there will be a search for available backups.&nbsp; Then you will be asked if you want to restore from a found backup, yes or no.</p>
<p>Use the reset in settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never reset using buttons so I am not sure if you will be asked about formatting the SD card or not.</p>
<p>Why use buttons when you don't have to??</p>
<p>I said the reset is the same, buttons or in settings.</p>

            + success with this improvement endeavor (let's hope it is not some hardware issue causing the problems) ++ try other racing games also : Asphalt 8 has NASCAR cars with all the stunning stats ++ great news if a Windows (10) Mobile user can carry on in
 these crucial &amp; challenging times for this tech ecosystem ++ as for OneDrive, you can imagine as a folder in the Microsoft&nbsp;cloud ++ in order for things to run smoothly you need permanent internet connection for the sync to run properly ++ it can be a useful
 extra space or backup space for files ++&nbsp;

<p>Isn't there any way to fix the Messaging app in my phone without doing a Hard Reset?</p>
<p>I've tried several Soft Resets which are just the same as taking the battery out of the phone and that hasn't fixed my Messaging to put a "1" in the tile when a text arrives or have it display the Notification Bar even though it is Set to do that and did
 until recently.</p>
<p>That's my main problem with this phone right now &amp; maybe the only one since I think the Soft Reset fixed the clock forgetting what time it is for a few hours every now &amp; then.</p>

    <title>Suspended account - how to delete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zygmuntdreszer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspended account - how to delete</h2>
                    <p>Hello. Stupid Microsoft policy made my account totally unusable - account has been suspended due to "weird activity". In theory it is temporarily suspension, but in fact - it is permanent. There is no way to bypass this step - stupid Microsoft demands to
 give it my phone number to text me (hell yeah), and this won't happen. I am not going to give Microsoft anything like that.</p>
<p>About "weird activity" - sounds mysteriously, but in fact it just means no activity for long time - i wasn't using this account more than year. And no one used it.</p>
<p>I tried to bypass it by alternative e-mail verification (passed, no help at all) and by password recovery (passed, no help at all).</p>
<p>I would think about giving my phone number for text verification if that would be really neccesary, but no for "long inactivity".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already created another account, so I don't need the problematic one. How to remove this screwed account?</p>

<p>This won't work. It will work with normal account, but not with suspended one.</p>
<p>I tried hoping that it will make everything right.</p>
<p>As a suspended user I can't manage my own account, nor use Your link to close the account.</p>
