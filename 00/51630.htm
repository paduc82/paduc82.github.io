<h2>            Surface 4 - Bulging Screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4 with a bulging screen I believe due to an expanding battery.&nbsp; I recently went to the MSFT store at Perimeter Mall - Atlanta and they were at first going to do the right thing and replace my Surface with a comparable model, but then
 they backtracked on their initial response with a non-acceptable solution.&nbsp; I have done a lot of research on this issue and it seems that many people are having the same issue which is a HUGE safety concern.&nbsp; Please let me know the steps that I can take to
 get an equivalent or better model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Gamer-tag Change Fee - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mharyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamer-tag Change Fee</h2>
                    <p>$9.99?!?! Really? I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this obvious and unnecessary money-grab. Obviously there must be a charge, not only to cover processing costs, but also to discourage account owners from burdensome and frequent name changes. I just think that $9.99 is a bit excessive of a charge for a relatively small service. Would it not be manageable to allow account holders a limited number of free gamer-tag changes? Perhaps 1 per year, or 3 for the life of the account? At the very least, it seems reasonable to allow a limited number of free gamer-tag changes for paying subscribers to Xbox live. I have had my account (with a constant paid subscription) for over 6 years now, which means I chose my stupid gamer-tag when I was a teenager. In subscription fees alone I have given xbox $360.00, and from my over 35,000 gamer points you can guess how much I have spent on games for the TWO&nbsp;consoles and multiple accessories I have purchased from the company. Yet Xbox can't

If your the President of the US of&nbsp;A and driving people pay tax regularly.&nbsp;Would you allow them to have there license plate change unlimited at any time? &nbsp;Just a comparison I'm trying to make I guess. <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Seems there is drive corruption issues which could be hardware or software or both.<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure
<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

</span><br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>For even better and more efficient checking :</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not
<br />
have a&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy
<br />
protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own
<br />
Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy
<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already
<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Many of the files sfc can't fix are not important.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
put the command from below (copy and paste it) into that box and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
<span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt <br />
<br />
that creates the sfcdetails.txt file in the folder you are in when you run it.<br />
<br />
So if you are in C:\Windows\System32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then you will need to look in that folder for the file.<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><br />
<br />
That creates sfcdetails.txt&nbsp; in C:\Windows\System32&nbsp;&nbsp; find it and you can post the errors into a message
<br />
here. NOTE :&nbsp;there probably are duplicates so please only post each section of errors once.<br />
<br />
Be sure to run checkdisk and maybe SFC /scannow again afterwards.<br />
<br />
You can read the log/txt files easier if you&nbsp;right click on Notepad or Wordpad then RUN AS ADMIN - then
<br />
you can navigate to sfcdetails.txt ( in C:\Windows\System32 ) or cbs.log ( in C:\Windows\Logs ) as needed.
<br />
(You may need to search for sfcdetails.txt if it was not created in the default folders.)<br />
<br />
Many of the entries in sfcdetails.txt could be duplicates so please post each section only once.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP (7f)<br />
This means a trap occurred in kernel mode, and it's a trap of a kind<br />
that the kernel isn't allowed to have/catch (bound trap) or that<br />
is always instant death (double fault).&nbsp; The first number in the<br />
bugcheck params is the number of the trap (8 = double fault, etc)<br />
Consult an Intel x86 family manual to learn more about what these<br />
traps are. Here is a *portion* of those codes:<br />
If kv shows a taskGate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use .tss on the part before the colon, then kv.<br />
Else if kv shows a trapframe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use .trap on that value<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .trap on the appropriate frame will show where the trap was taken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (on x86, this will be the ebp that goes with the procedure KiTrap)<br />
Endif<br />
kb will then show the corrected stack.<br />
Arguments:<br />

            <p>Hey there thehillzdotorg,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>The Mixpot promotional items are still being sent out and applied to each account. It won't be a code you'll see, you'll just see the content appear in your Ready to Install section on the console.</p>
<p>Can you double check your Ready to Install section and let us know if you're seeing the content available there? You should see games like Rare Replay and Can't Hardly Wait.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Thanks so much!</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

<p>I accidentally changed my windows 8 password. I know the current password but I have reasons for wanting to change it back to my previous one. However the computer says that I cant use previously used passwords. Is there a way for me to change it back?</p>

Uninstall you Anti-Virus and reboot. I had the same issue, after upgrade from build 10130 to 10162, update went fine with the AV but caused issue until I uninstall, I was using Eset smart security which cause problems will windows firewall resulting in 0X80080008
 in Window's 10. This is the second time with different builds I had this issue, may be best to remove any AV before upgrading to Window's 10 then reinstall your AV.

            Hi Terry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose from the app (not the download page) to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But if Version 1709 keeps causing problems you can also hide it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<h2>            Windows Defender service can&#39;t start after uninstalling Avast&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sorry if this is a frequent question or anything, but I have been working on this for the past 9 hours and I have made very little progress. Not even Microsoft support could solve it (without paying...), so I turn to the community in a last ditch effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got fed up with Avast antivirus so I removed it with the removal software thinking all would be well and I could just use Windows Defender. Unfortunately, one very strange bug is in my way. I cannot start the WinDefend service that Windows Defender
 needs to run. When I attempt to start it, I get the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/429948ca-0fc0-4d82-90f5-337cb7ec9ae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/429948ca-0fc0-4d82-90f5-337cb7ec9ae5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply can't find any way to fix this issue, after wasting an entire day. I have tried every single "fix" I have found online, to no avail. At this point, I'm completely desperate, and will take anything short of reformatting. Please, if anyone has any
 ideas on a fix, I'm all ears.</p>

<h2>            How to delete Data &#40;D&#41; partition on Toshiba Satellite</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Toshiba C660, which is part of the Satellite series. I got my Laptop yesterday and while I was looking at hard drive capacity I saw that there is are 2 partitions. One partition is my C Drive and the other one is my D Drive, the D drive is
 called 'data' and one I double click on the folder it has a folder named 'HDD Recovery'. Would it be possible to delete this partition because I don't think this partition is needed and I would like to expand my C Drive using the space of D Drive.<br />
<br />
Thank You<br />

            <p>The D partition, by your description, would seem to be a recovery partition. If so, it is provided so that the computer can be recovered/restored to the state it was in when the computer was delivered to you.</p>
<p>If you have other means in place to do that (full system backups to external storsge, for example), the partition could be removed and the space used for some other purpose. If you don't have any such backup plan in place, you can delete it anyway - it's
 your computer. However, that would not be wise, in my view - but it's not my computer.</p>
<p>Happy computing and good luck.</p>

<p><span>Hi apacheguy,</span></p>
<p><span>Post the entire powercfg energy report as this will give more information about the hardware that is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1: Unplug all the external devices connected if any, and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2: If you have any USB devices go into device manager and make sure your USB ports are setup to let the system go into sleep
 mode.</span></p>

    <title>windows 10 edge swipe gestures and charm menu non existent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathanpoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 edge swipe gestures and charm menu non existent</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my 2013 Razer Blade 14 to Windows 10, the edge swipe gestures do not work. When swiping it from any side it does nothing. When moving the mouse down from the top right t open the charm menu it does not work. Also, using winkey+C does not
 open any charm menu either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating drivers, and have looked through every single setting on this entire computer but have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to remedy this issue. ANY help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>As you have face issues with the touch gestures, kindly check if the touch drivers are updated to the laptop Razer Blade 14.</span></p>

            <p>In my case it's a Surface Pro 3 i5. I can swipe in from the right side of the screen to access the charms menu replacement that Windows 10 uses, but not from the type cover touch pad. What's odd is that when I first upgraded to W10 I could, but then one
 of the updates after the upgrade (I think one was a Hardware or Firmware update) prompted a reboot and the touchpad swipe action stopped working.</p>
<p>

It does meet the requirements because I can use the trackpad for the new gestures of windows 10, but not the old edge swipe gestures. All drivers are up to date. Not sure what to do at this point.

            Anyone else have any ideas? I've come to the conclusion that this swipe in feature is just not in the version of windows 10 that I have.&nbsp;

<p>AGH so *** irritating.... thanks for the post Bootle, but whenever i try to hit "change persona" it brings me to a page that says "select a default persona" and it has my EA name thing i created, but it also says " add persona" but when i click on that it
 redirects me to my account management page and just loops me in a god forsaken circle</p>

<p>I linked mine by playing tiger woods, I think (It was many moons ago lol ). You need the EA account to upload shots to EA etc. Its done from the xbox.
</p>
<p>Try that if you can . </p>
<p>I had a look at other forums and this is a pretty big issue with very little on how to solve it. I would take seededdevils advice and call them and hold for a customer service person. It may save you a lot of frustration.

    <title>Shared memory issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travispostell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared memory issue</h2>
                    <p>First, some system specs - AMD FX 8320 CPU, Kingston HyperX Blue 4x4GB 1333 RAM, MSI 970A-G46 Mobo, Windows 10, Sandisk 960GB SSD, Radeon 7750 for apps, Geforce 960 4GB for games, no onboard video</p>
<p>
</p><p>So about a month ago, I started getting stuttering problems on some of my games. Ark: Survival Evolved, for instance, nearly locks up just to turn my survivor around. On another display, I keep Chrome open with Facebook and it stops responding. The other
 night, I decided to take a look at my performance tab of Task Manager and it shows 16.0GB of RAM but has an 8.0GB ceiling (running at 667MHz) and of that, I'm using about 6.9GB of it with Ark running. I look at System Properties and sure enough it says 16.0GB
 (7.95GB Usable). So I think "Okay, my system is running in single channel mode, maybe I forgot to change that after my previous CPU (which had memory controller issues) died and I got this new 8320" See.. my previous CPU was an 8300 as well and it would run
 backwards - single channel config would push dual channel mode and vice versa. So, I pull my RAM sticks, change their ordering (twice) and no change. BIOS sees all 16384MB and says it's running at 1333MHz. So I return to Windows and check DXDiag and there's
 where I saw it. 4.0GB shared towards my Radeon video card and 4.0GB shared with my Geforce. My BIOS has no options for sharing, it doesn't even have an "advanced chipset configuration" section, though I'm able to see timings and OC settings. Everything is
 at defaults and "auto" So I'm assuming that's where half my RAM went, how do I fix it? MSConfig also isn't set with a maximum memory size. Is there a way to get my RAM back? If I didn't already have so much going on, I'd just go put together a Ryzen 7 setup
 and be done with it but I can't put that option on the table yet.</p>

<p>Hi Travis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, this problem might be caused by incorrect settings on BIOS. We recommend contacting your system board manufacturer for assistance on how to check or configure the correct settings on BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to post your query anytime.</p>

            I was looking over my BIOS carefully 2-3 times and I can see and edit OC settings like timing and speed, but there's no sharing options or info anywhere. But I was under the same impression.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought this game in German language, but when I try to play it starts in French. How can I change the language for this particular game?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Manuel</p>

<p>It looks like you have ended up with the wrong copy of the game, if you specifically brought the German Language Version and have ended up with the French version you will have to contact the seller and request an exchange, as the language settings cannot
 be changed in game.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

 and welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you specify the Skype version you are using? <em>(Not newest or latest but the exact version you are using.)&nbsp;</em>Before we engage in further troubleshooting the issue, please make sure that:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You are using the latest version of Skype for Windows 10 <strong>v.11.19.805.&nbsp;</strong>Users who are using outdated Skype versions and platforms might experience issues with calling, messaging, signing in or the over-all performance of the app. Make sure
 to update the app whenever possible. Update your application through the <strong>
Windows Store</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You are not signed in to multiple devices at once. We do not recommend users to be signed in to more than one device at the same time as the calls might get misrouted on a device the user isn't currently using. Sign out from other devices and sign in to
 a device where you wish to receive the call.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your notification settings are enabled. Make sure that you enable your notification settings within the app and from the device itself since Skype for Windows 10 uses your device's native settings.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check your privacy settings. If you are expecting calls from non-Skype contacts. enable calls from anyone on your application settings.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You are signed in to the correct account. Although this one may seem to be obvious, some users tend to overlook this. If you have multiple Skype accounts, make sure that you sign in using the account you wish your friends to contact to.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have an updated application and settings are properly set, please let us know so we can check further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using version 11.19.856 of Skype, using the correct account, and have all notification settings on for all apps, including skype (I checked). I also made sure to be only logged onto one device, and I'm still having issues. I have had these problems&nbsp;ever
 since I installed the skype app from the windows store. It has also come to my attention that even when I got to my friends chat when I know I should be receiving&nbsp;a call, it doesn't show them calling me, just the messages. The call button on the top right
 is also grayed out until they hang up, then I am able to call them. When I call them, everything works fine and they can answer. The app on my phone (which I'm logged out of when not using) works perfectly fine. I can receive calls and call others with no
 issues.&nbsp;</p>
