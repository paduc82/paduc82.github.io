<h2>            Are out of date Trusted root certificates required to use XP mode &#47; compatibility mode on my Windows 7 computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For example I have two&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/293781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PKI certificates</a>&nbsp;that are
<em>necessary and trusted by Windows XP</em>, however they are <em>absent </em>from Trusted list in Windows 7:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df478646-0a2c-434b-8d8e-71b6cbcf2204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df478646-0a2c-434b-8d8e-71b6cbcf2204" /></a></p>
<p>Why are these certificates on a Windows 7 machine? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it the Administrator's responsibility to remove certificates that have exceeded their expiration date?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would that in turn limit backward comparability? Would removal of expired certificates limit the functionality of the operating system's compatibility modes?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do we update the controller&#63; NO USB Cable comes with Xbox One. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twigleaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do we update the controller&#63;  NO USB Cable comes with Xbox One.</h2>
                    
<p>Simple question. &nbsp; I am not 100% sure, but under Settings- system- there is an option now to update the controller firmware. &nbsp;So, I talked to an Ambassador, and they told me, when Titanfall comes out, the controller update will be needed.?? &nbsp;He/She may be
 wrong, as I don't know where ambassadors get their information. &nbsp;However, the MAJOR problem remains. &nbsp; At some point, we are going to have to update our XBOX One Controllers, and we cannot do it if Microsoft did not supply the cable which is required. &nbsp; I
 do understand its a simple micro USB cable, probably $5, but this has the potential to bottleneck a lot of people who do not have the cable.</p>
<p>Now, my XBOX day one edition did not come with any micro USB cable, and I do not know if any later editions did or did not. &nbsp;I think a cable comes with the charge kit, but I am not buying an overpriced charge kit.</p>
<p>If it comes down to where people cannot use their controllers without a firmware update, simply because Microsoft was cheap on not putting the cable in the XBOX One package, it may make a few people upset. &nbsp; Microsoft needs to implement a free micro-USB
 cable program or something. &nbsp;At some point, we are going to HAVE to update these controllers, even if right now, its just for the headset. &nbsp;I remember there was a similar program with the 360 and transfer kit.</p>
<p>Official Support told me to go out and buy a cable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well actually I have 4 different USB/Micro USB cable and none of them fit....in fact I came to forums in hope of finding an answer myself....surely not expected to buy the play and charge just for the cable...in my case all 4 of my cables were exact same
 size and all 4 of them were too large on the micro end for the controller....so it is a valid question I still don't have an answer too....actually now I think about it the wife found 2 on her own...so that makes 6 of these I have in my house that are all
 identical and none fit....whats the deal anybody? Tnx in advance for any help..</p>

<p>Hi there notyourbrodude you will likely have to purchase a charge and play kit from gamestop or see if xbox has one you can purchase or like previously mentioned look on ebay. That ambassador is correct the controller update does coincide with titanfall
 as well as lets you use third party headsets with your controller.</p>

<p>Most all current cell phones and tablets come with micro USB cords for power and charging. Of course apple products are a different story. Anyways..... You can just buy a micro USB cord from Target, Walmart, Radio Shack, etc..... for pretty cheap.</p>

<p>What I have read, the controller update for Titanfall is done by, just sync the controller to Xbox one(over air). &nbsp;This only updates the right stick on the controller, and this update was put out, before Titanfall open beta. &nbsp;You need an cable to update
 the controller, to used the Headset Adapter, and if you buy the adapter, it's comes with an small cable. An Micro USB cable is used for many things now, Phone, Kindle, etc..</p>

<p>Thank you Willapus, as that explanation may make the most sense. &nbsp;I have been playing the Titanfall beta, and if it was already needed, then I don't need to worry. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am not sure people have noticed that there are different kinds of these micro USB cables. &nbsp;The first person who responded, seemed a bit arrogant about the cable issue. &nbsp; I have 2 micro USB cables, and neither of them fit the port on the controller. &nbsp;One
 end is obviously standard USB 4 pin, but the other end seems to be manufacturer specific. &nbsp; &nbsp;And no, I don't own any &nbsp;i(apple) products, whatever you meant by isheep.</p>
<p>There is also a Sticky that was put up in the Dashboard Preview Forum, about the fact that cables are not able to properly carry the data to update the controller, so you are taking a chance at buying one that is not from Microsoft.</p>
<p>" &nbsp;Our developers are investigating the reports of controllers failing to update their firmware when connected with various types of micro-USB cables. Here are some troubleshooting steps that they recommend in the meantime to see if your cable will work:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Remove the batteries from your controller.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Plug the controller into your console via your micro-USB cable.</p>
<p>a) If the controller lights up you should be good to go.</p>
<p>b) If the controller’s light is initially off but pressing the controller's Xbox button powers it on and you are able to navigate with it, then there is a problem with the data connection of your micro-USB cable (or possibly the connection on the controller
 itself).</p>
<p>c) If the controller cannot be turned on by pressing the nexus then the controller is not receiving power via the micro-USB cable.</p>

<p>For anyone that needs to know the Turtle beach XO7's that I got yesterday COMES with the cable you need...there are a couple stickers everywhere and including a prompt that you have to have the update...TB knew it and included the correct cable...and the
 sound is far beyond the X42's as far as quality and the volume, anyway the cable might come with any headset or even with just the adaptor I don't know, but did come with these. You cant update over the air...as I also called support before I knew the cable
 came with headphones and was told same...got to have the cable, good weekend to all of you.</p>

<p>About updating controller, To use the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter with your Xbox One Console, you’ll need to update your Xbox One Controller with the latest software to support the Adapter.</p>
<p>This is from: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter</a> </p>
<p>So Titanfall controller update is done by over air, no cable, (February update) and Stereo Headset Adapter controller update you need an cable, which comes with the adapter (March update).</p>

<p>El código de 48 horas sirve sólo para jugar online dos días (48 hs.), eso no quiere decir que te haga gold. Según tengo entendido no podrás acceder a los beneficios del gold, como lo es Youtube.</p>
<p>Entonces lo que puedes hacer en este tiempo es jugar online y nada más. Saludos !</p>

<h3> blg red monster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ark survival evolved preview program question</h2>
                    
<p>While browsing the web for Ark's release date I noticed that it will be available with the preview program but that made me wonder which one because I'm not a member of the xbox preview program that gives early access to console updates but in games coming
 soon there is a game called Sheltered and it has a (Game Preview) tag so does that mean everyone on xbox one can preview Ark or only preview program members</p>

<p>2 types of Servers that you can join or create.</p>
<p>Dedicated server. &nbsp;The world is persistent and continues to exist even when you are not there. If you select this then the settings will probably allow for close proximity voice chat. &nbsp;i.e. get within a certain distance of people and if they have a mic you
 will hear them and they will hear you.</p>
<p>Remember that being in a Party Chat means you can't hear game chat and the other way around.</p>
<p>Non-dedicated multiplayer hosting server.</p>
<p>This is when you host a game or join your friends game. &nbsp;The game only happens when the host is there but everyone's stuff saves. &nbsp;So if you got to level 5 in your buddies game and he logs off, it kicks you out of the game... but when he invites you back
 or you rejoin... you are level 5 again with all your stuff still.</p>

    <title>Volume is stuck all the way down on my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Volume is stuck all the way down on my laptop</h2>
                    I was using my computer normally, but when I turned the volume down it started to go down all the way. The Volume level indicator is also stuck on my screen. When I try to turn the volume up via the slider on the volume controls the slider just slides
 back down on it's own. I can't seem to mute it either. If it helps I have an Acer aspire 5552 laptop and I am running windows 7.

<h3> sco420666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Download speed not accurate</h2>
                    <p>So I recently needed to update/reinstall a few games here recently and I noticed something I couldn't quite explain with my download speeds. &nbsp;</p><p>The issue is, when updating a game it brings up a tile with your download speed, % of download finished, and hard numbers as to what's already been downloaded. Now, normally you would assume that if it says your download speed is 30+ Mb/s, that in 10 seconds, you would download 300 Mb worth of data, and in about 33 seconds, one Gb.<br />Why then is it that a 5.29 Gb update isn't done in under three minutes? It was taking roughly 70 seconds to download the same amount that should be downloaded in 10 (0.3Gb)<br />In the end, the download wound up taking about 45 minutes to an hour to finish, when by raw numbers it should have been done in under 5.<br />Not that this is an issue to me anymore at this point, being that my updating is done for the next couple weeks, but it seems strange that there is such an obvious discrepancy here, especi

<p>Just trying to figure out if someone understands the reasoning behind this, any input would be great, Thanks!</p><p />

<h3> leonardgrosso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro downgrade on HP OEM build &#40;how to&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just received a refurb HP Laptop with Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; This PC was chosen partly because Microsoft.com states that Windows 10 Pro includes downgrade rights to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Now I have the PC and it suddenly is rather challenging and convoluted to actually execute that included downgrade.</p>
<p>I would like to downgrade using the installed Windows 10 OS as opposed to buying a new (old) Windows 7 copy and installing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With simplicity in mind, how may I accomplish this?&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC needs to fit into an organization that is still thriving on Win7 without IT support staff onboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi Marcio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the forums today. I understand you're trying to purchase a power supply for the Original Xbox One. Unfortunately, we no longer have them in stock through our Microsoft Store. I would suggest to check online or through third party
 stores (For Example: GameStop, Amazon, BestBuy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience, hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If that doesn't help, then it maybe worth updating your AV package and running a full scan. It won't take that long and
<em>may</em> find and remove some malware. There have been a few reports I've read of malware possibly causing this kind of effect.</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that, still issue is persisting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you answer a few question.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Did your computer come with Windows 7 preinstall or you upgraded your computer?<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Did you make any changes prior to this issue?<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Are you getting any specific error while connecting to home network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might occur if you have&nbsp; selected the checkbox beside the option "Treat all future networks that I connect to as public, and don’t ask me again" in Control Panel-&gt;Network and Sharing Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the steps below to delete network profiles from Windows 7:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong>Open the Network and Sharing Center by clicking Start, type Network and Sharing Center and press Enter.<br />
<strong>2</strong>.Below where it says View your active networks, click on the picture (Globe, Building, Bench, House, etc.)<br />
<strong>3.</strong>Move the Set Network Properties window out of the way, but leave it open. (You'll need it in a minute, but at a time when it's otherwise inaccessible.)<br />
<strong>4.</strong>Back on the Network and Sharing Center page, click the Change adapter settings link (in the left
<br />
pane).<br />
<strong>5</strong>.In the Network Connections window, highlight the network adapter through which you get your Internet.
<br />
<strong>6.</strong>Click the Disable this network device button above. Wait a couple of seconds for the connection to reflect the change by turning grey.<br />
<strong>7.</strong>Return to the Set Network Location window you opened in step #2, and click the Merge or delete network locations link at the bottom.<br />
<strong>8.</strong>Highlight the entries you wish to remove and then click Delete. (If there's more than one, you can delete them all)<br />
<strong>9.</strong>When you're done, close the Merge or Delete Network Locations window and then close the Set Network Properties window.<br />
<strong>10</strong>.Return to the Network Connections window, and with the disabled network adapter still highlighted from step #5, click the Enable this network device button
<br />
<strong>11.</strong>After a 10-15 second delay, your Internet should now be working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've removed the network, you should be able to choose a new network <br />
type.</p>
<p><br />
If issue persists, please get back to us.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft LifeCam Studio enables you to control most of the settings of your webcam. However, while the camera is on, the only controls are
<strong>Exposure</strong> and <strong>Timer</strong>, The webcam adjusts its focus automatically by default, but if you opt to change the settings, you can take control of the device and adjust it manually.</p>
<p>To do that, follow these easy steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the Microsoft LifeCam software and click the arrow at the right of the LifeCam window to open the dashboard.</li><li>Click the "Gear" icon to switch to the Settings tab and disable "Truecolor" by clearing its check box.</li><li>Click the "Properties" button to view the webcam's advanced settings.</li><li>Click the "Camera Control" tab, deselect the "Auto" option next to "Focus" and click "Apply."</li><li>Move the "Focus" slider to change the focus of your LifeCam manually. Moving the slider to the right makes the camera focus on objects that are closer to its lens, while moving the slider to the left forces the camera to focus on objects that are farther
 away.</li><li>Click "OK" to apply the new settings and close the Properties window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the focus controls are only available on some LifeCam models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other concerns, just send us a reply.</p>

<h2>            How to check if my router UPnP is working</h2>
                    <p>My router (Asus TM-AC1900) supports UPnP, but I'm afraid it's not working properly because I use some programs (or devices like XBox) that are supposed to open ports but they're not being opened. I want to debug this further so having a tool that can manually
 open ports using UPnP would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These programs used to work well when I had a Time Capsule as a router.</p>

    <title>Error device installation not complete with HP All-in One printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error device installation  not complete with HP All-in One printer</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 7 reports that my PC needs troubleshooting, that it is missing a driver for my printer, but cannot install it. Could this be related to Babylon malware?</p>
<p>Windows 7 reports that my HP laptop needs troubleshooting, that it is missing a driver for my HP All-in-One printer.&nbsp; I can print fine to my HP printer over my home network, but something is wrong.&nbsp; HP Solutions Center software will not open, reporting that
 "my device installation is not complete". Windows troubleshooter downloads the HP software drivers, which report that my software is already installed, giving me two choices, Uninstall, or Add Device.&nbsp; I tried Unistalling and re-installing everything -- no
 change.&nbsp; I tried Add Device.&nbsp; It finds the IP address of my printer, then reports that it cannot connect to the printer, asks me if I want to continue with the driver installation and connect later.&nbsp; I click Next and.... the software disappears.&nbsp; I am in limbo
 land.&nbsp; Something is wrong and I am out of ideas.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a new PC for me, I've had it less than a month.&nbsp; The HP software used to work fine.&nbsp; Then I had to remove some malware (Babylon.exe) from IE 8, which involved using RegEdit to remove all instance of "Bablyon" from my registry. At this point IE 8
 stopped functioning correctly, throwing a Visual C++ runtime error after every IE session in which I opened a new tab (this is where Babylon would assert itself, replacing Bing as my default search engine). I spoke to Microsoft support, who told me I couldn't
 re-install IE 8, which came with my HP laptop, but suggested I install IE 9, which I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime after this, I discovered these catch-22 problems with the HP printer driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is text from the HP Solutions Center:</p>
<p>HP Solution Center cannot run because your device installation is not complete.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please plug in the USB cable or re-run the setup program from the installation CD for a network installation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this does not complete the installation, or you do not have the CD, access the HP help files by clicking the Start menu.</p>
<p>Here is the text from the HP All-In-One Driver Software Installer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printer setup has failed to complete.<span>&nbsp; </span>Click Retry to try installing the printer again or click Next to continue installation without connecting to the printer now, I will connect later.</p>

    <title>Is there a way to get a count of how many windows are open&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h0mely  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to get a count of how many windows are open&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Thank you very much for looking.&nbsp; Very simply, I am having an issue where there I&nbsp;go to a site and run a stored procedure that opens up a web page for each record that meet a certain criteria.&nbsp; The individual web page runs a process that updates that record.&nbsp;
 Right now the total number records that should be getting updated is about 170 (so start the procedure and it should oprn 170 unique web pages in seperate browser windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't write the procedure so I cannot say for sure how it works or why it was done that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the stored procedure isn't completing on several people's pcs...it seems to be updating around 75-100 records and&nbsp; then stopping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are all on Windows 7 Pro 64 Bit with I5 processors and most with 4 GB RAM (I have 8) running ie8 and 9.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have 2 questions...the first is...is there something that limits the number of windows that can be open and how can it be tweaked?&nbsp; Why can one person run the procedure with no isues and most everyone else can't?&nbsp; What should I be looking at to explain
 their difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question two is I would like to see how many windows actually open up (get a count)...I can go to the Task Managare and see the windows but it won't give me a count and&nbsp; there are too many windows for the screen.&nbsp; Is there&nbsp; ados command that I can run from
 teh command prompt?&nbsp; A cheap application that I could build (would need code) or is one already created?&nbsp; Is there a utility that I just don't know of?&nbsp; I guess I am curious if I can help identify where the process is falling down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANY suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!&nbsp; Thank you again for looking</p>
<p>
</p><p>-John</p>

</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Create an Image Backup (see the end of my reply) before you start the Windows 7 or 8.1 roll back process/ , should something go wrong this will allow you recover Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you rollback to Windows 8.0 you should upgrade to Windows 8.1, apply all Windows Updates including IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try the following method to upgrade to Windows 10:</p>
<p>Disconnect all unnecessary devices (USB Thumb drives, Media cards, Etc.) just have the keyboard and mouse. Install the latest Grahics driver update. Disable your Anti-Virus software. Restart the computer and try again</p>

<p>If you still can't start the installation then start by creating an Image Backup of your current version of Windows and then use the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool:

<span>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When you click on the above link, please read the instructions carefully.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>"<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> To upgrade for free, select <strong>Upgrade this PC now</strong> in the tool. You should NOT be asked for a product key during the upgrade process. If you create a USB and use it to install, make sure to remove the USB as soon
 as setup begins. If you don't, you may be prompted for a product key. If this happens, remove the USB and restart your PC to continue with setup.
</p>
<p>Will you be running the tool from a 32 bit or a 64 bit device? Download the version for the device that will run the tool."</p>

<p><strong>You can also download the Windows 10 ISO file(s) version 1511 from Microsoft's Tech Bench:

    <title>Problema perdita pacchetti troppo alta - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonnieboss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema perdita pacchetti troppo alta</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao a tutti</p>
<p>scrivo perchè ieri sera mi è successa una cosa mai capitata prima.</p>
<p>Premetto che ho xbox one collegata ai powerline; poichè la casa è su più piani, il router si trova al piano superiore e la xbox al piano terra; ho colelgato un powerline al router tramite cavo ethernet e l'altro all'xbox; sono 4-5
 mesi che gioco così e non ho mai avuto problemi, a parte &nbsp;il fatto che in call of duty ghosts mi trova poche partite, tipo 3-4 ma per il resto non ho problemi di lag o di perdita di connessione.</p>
<p>Ieri sera invece, accendendo la xbox notai che non riuscivo nè ad accedere al mio account nè a giocare a cod, sia perchè non trovava partite sia perchè quando le trovava laggava di brutto.</p>
<p>Ho fatto il test di connessione multyplayer e c'è scritto che ho una perdita pacchetti alta, facendo il test di connessione ho visto che la perdita è del 25-26% quindi in effetti altissima e un ping di 250ms.</p>
<p>Ora voglio capire a cosa può essere dovuto il problema; possono essere i powerline?Anche se fino a ieri pomeriggio ho giocato benissimo?!</p>
<p>La connessione di casa ieri andava bene, come al solito download 7 mega, upload 0,40 e ping 55ms.</p>
<p>Grazie mille</p>

<p>A NAT come stai?</p>
<p>Coi pacchetti persi non credo c'entri, ma di sicuro c'entra con le poche partite trovate.</p>
<p>(Down, up e ping sono decenti, per quanto non ottimali diciamo).</p>

                    <p>I have a Nextbook Flexx 10 running windows 10.&nbsp; The battery icon is missing and greyed out in "turn system icons on or off."&nbsp; When&nbsp;I go to the device manager, the Microsoft ACPI-compliant control method battery that should be there is not.&nbsp; I have scanned
 for hardware updates and found none, gone to Nextbook's website to find updates and found none, and downloaded Intel's Driver &amp; Support assistant which scanned my computer and said there were no updates available.&nbsp; WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND ONE DRIVER TO DOWNLOAD?&nbsp;
 Can somebody please tell me where I can find the driver download for the Microsoft ACPI-compliant control method battery for the Nextbook Flexx 10 running windows 10?</p>

            Nextbook is a cheap crappy brand of computers that are pretty much disposable junk you should expect to fail within the first month of use. Its a snake oil brand. You should should consider disposing of it and save up some money and purchase a decent brand laptop or tablet from HP, Lenovo, Dell. If you can't afford one thats Windows 10 based, consider a Android based device.

            Yeah, its not technically help ful, but neither does seeking help in a software forum. Its obvious this is a hardware issue, so they best point for help is actually Nextbook Support.

<br />
<br />Hopefully they can provide some insight into what might be the issue with your device. If they try spin this and say you should contact Windows or Microsoft Support, tell them you have already tried and Microsoft Experts have thoroughly investigated the problem and determined they have a defective product and they need to either have it resolved, replaced or exchanged for a working product.
<br />
<br />If they don't want to help, then its obvious you bought lemon.

<p>If you purchase a csv (currency stored value) ppc, which is added to your Microsoft account, you can then purchase games, add-ons, etc. without adding a credit card to your account. &nbsp;However, you CAN NOT purchase an xbox live subscription with a csv ppc.
 &nbsp;You MUST purchase an Xbox live ppc to add a 1-month, 3-month, or 12-month subscription.</p>

<h2>            Saving Skype Chat History&#63; Please help me... &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    I'm sorry to be making a thread about something so basic, but I'm running out of time as I'm still running&nbsp;Skype version 7.41 and it'll stop working very soon! :(<br />
<br />
One thing I love about Skype version 7.41 is that I can go all the way back to the beginning of when I first met a contact and see the chat history of everything we've ever written to each other.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can I still keep my chat history in the most recent version of Skype???&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was told that Skype version 8 only saves a few months of Skype chat history?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I really want to be able to save all of my chat logs with all of my Skype contacts.<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            1. Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.
<br />
<br />2. For v 8 - You must go through the in-client upgrade process to preserve all of your conversation history.  After the upgrade process you will be able to access a portion of history from within your new Skype client.  Additional history will be transferred to a local file on your machine that you can use to search and view history outside of Skype.  To find that history file:
<br />
<br />    Select Tools from the top tool bar. 
<br />    Select Export chat history from Skype. 
<br />    Follow the steps in the wizard.
