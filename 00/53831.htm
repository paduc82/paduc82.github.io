<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer depends on what kind of item you want to pin.&nbsp; Since the only kind of item you mentioned was a folder, you can easily do what you're asking about now and needn't wait for a later build.<br />
</p>
<p>In the Windows 8 desktop, when you drag an executable file (or shortcut) onto the taskbar, a message pops up that says "Pin to Taskbar."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you drag a document file (or shortcut), the message will say "Pin to [associated application]" - in other words, "Pin to [default browser name]" for an html file, "Pin to Notepad" for a txt file, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a folder, File Explorer is the associated application.&nbsp; Therefore, if you open a File Explorer window,&nbsp;locate the&nbsp;desired folder, and&nbsp;drag it to the Taskbar, the message that pops up says "Pin to File Explorer."&nbsp; Just click on that, and it will appear
 in the FE jumplist, above the Frequent Places, in a separate section called "Pinned."&nbsp; You can drag things up and down there to order them as you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(The Control Panel, though it is displayed in FE as a "System Folder,"&nbsp;will only let you pin it to the desktop, not to the FE jumplist.&nbsp; There may be some other special cases like that; I don't know, but it generally works like I described, including for
 other System Folders.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I'm a new Windows 8 user, very far from expert.&nbsp; I only know how this works&nbsp;because I learned it by trial and error today.&nbsp; So there may be more to it that I can't help with.</p>

    <title>Issues with Wacom Driver and Sculpt Mobile Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> staceyfish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Wacom Driver and Sculpt Mobile Mouse</h2>
                    I seem to be having connectivity issues when I have the Wacom Driver for the Surface Pro 2 installed and trying to use my Microsoft Sculpt Mobile mouse. As soon as I install the driver, the mouse stops being recognized by the tablet completely. Disabling
 the driver doesn't change anything either, I have to completely uninstall the driver to get the mouse to work again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I noticed that in my Device Manager, I have two 'HID - Compliant Mouse' devices under the 'Mice and other pointing devices' category. One is connected with Wacom, the other with Microsoft, which I'm guessing is my mouse. I can't use the Mouse and Keyboard
 center because it doesn't even pick up the mouse anymore with this driver installed and it's become very frustrating that I can't switch between using the pen and my mouse at leisure. I could not find a fix anywhere for this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found that the Windows button on the mouse works, however I cannot use it at all to navigate the screen with the pointer. I did discover that if I plugged in a wired mouse, that mouse responds just fine and I can use the mouse pointer... so it seems
 like this is a problem between the FeelIT Wacom driver and the Sculpt Mobile mouse directly, though I have not tried with another wireless receiver mouse to see if it's just a problem with a wireless transceiver in general.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would be nice to know if there is a solution to this or, at least, if Microsoft has a work-around for this so I can use my mouse when I'm on the go.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            All photos have become read only on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 it looks like all of my photos are set to read only and I cannot switch it off. I can right-click a folder of photos and untick Read Only - 'Apply changes to this folder, sub-folder and files'. This tells me I need to 'provide
 Administrator permission to change these attributes', I then click continue, changes appear to have been made. If I then select a photo, click manage along the ribbon and try to rotate the image I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot rotate this image. The file might be in use or open in another program, or the file or folder might be read-only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other windows or apps open and when I right click the photo again to check the properties, it still says read-only!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong?</p>

            <p>it appears there was an issue with upgrades and unlinked your files from the current file owner, this means that although you are the owner, you cannot do anything with the files.</p>
<p>Here's what I suggest</p>
<p>1. Back up your files (you should be doing this already but in case you haven't been, do it)</p>
<p>2. right click on the command icon, select "Run as Administrator"</p>
<p>3. when the window and prompt are ready, run chkdsk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will run for a few minutes, if it reports any errors</p>
<p>1. make sure you files are backed up (I cant stress this enough)</p>
<p>2. run chkdsk /r</p>
<p>3. There will be a message that states the drive is locked and it should ask you if you want to perform scan on next reboot, select yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system restarts, it will begin a scan, go grab some coffee or something, it might take awhile - and at one point it might look like its stuck around 10 - 13 percent... don't worry... if there were a ton of errors reported the first time - it could
 take awhile, maybe and hour to 24 hours... </p>
<p>
</p><p>If there were no errors reported, then</p>
<p>1. right click the parent folder of the files you were trying to access</p>
<p>2. Select properties</p>
<p>3. In the properties dialog, select the security tab</p>
<p>4. select the Advanced button in the lower right corner.</p>
<p>5. when the dialog appears, around the top you will see "owner" with a user name in it, EVEN IF IT IS YOUR USERNAME, click change</p>
<p>6. Another dialog will appear, in the "object name to select" type in your login name and click check name... your name should resolve</p>
<p>7. Click okay</p>
<p>8. There will be a checkbox underneath your name that says something to the effect of "replace owner on sub container and objects", make sure its selected</p>
<p>9. Click okay</p>
<p>10. Click okay again</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That should take care of it</p>
        </p>

<p>My son's xbox 360 profile has been wiped clean.&nbsp; No avatar, no gamerpoints, no achievements.&nbsp; He can't connect to live.&nbsp; Last night it did say there was a problem but now it says he is up and running...xbox.com&nbsp; shows all his points and achievements etc...but
 nothing has changed on the console.&nbsp; It won't let him even save anything he plays.&nbsp; He's only 9 and kind of upset.&nbsp; How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Delete his profile from the xbox, to do this simply go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Hard Drive&gt;Gamer Profiles then hit A and select Delete then

<p>Deleting his profile from the console isn't deleting his profile altogether. &nbsp;Think of it like a cloud system. &nbsp;Once you delete the profile, everything is still saved on the "cloud" like points, membership and everything you see on xbox.com. &nbsp;When you redownload
 the profile, everything will be there. &nbsp;It's the same thing as if you were going to download your profile at a friend's house. &nbsp;People do it al the time, no worries!

<p>Its nothing but virus has edited your userinit file and for this you will not able to log in even as in safe mode.</p>
<p>there are 2 -3 ways to fix it.</p>
<p>First - Log in to Recovery console using XP CD once you come to command prompt then just copy the userinit.exe from C:\WINDOWS\system32\dllcache and paste it inside C:\WINDOWS\system32</p>
<p>use this command - C:\WINDOWS\system32\dllcache&gt;copy userinit.exe c:\windows\system32</p>
<p>then restart the machine.</p>
<p>It will solve your problem</p>

            The other way is to take out your harddisk and then find updated Anti-Virus and then run scan on your harddisk , the virus should detect and resolve your problem.

<h2>            Canoscan LIDE 50 - no Drivers exist for Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
I use Windows 7 64 bit and a Canoscan LIDE 50 scanner. Canon did not create scanners for this device in Windows 7, however back when I first purchased this computer I was able to get around this issue by insalling the drivers for the next model, LIDE 60 with
 the scanning software for the LIDE 50.&nbsp; I recently got a bad virus that forced me to totally wipe my harddrive, and now I can't seem to install this scanner with the method I used before. Can anyone help me around this? Thanks!<br />

    <title>Reset Taskbar to Default Settings on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cvrran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset Taskbar to Default Settings on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Taskbar is suddenly staying on my screen when I go full-screen whilst watching a YouTube video, etc. In hopes of fixing the issue, I would like to know the default settings for the Taskbar, as there does not seem to be a, "reset to default settings" (or
 I just couldn't find it) button or something of the sort (I am also certain I have changed some settings but I don't know which one could possibly be causing this to happen). I did see a thread answering a question similar to this one but it did not quite
 fix the issue I am having, and if this question has been answered already, I apologize as this is the first time I have used this service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have a 7 year old boy that would love to have a friend to play minecraft with. I will send her a request. Please pay no attention to the games like Call of duty that are listed under his gamer tag, his dad plays offline games and we didn't realize that
 everytime he played, it was adding those games to our 7 year olds gamer tag. He only plays the lego games, minecraft, fortresscraft, and a few more.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 64 bit &#58;&#58; irql_not_less_or_equal when connecting with bluetooth device</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new bluetooth adapter (ASUS BT400) and a bluetooth loudspeaker (HK Onyx Studio).&nbsp;The PC is a Dell Studio XPS 7100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The adapter is working, however, when I try to connect to the loudspeaker, I get a blue screen and the IRQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here are the&nbsp;<a href="http://1drv.ms/1XoLMsF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="DMP files on cloud">DMP files</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Story: </p>
<p>- I first used the loudspeaker with my phone to make sure it works before I try with the new USB bluetooth adapter for my PC</p>
<p>- I successfully (!) used the loudspeaker with my Windows 10 PC and bluetooth adapter for a few minutes</p>
<p>- the sound stopped without an error message</p>
<p>- I tried re-installing the USB-bluetooth adapter using the DVD, however the installation process stopped progressing and after 90 minutes I restarted the computer while this installation program was running.</p>
<p>- at this point the loudspeaker wouldn't show up in the bluetooth device list anymore (it's the only active bluetooth device I have)</p>
<p>- I de-installed all drivers, unplugged and replugged the adapter and had windows 10 re-install the driver</p>
<p>- now the device appears in the list and I can pair it, but when I connect to it, the PC attempts to update some settings and that's when I get the blue screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much,</p>
<p>

            <p>It appears to be working, now. I uninstalled everything related to Bluetooth and bought PC Mechanic (I hope that's a software one can trust) and cleaned up whatever it wanted to. Then I re-installed the bluetooth adapter software from DVD, and finally upgraded
 it with this version:<br />
<strong>WIDCOMM® Bluetooth Windows® Software&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">https://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I recollect correctly it asks you to restart the computer, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then connected to the speaker and the system began updating some settings. This took hours. In fact I just left it overnight and then some. All of the sudden I heard the 'connection established' sound coming from the speaker. Just as before, it only worked
 a few minutes and then stopped. It looked like it was still transmitting but the speaker was quiet. I then restarted the computer for an unrelated reason and now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fun fact: the driver&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">btwavdt.sys that seemed to be the problem (see below) was NOT updated. Instead the device (Bluetooth Hands-free Audio) now states that no driver files were necessary
 for this loudspeaker.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>Are you facing any issues with the computer or the USB recovery stick?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A recovery partition is a section of a hard drive which is hidden and set aside for an up-to-date backup of your operating system. If your operating system fails, you can recover a working copy from the partition. The backup contains all of your system
 settings and updates intact, allowing you to immediately use the backup upon restoration to access your system programs and data. This recovery partition is created by the computer manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That Recovery Partition was imaged on your Hard Drive by your Computer Manufacturer when your machine was built at the Factory.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You cannot recreate a hidden recovery partition on the hard drive. If you have deleted the partition to gain some space on the hard drive then it is gone for good. You may contact the computer manufacturer with this question and they might be able
 to help you further.</span></p>

                    I recently upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1.&nbsp; Ever since the upgrade was completed, the command prompt box flashes on the screen every 30-45 seconds but is gone too fast for me to see what it says.&nbsp; I have installed all available updates, and scanned
 for malware/viruses repeatedly and found nothing.&nbsp; Is there some setting to prevents this from happening because it often freezes or lags whatever program I am running at the time.

            Thank you for replying. I should have said that none of the functions associated with the shutdown key are available. The only way for the last 8 days to switch off the computer is to hold down the pwer button on the desktop until it switches off. Having
 said that, the computer starts correctly each time without any error messages.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Issues with device drivers and/or programs running can be the possible reasons why this issue occurs. For us to isolate your concern, we would like to ask for the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes or updates installed on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li></ul>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to my earlier reply, after reinstalling default windows 10 apps I could restart the computer, but it would still not shut down until I switched off fast start up as you advised. It has shut down on 4 occasions without any problems since I unchecked
 fast start up. Many thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p><br />
Hello <br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>Is the Installer service started and set to manual?</p>
<p>(A). Set the computer to clean boot and try to install.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Clean boot will stop any
 interference with other third party software on the computer.<br />
Steps to perform clean boot:<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
Reset the computer to start as usual<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
(B). Stop the Window Management Instrumentation service and try to install the software.<br />
<br />
(C). Set the service to default after testing.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps<br />
Thanks and regards<br />

    <title>Start menu apps and tiles greyed out and underlined in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Start menu apps and tiles greyed out and underlined in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently i have been trying to personalize my start menu, and because there is no way to reset the most used list, I did a trick where I made a new account on my pc, and copied the vedatamodel.edb in the folder "tiledatalayer' and pasted it onto my admin
 account. This did reset the most used list so the trick worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But ever since then, certain apps on the start menu will grey out and underline when I click them. This is kinda irritating since it makes the start menu look messy, and I have searched everywhere but I couldn't find any fixes online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Thane,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to uninstalled apps updates, corrupted or missing apps files and folders or the user profile is corrupted on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, are you facing the above issue on the new user account?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Check if you have any pending updates to be downloaded and installed on the computer. To check
 and install the pending updates, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>Windows Store</strong> and click on the user profile name located at the top right of the window.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Downloads and updates</strong> from the options.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Check for updates</strong> from the window and check if you have any pending updates to be installed.</span></li><li><span>After the pending updates are installed, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, run
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to
 check if any of the app files and folders are missing or corrupted on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, <strong>
Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of greyed out app tiles on the computer in the same post for further assistance.

            The scans couldn't detect anything regarding the start menu, but the windows store offered new updates for apps and after updating them, those certain apps started to become normal and did not leave grey tiles/underlines anymore. All the other apps that
 leave grey tiles/underlines don't require updates though.
