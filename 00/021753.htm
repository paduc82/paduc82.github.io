<h2>            Mail merge in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>In an earlier version of Word, I have created many mail-merge documents by creating the basic document as a .dot template file, to which was related a data document in the form of a .tab (tab-separated text) file, and a header document as a regular .doc
 file.&nbsp; I would populate the data document by exporting text from a database, and then create my final document by doing a mail merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I do the equivalent with Word 2016?&nbsp; How do I open up a new document with my prepared template.&nbsp; And how do I assign the data document and header documents to that template?</p>

<p>If you save the mail merge main document after attaching the header document and the data source AND you answer in the affirmative to the SQL warning message that appears when later re-opening the document, the header and data source will still be attached
 to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot imagine why you want to persist with a separate Header document however.</p>

<h2>            8 years of work and now I cannot use Save or Save As.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I can open edit and save any other worksheet as expected but now Excel is fighting me on this extensive and elaborate project.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have invested 8 years of design and coding and now it looks as if it is all trashed unless I go back to a previous version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The problem here is that I have seen all these errors before and figured that Excel actually repaired them.<span>&nbsp; It certainly looked that way so I trusted MS and continued to work on the project.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure that I will have to go back to September 2015 to get what might be a useable version but I wonder if I will get months into the rebuild and Excel will burp again as it has in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to save and get an error.&nbsp; It asks me if I want to repair it.&nbsp; It tells me that I have a recovered worksheet yet it is the same name as the original tagged "Repaired".&nbsp; I open it make a token change. I go to save and all messages cycle again.&nbsp; Recovery
 files show up in the temp folder but none of them are usable as they all claim the same errors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless Excel has an Export/Import operation for all parts of the workbook, I can only imagine that I have to rebuild the entire project by opening a new instance and use copy/paste for all the VBA code, copy the data, and rebuild the spread sheet.&nbsp; One problem
 is that it is not possible to open two totally disconnected instances of Excel and I figure that the cancer will end up in the new project so I will have to find some way to write everything to a file outside of MS then somehow bring it back into a new Workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the error notes suggests to a problem with a drawing.<span>&nbsp; </span>To my knowledge, I do not nor believe that I have ever had one in any project. In the last burp, my buttons were deleted and the graph disappeared.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Maybe there is some magic undisclosed secret trick to fixing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a tight fire wall and all updated scanners for virus, malware, you name it! I have run FixMeStick, MalwareBytes, and nothing was reported so I am figuring that this is a feature within Excel.</p>
<span><br />
<span><br />
I get these three error notifications over and over and over and over and still cannot save any version.</span>

            <p>OK it seems to&nbsp; be working.&nbsp; I copied all of the code from the modules into files then did a copy of the Worksheet into a new project.&nbsp; Recreated the modules and it seems to be working.&nbsp; I stress "seems" as I wonder how soon it will all crash again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was in recreation mode, I used Insert to place two modules.&nbsp; I copied the in the code and saved everything.&nbsp; When I went to reopen the workbook, the modules were gone.&nbsp; I had to create them again.</p>

            Hello. How old is the PDA and what version of Windows Mobile is it running? Unfortunately, no version of Activesync will run on Win 7. You must use WMDC on a Win 7 system:
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931937</a>

<h2>            nokia 6303 mac os x compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just totally disappointed with the mac support of nokia 6303. i decided to take this phone, since i found it simple and having all the features i need. when i came back home and try to synchronize my contacts and calendars with mac (isync) it appeared
 that the phone is not supported! which is an actual game over, since i am not going to work with a phone i can not backup easily. i am not talking about the lack of support for itunes, which in this context is only a small feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here goes the question: is it really OK to sell a phone without a support on mac os x? i have chosen nokia, since i thought that the company is big enough to properly solve the software issues. even the best phone without good software is worth nothing..&nbsp;</p>

            If it's any comfort: according to Nokia, the 6303 is not compatible with any version of PC Suite either. It's simply not listed. But it does work with a recent version, albeit with flaws.

            So again I ask, does anyone know what will happen with this phone? Is it a normal situation by nokia (to release a phone and a year after to come with a software working with this phone). sorry, if i am offensive, but i am really frustrated. i really bought
 the phone i found classic and simple, just to avoid such a problems.. and it seems that taking any no-brand phone would put me in the same position..

            iSync is using Bluetooth to backup all your phone data to your Mac. Check out Syncfony. I think they do all the backups over-the-air. And you can synchronize your personal data on your phone when you are at work with your home computer. Syncfony really
 does not use bluetooth or wifi.&nbsp;

<p>for those interested:</p>
<p>I got my nokia 6303classic to work by copying another nokia plugin for isync and futzing around with all the plist files abit. Don't ask about the details. Will have forgotten it in a few hours. ;-)</p>
<p>Anyhow it seems to work as well as it did under leopard now.</p>

<h2>            Typo in email address, Fix it here not functioning.</h2>
                    <p>I have to verify my email address on my phone and I misspelled it with a B at the end of .com- no Idea how that even happened. When I get to the the screen to verify address and the say "Fix it here." Following the link just says that there is a temporary
 problem and to try again later- this has been going on for quite a long time- few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I just lived with my phone being a phone but after the update I want to take advantage of the new systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm not sure exactly where you are stranded in the setup, so I suggest from a PC log on to your Microsoft account and verify all personal information, especially<br />
<a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage</a></p>
<p>Preferably have two valid email addresses along with the phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, backup pictures and other personal files on the phone and reset from<br />
App list &gt; Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset my phone</p>
<p>Finally, set up the phone fresh on your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary Microsoft account used on the phone can only be altered this way.</p>

            In both versions you can select "Show without animation" in Slide show &gt;&gt; Set up Show<br />
<br />
Slides don't just "default to animation" though!! Maybe there is animation on the slide master which you should be able to remove easily.<br />

            You need to insert a "Section Break" (probably a "next page" break) where you want to start the new page numbering. Then go into the header or footer where the page number is located. Unlink the header/footer from previous one, then reset the page number
 to 1.<br />

    <title>Problem uploading photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherstringer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem uploading photos</h2>
                    <p>I have just done a clean install of Windows 8 Pro on my laptop. Infact I installed a new SSD first so it was a completley blank disk though because the Windows 8 download was an upgrade I had to load Windows 7 first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So onto my problem, I advewrtise on a couple of holiday villa sites which means I have to upload photos for my ad to the sites. I have tried to upload a photo to 2 different sites (different photos) and one simply would not load whilst the second one came
 back with an error:-</p>
<p><b><span>Error : Not possible to save a non gif / jpg file - photo upload using Internet Explorer only</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Record Saved</span></b></p>
<p>The first problem was resolved by the site administrator updating my photo, so the error was not really pursued. whilst on the one with the error message I tried again on my Windows 7/IE9 desktop and the photo uploaded with no problem. (Also proving it was
 a jpg contradicting the error message)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both sites have there own upload procedures built into the site so I did not use any other software to upload the photos and they have been used many times in the past to upload photos with no problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know if the error was caused by Windows 8 itself or IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem or how I can establish what is actually causing the problem in the first place.</p>

            Hi,
<div>As I understand the issue, you are unable to upload photos on a website and receive error message "Error : Not possible to save a non gif / jpg file - photo upload using Internet Explorer only record saved". Please let me know if this is not correct. I
 understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to use compatibility view in Internet Explorer and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Use Compatibility View in Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10</a></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If you are receiving this error when using Internet Explorer, check if add-ons are causing these error messages to appear. Disable add-ons.<br />
<br />
<strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer<br />

            <p>I think this is an IE10 bug that needs fixing. As I said this is a completely new installation and whilst I have add-ins that come along with Microsoft products listed below I have nothing else added.</p>

<p>Out of interest I just downloaded Chrome for W8 and as an easy test if you go to the following page
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.specsavers.co.uk/glasses/mens-glasses/#ct=ismale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.specsavers.co.uk/glasses/mens-glasses/#ct=ismale</a>&nbsp;you will see it is for buying glasses online,e but if you click a TRY ON button on a pair, you can upload
 your own (head face on) photo to try them on. Again I get an error with IE10 but it works fine with Chrome.</p>
<p>So that is now 3 sites I have tried to upload photos on and none work with IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I meant to add that the actual Specsavers site views fine, I don't see any compatibility view button to press presumably because it is not necessary to view the site.</p>

            <p>Same issue on Photobox.co.uk, Mypublisher.com and loads of other sites. The same thing used to happen on Facebook back before Windows 8 was released but the bug report was squashed with a "not able to repro".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using compatibility mode doesn't help either, at least not on any of the sites I've tried using today for ordering some photocards for the holidays. Thanks Microsoft.</p>

            <p>What I cannot understand if this is a bug in IE10, thinking how long they had to check for compatibilities, where is the solution? &nbsp;Chrome does not have the problem and they had a far shorter development time.
</p>
<p>The ability to upload photos is quite an important feature and with all the expertise at hand at Microsoft I cannot understand why I am still having the problem.</p>

<h2>            I need to merge two microsoft accounts, one is outlook, the other is through my college but loads in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I created the outlook.com account recently only because my college email doesn't have the option to create aliases, I can delete the non-college account if needed. I just need a shorter email address that I can use to sign in to my Microsoft account and
 services as well as for receiving and sending emails. I don't know if it matters but my college email is technically an office 365 account.

<p>I was previously linked to this article: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-profile/how-to-merge-2-account-into-one/1ff8a16c-10bd-4b6c-808c-c8532be40d80">

 year for it to be available for use (as an alias) after you deleted the account.

            <p>I have a similar question. You may be familiar with the current MS bug that is preventing Hotmail accounts from being upgraded to Outlook accounts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/sorry-outlookcom-upgrades-arent-available-right/d78719ff-962b-4332-9e9f-45e0b0aebdb5?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-signin/sorry-outlookcom-upgrades-arent-available-right/d78719ff-962b-4332-9e9f-45e0b0aebdb5?page=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So because I could not upgrade my Hotmail account, I created a new Outlook.com account. The new Outlook.com account works just fine, but this has created a Windows 8 problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 users have to log on to Windows 8 using a Microsoft account. My Windows 8 OWNER user uses the old Hotmail account; as a result, the Metro calendar and people apps do not synchronize with the new Outlook.com account data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I basically need to do is: I want to change my Windows 8 OWNER account to use the new Outlook.com account information. And once that is done, I can just delete the old Hotmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not possible, I suppose I could just erase my drive and reinstall Windows 8, this time with the OWNER account set to the new Outlook.com account...seems like a big hassle though.</p>

As a suggestion, maybe it is time that an online tool be made available and easy to use. I am sure there are millions, if not billions of people in similar situations.<br />

            <p>It has been happening with the last version (1511) and this one.&nbsp; When I originally purchased the phone in January, the messaging worked as expected.&nbsp; I have tried rebooting, removing and re-adding the car's Bluetooth, re-adding it in driving mode.&nbsp; I have
 tried all combinations of ignoring calls and texts.&nbsp; This behavior is consistent with both windows phones we have.&nbsp; They are identical and have the same update versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As an aside, I also have trouble with the phone recognizing voice commands from the car, ie, "Read it", "Ignore", "Reply".&nbsp; When dictating a message,&nbsp;after saying reply 5 times, it seems to work well.</p>

            Thanks for the update. We suggest you perform a hard reset on your Windows Phone first. The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings,
 etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. Then, turn on your <strong>backup</strong> under Settings so you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Note that resetting
 your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.
<p>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under Settings:<strong> Settings

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The hard reset operation will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings. Usually it will finish within 30 minutes but can, in some rare cases, take up to a couple of hours. Some older Nokia Lumia
 handsets have a bug where a reset never seems to finish. If that should happen to you, check this

wiki article</a> for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the hard reset, we suggest you set up a driving mode. Please click this

<h2>            Is pop-up &#34;Update Drivers&#34; a legitimate message&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After updating Internet Explorer 5/1,&nbsp; we logged in and a pop-up window appeared,&nbsp; purportedly from Microsoft,&nbsp; saying&nbsp; "Update Drivers".&nbsp; We searched through our Control Panel and Computer ,&nbsp; OS:C,&nbsp; but found no evidence of drivers needing updating.&nbsp; Did
 a thorough security scan, with nothing appearing to be wrong.&nbsp; But are still afraid to click on this pop-up,&nbsp; with all the news about being hacked.&nbsp; Another pop-up appeared,&nbsp; saying "Errors: Window 7)&nbsp; also appearing to be from Microsoft.&nbsp; How can we tell
 if these are legitimate messages?&nbsp; I could not find an answer from Microsoft. </p>
<p>And how can we eliminate these small windows without the possibility of getting a virus?</p>

<h2>            FAQ&#58; OneNote Mobile for iPhone&#47;iPad 1.3</h2>
                    <p>(last edited 12/12/2011, 3:00pm PST)</p>
<p><span><strong>New release 1.3 available on the app store</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A free update to OneNote Mobile for iPhone version 1.3 is now available through the
</span><u><span>iTunes App Store</span></u><span>. If you previously installed OneNote Mobile for iPhone, simply tap the App Store icon on your iPhone and then tap Updates. When the new&nbsp;version appears in the Updates list, tap the OneNote icon, and then tap
 the UPDATE button to install the new version.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A new download is also available for OneNote Mobile for iPad version 1.3 through the iTunes App Store.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a</span><span>n iPad-optimized version of Microsoft OneNote. If you have a previous version of OneNote for iPhone installed on your iPad, you can avoid confusion by deleting it before installing OneNote for iPad version 1.3.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>FAQ: Install/Login issues</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>My question is not answered below, now what?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We want your feedback! Go to the<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Answers forum</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span>and post your questions there. It is frequented by many users who might be able to help and is often visited by the OneNote product development team and the Microsoft Support team.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>I get a crash - now what?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We are receiving crash information through iTunes automatically when syncing your device. To help us solve your issue, please post on the<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/addonenote/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft Answers forum</span></a> and give as much details as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>FAQ: Usage questions</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When will you release the application in my location?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OneNote for iPhone 1.3 and OneNote for iPad are now available in the following markets;
</span></p>
<p><span>Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile,&nbsp;Colombia, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, India,
 Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
 Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where is &lt;my favorite feature&gt;? When will it be added?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Since we use the app, too, we want it to be as awesome as possible. We listen to all feedback and consider it for future releases. Your feedback helps us know which features are most important to you. However, for a variety of reasons we cannot discuss
 planned features, their priorities, or the dates that we expect these features to be released.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why can't I see notebooks that others have shared with me?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If others have shared their notebooks with you on SkyDrive, you can now sync them with your device and work on them together. You must first turn them on in the OneNote for iPhone Notebook Settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why can't I see all of my content on my iPhone?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The current release supports text, images, checkboxes, bulleted lists, and table rendering. We do not support rich text formatting or table editing. Other content types (including ink and math equations) are not yet supported. We prioritized support
 for different types of content based on the top needs of most mobile users. We will continue to evaluate and prioritize additional content types for future releases.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why are my notes going to the "Personal (Web)" notebook, and why is it needed?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The current OneNote Mobile for iPhone app needs this notebook to exist to synchronize the "Unfiled Notes" section. There is currently no way to change the location of "Unfiled Notes" in OneNote Mobile for iPhone. Do not delete this notebook (you'll
 see it show up again if you do). If you prefer to have all of your notes in one notebook, we recommend using the "Personal (Web)" notebook. You can open this notebook on the OneNote PC client from the<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.skydrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.skydrive.com</span></a> site. Open the "Personal (Web)" notebook in the web app and then click "Open in OneNote". From now on, you will be able to see your notes from the PC client.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where did my text formatting go?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Text formatting is not currently supported. Please note that you will lose formatting on a paragraph if you make edits to that paragraph with OneNote Mobile for iPhone. Paragraphs that you do not edit on your iPhone will preserve their original formatting
 when viewed in other versions of OneNote.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why aren't my pages syncing to new content that I added on other devices?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We've worked hard to make the sync experience as seamless as possible. For many users, it should "just work." However, for those who use multiple platforms in quick succession, it may help to know a bit more about how and when the app syncs. The iPhone
 app does not sync a page while you are viewing or editing it; it will attempt to sync content to and from SkyDrive when you enter and leave the page. You can also manually trigger a sync at any time from the settings screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why am I asked to upgrade?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The free download of OneNote Mobile can be used to sync up to 500 notes with your device. If you choose not to upgrade to the unlimited version, you can still view, sync, and delete any of your existing notes even after you've reached the 500 notes

<h2>            Open attachment from Outlook 2016 in edit mode instead of read only mode - a solution</h2>
                    <p>If you have the problem when opening an attachment from Outlook, where the file opens in "read only", but you want to be able to edit from within Outlook, try this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcd38466-9583-4047-bb7f-2381e64a246a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcd38466-9583-4047-bb7f-2381e64a246a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Works great for excel.&nbsp; However for Word, I had to do one more step by disabling the protected view for Outlook attachments.&nbsp; In Word, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings (the button on the right) &gt; Protected View.&nbsp; Then UNCHECK the
 "Enable Protected View for Outlook attachments".</p>

 suggested I try the community to see if anyone else might know.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting back. Since that you already contacted the Answer Desk, we suggest posting your query on our

    <title>Word 2016 with Windows 10 Picture Resize Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 2016 with Windows 10 Picture Resize Problem</h2>
                    <div>
<p>When I hover over any of the corners of a picture to resize (smaller or larger--doesn't matter), hold the mouse button down and barely begin to slowly drag, the picture jumps to a huge size (three times larger than the page) and often also flips
 the image vertically or horizontally. And it happens with every image I touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I am not crossing over other edit points on the picture (the other little white, round circles bordering the picture after it's selected) an answer suggests in another similar post.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Again: this happens when trying to make it small&nbsp;</em><em><span>or&nbsp;</span></em><em>bigger.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried with no success:</p>
<p>*closing and reopening Word</p>
<p>*restarting (or turning off completely and waiting a while before turning on again) the computer</p>
<p>*holding down the shift key as I drag</p>
<p>*holding down the control key as I drag</p>
<p>*putting the picture elsewhere on the page</p>
<p>*cutting and pasting the picture again in the same document&nbsp;<em>or a new one</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;There is a guy with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT1BQmJQdwg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">YouTube video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/zT1BQmJQdwg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/zT1BQmJQdwg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;showing the same problem, but as far as I can tell, no one has been able to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Note: His problem is in Excel. Mine is in Word. I haven't tried it in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having other weird issues with the Suite as well though, and I wonder, did I just get a bad download? Is that even a thing? I bought it directly from Microsoft, so it can't be because a third party had fiddled with it.</p>

<p>The issue occurs with any document even new ones, but in particular in documents that I have exported from OneNote.&nbsp; It happens to all the pictures no matter what, in all Word documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is one question..... My question is how do I solve this ridiculously annoying bug in your product.&nbsp; I have tests and assignments to complete I cannot spend 2 hrs manually resizing the dimensions of each image in a document.&nbsp; So this is a single
 question/problem.&nbsp; I'd suggest next time you read my post more thoroughly because I did mention that this issue happens with any image I touch in my document which would have answered question #2.</p>

<h2>            How to hide add-in from Project VBE</h2>
                    Is it possible to hide MS add-ins from VBE Project list?

            <p>AFAIK you cant hide the name but you can password protect it and hide the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the module name -&gt; VBAProject properties -&gt; Protection tab -&gt; Check Lock for viewing and then enter the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The password does not have an effect until after save and close and re-open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open the project click the project name and the enter the password. The project remains open until the workbook is closed again and re-opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove the password the procedure is similar to applying the password but you&nbsp;clear the password from the fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I never apply a password to projects unless I have a backup copy somewhere safe that is not password protected.</strong></p>

            <p>I was aware of how to protect a project, but this is a Office Analysis ToolPak add-in and, of course, it shows in the project list and I just wanted to eliminate it from view. thanks...</p>

            Unfortunately, no. Any open workbook will appear in the project explorer and .xlam/.xla files are just workbooks really.
