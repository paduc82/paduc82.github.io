            <p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.
</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model. </li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>

<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

    <title>Remove Windows 8 Metro and add Start Menu&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hellhoundx666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Windows 8 Metro and add Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. A friend of mine got a new laptop for Christmas, and it has Windows 8 pre-installed. After a few hours of tinkering with the system we've both become incredibly distressed by the changes
 to the windows experience. So, what I'm looking for is the ability to add a start button to the desktop, remove the metro interface entirely, and also disable the start screen. I'm nearly furious that these aren't functions that users can enable/disable. Forcing
 users to work with your new interface because it's more "Intuitive" which is exactly opposite it's intention. I understand the concept behind the metro screen. It's an attempt at making everything more convenient, and accessible, with a custom application
 layout. But, removing the option to create your own user experience is incredibly limiting. Why can't an operating system for once, just allow users to pick what goes where, how those functions act, and why?<br />
<br />
I should also add that I am absolutely not willing to pay for a third party application to bring the most basic of functionality to this operating system. Is there a registry key I can remove, or
 edit, to accomplish any of this? And does anyone know of someone at Microsoft I can contact directly about my concerns? I'd actually like to have my concerns heard somewhere where it matters. User to Developer. The way it should be.&nbsp;<br />

I agree the new interface is fun but I don't want the OS to be fun, I want to use my computer to run software.<br />

            <p>These people that have posted here are not the only ones who have regarded the new interface of Windows 8 to 8.1 with disdain and a greater befuddlement with the answers to do so from Microsoft of why.</p>
<p>This has failed like their tablet, and should go to the curb as it has done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People want at most to REMOVE the new TOILET DOOR SIGNS which Microsoft has stolen to make a new front gui that people feel as if they need to wash their hands after use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or at least at the slightest to change and customise, so as to be their own and not likely to ask which app is the TOILET app to flush them all away with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look and see,, not even a rounded bevel on any corner,, no use of 3 dimensional graphics no use of any form of artistry, no one at Microsoft seemed to even care enough to give people an option of a ability to use other icons as to replace those that Microsoft
 has used or stolen from their in-house restrooms,, maybe that's the time they got the idea to use those icons while they used that service, we got the same end product.</p>

            Could be a coincidence. Run the computer's pre boot diagnostics to see if the hard drive failed. Your computer's support site will have directions for running the diagnostics. If you made any recovery disks or thumb drives for windows 8 before you upgraded
 to 8.1, boot to that to see if you can repair or refresh.

            Hard to answer without knowing the model computer. You should always included that in your questions. Did you run the hardware diagnostics to test all the hardware, not just the HD? That takes hours to run so you could not have answered so quickly if you
 did. Try tapping F12 as soon as you reboot without waiting for any screen. that should bring up the Boot Menu with a choice to run the diagnostics. A spinning disk means nothing if the drive has failed. A failed drive might spin but doesn't boot. It sure sounds
 like that might be the case

            <p>Pav 17.&nbsp; I am seeing this as MS-HP issue and who ever provides their HD and this is not a Win 8.1 friendly HD.&nbsp; Clearly when making 8.1 they failed to make it work right with the HD, but there may be an equal quirk with an HD.&nbsp; I am running a Pav dv6000

<h3> genericaluser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choppy Bluetooth Audio</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pair of Sony MDR-1000X Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>I bought them specifically so I can use their Bluetooth&nbsp;functionality, so it's pretty annoying how the audio is incredibly choppy.</p>
<p>I've had a similar experience with previous Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>Usually what happens is that they will work for a good few hours and then suddenly the sound will become choppy</p>
<p>How do I fix this? It's so annoying and awful. I don't know why something that I'd think would be pretty simple such as Bluetooth headphones would end up being so terrible on Windows. This doesn't occur on any of my other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify: I'm not saying the quality is poor, but that the audio is skipping and lagging. It's a bit weird and sounds quite awful.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can we delay the activation&#47;popping-up of a &#39;hidden&#39; Taskbar by a user-selected number of msec&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>[This is not a question about delaying the appearance of 'thumbnails' when one's mouse hovers over an already-visible Taskbar]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[It is about delaying the re-appearance of the entire 'hidden' Taskbar, as soon as the mouse pointer reaches the bottom of the screen]</em></p>
<br />
<p>--------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It's so frustrating that MS hasn't provided users with a way to delay the re-activation of a 'hidden' taskbar, by a user-selected number of msec.</strong> &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is human nature to overshoot one's target while dragging a mouse, and nearly EVERY time I try to move a horizontal scroll bar or press a button anywhere NEAR the bottom of the screen, I inevitably trigger the popping-up of the 'hidden' Taskbar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use many programs that have buttons/sliders/switches located at or near the very bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Just changing the volume on the VLC media player requires moving the mouse to the very bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Invariably, the hidden taskbar pops up, blocking the button/slider/switch that I was about to click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have to move the mouse away, wait for the taskbar to eventually disappear, and then ve-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ery slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-owly move the mouse to its intended target, so as not to re-trigger the taskbar's activation.<br />
<br />
A simple web search shows that this issue has been complained about for nearly two decades. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is frustrating that the only 'known' solution offered to remedy this problem appears to be installing and running a program by an unknown (to me) developer, one that hasn't been updated since 1999:<br />
<br />
<strong>http://pmdevigne.free.fr/TaskbarActivate.html</strong><br />
<br />
Unknown people on unfamiliar forums claim that it still works on their Windows 10 systems, but I don't want to have to rely upon such questionable recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know exactly <em>how</em> the above-linked software delayed the activation of a 'hidden' Taskbar?&nbsp; Is it the addition/change of a registry key?&nbsp; Some group policy setting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to delay the activation of a hidden Taskbar by a given period of time, without having to install an unfamiliar third-party program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS should at least make available registry key details or SOMETHING, so that intrepid users can delay the popping-up of the 'hidden' Taskbar by as many msec as they choose.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any guidance, insight, or specific methods!!!!!</p>
<p><em>Ohhhhhhh, I haz such a sad.......................................................&nbsp;

</p><p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8287eb8d-5007-48e1-98ea-a78e4ff4bc01" title="lacrumb">
lacrumb</a>, thanks for helping out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure which setting you're referring to.&nbsp; The closest thing I can find is under "Additional Mouse Options" (which launches the "Mouse Properties" window) where there is a little checkbox that says "Enhance Pointer Precision."&nbsp; That box has always
 been checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the real issue here is being able to move freely to adjust buttons/sliders/switches located at or near the very bottom of the screen without having to worry constantly about 'overshooting my target' and causing that ^%$#@!^ Taskbar to pop up and interrupt
 my workflow, over and over and over and over again......................</p>

<p>
</p><p>That just selects a different looking pointer.&nbsp; Is it more "accurate"?&nbsp; I don't know but, regardless of whether I'm using the dot in the center of the Precision Select crosshairs or the one at the tip of my current pointer, the same thing will happen when
 I'm trying to hit a button, scroll bar or slider situated <strong>a millimeter away from the bottom of the screen</strong>.&nbsp; I'm still going to wind up triggering the Taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried working both with and without the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/321763/what-is-enhance-pointer-precision-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">“Enhance Pointer Precision” setting</a> enabled, and the problem remains:&nbsp; the Taskbar keeps jumping up unless I carefully
 police my every hand movement... which amounts to constant interruptions when I'm trying to concentrate on whatever I'm working on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm looking for a way to delay the activation of the hidden Taskbar, so that I can overshoot that button at the bottom of the screen, and let the pointer (whichever shape I choose) hover in the 'Taskbar activation zone' for a certain amount of time

Stop 0x124 is a hardware error<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.<br />
<br />
This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[QUOTE] Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try<br />
Synopsis:<br />
<br />
A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.
<br />
<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
<br />
<br />
[U] Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:[/U]<br />
<br />
1) Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked. Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.<br />
&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Update all hardware-related drivers: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.
<br />
It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions. <br />
Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).
<br />
At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.<br />
<br />
6) Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components which can be put through their paces artificially.
<br />
The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s). <br />
For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.<br />
For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".
<br />
Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the RAM is
 free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.<br />
<br />
7) [I][U]As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates, or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows
 7 disc.[/I][/U]<br />
Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps. <br />
If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the machine
 is still free from 0x124 crashes. <br />
Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.<br />
If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the harware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.
<br />
Be aware that attempting the subsequent harware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:<br />
<br />
8) Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine. <br />
Reseat all connectors and memory modules. <br />
Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.<br />
<br />
9) If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.
<br />
Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.<br />
<br />
Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed [I][u]all[/i][/u] of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong
 with the machine's hardware.[/quote]<br />

            This is a very interesting set of memory dumps.&nbsp; I ran the last 10 and only found 1 3rd party driver.<br />
And, the stack starts out with the start of a system thread.<br />
<br />
Although this isn't a usual technique, I'd have to wonder if running Driver Verifier might tell us something.&nbsp; If you choose to run it, please do so using these directions:&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype business no gear icon, no three dots, nothing under profile for setting - nothing&#33;</h2>
                    I have Skype for Business Word 10. I am trying to find the settings to stop Skype from loading every time I turn on the computer. I have no gear icon, no three dots, click on my picture and only thing that comes up is the profile information. I can't locate
 the settings, menu or any other indication of where the settings/menu is located. The only thing across the top of my screen is Downloads, Skype to Phone and Help, none of which have the settings or menu options. Please help! Thank you!

<p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better help you, may I know if your Skype for Business client is newly installed? I mean, your client worked well before? You can refer to the following screenshots to upload the related ones of your client.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48a6755d-ffd4-4b8e-80de-08464770376a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48a6755d-ffd4-4b8e-80de-08464770376a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3f74a56-c52b-4075-af65-475c886056c3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a3f74a56-c52b-4075-af65-475c886056c3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it persists once you get the client, I'd like to confirm where did you get the client or who helped you install the client. Generally speaking, as an Office 365 for commercial user, it is recommended that he install the client from Office 365 Portal (Install
 software/Office 2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then for your concern on "Skype for Business will be loading while your computer starts". You can try checking if the Skype for Business has been the program that will be started automatically in your Windows 10. If so you can try disabling it. For more
 information, you can refer to<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4026268/windows-change-startup-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4026268/windows-change-startup-apps-in-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

            I should correct this, apparently I do not have Skype for Business. This Skype program I installed is October 2016. I have only used it a couple of times. There has never been a gear button or any other menu options available. Is this something I need
 to pay to have to set my options?<br />

<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>To provide the appropriate resolution, I would need more information from your end.</font></span></b></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Are you referring to usable memory?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. How exactly are you checking the available memory?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>The amount of usable memory in the examples, are not exact amounts. Usable memory is a calculated
 amount of the total physical memory minus "hardware reserved" memory.<br />
<br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>This is expected behavior on computers that are running Windows 8. The reduction in available system

</font></span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>This problem may occur because the
<b><font>Maximum memory </font></b>option is selected incorrectly. To fix this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />

<p><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press
<b><font>Windows key + R</font></b>,</span></font></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>f.

</font></span><b><span><br />

<h2>            Booting Win 7 off UEFI and 3TB HDD.  Can&#39;t install Win 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Windows 7 Ultimate with a 3TB Western Digital Green HDD.</p>
<p>This is my motherboard:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3978#ov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=3978#ov</a></p>
<p>"In addition, GIGABYTE DualBIOS™ now supports 3TB+ (terabyte) hard drive booting without the need for partitioning, and enables more data storage on a single hard drive. "</p>
<p>I've upgraded this bios to: </p>
<p>U1g (UEFI Bios)</p>
<p>Gigabyte advertises this Motherboard as Windows 8 ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/314/windows8.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/314/windows8.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to set up this system, I had to boot the windows 7 DVD into UEFI mode (an option when selecting boot devices and the win 7 DVD is inserted).&nbsp; I partitioned the drive with GPT.&nbsp; This let me&nbsp;install Windows to C: with&nbsp;2.72 TB of space, and I boot
 off that drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and I'm trying to install Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>When I ran the upgrade assistant it said that:</p>
<p>"Secure Boot isn't compatible with your PC", but that didn't look like it should be a problem.&nbsp; I purchased a license, downloaded the .iso, and burnt the DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I boot off the DVD, run the&nbsp;installer, and I try to select my C: partition,&nbsp;I get an error&nbsp;that the drive is formated with GPT and that Windows can't install there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing?&nbsp; Surely Windows 8 will support my 3TB HDD like Windows 7 does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            So for some reason, my BIOS could choose to boot UEFI or BIOS when loading the Windows 7 DVD. &nbsp;Yet the same options do not appear when trying to boot off my 64-bit Windows 8 Pro DVD.
<div><br />
<div>My BIOS does not have an EFI shell (that I could figure out how to access). &nbsp;However I don't need the EFI shell for the Windows 7 DVD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ended up doing a workaround&nbsp;successfully instead. &nbsp;I formatted and installed Windows 7 64bit via UEFI to the 3TB drive. &nbsp;I then put in the Windows 8 Pro 64-bit DVD, and ran setup from within windows 7. &nbsp;I selected "save none" and now I'm running Windows
 8 Pro on that same partition.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then ran the disk space clean up utility to delete C:\Windows.old and every thing feels like I have the same result as a clean install, just a few extra steps.</div>

<h2>            Remote device won&#39;t accept the connection since W7 re-install.</h2>
                    Since reinstalling W7 Pro I am now no longer able to map a network drive to a NAS on the network. The NAS device is visible to all other home uses (Sonos, Internet TV, etc) and can be accessed via front-view in a web browser without any problem. I can
 PING the device and get an answer so no problems with the device itself (which has not been touched before, during or after W7 re-installation).<br />
<br />
Just can't map a network drive!<br />
<br />
Have tried disabling firewall etc but still no luck. Have also checked all relevant services are running.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas what more I can do to get my laptop to talk to it as a network drive?<br />
<br />
When I enter the ip address of the NAS and click 'finish' to map it I get the following dialogue message:<br />
<br />
The remote device or resource won't accept the connection<br />
The device or resource at 192.168.x.xxx is not set up to accept connections on port 'The file and printer sharing (SMB)'<br />
<br />
any&nbsp; help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
many thanks in advance.<br />

<h2>            WIndows takes an hour to boot since update.</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just updated my system and it seems to have developed a fault. It now takes half an hour or more to boot into Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system starts up as normal until it gets to the launch of windows when you just get a black screen with a mouse cursor. Ctrl+Alt+Del does nothing though you can move the cursor around.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you then leave the system for 30-40 mins it does (eventually) load into Windows and you can enter your password.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It does the same thing every time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas as to what caused this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Adrian</div>

<p>Hi, you are right, it is compatible, if you are having trouble getting it from the xbox one, then you can still purchase the game using the xbox 360 store on xbox.com.&nbsp; here is the link for Torchlight

</a></p>
<p>If you own the game, then it should show up in the ready to install section for you to install.&nbsp; Make sure you are using the same account you used to purchase the game.<br />

    <title>Error in creation of recovery disk in Windows 10 64 Bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zilden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error in creation of recovery disk in Windows 10 64 Bit</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a recovery disk. On running its wizard, I'm prompted to connect a USB flash, after connecting an USB flash drive, the wizard fails to recognize it and keeps prompting me to connect an USB drive although I'm able to see, access and format
 this USB drive through menu option &lt;This PC&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On contacting Microsoft support, they believe to look into this problem I need to have a premium membership of $150 a year. It is unsure that after looking into the problem they can guarantee to solve it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creation of a recovery disk, I believe, is &nbsp;a basic requirement for the full functionality of the PC and to capitalize and make profit on someone else's problem is nothing but sin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft it appears has &nbsp;surprisingly hit on a new business model of making profits, release a Windows 10 version full of bugs, offer a free upgrade to get people on it and charge a whooping $150/year to just look into solving the bugs that come of it!</p>

<p>Also make sure that you have more then 4gb space.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

            <span>Dear Microsoft Community,</span>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Its very clear my question still remains unanswered if one reads the last post above.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
The problem seem to be more in getting Microsoft to accept they have a bug in the creation of a recovery drive software utility, than the standard support procedures that are to be applied to Microsoft believing in the contrary.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
The same bug of USB drive recognition is also evident in another similar utility when used in creating a backup.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
&nbsp;It is quite possible that this bug may get generated only during a Windows 8 to 10 upgrade and may not show up in the standard Windows 10 test OS.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<p>If only the support executives could get directly to the development team responsible for this utility and the backup, to communicate this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also quite saddening that, in more than 20 years of Microsofts tryst with Windows, to see a company that till now cannot change the core design to automate such support or even report them automatically when they occur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR simply, to &nbsp;take strong responsibility for the failure of the products they build.</p>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Warm regards</div>

<h2>            Printer printing to wrong port</h2>
                    Hi can someone please help. I have 2 printers one with IP address .........1.76 and the other ......1.77. When I try to print from autocad to .......1.76 it prints to .......1.77. I have checked and checked and checked again but cannot seem to get it to
 work. I changed the port name on .......1.77 to ......1.77_1 that did nothing. What I did notice was that both printers have the same port number if that means anything. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>You have just discovered the reason for NOT storing data on the Desktop. The Desktop is a special system folder for storing icons only and is NOT designed to store data files.</p>
<p>Store your documents where they are meant to be stored - in your Documents folder. (You can certainly put SHORTCUTS to these documents on your desktop...)</p>
<p>As these are critical files, I presume you have a backup?</p>

<h2>            Internet problem - Windows 10 Insider Preview 14965</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a serious problem here, related to Internet browsing. Thursday night, I got prompted that there's a new build available - 14965. I was like "YAAAY", since I usually like the new stuff. Well..not this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to shut down the PC at that time, so I did. On the next day, friday, I turn it on and it started updating the build as previous ones. Ok. Once it was done, I go as usual around the Internet, Steam, try play online games. Nothing works. I had Internet
 connection, I contacted my ISP - the problem is not from them. Basically, when I went to Steam shop, it was barely loading, most of the time text only, and the images (if they even load) would show up with some weird colorful lines, like they're glitched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Ok, it's probably Steam's servers", I said. Well, Chrome had similar problems. Pages were loading slow, some wouldn't even load and I couldn't download any file from any website. It said "Network error". I go to Edge - same thing, even worse. Couldn't even
 load any website. I also had Java and Flash errors, saying they are not installed...but they were...the ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, most of the browsing was messed up. I could send text messages in Discord, but couldn't send pictures. I was sure it was the build's fault as I had just updated, and now I'm totally sure as I went back to the previous build and these issues are
 gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not update until it's fixed since I can't really make use of Internet. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>DilyanD.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I faced exactly the same issue... twice! ... :-(</p>
<p>Windows installed this build when I was in Fast ring mode and I had to roll back due to the very issues. I change my settings to go in Slow ring mode.</p>
<p>This week Windows reinstalled this same Build while it knew I had to rollback! ... :-( and obviously I faced again the same issues and again I rolled it back.</p>

</p><p>I have found that killing my firewall (not just disabling) solves all the issues. I'm using Kaspersky Internet Security 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this has something to do with the way the latest Win10 update work with 3rd party security products and it may even be by design. I read something recently about Kaspersky filing an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft over this issue.</p>

            <p>I can verify this&nbsp; problem which I've been having the last 3-4 builds on the insider fast ring. I'm currently on 14971. No standard win32 browsers (I've tried Edge, IE11, Chrome) are working properly with https. Keep getting ssl errors, webpages don't load
 or only load patially after multiple refreshes. All downloads over https fail with a network error. Wireshark analysis indicates a bad ssl/tls handshake. Accessing the internet via all other apps such as Outlook, Skype, Powershell invoke-webrequest work fine.
 UWP browsers such as Inkognito from the Windows store also work fine. I've taken the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cleared cache and history</li><li>Updated NIC drivers</li><li>Cleared ssl state</li><li>Ran chrome with ignore-certificate-errors flag</li><li>Removed Webroot Secure Anywhere antivirus</li><li>Tested on 2 different networks, both Ethernet and wireless</li><li>Keep posting on Feedback hub and in various threads around the Community - no response. I did get a few upvotes (can count one hand)</li></ol>
<p>I REALLY wish this would be resolved already. It's the first serious bug that I've hit in 2 years of Insider builds...</p>

            <p>I don't know about the original poster but killing your firewall probably did solve most of your issues but, it is known that when you install a preview build you should not use a third party security product as most will not work properly. My advice to
 those who have anything but Windows Defender to uninstall it and than run that products removal tool.</p>

<h2>            Audio stuttering&#47;lagging whilst using 3.5mm jack headset</h2>
                    
<p>I am constantly having sound problems whilst using a headset with my Xbox one controller. I dont know what it is, why it's happening or how to fix it. does anyone know what it is, and how I can potentially fix it? It is so annoying when the sound always
 stutters while I'm playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Try sitting closer to the console and see if things improve. Also, I find that if I have my phone in my pocket so that it is inches away from my controller when I'm playing, that causes audio issues from interference.</p>
<p>Make sure also that there are no wireless devices sat too close to the console itself.</p>

<p>I am sitting literally 1meter from my console. I think it's because the controller uses wifi or something instead of Bluetooth. Do you think it will be better with the new Bluetooth controller?</p>

<p>The new Bluetooth controller still uses the same type of connection as the older controller with the Xbox Console, the Bluetooth is more like an add-on to allow it to connect to other devices like PC's, tablets, and phones.</p>

<p>No, I don't work for Microsoft. </p>
<p>Though If you are sitting that close to the console, you may as well connect via USB, not only will it save you having to buy batteries or charging the thing, it will not get any interference at all. Try it anyway and see. If the issue persists with it connected
 that way, you're probably looking at a faulty controller.</p>

<p>Hi there :)</p>
<p>Also., you can try and update your controller software, to see if that cures the issue - I recommend using the USB connected method. Please see this article for more info, and feel free to post back here with results:</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<p>This is happening to both my regular controller, and my Elite controller. So maybe they're both outdated. I will try to update them. Also, I have tried multiple headsets, and this happens with all of them, so it's not the headset either. Do I have to remove
 the rechargeable battery in order for it to be connected through wire? If I connect the cable with the batteries inside, will it be using the wireless function, instead of wired function?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back, and sorry to hear you're still having problems. :/</p>
<p>From experience, you would have to navigate to the controller update section, so is something working?</p>
<p>Try removing the batteries and seeing if the controllers connect via cable only. From there, run the controller test again. If this doesn't solve the issue, then I would like you to try a power cycle (power to Xbox, router and TV unplugged at the mains outlet
 for a few mins, then re-connected), and try the whole thing again.</p>
<p>Try a completely different controller. Simple idea, but.. lol ;) If you do get something working, try looking in Xbox One's AV settings, to see if there are any issues.
</p>
<p>There may be an issue with your TV also, in the way that it handles AV. Have you got another set that you can try plugging into, for the sake of troubleshooting? If so, please try this, along with a new HDMI cable.</p>
<p>Search Xbox.com for your issue, and see what solutions are posted. Try each one out and see if something works.</p>
<p>As an ABSOLUTE last resort, I'd recommend a master/factory reset of your Xbox. This can get rid of any software issues that might be preventing the controllers and headsets from working. This will delete all data from your console's hard drive. You can learn
 how to do that here:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../reset-console-to-factory-defaults</a></p>
<p>If none of these ideas fix the issue overall, I think the best thing to do would be to consider starting a repair. More info on that, here:</p>

<p>There may be a chargeable repair involved.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>The stutter was just about gone when I connected through USB, with battery removed. So the problem was most likely some WiFi interference. Thank you both so much for the help!</p>

<h2>            Windows Brightness issue  after the 1809 update</h2>
                    hello , Yesterday I installed the 1809 update , and today i noticed that each time i restart my laptop the brightness level is being reset automatically to 0% or 25-50 i'm not really sure , and after windows will boot up , i will need to manually adjust
 the screen brightness again to 100% . I searched the web and i found this&nbsp;https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-october-2018-update-common-problems-and-fixes#fix_brightness_windows10_1809 , and it might be an update issue i think&nbsp; , by the way , my power
 plan is set to maximum performance and my laptop is always plugged in , and solutions or ?

<p>I have the same problem too. And there's no such option as "Enable adaptive brightness" in Windows 10 1809 version. Plus when the screen goes to dimmed display brightness mode(i.e. few minutes before turning off the screen), then it remains in dimmed display
 and it recovers only when I restart my laptop.</p>

            I'm having the same issue, where the screen occasionally resets brightness to 50% or so. It started immediately after installing the October update. It seems like Microsoft tried to migrate the adaptive brightness away from the classic Power Options and
 into the new Display Settings, but left out the small detail of actually adding the setting. It's referenced in Ease of Access that you should be able to change adaptive brightness in Display Settings and it even links you there, but the option doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
I've dug around in the registry a bit, and I managed to find this directory:&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\DisplayEnhancementService\State\SDC434B0_00_07DE_2B<br />
which includes options like, "isAutobrightnesson." I haven't had a chance to try editing these keys, but it looks very promising. A word of warning, editing the registry can cause serious issues if you don't know what you're doing. Do so at your own risk.
