Thank you for posting to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>I would recommend you to create a System Restore Point manually, so that in case, something goes wrong while performing these steps, you may always perform
 a System Restore.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Try to create a new user profile and try to install Windows update and verify if the update works fine.
</span></p>
<p><span>Create a new user</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Click Start, type Control userpasswords in the Start Search box, and then click Control userpasswords in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. Click Manage another account.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Click Create a new account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. In the New account name box, type a single-byte character name, click Administrator, and then click Create Account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Click the user account that you created in step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. Click Create a password.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>7. In the New password box, type a password, type the password again in the Confirm new password box, type a password hint in the Type a password hint box, and the click Create password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have a new user accounts created verify if you can install updates.</span></p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Pointer Jumping&#47;Lagging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hyung joo ahn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Pointer Jumping&#47;Lagging</h2>
                    <p>I am using a 15-inch Surface Book 2. While the surface is plugged in to the surface dock, the pointer continues to freeze. Occasionally I experience this freezing of the pointer when the surface itself is unplugged as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot recall from what update this problem resulted in, but it was quite recent - within the past few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I had thought the issue was with the software. Hence, I updated and reinstalled the mouse drivers, the surface dock drivers, the monitor drivers, the GPU drivers, etc. The problem still persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that it might be a hardware problem, I sent my surface in for repair and Microsoft sent me a new replacement. The problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I searched online for solutions: I already tried everything with my drivers. I disabled cortana, my touchscreen, and the touchpad while the mouse is connected. I read an article about changing the power settings, but I do not see the purpose in doing that
 as my surface lid is not closed while connected to the dock (which connects to the monitor).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, the pointer freezes and jumps after a few seconds. There is no pattern to this. It just happens occasionally. It's getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi Hyung Joo Ahn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's important that we perform all software troubleshooting before we can determine if the problem is the hardware itself. Based on the description, you are using an external mouse. If that is correct, can you share what the make and model of the mouse is?
 Does the problem happen when you are just using the touchpad on the keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it happen when using specific apps in the background? When not connected to the Surface Dock, detach the keyboard and try to run the program/s that are open when you experience the problem with the cursor and see if the same issue will arise. Let me
 also tell you that the power settings may indeed play a part in the issue. Click on the battery icon on your taskbar and try to move the power slider to Better or Best performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong> can also help you check the software
 for errors. Apart from that, it will ensure that the you are running the best driver and firmware updates for the Surface Book 2. Perform a forced shutdown once the SDT is done running to apply the changes and reload the software properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update the post so we can continue looking into this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Dear Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs randomly and is unpredictable. I ran the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit, and it found no problems.</p>
<p>There should not be any hardware problems as I replaced my surface book 2 to a new one just a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a logitech g903 mouse, which is connected to a surface dock.</p>
<p>The surface dock also connects to a LG34WK650. Being connected to the monitor through the surface dock seems to increase the frequency of the pointer freezing.</p>
<p>For some reason, using the default surface book 2 charger instead of the surface dock seems to reduce the number of times the problem occurs.</p>
<p>I have tried directly connecting the mouse to the surface. This seems to reduce the number of times the problem occurs as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am bearing with it, but it gets on my nerves every time the pointer randomly decides to freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The touchpad is not a problem. The touchpad works when the mouse freezes. (it freezes for a brief few seconds, but I tried to use the touchpad during that time and I had no issue with it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is this issue? I am confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevermind, as I am trying to submit this post it just continues to frustrate me by 'jumping' from place to place. I guess it anticipates where my pointer should be at and jumps directly there not showing the trail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the mouse trail options in the control panel as well by the way. It jumps regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hyung Joo Ahn</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, Hyung Joo Ahn. I checked the mouse you have and if I'm not mistaken, it connects wirelessly to the Surface or Surface Dock using a dongle. Since this is the setup, navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong></span><span>(Windows
 key + I) &gt;&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Devices&nbsp;</strong></span><span>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong></span><span>. If you find devices that show errors,
 remove them. You can also try to unpair and reconnect your Logitech mouse.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you also try using a different power mode? Click on the battery icon and move the slider to a different power mode. Use your Surface with the mouse for a while with that power mode applied and see if the issue will
 occur.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned on your initial troubleshooting that you have updated and reinstalled the drivers including those for the Surface Dock. In case the update was not done using the Surface Dock Updater Tool, please go ahead and try to use the tool which you can
 download <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. For your reference in using the tool, you can go to

<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it turns out. I will be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can to help you in case you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I can attest to the same issue. I have a Surface Book 2 (15 inch) paired with the Logitech G903 mouse including the latest Firmware and Drivers, and when connected via USB it will completely lock up every couple minutes, where I have to turn off my mouse
 and back on to get it to work, and when <span>connected wirelessly via the USB dongle-
</span>it will freeze every few seconds but recover and jump across the screen (very annoying).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The G903 mouse works perfect on a different Windows 10 machine with the identical drivers and firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Logitech Support and they mentioned that the G903 is USB2 and to try and use a USB2 port, but whether or not I am connected wired via USB3 on the Surface directly, or connected wired to the Surface Dock (USB2) I get the same lock up hard
 issue. Where I have to turn the mouse off and on to get it to start working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

                    <p>I have about 1,600 PDF files that I am working with.&nbsp; They all have specific individual file names.&nbsp; I am trying to organize them by only a portion of the file name.&nbsp; In order to do this, I need to delete or get rid of the first three characters of the file
 name and keep the remaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi yok33
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Best way to do is through any file renamer utility. Microsoft Store has many free file renaming utilities. Just launch Microsoft Store and type rename and you get many options.
<br />
<br />If you need a recommendation, you can download below from Microsoft Store
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Yok33
<br />
<br />Open that folder in File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click an empty space and choose 'Open Powershell Window here'
<br />
<br />Paste the following command into Powershell and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />get-childitem *.pdf | foreach { rename-item $_ $_.Name.Replace("SA-", "") }
<br />
<br />
<br />Wait for that command to complete, then close Powershell

    <title>How do I get better at aiming&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get better at aiming&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>OR Is it just blind luck? every time I try aim I die 99.99% of the time, I even tried putting a small marker or red piece of tape on the center of my LCD back on Bad Co 2, I'm having a heck of a time with this, Ive tried everything! IS it just come with
 practice? my connection has never been OR will not get any better than it is now 5MB second, Is it something I'm just going to have to live with? Am I just a victim of cheats or glitches? I have also tried every sensitivity setting along with auto ON an auto
 OFF. Maybe its just the people I get matched up with, being FAR superior than me,because I do eventually find the odd match were everyone seems to be on a level playing field, an at the very least I can stay PAR or slightly above Par!</p>

<p>Dice nerfed a ton of weapons for each patch. &nbsp;Back during metro beta core felt like hardcore. &nbsp;People dropped fast. &nbsp;My aiming is just drink a ton of beer. &nbsp;Good aiming fluid and takes the edge off. &nbsp;But then waste more time fetching more beers and bathroom

<h2>            Audio device properties for Windows 8</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to review and possibly change audio device settings in order to install a software program.&nbsp; The program's instructions&nbsp;include Windows 7 and Vista, but nothing about 8.&nbsp; For Windows 7, it directs us to "Sounds and Audio Devices Properties"

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I understand what you are saying. Habit memory is very difficult to change.</p>
<p>I was in the same situation when I started with the Windows 7 beta last year. In Vista and XP I kept a toolbar docked to the top of the screen and hidden. When I started using Windows 7, I don't know how many times I slapped the cursor up against the top
 of the screen trying to&nbsp;get that toolbar. :)</p>
<p>What I ended up with now is the Quick Launch toolbar on the Taskbar and sitting next to the Start Button. I can expand it and have several other menus cascade out. It works fairly well and wasn't too difficult to get used to. Using this in combination with
 the Taskbar Icons Jump Lists I have just about everything I need in that area of the screen.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Mouse wheel and left&#47;right click not working properly in IE11 and Windows Store apps</h2>
                    Recently my mouse started behaving badly with Windows 8.1, specifically with IE11 and most Windows Store (Metro) apps. The mouse wheel does not scroll, left clicking on a scroll bar does nothing, and left and right clicks don't work (forcing me to use
 my keyboard for navigation).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This issue appears to be confined to IE11 and most Windows Store apps. I do not experience these problems in other browsers, specifically Google Chrome. Also, the problem with registering mouse clicks within Windows Store apps does not occur in all apps.
 My Bank of America app will register left and right clicks properly, but most apps do not.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit with all the latest Windows updates.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Things I Have Tried</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Three different mice. All 3 mice are experiencing the same issue, which I think rules out the possibility that this is an issue with the mouse drivers.</li><li>Closed Razer Synapse 2.0, tried all three mice again. No dice, which I think rules out Razer Synapse software as the source of the problem.</li><li>I ran the IE Performance Troubleshooter.</li><li>I re-set IE as the default browsing program and made sure it was in charge of all browser defaults.</li><li>I re-set all IE settings to their default state.</li></ol>
<div><b>Things I Still Need to Try</b></div>

<ol>
<li>Windows Repair.</li></ol>
<div><b>Questions</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Is this a known issue with Windows 8.1?</li><li>Are there other things I can try to resolve this issue? I recently had to re-install Windows, and I would like to avoid having to do this again.</li></ol>

            This is odd, the problem appears fixed after my latest reboot. I could swear that I rebooted after each of the steps listed above, but I may have forgotten to reboot after one of them.

            Well that was a short-lived victory. Windows froze up and I had to reboot, and now the problem I described above is back.

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>First, I would suggest you to make sure that you have set the right screen resolution for best performance in Windows store
 apps. Refer to this article to set the computer to its native resolution:</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you are facing this issue even after setting the correct resolution, then I would suggest you to run the hardware and devices
 troubleshooter. This built-in troubleshooter can automatically detect any incorrect settings related to hardware devices and fix them. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</font></font></font></span></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any incorrect settings, then it is possible that the issue is related to driver. Thought you have tried using three

            Ben,
<div><br />
<div>All three mice I tried are USB mice with their own Plug and Play drivers: a Dell laser mouse, a Logitech MX510, and a Razer DeathAdder 2013. I seriously doubt all three drivers are corrupt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the Razer, I have tried re-installing the drivers several times. I also tried uninstalling the Synapse software, and that did nothing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My monitor is running at the correct (native) resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ran the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter, and it made some unspecified changes, but both before and after a reboot I'm still seeing the same behavior.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Scott Johnson</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: An issue quite similar to the one I'm seeing was posted in the IE11 forums.

            Ben, in the other thread I linked to above, one of the other MS support engineers recommended creating a new user profile. This has led to an interesting development.
<div><br />
<div>Logging in to the new profile and then back into the default profile temporarily fixes the mouse problems I'm having. After a reboot the mouse problems return, but they can be fixed again by logging in to the new profile and then back into the default
 profile.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not an ideal solution to my problem, but it may prove useful in tracking down the source of the issue I'm having. Let me know if there's anything else you would like me to try out.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Not receiving bonus coins for Microsoft Solitaire Premium</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to premium on Microsoft Solitaire Collection for iOS. I am not receiving bonus coins or any&nbsp;other benefits other than removal of ads. I have restarted the game and device but it's still the same thing. If I don't receive ALL benefits then there is no need in upgrading. The ads didn't bother me that much</p>

<p>Hey, DiddleAim!</p>
<p>There is a chance that it will effect the console and you might have some problems in the future, but I am not guaranteeing problems will even come! If it was a very small amount and only hit the fan and not the board or any other component, you may be safe.
 If it was a small amount, some drizzled on the fan, and the components. Problems may be bound to happen. There is really no way to find out if it will damage the console until it is already too late.</p>

<p>I have previously uninstalled update KB3035583, restarted the computer, and unchecked and hid that update. When I check for updates a Windows Update window appears with only one option "Upgrade to Windows 10"&nbsp; 2,6991 MB.&nbsp;

<h2>            So what IS the Day One Achievement&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone got any idea on what the Day One Achievement is going to be?</p>
<p>Will it involve gamerscore?</p>
<p>Will it affect your Xbox Profile by adding a logo or changing some sort of colour?</p>
<p>Will you receive some sort of reward such as free XBL for some period of time?</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts peeps.</p>
<p>Obviously if someone actually knows what it is then please feel free to inform and link in your source!</p>

<p>I'll still be getting my Day One Console but to me having a controller with a chrome D-Pad and some writing on it with a meaningless achievement seems pretty pointless to me?</p>

<p>Ah yes of course the free copy of FIFA 14 or Forza 5!</p>
<p>I was swaying between Dead Rising 3 and Forza 5 but have gone with Forza in the end.</p>
<p>If Dead Rising 3 gets some decent reviews and they fix the frame rate issues I will definitely pick it up.</p>
<p>I also really want Ryse however, IGN have held their review back until 21/11/13 and most of the time when that is done it's because it isn't going to get a great score :/</p>

<p>Be nice if they gave us something a little further down the line - on the one year anniversary of launch etc. Some exclusive dlc, something like that - it will always be on record as to who got day one thanks to the achievement, so it could kind of act like

<h2>            Microsoft Edge is hundreds of times Slower than IE11 on Microsoft Sites</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Windows 10 Home laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On two Microsoft sites, (<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.msdn.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.msdn.co.uk</a>), the website runs several hundred times more slowly than on an old Windows 7 desktop (immediately next to&nbsp;it).&nbsp; For example, getting to the login page for
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a>&nbsp;took 2 seconds on my old PC, and over 4 minutes on Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not an intermittent problem.&nbsp; Other web-sites (including <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.Microsoft.com</a>), area unaffected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            What the heck is this, APP Crash &#38; No IE because of DEP</h2>
                    
<p>Hi y'all,<br />
I have been getting this for a few days now, and getting ready to pull out my hair. First of all, everytime I want to get on IE it tells me it has to shut down because of DEP (Data Execution Prevention) I changed the settings and still acts fickle. My other
 is I have some downloaded games and now they won't play. When I run them I get an error message stating this program has stopped working.... Can y'all give me a hand. Thanks in advance for your time. Oh by the way, I have tried to change the setting on DEP
 and still not working, I ran a scan under cmd&nbsp;and all was well there. As for the game below, I have tried to do as some has suggested but nothing has worked. I even restored my system and the problem still consist. The only thing I can think of is that we
 deleted something to play those games. Help please.<br />

<p>IE now runs in protected mode and with DEP enabled. This is done to reduce the attach surface for the malware and increase the system security. You&nbsp; may want to disable DEP for IE.<br />
<br />
To do this<br />
<br />
1. Open Internet Explorer and Click on Tools &gt; Internet Options.</p>
<p>2. Click on the Advanced tab.</p>
<p>3. To enable DEP, check the box toward the bottom of the list that says Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks.<br />
<br />
Note: Do this test at your own risk as disabling DEP can be harmful for your system security.</p>

    <title>Window 8 Pro Crashing due to Kernel-Power Event 41 error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 512factorial  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 8 Pro Crashing  due to Kernel-Power Event 41 error</h2>
                    I upgraded my desktop machine from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8 Pro.<br />
My machine started crashing (BSOD equivalent) randomly and often.<br />
Looking at the crash dump data (and event viewer), theses Win8 crashes are a result of "Kernel-Power" (*Event 41) error.<br />
Due to the lack of any related information on the nature and rectification of this Kernel-Power event/error, I had to assume that it may be related the power supply rails that are feeding the processor (or the Win8 kernel).<br />
My Windows 7 Ultimate was rock solid and NEVER crashed.<br />
Thus, I must make another assumption that the problem is NOT with my hardware but the fault may be caused buy an aggressive Vcc polling internal to the kernel of Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp;
<br />
To confirm this assumption, I was able to reinstall Win7 [ty Acronis] from an image previously made before Win8 upgrade.<br />
Windows 7 NEVER crashed before installing Window8.&nbsp; When I reinstalled back Windows 7 from an image, it still does NOT crash.<br />
<br />
My third assumption is that this BSOD is NOT related to my hardware nor Windows 7.&nbsp;
<br />
I actually went as far as testing (under load) my power supply (Antec NeoPower 550) rails and the PS is rock solid, as indicated with proper operation of Win7 but NOT under Win8.<br />
<br />
Some additional testing has indicated that if I continuously playback movies in the background, Window 8 DOES NOT crash at all.<br />
I don't think this is the type of resolution to this problem that I am seeking.<br />
I will continue to blame Windows 8 for this problem as neither my Antec power supply nor Windows 7 is at the heart of the problem.<br />
I also have a sneaky suspicion that this problem is not going to be resolved anytime soon.<br />
But one can only hope that someone may assist with this problem.<br />

<h3> gerald-h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype contact list and contact problems.</h2>
                    <p>For the past week or so contacts I know are on line have been showing as off line in the contacts list even though I can contact them with Skype.&nbsp; When I do contact them, they get the bad internet connection error message, even though the connection is fine,
 and it doesn't go away.&nbsp; For at least one of them, clicking their "end call" button doesn't work and I have to terminate the call from my end.<br />
<br />
I'm using Skype version 7.40.0.51 and its update check says it's the latest version.&nbsp; I'm running it on my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; Everything was fine until about a week ago.&nbsp; Now only two contacts show as on line out of half a dozen I know are there.&nbsp; I suspect
 the two are using older versions and everyone else has been automatically updated to the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this problem being worked on?&nbsp; Any ideas when it will be fixed?</p>
