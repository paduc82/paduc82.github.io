<h2>            The Sims 4 Crashing</h2>
                    Each time I start up my Sims 4 game it loads until just before the start up menu and then crashed with the error message saying it has stopped working. I don't have any mods or custom content installed, I've tried uninstalling and re installing both the
 games and Origin. Nothing so far has worked. I've also changed it from 64 bit to 32 bit. What can I do to fix it?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8.1 PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGE_AREA</h2>
                    <p>Alright so heres the goods:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer Aspire E1-571</p>
<p>Windows 8.1&nbsp;x64 Bit&nbsp;(Pre-Installed with windows 8) / Dual Boot with Mavericks OS</p>
<p>Motherboard: EA50_HC_CR Ivy Bridge</p>
<p>RAM: Slot #1: Nanya Technology 2GB DDR3; NT2GC64B88G0NS-CG</p>
<p>RAM: Slot #3: Nanya Technology 4GB DDR3; NT4GC64B8HG0NS-CG</p>
<p>Intel HD Graphics 4000 w/ latest driver update from <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24593/Intel-HD-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-7-8-8-1-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://1drv.ms/1BUc0pt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mini Dump File Here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Had some issues after installing windows updates.&nbsp; <a href="http://1drv.ms/1BUd4cL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Installed updates preview</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic updates are turned on so it installed some updates on the 16th. Some of them failed. Of course windows attempted again on the 18th and succeeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update the laptop would not boot into the OS in which resulted in me bringing out the recovery partition and performed a startup repair. It checked for disk errors and what not. Completed the check up but could not boot. I then performed a system
 restore to a couple days earlier in which I was cleaning my laptop and them created a restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the laptop proceeded to work fine, installed the updates and succeeded. Rebooted fine. No problem.</p>
<p>I then leave it off and then when I come back to power it on I get the BSOD after attempting to logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently powering on and working partially. </p>
<p>By partially I mean that for whatever reason, google chrome will not work.</p>
<p>I haven't gotten a chance to check all my installed programs but it seems like anything google chrome related will not run.</p>
<p>I uninstalled google chrome and ChromeSetup.exe will not open. I will also check the legitimate Admin account, not the admin assigned account when the laptop was setup but the actual admin account with "root access", to see if I can install it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Yes my user account is set to an administrator but I also have the admin account available for logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the mini dump the issue resides in the ntoskrnl.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the mini dump is there so have a look and let me know what I can do to resolve the issue. Maybe restore again and ignore the updates? I dunno. Thanks in advanced and if you want more info on regards of my installation of windows I'll reply as fast as
 possible.</p>

    <title>Cannot Access server files&#47;folders over VPN if the remote drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nope45678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Access server files&#47;folders over VPN if the remote drive also contains Files&#47;Folders made available Offline</h2>
                    <p>I often have to work remotely, so I have some folders from our server available offline. The problem is, when I connect to our VPN I can access almost every file/folder on our server, but anything that is on the same drive as an "available offline" file/folder
 is completely inaccessible, with a cross mark over it.<br />
For example if a file is made available offline in "ServerDriveA/Documents/settings/files", I can't access anything in "ServerDriveA" other than the one offline file. Everything else will appear, but with an X over it and a message about it being inaccessible.</p>
<p>Anything on a different drive on the server will be completely accessible.<br />
Tested on two different server drives. The other server drives remain fully accessible, but not the two with offline files on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know a workaround that doesn't involve me removing all my offline files?
</p>
<p>Internet speed and VPN are both good. I had the same issue with our last VPN too.<br />
I've tried re-mapping drives and accessing files via their address rather than navigating. It's like Windows doesn't want to even try accessing them because there are offline files available.</p>

<h2>            KB2736182 &#40;Visual Studio 2010 SP1&#41; keeps trying to update and stalls</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 with trial version (expired) of VS 2010. This update keeps showing up and every time I shutdown I get the "Updates being confirgured- Please do not power off your PC" message. I left it running last night and after 12 hours in was still
 there. Had to power off manually to get the PC back. Tried manual download and install and it just stalls. Used the MS Update Fix-It center utility and no joy. How do I stop MS Update from sending me this update?

<p>Sorry if this is in the incorrect forum as I've been looking for a few minutes and this is the closest I could come to a correct forum for my issue.</p>
<p>Since 2009 I've been using a NFL jersey avatar during football season that I bought from the 360 avatar store. I used it on the 360 when I had that and I used it on Xbox One last year. Well I just went to the Windows 10 Xbox app to put it on my avatar and
 I noticed that my jersey is gone. I checked my download history and found my "Minnesota Vikings NFL Jersey" and when I click it it say: "Ooops! What happened to this page? Weâ€™ve moved some things around. The page you are looking for may have a new location,
 or is no longer available."</p>
<p>So am I correct to assume that this means that my avatar item that I paid for has just been deleted with no way of getting it back and no option for a refund?</p>

            <p>Actually, it may be that the item is not yet available on Windows 10. &nbsp;Are you able to check and see if it is still available on the 360 or the One?</p>

<p>I don't think the Windows 10 app is the issue. I went on Xbox.com and looked at my download history, found the item in question, clicked it and it gave me an error message. I then checked a random avatar item and that was available to download. So it appears
 that the Madden NFL 10 jersey avatar clothes have been wiped from the server (sorta like P.T. on PlayStation). It's just disappointing that I never deleted this item, assumed it was safe with my avatar stuff and then it's just secretly taken from me and I
 get no refund on my purchase.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade on Inspiron 14z - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade on Inspiron 14z</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my inspirion 14z from Windows 7 to windows 10. Firstly the start up has slowed down to about a minute compared to 30 seconds on windows 7. Secondly the laptop heats up a lot and whenever I restart it, I get a blue screen error and it
 restarts on its own and again goes to the blue screen error. This loops continuously until I manually hold the power button down. Then after letting it cool down for about 15mins it starts normally.</p>
<p>i think it crashes because of overheating. Anyone else facing the same problem? Any solutions? Do you guys think it could be a driver issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I wanted to know if the OS is installed on the SSD of the 14z or the HDD? And if on the HDD, will migrating it on the SSD solve my problems?</p>

            <p>Your best bet could be clean-install Windows 10, but I suppose you cannot do it because your Windows 10 is not yet activated. Therefore, what I suggest is, find/buy/borrow a notebook cooler and try to run your notebook on it. This may buy you some time to
 find out what&nbsp;is causing the heat buildup. You can open Task Manager and look at the processes tab. If you see something is consuming too much cpu usage, you may be able to kill that process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also could be as simple as dust build up on cpu heat sink or accidental blockage of the cpu cooler fan.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. My windows is activated according to the Activation tab in my update and security settings. But when I tried to clean-install windows 10, it said that i will not be able to go back to Windows 7 if I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unsure if this clean-install will definitely solve the over-heating issue. Do you think I have any other options?</p>

            <p>You can go back to Windows 7 if you have oem recovery disk or Windows 7 DVD disk. When it says you cannot go back to Windows7, it means that clean-install will wipe your hard disk and remove the backup files for your old OS (Windows.old folder).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot say clean-install will solve your problem but I am sure it will eliminate most of the problems carried over to Windows 10 thru the upgrade process. The decision is yours.</p>

<p>I installed NAV when I built the computer on 2/26. Updates worked automatically until after 4/16 (the last updates received).</p>
<p>I reset the update components both default and aggressive. Still getting the same error. I have the virtual XP Mode installed, but I don't see that should have any impact since it was installed in early March.</p>

<p>Hi DreadfulBag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! I understand that you're experiencing difficulty with Fable 3. Do you mind clarifying the issue present? Are you receiving any error messages or codes? You may want to try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power-cycle</a> on your console to begin troubleshooting this. </p>
<p>

<p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\ CurrentVersion\ProfileList</p>
<p>

<p>What errors? How do you know you have them? What makes you think they<br />
need to be corrected?</p>
<p>If you are considering running a Registry Cleaner, I <strong>strongly</strong><br />
recommend against it. Registry cleaning programs are <strong>all</strong> snake oil.<br />
Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the<br />
registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many<br />
people think, and what vendors of registry cleaning software try to<br />
convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt<br />
you. <br />
The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously<br />
removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit<br />
it may have. <br />

<p>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the<br />
use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause<br />
problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from<br />
the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry<br />
cleaner and never had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it<br />
the substantial <strong>risk</strong> of having a problem. And since there is no<br />
benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad<br />
bargain.</p>

</p><p>Depending on what you did, it's likely that the "Get Windows 10" icon will reappear.&nbsp; Also, just removing the icon may not delete some rather large files that may have been downloaded to your computer to "prepare your computer for installing Windows 10."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to be bothered by these effects, consider using GWX Control Panel from

<h2>            Windows PIN locked out - unable to reset</h2>
                    <p>I have a new PC with Windows 10 and when setting it up, I was locked out from using a PIN due to too many attempts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log on using my password, but I am unable to reset the PIN and use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise how this can be reset ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to eliminate the Password and&nbsp;PIN completely.&nbsp; It's ridiculous that I must use a password to get on my PC at home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>

<p>
</p><p>When setting up my new PC, I originally had a PIN and a Password to log onto my PC.
</p>
<p>

<p>Digital games are region locked to the country that it was bought in/the currency it was bought in but disc games on Xbox one are not region locked and all Xbox one disc games will work in any Xbox one.</p>

</p><p>For example, if you're in the USA and you buy a French code for a game it will not let you redeem it and vice-versa.</p>

<h2>            Question regarding Xbox Repair and DL&#39;d content.</h2>
                    
<p>After alot of trouble shooting, I'm having to send in my 4g Xbox 360 Slim (the one WITHOUT the removable hard drive) in for repair.&nbsp; Though, my question is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play Magic the Gathering on the Xbox 360, and have downloaded each of the 3 expansions, which cost 400 creds each - roughly $15.&nbsp; Now with sending my Xbox in for repair, if they can't fix it, refuse to fix it, or have to ship me a new refurbished Xbox
 360 Slim, will I have to repay to be able to play that downloaded content?&nbsp; Or does the information that I've downloaded it stay on my Xbox Live Account?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Battery - Charges to 80&#37; only</h2>
                    As I had Samsung Control Center, I could easely turn on and off Battery Life Extender (set whether battery was charged to 80% or 100%). But Windows 10 found this app as incompatible and it had to be uninstalled. Anyone knows how to set this function, so
 my laptop could be charged to 100% again?

            Hi, I'm also having the same issue - I had battery life extender turned on in my Samsung Settings before upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, but now I can't turn it off as Samsung Settings don't work with Windows 10. Are there any fixes for this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I found out that this setting can be changed by accessing UEFI BIOS, so there is a solution to this problem. But still there is no (at least known to us) software, which could set it up while working on Windows 10.</p>

I am having the same problems as everyone else... I tried the fix above, but it didn't work. There is no settings folder in any of the Samsung folders, I checked all my drives... nothing!! Does anyone know any other fixes or could explain what the fix discussed
 earlier (UEFI BIOS) was all about??

<p>Hello</p>
<p>While in Windows 10</p>
<p>Simply hit the RESET button hidden somewhere on your Laptop. (sometimes a pin hole on the back that requires an unfolded&nbsp;Paperclip to press)</p>
<p>The computer will shut down.</p>
<p>Nothing else will change.</p>
<p>When you re-start the computer the battery should be re-set and charge to 100%</p>

    <title>Cannot play any Xbox Original games. Previous fix suggestions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshwallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot play any Xbox Original games. Previous fix suggestions haven&#38;&#35;39&#59;t worked.</h2>
                    
<p>I read through the stickied post regarding playing original Xbox titles, and tried every suggestion that I could. I have cleared the system cache, reinstalled the system update, etc.
<strong>I have also confirmed that my games work on an original Xbox</strong> and that they are on the Backwards Compatibility list. All discs are in very good condition, minus one that isn't the best, but still plays on an original Xbox just fine.</p>
<p>The games are as follows:</p>
<p>Shenmue II<br />
Jade Empire<br />
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (1 &amp; 2)<br />
Panzer Dragoon Orta<br />
Fatal Frame II<br />
Jet Set Radio Future<br />
XIII</p>
<p>They are all disc versions, not downloadables. When I insert the disc into my Xbox 360, the dashboard recognizes the game (e.g. "Play Jet Set Radio Future"). However, when I try to play it, the screen fades to black as if it is about to start, then almost
 immediately gives me the error message, "<strong>The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again. For more help, visit www.xbox.com/support.</strong>"</p>
<p>I own an<strong> Xbox 360 S model with a 500GB HDD</strong>, which replaced the original HDD about two years ago. (The replacement HDD was a new-in-box official Xbox brand HDD, if that matters.) I am connected to Xbox Live Gold and have installed all system
 updates.</p>
<p>I recently purchased these games on the assumption that they would play on my 360, but I have not gotten them to work on my console all week. I tested them on an original Xbox (all work), but I do not have another Xbox 360 readily available with which to
 test them.</p>
<p>Please let me know what I'm missing here.</p>

<p>Just posting an update because I have seen multiple threads where the validity of the hard drive was the issue. I want to clarify that I purchased by replacement hard drive from Gamestop, and it was an official Microsoft-branded HDD, not a knock-off or third-party.
 The HDD has "XBOX 360" on the top of its black case, like so: <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/xbox-360/accessories/xbox-360-500gb-media-hard-drive/116104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.gamestop.com/.../116104</a></p>
<p>To my knowledge, Gamestop doesn't even carry any knockoffs, so it's a legitimate Microsoft drive. I used the Xbox brand HDD transfer tool to move my data from the original HDD to the new one and haven't had any issues to date. However, I've never tried playing
 original Xbox games on this console that I remember, so I can't confirm that they definitely worked on my last hard drive, either. This is my first time trying to play original Xbox titles since owning my Xbox 360 FAT roughly seven years ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, anybody have any ideas?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the 500gb hard drives were not available until August of 2014. So if it's possible to check exactly when it was purchased, that would narrow down if it definitely is real or not. Even though Gamestop doesn't generally sell knock-offs, it's
 not entirely impossible to not get one from them depending on if someone had possible returned one and swapped it out or something.
</p>
<p>Other than that, it just sounds like the hard drive does not have the emulation software needed. That can happen sometimes if it's been reformatted. Usually a way to check is by trying another game, but since you've tried several already, the only other
 thing I can suggest is to try another hard drive if possible.</p>
<p>@johnhuckabay - If you can post what console and hard drive you have, it might help as well.</p>

<p>Your console has to be connected to Live, and you must be signed in. Once you boot your game, it'll check to see if there's an emulation profile available for download. These are all separate from dashboard updates, and cannot be downloaded independently.
 Counterfeit HDDs are a common, although not the only reason why games refuse to boot.</p>

<h2>            My sound stopped working after either a java update or itunes. is there any way to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    I updated java just as it prompted and my itunes like normal, but after i turned it off overnight and started it up the next day, my sound just stopped working. i have volume keys on my keyboard and it usually works, but it's not working and the mute button
 usually lights up when it's mute so i tried pushing that button but it didn't react. also when i open my itunes now it just says that there's something wrong with my audio configuration and that audio/video playback may not work properly.. i then tried checking
 my sound options and it says my ATI HD Audio device is not plugged in.. i don't know what that means. i also tried the audio service on my laptop but it just stopped and didn't really change anything.. is there any way to fix this??

            <p>... from Microsoft?&nbsp; Or is there some manufacturer's bloatware running on the system that will supposedly do this for you?</p>
<p>Your audio device (hardware)&nbsp;was not made by Microsoft.&nbsp; The drivers that may be delivered to your computer may/may not be the latest drivers the actual manufacturer of your audio device has.&nbsp; It is quite likely they are not.</p>
<p>The hardware in your computer is supported on whatever OS you choose by the hardware manufacturer, not Microsoft (nor the makers of the other OSes you might have on that system.)&nbsp; If you want to be sure you have the latest drivers installed for your hardware
 (be it the motherboard chipset, video device, network device or audio device) you should figure out who manufactured the device(s) and visit those manufacturer's web pages to get the drivers you can install to make them communicate with the operating system
 of your choice.</p>
<p>Now - being that you have a laptop - even though you could go to the manufacturer's web pages for each individual device (and likely get things working just fine) it is better you go to the laptop manufacturer's web page and look up your model there.</p>
<p>What is the make/model of your laptop?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Try removing the Samsung devices and device drivers from the Devices and printers and also clean the registry (if any) and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Once after removing the Samsung devices download all the drivers etc from the Samsung site and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try to update the device drivers from the Samsung or from Windows update and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</span></strong><b><br />
