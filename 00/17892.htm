<p>I had this issue with one of the devices. removing the storage card while its booting fixed the issue. You might want to try that. If you still cannot access your device after that, then the problem is elsewhere.
 In which case I will recommend you do a hard reset. As you are probably aware, you will lose all your data and software that you installed.

<p>yes i did. i upgraded it from wm5 to wm6 by using the download i got from the o2 site before (<a href="http://www.seeo2.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.seeo2.com</a>) but the site doesn't exist anymore scince
 MWg aquired or bought the o2 company (i think?!). so i know its a legal upgrade ( i guess?!). then i installed the old TCPMP (the core pocket media player) software i was using 2 years ago with my o2 xda II. i also downloaded and installed Yahoo Go! 2.0 beta.
 do you think this is the culprit? you know, i also have another problem.... sometimes when i turn on my zinc, all i see is a white backgound! is this the same as the "reseting" problem everytime i turn it on? because since yesterday when i did what you said
 about removing the storage card during reboot the "reseting" problem hasn't occurred yet.... so i guess it kinda worked, but i still have the problem about that white background. i also have alot of calendar reminders everyday (like&nbsp; 20/day sometimes all at
 the same time slot, like 5 entries at the 8:30 slot, 5 entries at the 9am slot, etc.) do&nbsp;you think this also contributes to the problem? anyway, i'm so greatfull for your help, and i hope to hear from you soon....thanks in advance!!!</p>

            i suggest you re-install the upgrade again. Do not install any apps and see if you have the same issue. My thinking is that something went wrong with the rom upgrade.

            hi, its been a day and a half since i "re-upgraded" my zinc's rom. so far so good, i didn't install the tcpmp and the yahoo go yet, also, i followed the upgrade instructions carefully. i even restarted both the laptop and zinc prior to the upgrade and
 removed the storage and sim cards. let's see in about a week.... i'll keep you posted. thanks!!! pls update me if you have any new solutions... Thank you so much! oh, and if it's not to much to ask, would you happen to know where can i download&nbsp;a "free" media
 player that can play alot of file associations for my zinc and a dictionary too? but i wont install it yet, i'll wait a week. thanks again!

    <title>Duplicated birthday on Windows Calendar. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Duplicated birthday on Windows Calendar.</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I had to make a factory reset on my Nokia Lumia 720, and after that I discovered, that I have duplicated birthdays in both my Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 calendars. I tried linking and un-linking it with Skype and Facebook, but nothing worked
 :( It's really annoying to have doubled birthday dates. I did another reset, thinking it might be an issue during that one particular reset, but it didn't help. I looked into my Hotmail contacts and I noticed, that some contacts are double- or even triple
 linked to Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            This could be due to combining your facebook and twitter accounts into the single 'People' Hub.&nbsp; If you have the same people in multiple accounts, it can lead to duplication of their birthdays, etc.

<h2>            Why my 4g LTE windows phone is only working on 3g network with my t -mobile carrier</h2>
                    I've had my Microsoft 640 XL windows phone for over a year now, and it has always worked very well. However, lately I noticed that my 4g LTE network dropped to 3g with my family Mobile carrier, powered by t-mobile. Every time I call for answers, I am given
 a different answer and nothing is ever resolved. It is a 4g LTE phone, and my package is for 4g speeds. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?

<p>First check Mobile + Sim and that the highest connection speed is set to 4G</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that the 3G/4G icon on your phone is a "speedometer" it is only displaying &nbsp;the speed the network is transmitting at, so if they are not transmitting &nbsp;4G, your phone will display the speed they are.</p>

<p>Hi Rhonda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you have tried changing the SIM settings and mentioned that the issue started when your mobile carrier upgraded, it is best that you get in touched with your carrier to checked if there is an issue with the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>

<h2>            Offline&#47;saved folders have disappeared&#47;deleted</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office 2013 on Windows 10 Pro, and my saved folders in the left Folder Pane just auto-deleted along with&nbsp;the emails within them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although my internet connection has been fine, my ISP also hosts my email server, and I was getting error messages that accounts were not syncing the IMAP folder email, so we went in to investigate. Our incoming and outgoing mail servers
<em>were</em> popa.midco.net and smtpa.midco.net. Kind of odd with the <strong><em>a
</em></strong>added to the <em>pop </em>and the <em>smtp</em>, but at the time, that was how our ISP/Host had us set it up. Our email has been working flawlessly for a few years until recently, so&nbsp;it wasn't a problem with the way they were set up. However,
 in setting up another computer a year or so ago, we used the standard pop.midco.net and smtp.midco.net setting without the attached
<em><strong>a </strong></em>found on our work computers, and again, email worked great until recently. As we were trying to figure out with the ISP/Host why the issues had recently shown up, we decided to make the home and work computers all the same by dropping
 the <strong><em>a</em></strong> after the <em>pop</em> and <em>smtp </em>on the machines that had those. We went in and changed the settings in the account, and the minute we made the change on the default account, all of my saved folders quickly started removing
 themselves. I have searched everywhere to find them - deleted folders, trash folders, etc. - but I cannot find them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even installed Office on a laptop that did not have it previously, then&nbsp;recreated the outlook account on&nbsp;the laptop,&nbsp;and restored the .pst account to Outlook, but nothing is there. I have a backup, but it is not very current, so hopefully there is a way
 to get the current info back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a way to get back the folders and emails in those folders?</p>

            Correct - our ISP uses pop.midco.net, but that is for my IMAP account. They use pop3.midco.net for their POP accounts. Kinda screwy I know, but that is how they have it set up. And I am not sure if you are looking for something different in the Win version,
 but as mentioned in the 1st line, I am on Windows 10 Pro. I find the PST data file, but there is no longer anything there as far as my saved folders/emails.

            One other oddity I forgot about. I was logged in remotely to my work computer via LogMeIn (the host). The host computer is the one where I had the saved email folders, but it was the remote computer on which I changed the email settings. Once the changes
 were saved, I watched the folders start disappearing on the window that represented the host computer.

    <title>Excel using data within certain subsection of worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aiqbal87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel using data within certain subsection of worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to get your advice on the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet that contains sales person names and characteristics for that particular person in row format. For example:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Sales person Name</td>
<td># of accounts</td>
<td>
<p>average value of top 30% of accounts</p>
</td>
<td>average revenue from top 30% of accounts</td>
<td># of small accounts</td>
<td>Manager</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All the fields are already populated with data. One manager may have 10-20 different sales persons on their team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm trying to do is create a summary chart that shows each manager the sales person that has the min and max in all the different categories. What I need excel to do is go through the sheet and for each manager (50 different managers) pull the min,
 max, and name of each of the above categories (# of accounts, average total value of to 30% of accts, average revenue from top 30% of accounts, # of small accts, ect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using the =min(if), =max(if) combination of functions to try and pull the data and it seems to be successful getting it but the issue is excel is when I try to search the sheet to get the name of the planner with in the managers team that has the
 min or max number Excel is searching the full spreadsheet and because two sales people with different managers may have same number of accounts it's pulling the wrong name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I used to pull the min max numbers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{=MAX(IF(U2:U643=X7,C2:C643))} X7 contains the name of the manager I'm creating the summary for. I change this when I want a summary for a different manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>{=MIN(IF($U$2:$U$643=$X$7,C2:C643))}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I use the following function to try and pull the sales person name:</p>
<p>{=VLOOKUP(MAX(IF($U$2:$U$643=$X$7,C2:C643)),C:V,20,FALSE)}&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought was because the max function is pulling the right #, I could use it and do a vlookup and it would look in the right section of the worksheet and pull the name. I think this is where the issue lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I've described this as clearly as possible. I'm completely open to any and all suggestions. I'm happy changing the way I as thinking of solving this problem. I am not looking forward to chopping the worksheet up by manager and writing functions to
 get the min, max, name for 16 different categories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Asad</p>

<h2>            Bing quiz question error</h2>
                    I just wanted to point out an error in one of the questions in the quiz available on 5/15/2017<br />
The second question asks which of the listed traits makes a Whale a mammal, and the "Correct" answer is that it has lungs, and while it is true that all mammals have lungs it is not true that all animals that have lungs are mammals. I know this is minor but
 considering that marine sciences were my major in college, it was something that kept bugging me, thanks for taking some time out of your day.

<h2>            Reduce the size of a spreadsheet</h2>
                    <p>I have a user that somehow managed to format the maximum number of cells with a border around each cell.</p>
<p>When she tried to insert a new column, it failed.</p>
<p>I removed the formatting from all the unused cells and she is now able to insert columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to permanently remove the blank cells?</p>
<p>I have tried selecting all empty columns and choosing "Delete sheet columns," but I still have XWF columns.</p>
<p>As a result of having so many rows/columns, the file is 16MB; which causes very slow upload back to SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried copying the contents to a new spreadsheet, but all formatting is lost and they have extensive formatting and commenting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to remove the empty cells and reduce the size of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's your detailed Visio version number? Please click File &gt; Account &gt; About Visio to collect the version information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested in my Visio Pro for Office 365 with version 16.0.7301.1019 and 16.0.7301.1021.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue can be reproduced in both versions. When I tried to Crop a inserted picture, the picture is not displayed during the Crop:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d95db3f-60b4-4ce1-857f-2a6327b5ef43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d95db3f-60b4-4ce1-857f-2a6327b5ef43" /></a></p>
<p>But fortunately, the picture can be cropped successfully finally:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e134946-bfb5-4958-bcec-d4966b638741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e134946-bfb5-4958-bcec-d4966b638741" /></a></p>

<h2>            N8 swipe, from Nokia</h2>
                    
<p>Hi to everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologise if "reboot" has been explained / solved elsewhere here. I searched &amp; could not find it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just installed Nokia's own and new swipe application on my N8. After installation it asks me "reboot". I don't have the code for simple reboot but for hard reset (which I want to avoid). CAn anyone, please, tell me how I reboot the N8 (w/out losing data
 &amp; settings?).</p>
<p>I appreciate any help. Thanks in advance for your time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have found the solution! REBOOT means "soft reset"!</p>
<p>With *#7780# it finally works fine...!</p>
<p>I am have:</p>

<p>Release: PR1.0<br />
SW version: 011.012</p>
<p>Custom Version: 011.012.263.01</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swipe SW version: 1.00(13559)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish Nokia would use the correct terminology at least w/ their own SW! It's called "Soft Reset" not "Reboot"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks to everyone who helped! Much appreciated!</p>

    <title>iif Statement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.a.marshall  say:</h3>
<h2>            iif Statement</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I asked a question last week and received an answer which I thought worked... but I jumped the gun a bit. I'm not getting the result I need. I posted the question below but may need to clarify it a bit more, if I can:</p>
<p>On my criteria form I have 5 combo's in total. I want to be able to make 1 or more selections i.e. I might select 'combo 1'&nbsp; and not select anything in the other 4 combo's... or make a selection of more than 1.</p>
<p>In the report/query .... if I select combo 1 I want it to see all records matching combo 1. If I select Combo 1 and combo 3 I want to see all records matching combo 1 and combo 3. Combo's 2, 4 and 5 will have no selection made so will not be a filter at
 all, so all records I see match the combo's where I have made a selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Combo 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Combo 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Combo 3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Combo 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Combo 5</p>
<p>Selection Made&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No selection made&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Selection made&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No selection made&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No selection made</p>
<p>Must match&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doesn't filter at all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must match&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doesn't filter at all&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Doesn't filter at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically if I make a selection in one or more of the combo's, as in the example above, the report/query would only show records which match combo1 and combo 3 (in the same record).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your assistance</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Original question</p>
Hi All, I have a field in a table (number,Long) populated by a combo box on a form. The field is not populated in all records i.e. some have a name selected, others do not so it is empty.<br />
<br />
I am now doing a report and having trouble getting the result I want.<br />
<br />
I have a form for criteria for the report. On the form I have a combo box (same as the main data entry screen) to select the criteria i.e. the person't name. Sometimes I want to select a name, other times I do not i.e. nothing selected. (there are other criteria).<br />
<br />
What I want to see in the report:<br />
<br />
if I select a particular name, I only want to see records that match the selection made i.e. match person 1 and null values i.e. records in person 1 with no name.<br />
<br />
I do not want to see other names.<br />
<br />
Alternatively,if no selection is made I want to see all records<br />
<br />
I have the following iif statement in the query, it gives me records matching person 1 as my criteria but not records that have no name.<br />
<br />
=IIf([Forms]![fdlgRptReport3a]![cboPerson1] Is Not Null,[Forms]![fdlgRptReport3a]![cboPerson1],[Forms]![fdlgRptReport3a]![cboPerson1] Or Is Null)<br />
<br />
I've tried other combinations but can't seem to get it right.... any ideas?<br />
<p>
</p><p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The method described by Karl is the most efficient, and you should have no problem implementing it with only five controls as parameters, provide that the query is saved in SQL view, never in design view, which will move things around, and at best obscure
 the logic, at worst make the query too complex to open.<br />
<br />
The following is from one of my demo files, and references three combo boxes in which a county, district and parish can be selected.&nbsp; The form's RecordSource is the following query, which references the controls as parameters:<br />
<br />
SELECT Counties.County, Districts.District, Parishes.Parish, <br />
Locations.Location, Parishes.ParishID &nbsp;<br />
FROM ((Counties INNER JOIN Districts ON Counties.CountyID = Districts.CountyID) &nbsp;<br />
INNER JOIN Parishes ON Districts.DistrictID = Parishes.DistrictID) &nbsp;<br />
INNER JOIN Locations ON Parishes.ParishID = Locations.ParishID &nbsp;<br />
WHERE (Counties.CountyID=[Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoCounty] <br />
&nbsp; OR [Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoCounty] IS NULL) <br />
AND (Districts.DistrictID=[Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoDistrict] <br />
&nbsp; OR [Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoDistrict] IS NULL) <br />
AND (Parishes.ParishID=[Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoParish] <br />
&nbsp; OR [Forms]![frmDrillDown_Simple]![cboGotoParish] IS NULL)<br />
ORDER BY County,District,Parish;<br />
<br />
In each combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure the combo boxes below it in the hierarchy are requeried&nbsp; The way it works is that each parameter is referenced as follows:<br />
<br />
(SomeColumn = SomeParameter<br />
&nbsp; OR SomeParameter IS NULL)<br />
<br />
If a value is selected in the parameter combo box rows will be returned only where the value at the SomeColumn column position equals the value selected in the combo box.&nbsp; If the combo box is left empty, NULL, on the other hand all rows will be returned because
 the expression SomeParameter IS NULL will be TRUE regardless of the value at the column position.<br />
<br />
Expressions like the above are then tacked together in AND operations:<br />
<br />
(SomeColumn = SomeParameter<br />
&nbsp; OR SomeParameter IS NULL)<br />
AND (SomeOtherColumn = SomeOtherParameter<br />
&nbsp; OR SomeOtherParameter IS NULL)<br />
AND (YetAnotherColumn = YetAnotherParameter<br />
&nbsp; OR YetAnotherParameter IS NULL)<br />
<br />
This can be continued for more parameter controls in the form of course.&nbsp; Each parenthesized OR operation will, by virtue of its inclusion in parentheses, evaluate to TRUE or FALSE independently.&nbsp; By virtue of the AND operations rows will be returned only where
 all of the parenthesized OR operations evaluates to TRUE.<br />
<br />
You'll find the demo from which the above query is taken as ComboDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the option to "Open simplified form for 'drilling down' through hierarchies to return records" is the relevant one to look at.&nbsp; To see how the combo boxes are, in this example, correlated so that a County is selected first, then a district,
 then a parish, study the RecordSource properties of the combo boxes in my demo, and the code in their AfterUpdate event procedures.&nbsp; The same query would work equally well if the combo boxes were not correlated, however.<br />
<br />
The same demo also contains a more complex example where the hierarchy can be entered at any point, rather than having to start at the top and work down.<br />
<br />
In your case a complicating factor is the use of LEFT OUTER JOINs. If a query using such a join is restricted on a table on the right side of the join,&nbsp; this conflicts with the basis of an outer join of course, so, in effect, the join becomes an INNER JOIN.&nbsp;
 You might find it better to leave the query unrestricted therefore, and filter the report by building a string expression as the WhereCondition argument of the OpenReport method.&nbsp; The following code is an example, using four unbound controls in a form, of
 code in the Click event procedure of the form<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strWhere As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.cboDepartment) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = strWhere &amp; " And Department = """ &amp; Me.cboDepartment &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.cboCity) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = strWhere &amp; " And City = """ &amp; Me.cboCity &amp; """"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.txtDateFrom) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = strWhere &amp; " And DateAppointed &gt;= #" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(Me.txtDateFrom, "yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.txDateTo) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = strWhere &amp; " And DateAppointed &lt; #" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(Me.txDateTo, "yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#+1"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strWhere = Mid(strWhere, 6)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenReport "rptEmployees", View:=acViewPreview, WhereCondition:=strWhere<br />
<br />
BTW the DatabaseBasics demo, in the same OneDrive folder to which I referred you to above, also contains an example of how a query using a LEFT OUTER JOIN can be restricted on a column in the table on the right of the join, while preserving the unmatched rows
 to the left of the join.&nbsp; It does this by joining a table to a subquery in which the restriction is undertaken.<br />

    <title>How to Access Microsoft Account &#34;Services&#47;Apps&#34; from Your - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Access Microsoft Account &#34;Services&#47;Apps&#34; from Your Account Page EASIER</h2>
                    <p>I am at times finding it frustrating when I log into my various Microsoft Accounts. Over the years it has been Live, LiveID and incorporated new and acquired elements that Microsoft I'm assuming wants to have all under one umbrella, which is nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it amazing how many ways there actually are to access your Microsoft Account. It's a dizzying array of various website links that all lead back to essentially the same spot. Now this would all be well and fine if it truly would be easier to access
 the services from the Microsoft Account page. I'm not talking about logging in on your computer user account, I'm speaking about when using a local user account in Windows 8.1 and you want to use say OneDrive. Easy enough if I have a link/favorite to OneDrive
 itself you could simply go to&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the past year I have tried to figure out what the core actual true link to a Microsoft Account, where I can log in, and access all the services. The three I have narrowed it down to are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com</a></li><li><a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a></li><li><a href="https://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://profile.live.com</a></li></ol>
<p>I'm assuming #2 is the end-goal as the other ones have "live" in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first 2 will take me to my Microsoft Account where I am pleasantly greeted with "Hi ...,&nbsp;Here's where you manage your account." Makes sense... but from my Account page shouldn't it be easy enough to start using one of the services? The only way I have
 found from this main account page, is by clicking on the image/avatar to "Change Picture." Even though I have no intention of changing my picture, it appears to be the only clickable item on my Microsoft Account page that will bring me to a section of my account
 where the "9-digit/keypad/apps icon" - you know the one, the "Google-style" apps button to access these services! Beside it is the "Profile" button which interestingly when clicked, goes to #3 (<a href="https://profile.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://profile.live.com</a>/...)
 - so you are still actively using "Live"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am missing something obvious, I apologize, but I find it quite frustrating to login to my Microsoft Account and have to hunt around for the apps associated with my account. So my temporary solution is to NOT login to my Microsoft Account at&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;which
 seems pointless unless you want to change a security feature of your account or the data associated with it, but to pick one of the applications I use most, for example OneDrive like I said before, create a link to it (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a>)
 and then I know I will have access to the OTHER services/apps from there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a suggestion, would it not make sense to simply add a "Go to your Apps" button on your Microsoft Account page? Or borrow what Google does and simply create an extra addition to the domain and have all your customers link to, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/services</a>, or</li><li><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/apps</a></li></ul>
<p>That would enable easy access to all the services from one link, and then, should I wish to look at or change my account settings, go up a level or remove the text after the "/"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if I am missing something obvious and simple, and there is a link that does just what I am looking for, I would sincerely appreciate any assistance. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 - rule to reply using specific template not sending specific template</h2>
                    I'm trying to get a specific email to send to specific people when they respond to a "voting button" email.&nbsp; I have my .oft template(s) set up and have configured my rules however I've had only two successful tests of the automatic response.&nbsp; I've tried
 to use both an html template and a text only template and it just is not working.&nbsp; I've been playing with different ways to set up the rule but none of them have worked with any consistency.&nbsp; Right now I have my rule set up as: with specific words (all three
 voting button choices so the responder doesn't actually have to know the answer to my question) in the message subject; from people or public group (listed each person in the group in the from field) and the action is to reply using my specific template.&nbsp;
 Does anyone have a fix for the rule not working or suggestions as to why it is not working?

            <p><span>Hello Richard,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and I will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better
 assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Have you installed all the pending updates (including optional updates)?
</span><span>Check if there is any&nbsp;update left to install?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Mostly these type of issues occur when&nbsp;Bluetooth drivers are not installed correctly and interference with other devices.
</span><span>Letâ€™s work together to get this problem resolved.</span><span> </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step&nbsp;1:</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check the <strong>Bluetooth service status to â€œAutomaticâ€:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a.&nbsp;Press <strong>â€œWindows Logoâ€ + â€œRâ€ </strong>keys from the keyboard, Run window opens.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b.&nbsp;Type â€œ<strong>Services.msc</strong>â€ without quotes and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. <strong>Right click</strong> on&nbsp;<strong>Bluetooth support service</strong>&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d.&nbsp;Set the&nbsp;<strong>Startup type</strong>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<strong>Automatic</strong>&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try to uninstall and reinstall the Bluetooth Drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to uninstall and reinstall the driver:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Uninstall the Bluetooth Device Drivers</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a)&nbsp;Press â€œ<strong>Windows Logoâ€ + â€œXâ€</strong> keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b)&nbsp;Click on â€œ<strong>Device Manager</strong>â€ from that list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c)&nbsp;Search for the Bluetooth device from the device list, right click on it and then select â€œ<strong>Uninstall</strong>â€. On
</span><span>the un-installation window, if you have an option: â€œ<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>â€ you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d)&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the restart, you may again open the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;and then click on the â€œ<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>â€ button at the top of the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;window and check if Windows&nbsp;detects the Bluetooth
 device and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also refer to the articles given below:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/why-isnt-windows-finding-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why isn't Windows finding my device?</a></span></strong><span>&nbsp;(Holds good for Windows 10 Insider Preview)</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the section: (<strong>Make sure Bluetooth enabled and other wireless devices are on and discoverable</strong>).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you</span></p>

            <p>Art2016 did not say they were using Outlook.com to access their Hotmail account.&nbsp; All that we know from the original title is that Windows 10 is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Art2016 asked if there was a way to add folders.</p>
<p>You replied yes there is.&nbsp; How is that a helpful answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add folders to a Hotmail account, you must login to the account using a browser.</p>
<p>Now the question is what is the 'new Hotmail'?&nbsp; If you login and see Outlook.com, then right click on Folders, Add a new folder or right click on a folders, New subfolder.</p>
<p>If you see Outlook Mail, move the mouse cursor to the folder pane.&nbsp; Left click on the + sign that appears by Folders to create a new folder.&nbsp; Or right click on a folder, Create new subfolder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the folders are created, you can save emails to the folders using browser access or when accessing the account using the Windows 10 Mail app.</p>

<h2>            Which online folder is syncing in Onedrive for Business&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an unusual question.&nbsp; How do I see where my OneDrive for Business sync client is putting the files online?&nbsp;My normal Onedrive folder is not where they are being sync'd to. After having many sync issues, I had to create a new library. However, I cannot
 find this library in O365 online.&nbsp; Is there a way to see the sync settings to see what the URL of the sync folder is?
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hi jason2014,</p>
<p>we can see the url of the sync folder. please follow the steps below:<br />
1. for the legacy onedrive for business sync client, we can get the url by right-clicking the file stored in the client and choose
<strong>onedrive for business</strong>, either choose <strong>go to browser</strong>,
<strong>copy link</strong> or <strong>shareâ€¦</strong> to get the full url of the file and library which it is stored in.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=77380efd-7f42-4fc1-85d4-1012813b6d63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d77380efd-7f42-4fc1-85d4-1012813b6d63" /></a></p>
<p>2. for the next-gen onedrive for business sync client, we can also right-click the file and choose
<strong>more onedrive sharing options</strong> and <strong>view online</strong> to get the full url of the file and library which it is stored in.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e5f053e5-7c7a-4cc9-a84f-f1d8a993e743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de5f053e5-7c7a-4cc9-a84f-f1d8a993e743" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Mayra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. My husband spoke with an IT person in his department and he contacted me. I, in fact, by some strange occurrence had a folder labeled "Junk Email" as well as another labeled "Junk." Once I deleted the "Junk"
 folder the emails stopped. In fact, my junk emails were actually going into the Junk Email folder. So for me this problem ended up being as simple as deleting a "duplicate" folder. Thanks again for contacting me.</p>

</p><p>I am trying to write a macro to execute vlookup, sumif and replace through command button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In sheet1 data is combined in one cell with comma separator.</p>
<p>In sheet2 data is separated in two columns</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a common value in both sheets which is REFERENCE NO (21 digits).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In sheet1 data, REFERENCE NO is placed between 2nd &amp; 3rd comma group.</p>
<p>In sheet2 data, REFERENCE NO is placed in column A:A</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>what i want macro to do is, to select the reference no in sheet1 and by checkin this number in sheet2, sum its respective value in column B:B. this sumif result to be replaced with value between 14th &amp; 15th comma. incase reference number is not found in
 sheet2 then do nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">FOR EXAMPLE:</span></p>
<p>SELECT the REFERENCE NO from sheet1 data</p>
<p>AND &nbsp;VLOOKUP this number in sheet2 column A:A and SUMIF the respective value in column B:B &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note: reference no are repeated in sheet2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>take the SUMIF value and replace this &nbsp;sheet1 &nbsp;between 14th &amp; 15th comma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it make sense&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Dear Asadakhatar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can write on Macro on this problem by this method Run Macro to record the following steps&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the entire range of A:A (Range of Data) and click on Alt+A+E (Text to data) and then delimited followed by Next Select Comma and _ in Other Tab and then finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>By following this way your data will shattered into the columns and close the recording of Macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this it is upto you which method you want to use to extract relevant data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Macro so recorded can be used for repetitive works &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with a particular website but other sites can be accessed. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sometimes websites don't look like you expect them toâ€“images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. This might be caused by a compatibility
 problem between Internet&nbsp;Explorer and the site you're on. Sometimes this can be fixed by adding the site to your Compatibility View list.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if they help:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try using Internet Explore in no add-ons mode referring to the steps mentioned below and check if that works:</span></p>

<h3> research - communicate  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 copy &#39;design ideas&#39; slide layout</h2>
                    I have used a 'design ideas' theme in a PowerPoint 2016 presentation and want to apply it to all slides. Problem is the graphic elements as laid out in the design idea don't appear on the slide master or any of the available design themes. I can't even
 select the graphic elements from the screen to copy them onto the slide master. They also cover a logo I have on the original slide background. I can of course copy or duplicate one of the design slides each time I want to make a new one but this seems very
 clunky and I still can't manipulate the elements to reveal my logo. Any ideas would be very gratefully received.

<p>If you want to use the layout repeatedly, the best bet might be to make a new layout that matches it.&nbsp; There might be some cleverer way of doing it but I'd save the slide as an image, go into the Slide Master and insert a new blank layout.&nbsp; Then set the
 layout's background to be the image you just saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can add placeholders and such, size and move them around to match their positions on the original slide w/o accidentally selecting and moving the background image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When done, you can change to another background image or just reset the background to a plain color, gradient or whatever.</p>

<p>Hi Tina.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve's workaround worked perfectly - just needed a few steps to set up the various design templates that 'Design Ideas' supplied for title page, content page, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will send through the information to you as soon as I can...</p>
