<h2>            Fifa 13 - Career mode - camera problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have problem with dynamics or pro (I don't remember now) camera in career mode ( Fifa 2013).</p>
<p>I'm playing now 3th season. Today my camera changed view.</p>
<p>I didn't change any options of camera (intentionally).</p>

<p>Before changes I saw my player on the pitch all the time. I had view on his back. I attacked<span>
<span>in the direction of</span> <span>goal (I saw goalkeeper from opposing team).</span></span></p>
<span>in the direction of</span> <span>goal (I saw goalkeeper from opposing team).</span></span></p>

<p>Now camera is following the ball so I don't see my player if I'm not in within "ball zone'.</p>
<p>When I'm attacking I see my defense instead opposing team defense and their GK. I see my player from the front. This cameras view doesn't let me play well.</p>

<p>What is happend ? Can someone help me ?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>This may sound like a weird question, but I don't think it was clarified in the opening post. Have you tried to change the camera settings back to the way they were in the settings menu?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for my languages. I'm still learning english. I tried to explain as the best as I can.</p>
<p>I'd like to say that standard view camera for career mode &nbsp;stoped work properly. Others camera view are working right for example: TV, Co-op, Broadcast... Career mode has specific view when your control one player, it's view behind your player and camera
 follow your player.</p>
<p>Now, camera follow the ball and the view looks like camera view rotated 180 degrees.</p>
<p>I tried reset settings to default mode but nothings changed.</p>
<p>thank you for repley.</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4&#58; Already participating in championship</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
So I've been playing Forza for the last two months or so and I never had any problems, but this summer I can't participate in any racing challenges. I can do the weekly Forzathon challenge and also the PR-stunts. When I try to start any racing season event
 it always gives me a warning before the race that I'm already participating in another championship and if I want would like to cancel the current one. If I press no I can't do anything and if I press yes I start the race, but apparently not the summer games
 challenge.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)">
Anyone with similiar problems can help me out?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to this Community for advice on how to fix this in game issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can totally understand how not being able to access special game modes the way that one is supposed to could be confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest though, seeing that this is an issue that is in-game that you try and bring this to the
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Forza Motorsport Forums
</a>for a little more input and clarity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, head over there and let us know how that helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>BSoD potentially caused by network issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSoD potentially caused by network issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi, everyone! I have a Windows 7 system (64-bit Home Premium), and an ISP of CenturyLink (how sad). Unfortunately, I am having some network issues that eventually culminated into a BSoD. First off, for a long time, we've been having bad ping. Usually, it
 maintains 30-80 ms, but often, ping will be 100-300ms. This seriously is affecting Minecraft mutiplayer performance. Sometimes, lag may get as bad as 800ms ping. Now, today, after running a tracert via the Command Prompt, I found something horrible. Now, the&nbsp;<em>physical
 modem </em>is taking a long time to respond. It's ping time can range from 1ms to 1000ms+. Fortunately, after a computer &amp; router reboot, the ping had reinstated to normal 1-20ms ping. But the worst problem comes in now. When I attempted to reboot the computer,
 when the system was about to shut down, the dreaded BSoD came with an even bigger problem. The STOP code was completely undocumented!</p>

<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<em>-- %systemroot% is the environment variable for your Windows directory. For example, C:\Windows.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all .DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop, create a new folder on the Desktop to put these .DMP files in, and then zip the folder. You can then either use a 3rd party tool such as 7-Zip/Winrar, or you can use Windows'
 default method of zipping folders.<br />

<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the .ZIP containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel Memory Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel Memory Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel Memory Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel Memory Dump is
 the best choice. Do note that Kernel Memory Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong>
</em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />

After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -

<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

<h2>            Keyboard Causes Crash</h2>
                    <div>Updated &nbsp;to Windows 8.1 from 8</div>
Using on screen keyboard, normal keyboard crashes to BSoD with error: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (kbdclass.sys) Temporary fix is to uninstall&nbsp;driver "HID Keyboard Device" and then scan for changes in Device Manager. Only works for a minute then crashes.
<div>
<div>
<div>Tried to update drivers, already have most updated ones. </div>
<div>Did sfc /scannow : "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</div>

    <title>807b0190 AND 8007045D - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nykyrian-ebab1e66-4603-4725-8de4-a12ab1cf2814  say:</h3>
<h2>            807b0190  AND  8007045D</h2>
                    
<p>I live in the US., South Carolina, Chester County.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;noticed that I lost all of my xbox live channels except for <em>Friends</em> and
<em>my Xbox</em> shortly after installing the update that&nbsp;installed all of the kinect options. Eventually I started getting the error code 807b0190 with the following message:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">Some xbox live content is temporarily unavailable. You can still access your profile, communicate with other players, and play games online.---- The content will automatically appear when it's available. Status code 807b0190</span></p>
<p>For the first month, this message would appear and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
after</span> playing a game the channels would appear (approx an hour or more). I was able to watch movies and&nbsp;new trailers as well as download the ocassional funky game. Since March of this year I have rarely been able to get on the channels and watch 30 min
 of a movie and haven't recieved any system or game update correctly since if any at all. So far these are the steps I have taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have gotten a new Lynksys&nbsp;E2000 advanced wireless N router&nbsp;to match the console( so I do not have a cable running between rooms.) Using a mixed security of WPA2&amp;WPA
</li><li>I am 15 feet from the router and modem with nothing in-between but sheetrock and fiberglass.
</li><li>&nbsp;I have upgraded my internet service from 3megs to 10megs with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Truvista (ISP)</span>&nbsp; using a new-out of the box- ZYXEL P-663HN-51 modem. </li><li>I have cleared the Cache on xbox. </li><li>I have went through every file that I can to look for yellow triangles and corrupted data. I removed anything unecessary that I don't use anymore.
</li><li>Tried to reinstall the update...(will not initiate) </li><li>I have made sure that my account settings are all open on xbox and set to adult.
</li><li>My NAT settings are open and my UPNP is enabled for universal play. </li><li>I have transfered everything from the xbox to my ext.harddrive and formatted (this I find weird because after formatting it didn't do an update, perhaps because it is the slim version?) the harddrive, recovered my gamertag (ONLY my gamertag)&nbsp;and tried to
 connect. Still the same error code <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">807b0190</span> when gamertag was recovered.
</li><li>I then transfered all of my data back to the harddrive, double checking for the yellow triangle.
</li><li>I then went into the router and released, renewed, and refreshed the IP Address twice. (this was after all of the above and then&nbsp;trying to matchmake with friends and I could not join them on halo, which has never never given me a problem)
</li></ul>
<p>Now, I was somewhat okay (emotionally) after all this when I remembered that I could log in on my PC and order my games through xboxlive.com and my downloads and licences. Well I purchased the games I wanted and tried to download to the XBOX, I had to go
 in manually because they didn't start by themselves&nbsp;so by going into download history and hitting download I&nbsp;get&nbsp;error&nbsp;8007045D with the following:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">Can't retrieve infromation from xbox LIVE. Please try again later. Status code 8007045D</span></p>
<p>Now, I did the xbox Live test connection....I got all the little green dots to connect and the status of connected. I pressed Y for status and recieved this special collection of digits:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">error status report</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">W: 0000-0021</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">X:0000-F001</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">Y:20A8-4840</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">Z:0000-0000</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">ID:FFFF-FFFF</span> </li></ol>
<p>Someone please tell me what I need to do next, or something else I can try besides beat everything with a hammer and call it a day. I'm about outta ideas...Now, please note that through ALL of this Halo Reach is still working and matcmaking with no problem
 while I do have issues with Black op's(This may be due to the update like most others)

<p>I have qued items, yes... after babying the xbox ALL day I finally got the items to pend and download
</p>
<p>COPIED TEXT FROM ABOVE:</p>
<p>I had to go in manually because they didn't start by themselves so by going into download history and hitting download I get error 8007045D with the following:</p>
<p>Can't retrieve infromation from xbox LIVE. Please try again later. Status code 8007045D</p>
<p>Now, I did the xbox Live test connection....I got all the little green dots to connect and the status of connected. I pressed Y for status and recieved this special collection of digits:</p>
<p>1.error status report</p>
<p>2.W: 0000-0021</p>

<p>4.Y:20A8-4840</p>
<p>5.Z:0000-0000</p>
<p>6.ID:FFFF-FFFF</p>
<p>END OF COPIED TEXT FROM ABOVE:</p>
<p>Now, after I sent my history of what I have done so far, I decided to try some other fixes I read online.. I tried connecting my Xbox directly to my modem. This did not work as it wouldn't let me connect to the internet, according to the Xbox Live test I
 ran. It told me that my MTU was too low...funny it was connected directly to the modem....I open all the ports on the router and tried to reconnect wirelessly, still nothing. I moved the xbox into a completly diffrent room WITH the router and modem. I reclosed
 all of the ports and reset everything. I have now hardwired my xbox to the Router (model type, see above)...</p>
<p>I am still recieving the same two messages...but, one thing I have noted is that I get all of my XBOX LIVE access during off-peak hours like 3am to 7am.. at least it seems like it most of the time, I will keep sending info as I get it because technically
 this is driving me nuts...I just want to be able to use the XBOX with all its features the way it was meant to...I just want to fix it.........ty.</p>

<p>Hey Babu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see you are having a problem in which your controller will continuously un-sync from your console upon turning it off. If you haven't already done so, go ahead and
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update its firmware.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to Xbox Live on your Xbox One console and install the latest system update if prompted to do so.
</li><li>If you have a stereo headset adapter, plug it into the bottom of your controller so it can also get updates.
</li><li>If you're using a stereo headset adapter, plug in a headset (a headset must be plugged in so the adapter will turn on).
</li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox </strong>button to open the guide. </li><li>Select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Kinect &amp; devices</strong> &gt; <strong>
Devices &amp; accessories</strong>, and then select the controller you want to update.
</li><li>Select <strong>Device info</strong>, select the <strong>Firmware version</strong> box, and then select
<strong>Continue</strong>. </li><li>When the update is complete, you can update additional controllers. If they can only be updated via USB, see
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter#update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update via USB</a>. Otherwise, select the <strong>Update another</strong> button on the screen after the first update is complete, and then follow the steps.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes! Cheers :D</p>

</p><p>Thanks for keeping us updated, and sorry for the confusion. So in this case, I still think an

update for the controller </a>is a good place to start. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Get the app from Microsoft Windows 10 by searching for "Xbox Accessories." </li><li>Launch the Xbox Accessories app. </li><li>Connect your Xbox One Wireless Controller by using a USB cable or the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You'll be prompted to update to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition if you haven't yet done so.
</li><li>When the controller is connected, you'll see the message <strong>Update Required</strong> if an update is mandatory. Install the update.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You can also go to <strong>Device Info</strong> to check for an update.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox Accessories app is available only on Windows 10. </li><li>Controllers that don't have a built-in 3.5-mm audio port must be updated using a USB connection and must have the Windows 10 TH2 Update (or later).
</li><li>Updating the controller over Bluetooth is not supported. </li><li>Bluetooth requires a PC running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hey there Babu!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to use your new controller.
</p>
<p>I would say that if the previously posted troubleshooting steps don't help, you may want to try the steps at the bottom of
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/accessories/connect-and-troubleshoot-xbox-one-bluetooth-issues-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect and troubleshoot Bluetooth on your Xbox One Wireless Controller</a>. </p>
<p>I know that this controller is new, but I would also see if this happens if you try another controller if you can.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give those steps a shot and let us know how that helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

 It's just the speakers themselves that don't seem to be working.&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated.<br />

            Hi Dami
<br />
<br />Do you want to change the font size or the actual font system wide in Windows 10?
<br />
<br />Change Font Size:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Ease of Access - Display
<br />
<br />At the top of that page is a slider that will increase or decrease the font size in the Windows UI
<br />
<br />If you need more control over the fonts in Windows 10, that feature was removed form Windows by Microsoft a couple of years ago, most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes . . .etc. anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker: 
<br /><a href="https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6911-winaero-tweaker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6911-winaero...</a>

    <title>Trouble with Windows Fax and Scan after Anniversary Update - migration - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble with Windows Fax and Scan after Anniversary Update - migration of old faxes, assigning fax modems on account without admin rights</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 anniversary update caused a lot of trouble on the App "Windows Fax and Scan".</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE FIX THESE FOR THE NEXT UPADATE - everybody will have these Problems!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When updating from Win 7 to Win 10 I had to solve two problems manually - exactly the two problems listed below. I somehow got around and was happy to have it running.</p>
<p>A while ago I received the anniversary update to latest Win 10. Surprisingly, it came as a complete new installation and not just as an update to be integrated into the existing Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As consequence, I was back in all the hassle with "Windows Fax and Scan". These are the two problems I faced, and they need to be solved in the code of Windows 10 for the next update, if you want to have customers loving Win 10...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. "Windows Fax and Scan" uses a dedicated folder to save sent and incoming faxes. For which reason ever, fax files are only shown in the app, if the file name follows a dedicated rule. Currently, my system uses file names looking like this: "S-1-5-21-2479xxxxxx-8080xxxxx-3180xxxxx-1001$201d217138111f1.tif"
 The App only shows files starting with "S-1-5-21-2479xxxxxx-8080xxxxx-3180xxxxx-1001$201". Unfortunately the new installation of Win 10 anniversary edition caused this unique number to change, so all my old received and sent faxes were not shown in the new
 app, even though being available in the correct folder. The solution was to manually rename them from the old unique number to the new unique number.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution to solve the problem for the next&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;update: Please either keep the unique name the same or alternatively provide a migration from the old file names to the new ones next time you provide an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. I use 2 accounts on Win 10, one is the administrator account and the other is the daily use account without admin rights. I ususally work on the account without admin rights. After the update to anniversary edition, the fax modem was not assigned to the
 new fax account any more. When trying to assign the fax, this did not work. There was a symbol indicating admin rights being required. When starting Windows Fax and Scan with admin rights, I could assign the fax modem properly. However, when trying to send
 a fax later I noticed, that the fax modem had been assigned to the fax account only when running Fax and Scan from the admin account. When running from daily use account, the modem was still not assigned. My solution was to temporarily give the daily account
 admin rights, then I could properly assign the modem. After installation I took admin rights away from this account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution to solve the problem for the next&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;update: Please allow to assign a fax modem to the fax account without requiring admin rights. If this is not possible, please make sure that the modem is assigned to the account Windows Fax and Scan are
 running from.</p>

<h2>            notepad file&#39;s text content gets lost when pressing ctrl&#43;z and ctrl&#43;y</h2>
                    So, this was interesting and happened to me. I am using windows 8.1 OS's notepad. I create a notepad text file first in a directory. Then I save it. Then I close the file. Then I return to the directory. I (accidentally) press ctrl+z keys which means undo
 so the file disappears. To get the file back, I press ctrl+y which means redo in most text files and command lines? So, but it appears that the notepad file's contents are gone. It was just interesting. Is this special to notepad or other files can get affected
 generally, i haven't tested but, it was just interesting so i decided to ask or discuss here. I was writing a diary kind of thing anyway so, i guess the content wasn't so important. Yeah. I also would like to say hello to the community. &nbsp;Hi. Yeah.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you save the notepad and reopen it and press Ctrl+Z. It will not delete the data in it. If you type something and press Ctrl+Z, then the data which is not saved will disappear.&nbsp;And, also&nbsp;Ctrl+Y&nbsp;will not work on Notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to run SFC scan and check.</p>

    <title>KERNELBASE.dll Application crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mentis_venator  say:</h3>
<h2>            KERNELBASE.dll Application crash</h2>
                    I've experienced a program crash involving the file KERNELBASE.dll while attempting to open Corel VideoStudio, at first I thought it was due to that software, so I uninstalled that and reinstalled it and the crash still happened. I used that Tweakfix software,
 which fixed what it said it would, but the crash still happened. I don't know what exactly is wrong and it might be a symptom of a much larger problem (as it can lead to the BSOD in some cases) can someone help me out with this?
