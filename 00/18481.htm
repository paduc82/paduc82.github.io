    <title>Outlook 2016 freezing when trying to save PDF attachments to network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fourthunders  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 freezing when trying to save PDF attachments to network file shares</h2>
                    <p>We use Office 2016 in our environment, with a mix of Windows 7 and 10 workstations.&nbsp; We have an ongoing issue in Outlook with saving PDF attachments directly from emails to our network file shares.<br />
<br />
When attempting to save one(or multiple) PDF attachment(s) to our network file shares, a progress window comes up and immediately freezes.&nbsp; It usually takes about 1 minute for the transfer process to complete.&nbsp; Often, though, Outlook will freeze completely
 during the file transfer, and the transfer will fail, leaving behind .tmp files in the desired save location on the network file share.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Additional notes:<br />
The PDF files can be saved directly to the workstation's local drive without issue, and can then be copied/transferred over to the network file share with no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
The PDF files can be manually dragged one-by-one from the email window to a File Explorer window pointing to the network share without issue.<br />
All other file types(Word, Excel, text, images, etc) can be saved directly from an email attachment to the network file shares with no issues.&nbsp; This issue is specific to PDFs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have done the following:</p>
<p>Ran Outlook in safe mode</p>
<p>Disabled all add ins in Outlook</p>
<p>Re-built users' local Outlook profiles</p>
<p>Repaired Office 2016</p>
<p>Re-installed Office 2016</p>
<p>Checked Event Viewer, but no events are present</p>
<p><br />
This issue is occurring on all workstations in our environment.&nbsp; For now, the work around is to have our staff manually save the attachments to a location on their local drives, and then copy them over to the network file shares, but we would like to resolve
 this issue.&nbsp; I have been unable to find any information online on a possible fix.&nbsp; We keep our Office and Windows installs current with all updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Has anyone experienced this issue, and is anyone aware of any possible solutions?&nbsp; We appreciate any help.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello FourThunders,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already uninstalled and reinstalled Outlook, it seems that the problem was not with Outlook and there might be some configuration in the network share location of the PDF files that might be causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further isolate, I'd like to clarify if you also experience the similar behavior when saving a pdf files from a different location (for example: from website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

                    how can I flush MyPhone completely of all data, then upload from my mobile device? Every time I synch it merges and messes up my new phone and I have to rebuild from OEM image. Now I can't use MyPhone at all as a result of this glitch.

Open up the My Phone Client on your windows phone again, and set up the new connection, select the data you want to sync, and sync your phone.&nbsp; The data from your phone should be copied over to your My Phone web account.<br />

<h2>            calendar notifications in both o365 and outlook 2016 found seriously wanting</h2>
                    <p>so i would have thought after all the year of work on outlook MS would have a robust notification system for its calendar events. &nbsp;so far its a complete miss for me with my workflows. &nbsp;the best way i can think of explaining are the list the issues in case
 anyone has suggestions or work arounds. &nbsp;this affects both o365 and outlook 2016 and their interactions with unified groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>o o365 has no ability to trigger desktop notifications of any kind. &nbsp;the in tap notifications are a joke as who constantly has their calendar tab up to notice a meeting is coming up.</p>
<p>o o365's only method of external notification I can find is via text message which I dont even want to use but if I did I can't even connect it to a google voice number as it only allows you to pick from certain national carriers. &nbsp;why the heck can't i text
 my google voice number.</p>
<p>o outlook 2016 does have desktop notification so I have been running outlook solely for this function. &nbsp;they are barely configurable from what I can tell and the pop behind window that comes up isn't terribly noticeable but it is something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>o neither o365 or outlook 2016 lets you choose to be notified for Unified Group shared calendar events which is my primary use case. &nbsp;there doesn't seem to be any reminder facility that will actually remind me of shared calendar events. &nbsp;I can imagine people
 not wanting to be reminded of all events for all shared calendars but why can't i choose that? am i missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point moving from google apps to o365 has caused me to miss numerous meetings as there does not seem to be a sane notification system within outlook or o365. &nbsp; i'm really hoping I'm missing something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

    <title>IE, Edge and Bing almost useless for playing videos&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smithl4819  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE, Edge and Bing almost useless for playing videos&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Spent several hours last night with the latest build (11082) trying to play music videos and found that there were nothing but constant freezes/hangups/crashes using Microsoft's latest and greatest.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems the worst trouble was caused by trying to preview the video before clicking on it--IE would freeze pretty often; pop-up that Bing was unresponsive and try to recover the webpage.&nbsp; Edge would mostly just lock up and do nothing.&nbsp; If I could click on
 the video pretty quickly before the preview started IE and Edge would work some better--IE better than Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't try any other browsers as the MS products are my favorites and one should think that of all browsers they would work especially using Bing!&nbsp; Not sure if this is new to the current build or has been going on forever.&nbsp; I know this was all pretty buggy
 early on but had hoped it would be better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back to W7 and it handles all these above tasks like butter--a reason I cannot at this time go full tilt with W10.&nbsp; Have already ranted and raved to the Feedback app and "Rate Your Build" so not sure what else to do other than keep using W7.&nbsp; All drivers,
 security patches and inner workings are up to date on W10 as far as I know.&nbsp; Anyone else suffering the same fate as I?</p>

<h2>            SUMIFS - Multiple SUM columns Excel 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish to <strong>multiply 2 columns</strong> on the same worksheet, based on multiple criteria. I can do this with SUMPRODUCT / array formulae, however, I wish to take advantage of SUMIFS greater calculation speed in Excel 2007 and as far as my attempts
 show, you cannot use SUMIFS to return the product of 2 columns.</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm that this is the case and that I have to use SUMPRODUCT.</p>
<p>Example working formula - =SUMPRODUCT((DATA!$J$2:$J$10000=$B439)*(DATA!$K$2:$K$10000=$A439)*(DATA!N$2:N$10000*DATA!$L$2:$L$10000))&nbsp; - I wish to multiply col N x col L if conditions J &amp; K are met. Is this doable in a SUMIFS, along the lines of&nbsp; =SUMIFS((DATA!N$2:N$10000*DATA!$L$2:$L$10000),DATA!$J:$J,$B439,DATA!$K:$K,$A439)
 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>G</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For evaluating the time it takes to calculate a formula I use the code from this site and have done some tests on the various options here. For each formula I used full ranges i.e every row in the range had data in. All times are in fractions of a second.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site for code</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa730921.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Sumproduct which I thought would be the slowest calculated in <strong>0.0059</strong> seconds</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((Data!$J$2:$J$10000=$B439)*(Data!$K$2:$K$10000=$A439)*(Data!N$2:N$10000*Data!$L$2:$L$10000))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second the suggestion made by Pete_Uk where we use a helper column and for consistency I changed that formula to the same ranges as above and not full columns. Calculated in<strong> 0.00109</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMIFS(Data!$O$2:$O$1000,Data!$J2:$J1000,$B439,Data!$K2:$K1000,$A439)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly an effort generated by me which is an ARRAY formuls using SUM which calculated in
<strong>0.00164</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUM((Data!$L$2:$L$1000*(Data!$N$2:$N$1000)*(Data!$J$2:$J$1000=B439)*(Data!$K$2:$K$1000=A439)))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to these timings; and I&nbsp;have no doubts aboout the accuracy, then Pete_Uk's formula is the fastest but my ARRAY formula gives it a good run for it's money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No you cant do a multiplication within a SUMIFS formula so you takes your choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT... Pasted the incorrect formula in for pete_UK's suggestion. Now correct</p>

 done reinstalling the Office 365, The message came back when I use the word 2016. Last visit, the technician looked at my add-ins and see if disabling one add in and that did not work. Also he at last resort , He uninstalled and reinstalled Offfice365 for
 me. Even after all they did for me I still received the same message as before. Is there anything else it can be done concerning Office 365 Word 2016 app. Every other app works just fine except the Word 2016. What kind of feature of Word 2016 is broken?</span></p>

<p>Did you try repairing Office from Control Panel? See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a>. If necessary, you can uninstall Office (possibly manually) and then reinstall it. See

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern, we suggest that you repair your Office PowerPoint application. You may follow the steps on this

            <p>Unfortunately, PowerPoint has never been able to "lock" slide changes to the timing of a sound track.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may play back differently on different PCs or even from one run to the next on the same PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS used to advise running through the presentation once before starting the actual playback before an audience. The idea was that this allowed it to pre-cache images of the slide as it appears on the screen.&nbsp; I vaguely remember hearing that PPT no longer
 does this, so this dodge may no longer help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But rather than rely on my vague memory, you might want to give it a go.&nbsp; It might help.</p>

            I use Powerpoint 2007 for timed slides. &nbsp;That works. &nbsp;Now, with all of Microsoft's infinite wisdom, why they can't fix this problem beats me.

<h2>            Mac Outlook 2016&#47;Signature Image Received in Duplicate</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this question asked multiple times, without a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use and image in my signature for Outlook 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;Recipients (including myself if I cc to my Mail) get a duplicate image, while text is received as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple HTML signature programs on-line, and still get the same duplication problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be done to stop this annoying problem? &nbsp;It seems incredible that so many would have reported this problem, and yet there is no definitive answer on-line except "live with it."</p>

            as Farby said, it can't be done, at any cost. if you are worried about it consuming precious phone memory, if your device supports it, you can invest in an external memory card and saving your photos, videos, other files, installing apps to that.

            It can be done,<br />
by downloading MOBIMB software and install it in windows,<br />
after the installation open ovi suite in pc and connect your mobile in ovi suite mode.<br />
And open mobimb, in that select File&gt; add a connection&gt; cable connection (usb)&gt; nokia native usb phones&gt; select CA-101 cable(micro usb) and then delete junk applications and waste you want. carefully.

<h2>            Outlook Data File Missing At Outlook Startup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a home PC running Vista and Outlook 2002. I am getting the error message that&nbsp; Outlook cannot start because the data file to send and receive mail cannot be found. Outlook was working fine but I had several unused, empty personal folders that I deleted.&nbsp;
 Before i did that I made the personal folder I wanted the default. The data file is on the C drive and has been checked with scanpst.exe.&nbsp; No problems were found.&nbsp; I have tried the suggestions to go to the mail option in Control Panel and set the default data
 file but I do not see an option to do that.&nbsp; I deleted my Outlook account and created a new account pointing to the data file.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; How can i fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello IsakKullberg:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having ripping a CD.&nbsp; At this point I have a few questions about the process you are following to attempt this burn and the device you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start are you trying to rip this CD via a Xbox 360, a Xbox One, a PC running Windows 8.0, a PC running Windows 8.1 or a Surface Pro?&nbsp; In addition to this please detail if you have successfully ripped a CD on this device in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, the Xbox Music application has no option to rip a CD.&nbsp; With that said, what software program are you using to try and rip this CD?&nbsp; Typically when there are issues ripping CD's this is related to either the content on the CD, the software or your hardware.&nbsp;
 With that said, have you tried multiple CD's?&nbsp; Have you tried both new purchased CD's and CD's that have been burned?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically when you attempt to burn a CD and it fails some errors would be generated.&nbsp; Please double check to ensure there are no ! next to any of your tracks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for some things to try, I would start by uninstalling and reinstalling the program you are using to rip these CD's.&nbsp; If you continue to have the same experience, try another program.&nbsp; If you are using Windows Media Player, try using
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Zune.</a>&nbsp; If nothing else this should at least give us an error.&nbsp; Additionally, if you can try and rip this from another computer, specifically one running the same OS that may help us
 determine if the issue is directly related to your&nbsp;hardware.<br />
</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            How do I restore my contacts to the new skype&#63; I already backed them up on the old skype.</h2>
                    I downloaded the new skype on a new computer and signed in with my account, I couldn't see any of my contacts from an old computer, which was on the same account. Since the version of my skype was the previous one, I was able to back it up. Yet I cannot
 see any way to restore my contacts using a file I have.

            <p>Good Morning MehakGupta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your question I am going to assume your company is in India however all tax articles and information can be found at
<a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52032/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Tax or VAT information</a> under the appropriate Business location if I am incorrect in my assumption.
</p>
<p>
Service and Withholding Tax
</p><p>For the business location you have selected, billing is managed by Microsoft Corporation (India) Private Limited. Bing Ads is required to charge service tax on all search advertising costs in India at the current local rate, which includes service
 tax at 14%, Swachh Bharat Cess at 0.5%, and Krishi Kalyan Cess at 0.5%. For customers who spend more than 20,000 rupees in a single transaction or 50,000 rupees annually, you are also required to pay a withholding tax, which is a percentage of the advertising
 costs (minus GST). This tax is paid directly to the Indian government and is eligible for reimbursement from Bing Ads. For reimbursement, once you have a receipt from the government for taxes paid, you should<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact
 support</a>.</p>
<p>Bing Ads cannot provide guidance on tax or VAT. Please contact your tax advisor or local tax office if you have questions.</p>
How is service tax applied to my account?
<ul>
<li><strong>If you have a postpay threshold account,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>the taxes are added onto your billing threshold amount. For example, if your billing
 threshold is 100 rupees, your card will be charged 115 rupees (100 + 15% tax). (Learn about<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52082/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">billing
 threshold</a>.)</li><li><strong>If you have a prepay account,</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>taxes are deducted from your payment. For example, if you make a 100 rupee prepayment, your
 account balance will increase by 87 rupees and the remainder of your payment (13 rupees) will cover the 15% tax.</li></ul>
<p>For more information or reimbursement on taxes that are eligible for refund please contact your local support team.</p>

<h2>            email stuck in outbox and sends repeatedly</h2>
                    
<p>I have Outlook 2010 on my PC running XP. When ever I send a message with an attachment it stays in the outbox and sends repeatedly. It even maxed out my bigpond account ! I tested sending it to my hotmail account and it sent it 22 times before i stopped
 it and manually deleted it.&nbsp; I have changed mail profiles so it sends sent mail to another account but nothing works. I never had this problem with 2007 Outlook !&nbsp; It doesnt seem to matter on the size of the attachment. I have tried with 1mb, 2mb and 4 mb.
 All the same results.</p>

<p>I have rung Dell and they told me it was a Bigpond problem. So I rang Bigpond and they told me they currently have no support for Outllook 2010. I changed back to outlook 2007 and everything seems to be fine.</p>
<p>I think someone needs to make a phone call to Outlook (bigpond!!) and sort there product out. Get with the program..</p>

            Who said PC Optimizer is a&nbsp;Microsoft approved&nbsp;program? &nbsp;Maybe the PC Optimizer folks said that but they lie!
<div><br />
<div>PC Optimizer is at the very least a potentially unwanted program - see the following information from the MMPC:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Program%3AWin32/PCOptimizerPro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Program%3AWin32/PCOptimizerPro</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>And PC Optimizer claims to be a registry cleaner....be advised we don't recommend registry cleaners on this forum:</div>

            Dunno if you have this problem anymore, i had this issue in 10049. Following the link from&nbsp;PranavMishra5582's worked for me, had to disconnect the pen-battery for a few seconds. Afterwards the pen-part started working.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I have this problem since installing the final release on my&nbsp;Surface pro 3! Along with other glitches like twitching windows when rotated and&nbsp;microphone doesn't work with Cortana (if at all, not checked yet). I've checked for updates and everything is
 up to date.&nbsp;Disappointed at this point MS, of all the devices to get Window 10 right on you seem to have failed on&nbsp;your&nbsp;own flagship.

            <p>After installing Windows 10 on Surface Pro 3 my pen does not work properly.</p>
<p>I press the purple button and it opens One Note but will not write, and other than opening One Note the pen doesn't function.</p>
<p>I have properly paired my pen. I have changed the battery. I have removed the pen and re-installed it. I have deleted the pen drivers and reinstalled them. I have downloaded all windows updates. I have downloaded and installed all firmware updates.
</p>
<p>After all this the only thing I can do with my pen is press the purple button and open One Note, and not the One Note 2013 I paid extra for.</p>
<p>Anyone have other suggestions on how to get my pen back? </p>
<p>It worked before the upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

            I just went through the same frustrating experience and came to the conclusion that the pen must be broken, but when I bought another pen I still had the same problem. After trying to use the pen multiple times with no success it came down to simply resetting
 the display data in the tablet pc settings box. To get there, type "calibrate pen" in the Windows search bar and it will be the only option. Then click "Reset" under the display options. Hope this helps!

<p>
</p><p>When I open the Pen calibration window, the reset button is no highlighted so I cannot click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ant other thoughts?</p>
