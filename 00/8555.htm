<h2>            OneDrive for Business follow missing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have an O365 demo tenant that I am using for a customer so that I can train them on how to use the various aspects of O365 and do an immersive experience for them. Im attempting to setup sharing and following in OneDrive for Business and in SharePoint
 Online. Sharing works as expected. However there are 2 things that are very odd, I cant remove an individual user from Sharing, its an all or nothing option, and the option to follow a document is no where to be found in the new web client. I can find it in
 the old client, but that receives an error message. Any help here would be greatly appreciated as I am currently baffled. Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Thomasbey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing with us screenshots in the private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly for the Following option part, I'd like to explain the following two things:</p>
<p>1. In the new experience of Shared with me section, there is no Follow option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2. Based on my test, in the classic UI of Shared with me section, we are able to follow other files such as images, documents, worksheets. However, it's not feasible to follow a notebook. When we click follow, it will give us the error message as the screenshot
 in your private message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For this two parts, I suggest you submit the feedback via <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Uservoice</a>. This is the best way to let the related team hear your voice. Thanks for your understanding.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, for the error message you get when set up alert, it seems when you click Alert me, the Set alert on this library option should be grayed out, you click Manage My Alerts&gt;Add Alert&gt;Documents&gt;Next&gt;get the error message. This is because of we cannot
 set alert for another users OneDrive for Business library. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At last, about the "cannot remove access for specific user" issue, we can look into it further. In you first screenshot, we can see two users have access for the document. One is yourself, the other is the user who cannot be removed. In the second screenshot,
 there is only you and guest link (can see that member under the link). It seems that he has access the file with that Any one guest link. In this situation, you could remove that account via:</p>
<p>a. Directly remove the guest link. In the second screenshot click "x" next to the guest link. That user will lost access to this document.
</p>
<p>b. Click Advanced to access the permission list of that document. You will see
<strong>Users who have permission through a sharing link</strong>. Click <strong>
Manage links</strong> to remove that user. Now you will get a pop-up&gt;click Shared with&gt;find that user&gt;click the black arrow&gt;select Stop sharing.
</p>

            Profiles are a group of user settings that you save as a set.<br />
Someone might go under one profile for general work-day use, a silent profile for when they are in meetings, and a different profile eg "My Profile" for recreational use. You might not want the Pink Panther ringtone to sound off when meeting a client for example!
 Not sure all of what's included in the profile but ringtone is certainly one, probably volume, wallpaper if you have one, maybe options for missed calls, calls that come when you're busy on another call, etc.,tc<br />
<br />
I can help you with a couple -<br />
<br />
General is the default setting<br />
<br />
Silent means that the ringtone doesn't sound - but you can still have the vibration alert if you set that on.<br />
<br />
My Profile would be a custom profile that you make up yourself<br />
<br />
Not sure what the difference is between discreet and silent. Lights only? Sounds like the phone lights up only.<br />
<br />
Best bet would be to email Nokia customer support. If like me, you are unimpressed with the user guide that is offered with this phone, let them know! If enough people bug them they might put further instructions up on the website - the existing web version
 is the same as the box version.<br />
<br />
If you get the answer to your question post back so others know as well. Good luck.

                    I was locked out of my account (and I appreciate the triggers for this are in everyone's best interest).&nbsp; Unfortunately, the password resets failed.&nbsp; The questionnaire succeeded!&nbsp; But when I reset the password, I still was locked out.&nbsp; It appears that
 people enter this futile cycle often.&nbsp; What can I do to use my email account which I need?<br />
Please note that since I cant see my email, I entered an alternative into the personal/private&nbsp; section for this community profile; hopefully I will find out whether there is a human wishing to help me!<br />

                    <p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: left">How to create a bootable Windows 10 USB Hard Drive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb
 the way, I suggest that if your going to create a bootable Windows To Go drive (not using the Wiindows 10 Enterprise built in Windows to go Media creator),&nbsp; you should use an External USB 3.0 Solid State or Mechanical hard drive, as it performs way way, way
 better.</p>

</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: left">Since Mike P's link he posted no longer works (apparently the developer shut the sight down)
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: left">I did some researching, and found that WinToUSB works very well, and even allows you to clone your PCs hard drive right onto the external hard drive, so you can boot up to your familiar desktop without ever
 woring about updating the OS either. and the best part about it, all the installed programs, and documents, and every single setting will be exactly the same.. (note. it will not sync with the computers internal drive)</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x800705570 and 0x80073CF9</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After few days of upgrading my Mobile Lumia 535 from windows 8.1 to windows 10, I am getting error in upgrading the apps in store. First I got the error message:0x80073CF9. Then I have googled the error and found some solutions like: uninstall
 and install the APP again. I have done so but the problem remained same. Someone had written to reset the phone which I have done. But I am could not update the APPS and received a new error message&nbsp;0x800705570 and for some APPS like CC player I received error
 message&nbsp;:0x80073CF9. What are all these? Why I am getting the error messages and what are the possible solutions to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>with kind regards</p>

            <p>Good Morning Hashem,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best to have someone in customer service take a look at your account as we don't want to add your private information into the forum. It is possible that what you are seeing is a temporary hold on your account, the system will create a dummy
 transaction that will fall off your account within 3-5 business days depending on the speed of your bank for card confirmation purposes, but again it is best to contact customer support so that we may confirm the information. Please have a copy of the transaction
 if it is posted and not in pending status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>-- For clarification I mean and Browser Restart not a system restart. In either event I don't want previous pages re-opened. --</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what do you do when your browser is opening a broken or malicious web page?&nbsp; When I have to forcibly close edge when its either hung up on a page or is actually opening a page that is malicious I want a clean start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While some may appreciate having all of their pages re-opened I do not.&nbsp; I think this is just the "Microsoft Edge Marketing Department" trying to convince me that Edge is really fast at the expense of security or common sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I kill the browser with the task manager there is probably a reason.&nbsp; If we assume that edge is working correctly because its well coded then we are in all probability dealing with a poorly coded web page or worst a malicious web page.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>By default, Outlook and WMDC sync every contacts you put in the default Contacts folder in Outlook. As you said, it's better to create a subfolder and move the contacts you do not want to sync there.</div>

            With that many contacts and your desire to to sync a subset, I think in this particular case I would recommend using PocketMirror Professional.&nbsp; I think the flexibility it will offer you might enhance what you are trying to do on a daily basis.<br />

<br />Unfortunately, Skype accounts cannot be merge as a one account. If you want to close the other accounts, you will need to have access on those and update it one by one to a Microsoft account before you can close the accounts. You may refer to these FAQ articles below for more information.

<h2>            Move a folder on a site with no sharing enabled and no syncing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>I have just been asked to move &nbsp;a folder held in yet another folder in a SharePoint Online &nbsp;library which seemed to have been moved accidentally &nbsp;this morning ;-( &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have looked at the obvious things:</p>
<p>Content and Structure - Move is disabled when I &nbsp;check the library</p>
<p>They haven't enabled sharing which I can do easily with PS but I guess I need to know if this help me fix this issue</p>
<p>They haven't installed any of the ODFB sync clients so no syncing locally, followed by open in explorer.</p>
<p>I seem to remember doing this a few times on SharePoint 2013 but things are little different.</p>

<p>Anybody know how to do this as otherwise I am back to PS .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Daniel</p>

<p>hi daniel,<br />
<br />
as panos suggested, we can use the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2629108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
open with explorer feature</a>, and it only works on internet explorer.<br />
<br />
meanwhile, if you’re moving the folder within a document library, you can <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/switch-the-default-for-document-libraries-from-new-or-classic-66dac24b-4177-4775-bf50-3d267318caa9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable the new experience for the library</a>, and then use the <strong>move to</strong> option.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e4c09ed8-b31e-46a3-b9b5-c835ee762c13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de4c09ed8-b31e-46a3-b9b5-c835ee762c13" /></a><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the late reply, I didn’t realize that you have replied to my private message.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the video, it was helpful. As you want data to be updated after pasting from Excel to Word without creating a new line, in this case, you
 can use <strong>Paste Special</strong>&gt;<strong>Paste Link</strong>&gt;<strong>Unformatted text
</strong>option in Word<strong>.</strong> This option will not create a new line when pasting from Excel to Word and will link the data as well. For this, copy the data in Excel and then in Word, follow the steps mentioned in the screenshot below.

    <title>Music library does not update with refresh&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music library does not update with refresh&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an issue with my music library not updating&nbsp;folder/genre information when I refresh.&nbsp; Songs are present and correct but the folder will not update (i.e. I deleted a song but the number on the folder does not show this change or I removed a specific
 genre&nbsp;but that genre folder remains) ----hope that makes sense</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen this issue with a number of Nokia music player phones and was wondering if anything was ever resolved, There was a workaround for the 5800 (show hidden folders and delete a load of .dat files) but this does not work for my C7 with Belle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help as this is an annoyance (thought the music still plays fine), if no official update exists a work around would be fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>

<p>Thanks the refresh now works but ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what if I can see with the new playlist (and the file added) but I still have all the old and deleted playlists?</p>
<p>I mean</p>
<p>1)I used OviSuite.</p>
<p>2) I refresh the library on itunes DESELECTING all the old playlist. I checked the new playlist only.</p>
<p>3) At the end all the songs linked with the old playlist were deleted. And that's fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still I have a discrepancy:</p>
<p>-&nbsp; on application/file manager/E:/audio file ... there is the new playlist and the new songs ONLY</p>
<p>- on Music/player/ ... I still have the "phantoms" of the old playlist and songs. How can I get rid of these annoying files. They are just empty files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do</p>

<div>Where did you purchase your copy of Office for Mac 2011?</div>

<div>In most cases, if you see a ReadMe file with ASCII art (a picture made up of letters and symbols) the software is a pirated copy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you did purchase Office for Mac 2011 and it came with this read me file, you should ask for a full refund and purchase a new copy from a respected retailer or direct from Microsoft using the link below:</div>

<p>Gladly, you are running "Fast Ring" builds. Don't expect things to be perfect. Now, if you where talking about a Released build, I would fully agree with your 'complaint'. As it is, it's unreasonable, for things get tried/changed/rejected at any time and
 you can't possibly ask MS to account for all the Insider variations out there.</p>
<p>

            In every build, I check all areas and usually all I have to change is to uncheck fast startup, &nbsp;adjust font size, reset system protection and maybe one or two other things. All of my other Settings usually stay the same as this is beta software and subject
 to change in any area. Each new build is essentially installing a new operating system and adjustments or changes are inevitable.&nbsp;

            <p>Oh but it is a RELASE build named ANNIVERSARY.</p>
<p>And it STILL hasn't been fixed in RS2.</p>
<p>I first reported this in June. Other people too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I mentioned bugs both in Anniversary and </p>
<p>still in RS2 some people started saying problems in both</p>
<p>ANNIVERSARY and still in RS2 are not RS2 problems to report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not so I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS wants all of us to keep reporting them over and over</p>
<p>because they didn't log them we all can do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could get HUGE I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if MS didn't keep logs then going back over the threads</p>
<p>is the only way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people report problems is there a way the peopke</p>
<p>can make sure MS has logged them, </p>

            <p>You keep referring to the Anniversary Update which you should be discussing in the following forum:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10?tab=Threads&amp;auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10?tab=Threads&amp;auth=1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Millions of users of the Anniversary Update do not seem to have the issues you are referring to and you appear to be in the very small minority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please list the changes made to your system that you are referring to as it is not a project for Insiders to research all of your previous posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is for rs2 build 14915 and again the known issues are posted in the Feedback Hub and Windows blog and as you have been previously reminded the Insider builds per Microsoft were going to be buggy and have issues and any you find should be posted
 in the Feedback Hub. Being an Insider may not be a good choice for you and I would recommend that you do a Clean install of the Anniversary build 14393 and not reenter the Insider program.</p>

    <title>some missing footers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardtomkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            some missing footers</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a Word 2010 document with multiple sections.</p>
<p>I have mirrored pages, with different odd and even footers.</p>
<p>I am using section and page numbering as this makes it fairly easy to navigate the technical document.</p>
<p>I have observed the following behavious and wonder what I am missing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an odd page section break, my footer for an odd page shows, the text flows onto the next page which is the even page and the appropriate footer shows and the text flows onto the thrid page and there is no footer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what have I not set or configured to have the odd page footer show up on the second odd page in the section, which is the thrid page in the section?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>When you disabled "Different first page," you lost the First Page Footer, which is what was appearing on the first (odd) page of each section. Since you have no text in the Odd Page Footer, you are now not getting a footer on
<strong>any</strong> odd pages. This is completely logical. You need to add the text you&nbsp;had in the First Page Footer to the Odd Page Footer.</p>

            <p>Unlinking doesn't unlink sections; it unlinks specific headers and footers, as described in
<a href="http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/HeaderFooter.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sbarnhill.mvps.org/WordFAQs/HeaderFooter.htm</a>. If you unlink the Odd Page Header, you're unlinking it from the Odd Page Header in the previous
 section. You are not affecting any First Page Header or Footer, any Even Page Header or Footer, or the Odd Page Footer.</p>
<p>The "Different odd and even" setting is applied to the entire document; you can't enable it for specific sections. You can enable "Different first page" for specific sections, but when you create a new section, by inserting a section break, the new section
 inherits the properties of the previous one, including "Different first page" (if enabled), restarting numbering, etc.</p>
<p>The First Page Footer appears only on the first page of a section (whether it is even or odd). The Odd Page Footer appears on odd pages that are not the first page of the section (if "Different first page" is enabled).</p>

<p>What reported to you that the application is Malware? I'm curious because the application is still available in the store and Microsoft would usually not allow an application that violates it's guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
