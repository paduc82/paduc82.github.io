<h2>            Cortana on Skype</h2>
                    Any updates on Cortana and if we can delete the bot in iOS? I hate the feature so much. An inconvinience. Feels like I‚Äôm in an episode of Black Mirror. Don‚Äôt imagine how much this feature is actually reading from my devices given those stupid suggestions
 of text it‚Äôs giving...

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 Home &#38; Student&#58; Unlicensed Product Error AFTER Purchase</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
On December 17th I purchased a product key for Microsoft Office 2013 Home &amp; Student online. Microsoft office was already installed on my new laptop, as part of the 30-day trial.
<br />
<br />
When my trial ran out, I inserted the Product Key I purchased and it reactivated my programs.
<br />
<br />
Some kind of registration Wizard would pop-up when I opened an Office program, and I put it off for a few days (it said I had 30 days to complete it.)
<br />
<br />
After a week, I decided to take the time to do it -but every time I tried, it would always come back with some sort of error.
<br />
<br />
On January 17th, I reached the "30 Day" deadline. Again, I tried to do what it was asking me and again it came back with an error.
<br />
<br />
Now, my product has been deactivated and at the top of my Office programs is says "Unlicensed Product".<br />
<br />
I have tried signing into my account, entering in my product key, and installing Microsoft Office from my online account -nothing has worked.
<br />
<br />
Only thing I haven't done is tried uninstalling Microsoft Office, and reinstalling.
<br />
<br />
^--- I just want to make sure I can do that without any repercussions. <br />
<br />
I paid $140 for this product, and I need it for my business. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!! Thanks!<br />

            <blockquote>An observation, you say "need it for my business" Office Home &amp; Student is not licensed for business use, for that you need Office Home &amp; Business or Office Pro, or a 365 Business Plan
</blockquote>
<br />
Great, what do you mean not licensed for business? <br />
<br />
I just need it for word and presentations for proposals.&nbsp; <br />
I work from home and have no employees that would be using it? <br />
<br />
<u><b>Also, wanted to mention that I managed to get it fixed. </b></u><br />
<br />
- Used the uninstall wizard Microsoft provides, to uninstall the trial version. <br />
<br />
- Reinstalled it from my Microsoft account. <br />
<br />
- Everything still opened as "Unlicensed Product", however I got the "30-day" ACTIVATION window to pop-up again. I tried to run the activation wizard, but received the same error as before. Looked up the error on Google, found a simple fix.
<br />
<br />
- Go to the start menu, right click on any Microsoft program. <br />
<br />
- Click 'Run as Administrator' <br />
<br />
- It will open the program, but this time you can actually complete the Activation process without any errors. Was done in 20 seconds.
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
I would require additional information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) Is this issue experienced when you open any existing file or even with Excel application?<br />
2) Are you able to work with other Office applications without any error?<br />
<br />
Try the following and verify the result:<br />
<br />
Click on <b>Start</b> &gt; <b>All Programs</b> &gt; <b>Microsoft Office</b> &gt; right click on
<b>Microsoft Office Excel 2010</b> icon &gt; <b>Properties</b> &gt; <b>Run</b> &gt; click on drop down and select ‚Äò<b>Maximized</b>‚Äô &gt;
<b>Apply</b> &gt; <b>OK</b> and try starting Excel and verify the result.<br />
<br />
You may also verify whether issue re-occurs in Excel safe mode. Follow the below mentioned steps to start Excel safe mode and verify:<br />
<p><br />
* Hold <b>Windows key</b> + <b>R</b>. </p>
<p>* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the <b>Open</b> box, and then press Enter:</p>
<p><b>Excel /safe<br />
</b>Note: There is space between Excel and /</p>
<span><br />
If Excel safe works, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below and determine the problem causing add-in:
<br />
a) Click on <b>File </b>menu, click <b>Options</b>, <b>Add-ins</b>, <b>Go</b> button besides Manage:
<b>Com-in Add</b>. <br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Excel, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
</span>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

<p>Hi I have just sent my text messages from my Nokia 2330 to the Nokia suite on my lap top. The conversation show that the are 443 conversations but I can only see 10 in the reading pane ! Does anyone know how to access the remainder please?????? The previous
 text messages which I saved are in the "in box" and these seem to be added to the number now in conversations. Maybe there is a simple solution but I cannot see it Thanks in advance for your help.:smileysurprised:</p>

<p>What do you mean by Reading Pane ? The view in the Nokia Suite -- &gt;messaging is divided in to 3 Vertical Columns .. In the First Column, Under Messages ..you will see the Folders, When Conversations is selected..In the Second Column, Under Conversations
 you will see them listed.. There is a Scroll Bar to the Right of <strong>THIS</strong> column to see more in the list ...The Third Column will show the Messages in the Conversation selected in the Second Column ...</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I think I understand what you are saying, but when Conversations are selected the second column gives a list and I can see the scroll bar just to the right of this. I scroll down but only 10 messages are shown - despite the fact that the conversation folder
 is supposed to 443 in it. So please how do I access the other 433 remaining conversations? I would like to confirm that the messages are saved on the computer before I clear my phone .</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;:smileysad:</p>

<p>443 is the Total no. of Messages in ALL Conversations and not the No. of Entries you will find in the Second Column.</p>
<p>To simlyfy understanding..If the Conversation is with just a Single person..You will see 443 against Conversations..but will find only a Single entry in the Middle Column..but again 443 Messages in the form of a thread in the 3rd column...</p>

<p>Hi mushroomlolz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zune marketplace requires a credit/debit card to be added to your account to purchase applications. There is more information on this
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-au/howto/wp7/apps/find-and-buy-apps-in-marketplace.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. Remember that payments cannot be authorised if you try to purchase applications/games not from your country of origin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you call up your operator, they may allow you to user operator billing, but that is only based on the operator side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't forget, that you can Trial games before buying the full version, this will ensure that you are satisfied with the purchase you are commiting to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and you will be purchasing the games you want very soon!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Storms7,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Project is a paid subscription, no matter if it is for school purposes or not. The cheapest one is a 3,80‚Ç¨/user as you can see in the picture below. If you still want that, go talk to your school administrator about possible solutions.</p>

<h2>            Major Problems with Microsoft Lumia 830 - MicroSD won&#39;t get out of the slot and I can&#39;t access the phone through cable connection.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, guys! I'm having problems with my Lumia 830.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The microSD won't get out, I can hear the click when I stick it and the click when I push it. Although, there's a small plastic thing there that won't let me remove the card. (it works properly tho)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The MTP USB thing NEVER installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any hints or tips? Can anybody post a tutorial on how to remove the microSD fromthe cellphone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much, guys &lt;3</p>

            <p>Hi Chppedheart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your memory card is stuck in it's slot and you are unable to take it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that situation, my strongest recommendation would be to get your phone serviced by an authorized personnel. You should be able to find Nokia Care point in your vicinity or contact the place of purchase.</p>
<p>

            Because you're pressing Enter at the end of each line of the address, you're creating a separate paragraph for each line. The default paragraph format in Word 2010 is to add 10 points of space after each paragraph. (It's not quite double-spaced, which
 would be about 12 points of space, but it's close enough!)<br />
<br />
You can do either of two things:<br />
<ul>
<li>Select the address (except for the last line), right-click and then click Paragraph in the dropdown menu, and change the Space After setting to 0 pt. Click OK.</li></ul>
OR<br />
<ul>
<li>Instead of pressing Enter at the end of each address line, press Shift+Enter. That creates a "manual line break" so the all the address lines are part of the same paragraph. For an existing address, click the ¬∂ button on the Home ribbon to show formatting
 marks. Then you'll see the ¬∂ mark at the end of each paragraph, and you can select it and press Shift+Enter to replace it with the manual line break (which looks like an arrow pointing to the left).<br />
</li></ul>

            Activesync will always sync the Contacts folder in your default data store in Outlook.&nbsp; For Outlook 2003, click Tools&gt;E-mail Accounts&gt;Next.&nbsp; Examine the "Deliver new messages to the following location" drop-down at the lower left.&nbsp; That's the default data

 image. It would be great if I could get this to work. I appreciate any help. Thank you.</p>

            Tried this on the sheet code and module code, didnt seem to work. I think using center across selection option with unmerged cells might work for me but problem is now I can only go up to like 5.6" when I need it to be unlimited amount of spacing, sometimes
 it can be up to 2-3 pages that needs to go in one cell. Any suggestions?

            I tried using a textbox but cells underneath the cells that need to autofit has to remain underneath it. Basically it is product description with price underneath it and another description under that so need cells to move down as description grows.&nbsp;

</p><p>First of all, this VBA is for a password protected sheet. I am commenting on the VBA that doesn't contain the password protect lines. This VBA is not quite practical when one
 ranges in order for it to expand. This could take days with the worksheet I am working with! Is there another code that doesn't require this extra work when applying it on already existing 1749 merged cell ranges that already contain text? Also, with this
 VBA code sometimes I get an Run-time error "1004': Unable to set the ColumnWidth property of the range class, and debug points to this line: "c.ColumnWidth = MrgeWdth" This only happens when I have more than 12 lines merged into one and the first line is the
 text which is much shorter than the set column width, but later that column width is not even enough for other similar text down the line (in different merged ranges way below &nbsp;down the line on a row somewhere down in the same column). So in other words -
 the column width has to remain as it was already set. Can I just remove the "c.ColumnWidth = MrgeWdth" line from the VBA code?! Finally, when one selects all "Ctrl+A" and one clicks the "Autofit Row Height" button, all of the work of triggering events in these
 merged ranges, is lost!!! And then, after countless hours of manually triggering events in these merged ranges, I have to start all over again from scratch!!! It's insane!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Deleting that line in the VBA code stops the error from coming up, makes the merged range a bit smaller, but messes up the Autofit of same rows, with different merge ranges located in columns further down to the right.</p>

<h2>            10041 real issues all of a sudden system freezes completely appears to be random</h2>
                    after install build 10041 my system freezes , it appears to be random..&nbsp; I can start explorer, or seti, or just about any program and all of a sudden the system&nbsp; just stops!!!!!&nbsp; Sometimes it runs for a while, the longest time has been about one hour before
 the system just stop accepting keyboard or mouse. All windows appear to be frozen at that moment.&nbsp; I also just noticed that running seti, I now get "two icons" on the task bar, used to only get one on previous release.&nbsp; The previous 9926 never had these issues.

            What kind of graphics adapter /video card do you have? I've noticed that with the AMD display drivers from February and March via Windows Update, they cause seemingly random freezes / hangs and crashes. The ones from January and earlier did not have the
 problem. Just something to check and try to rule out.

                    <p>For about a month now, any time I click on a function on Word that normally shows a drop down list (ex. line spacing, margins, text color), the list does not show up. For example, I clicked the line spacing button and all that happened was that it turned
 grey, like in the picture below:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SSMA - Error while Converting Schema - &#34;There is nothing to process&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to Up-size the Access tables into SQL Server 2012, after loading the source &amp; target databases when I click on "Convert Schema" option, I am getting an error as "There is nothing to process". I have been googling about this for about a day and
 I see the answers that I have got are not exactly resolving my issue. Can someone please help me in resolving this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I have been using SSMA from quite a while now and I have no clue why it is happening to me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

 you tell us what part it's not *exactly* resolving.&nbsp; Because my first thought is you don't have all the necessary permissions.

<p>Hi Gina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following are the suggestions I tried or checked;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I made sure that I am using 32-bit version of the Access and as well as the SSMA</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am the owner of the database that I am trying to migrate to so no point of having the access level issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Apart from that I saw somewhere to install Access runtime application so I am doing that now but I doubt it would resolve my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hmm, being the Owner does NOT necessary mean you have permission.&nbsp; You need to confirm that.&nbsp; You can do so by using SQL Server 2012 Management Studio and see if you can open the tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, there is an issue if you have the Click-to-Run installed and installing the Runtime *should* resolve it.&nbsp; So, will wait to hear back.</p>

</p><p>I have did the upsizing using the same credentials earlier and I checked in SSMS again to confirm if I have the permission to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as per your request, I have installed the "Access runtime 2013" but no luck as I still see the same error as "Nothing to Process".</p>

<h2>            Font rendering in Word differs from other Office programs</h2>
                    
<p>I have a font called <a href="http://www.cuttyfruty.com/enhtml/font_detail.php?font=15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Estrya's Handwriting</a>&nbsp;that has particularly interesting font metrics.&nbsp; When using it in Word it seems to behave in a very strange way, especially when you compare it to PowerPoint.</p>
<p>In PowerPoint when I lay out it seems to auto-clip the whitespace at the bottom:</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg94.imageshack.us%2fimg94%2f7040%2fpowerpointcapture.png" />
<p>The Save as PDF produces what I would expect:</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimg4.imageshack.us%2fimg4%2f5410%2fpowerpointpdfcapture.png" />
<p>But in Word it's a different story where it seems to put in some extra space (or is not intelligent enough to remove unnecessary space):</p>

<p>Word's PDF output is even worse:</p>

<p>Paragraph settings below.&nbsp; I am trying to compensate for excess space below and above the letters.&nbsp; The font's metrics are causing unnecessary spacing which is why I tried to use individual text boxes:</p>

<p>Font metrics belong to the font builder. Any answer you get here would just be a work-around. You would probably stand a better chance of getting a definitive answer by asking the creator/vendor.</p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, I see you are using Office 2010. Have you tried the font in any other applications, or earlier versions of Office, especially 2003?</p>

            I haven't and don't really fancy installing an old version of Office.&nbsp; I'm mostly wanted to poke at why Word and PowerPoint treat text boxes and font alignment differently.

<p>Word has a number of per-document compatibility settings that can affect this kind of thing - for example, you may notice a difference if you select "Don't add leading (extra space) between rows of text" and verify that the textbox property "resize shape
 to fit text" is checked (Word certainly behaves different from PowerPoint in its handling of that setting). But whether any of those options will help you here, I cannot tell. In Word 2010, the compatibility options are the "Layout Options" at the bottom of
 File-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced.</p>

<p>Is this a custom "personal signature" font or a generic script font that anyone can purchase?</p>
<p>Installing old version would be overkill. If you know someone who has older version, you could embed the whole font (rather than just characters used) in the doc and then see how it looks on their other machine.</p>
<p>Note: The font may be defined to not allow this.</p>

            <p>Hi ColinBowern</p>
<p>Right click on the text box and check the format shape option and check the internal margin of the text box. I think there The font will automate
 small internal margin in the text fox which raises the white spaces in it</p>

            I'm also getting the VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR on reboot after the windows update. Can't get in safe mode with low-res or with networking. Tried System Restore but it says the most recent (and only) restore point is corrupt after going through several
 minutes trying to configure that. Is there perhaps a way to roll back the firmware witha bootable USB that will allow the process to continue? Really really trying to avoid repaving the machine. (will take days out of my life to reinstall and configure everything).
