<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Update</strong> issues can occur due to any of the following reasons: Corrupted files, incorrect network settings, conflict with a third-party antivirus, internet connections are just a few.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be great if you can give us the exact error message you got when you tried updating your Windows 7.&nbsp; If you can share with us what you see on your screen when you experience that issue, kindly
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, provide us the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made to your computer prior to the issue? (software or hardware installation, etc.)</li><li>Besides restarting your computer, any other troubleshooting steps you've done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Windows came preinstalled in your computer, there should be a<strong> Certificate of Authenticity</strong> (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer. On some laptops, it’s in the battery bay. It will have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it -
 that is your product key. If it's not on your computer, look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</p>

<p>If the problem shows up again, I will include a screenshot.&nbsp; My initial feeling that there was something wrong is when I went into Control Panel and tried to get into Windows Update.&nbsp; It wasn't letting me but when I went to the task menu, it said it was
 running.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes later, I had to cancel out of it.&nbsp; When I tried later and just let it run, I eventually got the message that it could not bring in updates because the server was not running.&nbsp; After posting my question, someone suggested going to
 my run box and typing in services.msc to see if my windows update server was running.&nbsp; It was started and it said the status type was Automatic (delayed start).&nbsp; I then read more help and it said to connect to the internet and run trouble shooting to fix problems
 which is when I ran the windows update option that hangs up and won't let me in for many minutes and while doing that running the trouble shooting option&nbsp; The only fix I got from that option was a windows update fix was applied.&nbsp; After that, I was back to
 normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the only change to my software in December was that my McAfee virus option suddenly was upgraded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did find my product key number on a sticker on my disk drive.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Cindy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was about to ask if you have any third-party antivirus program installed, and you've just confirmed that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest temporarily disabling your third-party antivirus and try Windows Updates again. If everything works out, re-enable your antivirus back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong></span><em> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to
 temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly inform us of your progress.</p>

    <title>Deleted Alarms still ringing on Windows 10&#63;&#63;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abdulwahedquazi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Alarms still ringing on Windows 10&#63;&#63;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I'm using Windows 10 on Lumia 640XL</p>
<p>I had about 5-6 alarms on throughout the day.</p>
<p>Once before taking a nap, I asked Cortana to set an alarm. Instead that idiot opened the Alarms and Clock app. I noticed that no alarms that I had set were visible. So, thinking it was a glitch I set all the 5-6 alarms again.</p>
<p>Now the next day, two alarms of the same time were ringing as if I had set two alarms for the same time.</p>
<p>I went back to the Alarms and Clock app and only one alarm of each time was visible. I deleted them all and it displayed "You have no Alarms."&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the next day, the alarms I had set were ringing again, only once this time. I asked Cortana to turn off the alarms and she said I didn't have any alarms on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my question is, how do I turn off these alarms that are not visible to either the app or Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Should I soft reset? What will I lose if I do?)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Many of the files sfc can't fix are not important.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
put the command from below (copy and paste it) into that box and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
<span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt <br />
<br />
that creates the sfcdetails.txt file in the folder you are in when you run it.<br />
<br />
So if you are in C:\Windows\System32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then you will need to look in that folder for the file.<br />

<br />
That creates sfcdetails.txt&nbsp; in C:\Windows\System32&nbsp;&nbsp; find it and you can post the errors into a message
<br />
here. NOTE :&nbsp;there probably are duplicates so please only post each section of errors once.<br />
<br />
You can read the log/txt files easier if you&nbsp;right click on Notepad or Wordpad then RUN AS ADMIN - then
<br />
you can navigate to sfcdetails.txt ( in C:\Windows\System32 ) or cbs.log ( in C:\Windows\Logs ) as needed.
<br />
(You may need to search for sfcdetails.txt if it was not created in the default folders.)<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported.<br />

Do&nbsp;these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
download the WER_Explorer.reg file from my skydrive:<br />
http://cid-128fc518635be2dc.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public/MS%20Foren/Registry<br />
<br />
Import it with double cklick to your registry. When Explorer crashes again, you'll find a dmp file under C:\Localdumps. Please put the file on your Skydrive and post the link here. I'll look at the dump to see which shellextension causes the crash.<br />

Before this command , I also&nbsp; tried , by typing the command " <span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log&nbsp;&lt;ENTER&gt;&nbsp; ... Line one of command prompt
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfcdetails.txt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;ENTER&gt; .... line two of Command prompt after pressing ENTER at end of command in line one..."<br />
<br />
This above command did&nbsp; generate any sfcdetails.txt but of " 0Kb" data !!<br />
<br />
Among the&nbsp; other things&nbsp; suggested by&nbsp; you&nbsp;<br />
1. Check cbs.log file&nbsp;<br />
2. Look in event viewer&nbsp;<br />
3. Check Sony's web site for similar problems&nbsp;, are only things pending. These steps I shall carry out after this reply and revert back with my results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;so far.<br />

<br />
I get prompted for three&nbsp; options " RUN "&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"SAVE"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , " Cancel"<br />
<br />
Your message reads " Import it by double click it to your registry "... what exactly does this mean ?<br />
I can download your file. But&nbsp; then do I "run" &nbsp;it or&nbsp; "SAve it"&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br />
<br />
If "save it", what location should I save it to ?<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Nothing in the SFC is important as there were no integrity&nbsp;violations. Notice almost all of that in red<br />
is in the TEMP folder meaning it is expendable.<br />
<br />
The down side is SFC can't find or fix all issues. Did you run CheckDisk?<br />
<br />
Did you check the Sony site for those tips on fixing the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I have added the ".reg" file to my registry.<br />
Now do I need to&nbsp; switch off and start my computer again for&nbsp; your file to generate DUMP ?<br />
<br />
Also , there exists no folder by name "localdump" in my C-drive !<br />
Is it that the ".reg" file&nbsp; that I just added to my registry will create the folder automatically when my computer is re-started ?<br />
<br />
regs,<br />
        </p>

            the folder should be created automatically. You don't need to reboot. Just wait for the next Explorer crash and go to the folder C:\localdumps and upload the dmp file.<br />

    <title>FILE TYPE issue with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrhon  say:</h3>
<h2>            FILE TYPE issue with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>In Windows XP you could modify the FILE TYPES to allow for additional parms to use a paticular definition to access a file.&nbsp; We have a .DTV file that has parms, but a customer would like to just double click on the file and it knows how to open it... how
 can I do that with Windows 7 that doesn't have FILE TYPES like in Windows XP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: In Windows XP you could go into Internet Explorer and choose VIEW | Options and from there you could select the FILE TYPE tab and select NEW TYPE command button.&nbsp; And from there you could enter a new FILE TYPE option of selecting the program and
 then the default extension of the file so that if you were at the file within your pc and you DOUBLE CLICK it would know what program to submit and then under the NEW ACTION button you could put additional parms that would be required to not only open the
 application for the product, but it would also add additional parms necessary to run the program.</p>
<p><br />
Now with Windows 7 - it only gives you the option to OPEN WITH and no default ACTION parms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggestions?</p>

<p><span>I don’t quite understand your explanation of combining Internet Explorer and file types, perhaps you mean
 Control Panel &gt; Default Programs &gt; Associate a program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, the file type and association commands (ftype and assoc) can be typed via a command prompt. Alternatively, registry changes
 can be made.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ftype command associates a file type with an application. For example, if you had a file type called myaccs that had a program
 file named ledger.exe and used files with the .ldg extension, the manual assoc and ftype commands typed into a cmd window would be:</span></p>
<p><span>assoc .ldg=myaccs</span></p>
<p><span>assoc .acc=myaccs (i.e. more than one extension can be associated to a file type)</span></p>
<p><span>ftype myaccs= %SystemRoot%\Program Files\ledger.exe %1</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, when you double-click on a file with the extension .ldg or .acc, Windows will recognize it and launch ledger.exe using the
 optionally typed parameter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An easier to understand example of the above is a .txt file, which we all use in Notepad:</span></p>
<p><span>Typing assoc .txt will return txtfile (the file type)</span></p>
<p><span>Typing ftype txtfile will return %SystemRoot%\System32\notepad.exe %1 (the full path of the program and %1 representing a passed parameter).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, look in the registry hive HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT for .txt and further down for txtfile.</span></p>

                    I got my xbox one setup to share games with my son's xbox in his room, however i bought rdr2 today and it installed on his xbox. is there a way to change my xbox to the default for installs? because i dont need a rated M game on a 7 year old's console
 by accident. normally when i install it gives me the option of picking which xbox, but i didnt get one for rdr2 at all. and i ended up having to delete the game before he started to play it.

            Anything you purchase will automatically install on your Home console, even when you pick another console. So since you have your son's console set as your Home to share your games, everything will automatically install there. So you would either need
 to remove the console as your Home and buy the games separately for him, or remove the games from his console like you did today.

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 Jugendschutzeinstellungen</h2>
                    <p>Hallo,<br />Ich habe ein Problem mit den Jugendschutzeinstellungen. Im Spiel Forza Horizon 3 gibt es die Funktionen, dass man Designs/Lackierungen und Tunings herunterladen kann sowie auf das Auktionshaus zugreifen kann. Dies funktioniert aber bei mir nicht da ich ein Kinderkonto habe. Deswegen habe ich mir ein Erwachsenenkonto erstellt und mien Kinderkonto in die Familie eingeladen. und dann habe ich alle Einstellungen, die für diese Funktionen wichtig sein könnten auf "Zulassen" gestellt aber als ich wieder ins Spiel gegangen bin ging es immer noch nicht. Kann mir da jemand helfen?</p><p>Danke</p><p>Gruß</p><p>Louis</p>

<h2>            Opening Photo Viewer through command line windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Suppose we have multiple JPG files in a folder.</p>
<p>When you go to that folder and open that Photos Viewer app is opened and you can scroll through other images present in the same folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when you open an image from the command prompt you cannot scroll for other images present in the same folder.</p>
<p>I used following commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply location of file like "C:\ImageFolder\Image.jgp"</p>
<p>or "start&nbsp;C:\ImageFolder\Image.jgp"</p>
<p>

            No command prompt does not work like that but you can use tab.
<br />When I want to scan through files in command prompt or powershell i do a dir 
<br />that will list them all then i would go to the top of the list type that first.
<br />So.. c:\imagefolder\image.jpg
<br />then i would hit tab and that scan through the files.
<br />
<br />Does that help?

<p>Hi SarahKong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I should have mentioned this earlier, the actual issue is I am opening&nbsp;files through Java using Runtime.exec() method which in terms uses cmd.</p>
<p>In Windows 7 and lower version it worked (That time I used java.awt.Desktop API). But for some reason Windows 10 photo viewer app does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So looking for an alternate way to open one image in the folder and able to scroll through other images in the same folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has some photos app by default</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Privacy and Online Settings</h2>
                    I can't access my privacy and online settings so I can change my account to an adult profile. I got a windows phone a while ago and after a night of pain, I finally managed to get it working but then realised how far behind it was than the other phones
 so I reverted back to my Android. Lately, I have been told time and time again that the windows phone is much better but it still hasn't got rid of this terrible tricky setup where I have to be an adult to setup. I log into my account, go to privacy and online
 settings, asked to confirm who I am so I put in my account details but when I click to sign in. it just refreshes the page. Could you please revert my profile to an adult account. I know you are all so very busy at the moment but I am just struggling to find
 the will to live while setting up this phone so i know you all understand my problem so could you please do this?

<p>That won't actually do what you want anyway. &nbsp;To promote your account to adult status you have to use an Xbox, the settings on that page will just set the permissions, not remove the child status on your account. &nbsp;The ONLY way to promote your account is
 to download your profile onto an Xbox and go to Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Promote Account (it may be on a panel to the right.) &nbsp;You also have to be over 18 for it to work as determined by the birthdate on your account at account.live.com &nbsp;Support can't do it
 because reasons.</p>
<p>You can also set up My Family on windowsphone.com using your parent account and just use the account as a child.</p>

            Also, look for Windows Firewall and make sure it is turned on, &nbsp;no matter what. For some reason, &nbsp;Windows 10 updates fail if Windows Firewall is off (which is actually the subject of a question I have just asked in the forums and for which I am awaiting
 feedback).

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that we have an ongoing issue with signing in to Skype and it seems like this issue affects some features in Skype causing the incorrect contacts status, you're showing as offline and connection issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But do not worry, our engineers are actively working to fix the issue. For now, we recommend signing in using a different account or use Skype for Web. As for updates and news, we'll keep you posted. You can check the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype status</a> page from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for sending and receiving message, we had an issue with this earlier but do not worry, our engineers are already rolling out the fix. What I can suggest is to refresh the Skype app.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure to sign out of Skype.</li><li>Uninstall Skype.</li><li>Restart your device.</li><li>Reinstall Skype and sign back in then check if you can send or receive messages.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - fine for a while, recently started crashing with BSOD &#40;Blue Screen of Death&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I am a bit frustrated. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 10 and except for Bluetooth being flakey (ASUS has yet to release the Qualcomm Atheros bluetooth drivers for their Rampage IV Extreme) I was quite happy with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was good but after some time using it I started getting BSODs and the frequency seems to be increasing even though I changed nothing on the computer (so far I see Critical Kernel events on 9/25, 9/28, twice on 10/11 and 10/12). &nbsp;My guess is that Windows
 Updates pushed a defective update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went searching and found an article on how to report and *supposedly* get help from Microsoft Support on the issue (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d). &nbsp;In that
 article it recommends uploading the kernel dump and sysinfo to OneDrive, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I see no instructions for how to share my information with Microsoft (maybe they already have access?) without exposing the information to the whole world and no instructions on how to open a support ticket. &nbsp;So, before I go hunting for a phone
 number to pester them... </p>
<p>
</p><p>...I figured I'd ask here in the hope that someone can point me in the right direction.</p>

            <p>Verifier is supposed to crash when it loads the mis behaving driver. If it is crashing on boot it is probably a MS driver but those should not have been being verified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could have helped you turn verifier off</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could have done a repair install from the ISO</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive may be locked because there is an ongoing repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what you have to do for Carbonite</p>

</p>
<div style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1); text-align: center">
Skype version 8.21.0.7 and <span style="color: rgba(43, 44, 51, 1)">
Calling version 2018.18.01.11</span></div>
).
<p>
</p><p>Here, I am able to receive all the calls and messages from that contact and I am able to send messages to my skype mobile app. It is the only problem from MAC book pro and it's only for sending messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Solving this problem I tried a couple of options, Like uninstall and reinstalling Skype and clearing the cache and other options. still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is only from the last couple of weeks before it works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Idea to solve this issue.</p>

<p>Do you mean that you can send messages to only one contact but you cannot send messages to your other contacts or that you cannot send messages to one of your contacts but can successfully send messages to all your other contacts? Your post is ambiguous

<p>Even though you are seeing that your Graphics driver is up to date, please check GeForce official website for latest drivers. Sometimes device manager can not figure out if the driver is really up to date or not. Confusion right? please navigate to

<strong>here</strong></a>&nbsp;to know why this happens. &nbsp;</p>

            Check to ensure there is disk activity (look at the hard disk LED light to confirm. If there is, keep waiting. If setup goes beyond 2 to 3 hours, try the following steps.
<br />Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 20 seconds.
<br />If you are using a laptop, remove the battery if the option is available.
<br />Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet and/or turn off Wi-Fi).
<br />Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.
<br />See if it completes setup.
<br />If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try a startup repair.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.

<p>My situation is a follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 on my PC updated a couple of nights ago before shutting down for the night. Upon turning on my computer the next day, I found that I not only was I not &nbsp;connected to the internet, my wifi option had disappeared from my settings completely.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no wifi whatsoever on my PC and it seems that ethernet is my only form of connection which I have never used. I started looking up on my tablet (which can connect to the Internet via) for possible solutions such as inspecting my wireless adapter in
 my drivers. And as my boyfriend stated above, it has gone code 52. One of the suggestions was to uninstall/update the driver and then restart the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this with no success. I also tried running the command prompt as an administrator and typing in several different commands with no success. Resetting the system did not work as well, nor did a system restore. Disabling the firewall yielded the same
 results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know why this happened and it &nbsp;I need an Internet connection to fix the problem. What irony..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for providing additional details regarding what is the current status of the Wi-Fi connection on your computer. We would like to further clarify the steps that you have completed to resolve your issue by asking the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any error messages when you performed the uninstall and update of the Wi-Fi driver?</li><li>What are the commands that you have attempted to use in command prompt?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you attempt to connect your laptop using a wired connection so that you can manually download the latest device driver available from the website of the Wi-Fi card manufacturer. Doing this
<span>ensures</span> that you have the latest version of the device driver and correct any errors that were causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Upon running the Network Adapter troubleshooter, it noticed at one point that the wifi adapter was disabled. But &nbsp;after attempting to disable the driver and enable it again, I ran the troubleshooter once more only this time suggesting to plug in an ethernet
 cable. I also &nbsp;try downloading the driver from my computer manufacturers website, but that didn't help either. My computer is an HP Pavilion Slimline 400-334 PC. I hope that these screenshots I got gives you a better deal on what I'm dealing with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the update on the results of running the troubleshooter and completing the steps that were provided. Since even after completing the troubleshooting steps and also running the troubleshooter there is still no connection available on your computer,
 we suggest that you follow the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to perform a system restore that is one of the recovery options in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the section in the support article labeled "Restore from a system restore point". Choose a restore point prior to the installed update that caused the computer to lost network connectivity. Take note that doing a system restore will not affect your
 personal files but any applications that were installed or changes made to the settings on your computer will be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response once you complete the steps.</p>
        </p>

            I tried system restore, and &nbsp;my connection hasn't been fixed. I think it should be mentioned that I also cannot reset my PC. I tried a couple of times but it stopped after like 30%. No changes were made, including my internet connection. Plus I think attempting
 to do that resulted in erasing my other restore points.

Hi</p>
<p>When a Li-ion battery loses a certain percentage of it's charging capacity, you may see inconsistencies, such as the one you are describing in the charging circuit for the laptop.</p>
<p>The typical lifetime for a Li-ion battery is 1 to 3 years, depending on how it is used.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you create a battery report to check the status of the battery. Perform the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>1.</span></span></b> Go to
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span></b> / <b><span style="font-weight: bold">All Programs</span></b> /
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span></b>. <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Right click</span></b> the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Command Prompt</span></b> and select <b><span style="font-weight: bold">Run As Administrator</span></b>.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>2.</span></span></b> In the command prompt window, copy/paste the following command.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>powercfg -energy -output %userprofile%\desktop\energy-report.html</span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Press
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">ENTER</span></b>.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Wait until the command completes (usually about 2 minutes).</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>This will create a file named
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">energy-report.html</span></b> and place it on your
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Desktop</span></b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>3.</span></span></b> Go to the Desktop and double click the file to open.</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Scroll down to the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Battery: Battery Information</span></b> section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will see:</span></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Design Capacity</span></span></b> xxxxx</p>
<p><b><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Last Full Charge</span></span></b> xxxxx</p>
<p><span><span>(Where xxxxx is a number)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Copy this section and paste it in a reply here, for analysis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
