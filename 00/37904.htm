<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />

<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment

<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not work.

            Josh, what exactly did you do with your RAM? We don't fix Ram we only test it with memtest86 and swap sticks to try one at a time, also make absolutely sure it is specced correctly<br />
<br />
When you reset your FiOS did you make sure the correct hard drives is set first to boot? If a UEFI bios it can only be Windows boot manager set first to boot.<br />
<br />
I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files. These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent
 while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:<br />
<br />
1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>. Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.<br />
<br />
2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a><br />
<br />
Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a><br />
<br />
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer. If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />
3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />
If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here:
<a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration.
<br />
<br />
4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:
 If it doesnâ€™t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh:
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a><br />
<br />
Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page. Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3,
 Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />
5) If Safe Mode doesnâ€™t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options. Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow, DISM, a full Disk Check, or
 return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC. <br />
<br />
6) Better yet do the vastly superior Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. You can continue with the other steps there.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Sound turns off when I turn on my mic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> demetrikehoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound turns off when I turn on my mic</h2>
                    <p>So I have had Windows 10 for a while, and I just built my first desktop. I purchased the iDeaPlay V206 headphones to go with it. Whenever I turn on my my mic is being used, my sound cuts out. I have OBS on my computer because I love to record and edit videos.
 I don't use my mic, but today a friend told me that I should use it in my videos. I enabled it in OBS and the music in the background stopped playing. I went to the tab thinking it was paused, but the video was still playing. The volume was at 28% and the
 YouTube volume was at 100%. I turned off the mic again, and the music immediately started playing again. Does anyone know how I can use my mic and the sound at the same time? Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Dimjem<br />I read about your symptoms and drew two possible conclusions either A.  You need to change the settings within your sound control manager to prevent ducking which mutes sounds so that you may speak and be heard by the mic in use.  B.  Use something besides obs, I googled the symptoms you mentioned and people said this only happens with obs in conjunction with a bluetooth headset.  One person's solution was to plug a set of headphones into the computer and change the default playback device so he could have background music.  <br /><br />Hope this helps you,<br />Yomi Thomas

    <title>Windows 7 hangs forever on Shutting Down or Welcome screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 hangs forever on Shutting Down or Welcome screen</h2>
                    Windows 7 hangs forever on Shutting Down or Welcome screen. In my view a truly robust operating system would never hang and never allow a process to block console access. I suspect the Nvidia display driver interacting with obscure or unnecessary unmanaged
 Windows process.&nbsp;Every process should be monitored with a keep alive process. Loops in badly written driver or process code should be controlled by timing out.

<p>Click on the <strong><em>Customize</em></strong> button, then when the <strong>
<em>Settings</em></strong> window appears click the <strong><em>"Turn system system icons on or off"</em></strong> link.&nbsp; When the
<strong><em>"TURN SYSTEM ICONS ON OR OFF"</em></strong> page opens you should see a list of the system tray icons that you can turn on/off by clicking the&nbsp; sliding switch for each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the icons don't appear in the tray after turning them on, click the <strong>
^</strong> on the taskbar and if the icon appears in the popup you can drag it to a position in the tray area that you would like it to appear in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the icons still don't show in the tray area (either on the taskbar or in the hidden icon popup then there is a problem with the settings in Windows 10 on your machine or your user account.&nbsp; In this case try "refreshing" your system by going to
<strong>Settings</strong>-&gt;<strong>Update and Security</strong>-&gt;<strong>Recovery</strong>, then clicking on
<strong><em>Get Started</em></strong> under "Reset this PC".&nbsp; Choose to keep your data and applications.</p>

<p>Since your <strong>Power </strong>icon setting is grayed out the system may not have detected the battery and charger.&nbsp; This may mean that your laptop thinks it is running on AC power at all times.&nbsp; You can check this by opening right clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button and selecting <strong>Power Options</strong> from the menu.&nbsp; Click on the
<strong>"Change plan settings"</strong>. In the "<strong>Edit Plan Settings</strong>" window you should see separate settings for when the computer is running on battery or plugged in.&nbsp; If the battery settings are not visible you may need to download and install
 a special driver for the battery controller from your laptop manufacturers website.&nbsp; This issue happens with some laptops due to heavy customization or use of non-standard hardware by a manufacturer.&nbsp; If no driver is available ask your manufacturer to create
 one.&nbsp; Note that the driver may be part of a power management application for your PC.&nbsp; If no Windows 10 version is available, look for a Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 or Windows 7 version (in that order).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd07a715-d7e7-4bd5-b994-4fe15aad2b05" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - An alternate method is to open <strong>Device Manager</strong> (right-click
<strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> from the menu) and look for the
<strong>Batteries</strong> entry.&nbsp; If you double click this you should see something similar to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77bda03f-663c-488f-be88-9b071547d670" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if the <strong>Batteries</strong> category is not present, then you may need a driver from the laptop manufacturer for your system.&nbsp; (See instructions above for finding the driver)</p>

            Dave, your posts have been very helpful.&nbsp; I should've updated this sooner but the way I fixed this issue was just by restarting my computer and hoping for the best; and it did work- the battery icon appeared again and hasn't disappeared since.&nbsp; I just
 don't know why my computer did this in the first place, and I haven't modified anything.&nbsp; In the end, I went back to Windows 8.1 and this issue has completely stopped.<br />

    <title>I can&#39;t print emails from Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don roulo  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t print emails from Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP 8600 Office Jet Pro. I can print everything except my emails in Windows Live Mail. I can print the attachments and all forms of other documents except the actual email. I have Earthlink as my email provider and those emails then come in to Windows
 Live Mail. In Windows Live Mail I use the File pull down menu to print and the dialogue box is fine. I click Print and nothing happens. No error message at all.
</p>

<p>I saw an answer that says to change default browser and email program, but I am concerned this will mess up my emails since I have Earthlink as my email provider. I believe these are set up to receive and send with WLM and my Earthlink accounts being linked.
 Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi Don roulo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We will do our best to help you with that. It is possible that your Windows Live Mail is not set as your default e-mail program. If that is the case, it could be the reason why you are unable to print in Windows
 Live Mail because your printer cannot locate your e-mail program or your printer is being redirect to other e-mail program. To eliminate this symptom, we request that you set your Windows Live Mail as your default e-mail program. To do this, please follow
 these steps carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>2. In the program window press these keys on your keyboard, <strong>ALT</strong> +
<strong>F </strong>+ <strong>O</strong> + M</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Go to <strong>General</strong> tab and under <strong>Default Messaging programs</strong> category.</p>
<p>4. Click the <strong>Make Default</strong> button beside <strong>This application is the default mail handler.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leonard.</p>

            I can print from anywhere and everywhere else.&nbsp; This is the only place I have an issue.&nbsp; I am looking at the other answer posted and my only concern is if I change to having WLM be my default email will that mess up the settings I have to direce all my
 emails to come in from my Earthlink account.&nbsp; Do you know about that?

            <p>Leonard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I do what you suggested will it mess up the behind the scenes settings of my Earthlink emails.&nbsp; I have other email accounts...I think 3 of them that come from other sources, 2 from earthlink and 1 from my website hosting company.&nbsp; They all come in to
 Live Mail.&nbsp; I remember setting up all the emails with "pop3.earthlink"&nbsp; (example) and specific numbers etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I do what you suggest will that stop all my emails from coming in and going out through those sources?&nbsp; Will it mess it all up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Missing icon problem in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba laptop running Windows 10 set as my main display. I have a Dell HDMI monitor as a 2nd display. If I don't have the Dell connected and I boot up my laptop, my laptop desktop is missing the desktop icons. If I plug in my 2nd monitor, the icons
 all come back on the laptop screen but they are all out of order. This is intermittent and very aggravating. There are a lot of variations to this problem but I haven't found one exactly like the problem I am having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything to stop it but it won't go away. Read posts all the way back to 2010 but none seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have this problem come up lately and do you have a fix?</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft and other big companies recommends to keep our hardware and software updated to be secure.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still i can help you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just go to the network menu, click on the network(that you are connected to),&nbsp;</p>
<p>click on options and turn on "set as metered connection" option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will stop updates from being downloaded, if windows update is still showing "checking or downloading updates" then its ok because download maybe paused or will be stoped after few minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you are using Windows 10 creators update or later then you may able to pause the updates in updates settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that my Intel G3258 processor seems to be incompatible with builds 1703 and 1709, and they will not install.&nbsp; So, I seem to be caught in an endless cycle of the machine trying to install something that fails every time, and then rolls back
 to my existing version.&nbsp; I can't use the computer the whole time it is trying to install this update - which is virtually every time I turn it on (do I need to mention that it takes over an hour for it to try to install this update and then roll back? - and
 it takes even longer if no one is sitting their watching for the update to inevitable hang and then cycle power on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried all of the update repairs that I could find, none of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to block the update with the Windows Update Hiding Tool, and that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spent the last two weeks trying different ways to make this update work - clean install and all of that.&nbsp; But it just won't work with this processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling the Windows Update process doesn't work because it automatically gets re-enabled on the following power cycle.&nbsp; I've turned on the Metered Connections, but it still gives me the message about needing to update - I'm afraid that someone else using
 the computer will tell it to try to download.&nbsp; For that matter, it still seems to be downloading the update anyway, in spite of everything that I've done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a fairly computer savvy person (BSCSE and all), but I'm completely out of ideas on this one.</p>

            Thanks for asking!
<p>
</p><p>It has stopped trying to download the update at least. Maybe after I turned on the metered connection originally the update was already downloaded and I just didn't realize it - so it gave me the impression that the download was still happening (the update
 attempted to run when the computer was powered down - of course it failed and rolled back to the existing version - thank goodness Microsoft put that feature in the update process!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still get the message that the computer needs to be updated, and the message isn't very clear about how to not do the update.&nbsp; So, I'm still concerned that someone else using the computer will click the wrong thing and let the update try to run again,
 potentially causing a host of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also still searching for a solution to the problems I've had trying to upgrade to versions 1703 and 1709.&nbsp; In my mind that's the real core issue.&nbsp; I wouldn't be worried about disabling updates if it weren't for that.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for your assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to that is a little complicated since I've tried so many things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I let the update happen normally - windows downloads it, tries to install it, at about 30% the update freezes, I eventually cycle power manually, the update picks up again and continues to 83% and freezes again.&nbsp; Again, I eventually cycle power, and I
 get the message that the update has failed and that the original OS is being restored.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I make a Bootable USB with the update on it, and run it from Windows, the same sequence happens as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try a clean boot with the USB, again the same sequence happens.&nbsp; It also doesn't seem to matter whether or not I've disabled the Antivirus (Norton).&nbsp; The same thing happens in either case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried it asking for updates first, and I've also tried it by skipping updates.&nbsp; Again, the sequence is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to do a clean install (including a re-partition and format of the hard drive), I still have the problems with freezing is the same spots.&nbsp; But at the end I'll get a CLOCK WATCHDOG TIMEOUT stop code.&nbsp; If I try to do a repair on the system, I get
 the message that the system could not be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried it again, but this time going into the BIOS and disabling the Turbo Boost.&nbsp; Again, the update still freezes in the same places, but I get a different stop code:&nbsp; MACHINE CHECK EXCEPTION.&nbsp; Again, any attempt to repair the system fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry!&nbsp; I didn't know about the log files when I was doing the update from Windows, so I didn't retrieve those.&nbsp; There were no log files on the clean install (I was able to check after the install failed - it couldn't restore to the previous system since
 there was none - by using a repair disk to boot the system). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest update:&nbsp; I've managed to upgrade the system from version 1511 to 1607 using a bootable USB ISO image (but run from Windows).&nbsp; I plan to let this version of the system update itself, and then retry the 1709 update with a USB stick over the next couple
 of days.&nbsp; If it fails, I'll look for the log files and post them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hope at this point is that the 1607 version is recent enough that message demanding that I update the system will not be displayed - at least until the problem with the 1709 update is resolved for this system.&nbsp; And maybe the incremental updates will side-step
 the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last comment.&nbsp; The 1709 update has worked fine on my son's I7 and my mother's AMD computers.&nbsp; I'm suspicious that the root of the problem may be related to the Intel G3258 processor that is in this machine (it is NOT overclocked).&nbsp; I have seen notes
 in various forums about a microcode 19 issue with these processors.&nbsp; I have updated the BIOS for that issue, but the upgrade made no difference how the 1709 update failed to install.&nbsp; Feedback from Intel Technical Support indicates that they think this is
 not the problem.</p>

<p>The Windows 10 Version 1607 seems to be holding.&nbsp; The updates are working, and so far I've not been badgered about updating to version 1709 (although I'd be surprised if it didn't happen eventually).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that this version has been installed and updated, I'll go for 1703 within the next couple of days.&nbsp; If that goes okay, I'll try 1709 again.</p>

<p>I seemed to have hit a wall when trying to update to 1703.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried again twice today to do the update, but both attempts failed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first attempt I made an UEFI bootable USB stick with Rufus and tried running the setup as administrator on it from Windows.&nbsp; My hope was that this time, starting from version 1607 with updated drivers would make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also declined to
 check for updates since I had already checked for updates previously and there were none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it failed the same way as before - the update froze at 73%, the screen went blank and there was no disk activity. I waited about an hour, but there was no change, so I power-cycled the machine.&nbsp; The update resumed at 75% and then froze again at 88% (blank
 screen, no disk activity).&nbsp; I waited about 20 minutes, but there again was no change.&nbsp; So I power-cycled again.&nbsp; It attempted to recover the installation, but quickly gave that up and rolled back to version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code reported was 0xC1900101 - 0X4000D.&nbsp; Installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second attempt, I rechecked the drivers - and DID find some that the intel application apparently didn't update.&nbsp; So I updated those (from Device Manager).&nbsp; Then I did a Clean Boot (Disabled all apps in the Startup from Task manager, and shut down
 all non Microsoft processes from system configuration, and restarted the machine).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been suspicious that memory might be an issue, so I manually expanded the Page File from the 1.5 Gig that the system automatically allocated, and gave it a range of 8GB to 32 GB (I have 8 GB of memory).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled Norton and turned on Windows Defender.&nbsp; In addition, I disabled the Wireless connection (there is no LAN connection to this machine).&nbsp; At this point, I made sure that the machine was still in a clean boot mode - it was. Again, I ran Setup.exe
 from the USB stick as an Administrator, and again I declined to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time the install did not lock up on the first boot attempt like it did before.&nbsp; But it still locked up in the second boot phase (I think in the same place - I was out of the room when it happened).&nbsp; Again I waited about 20 minutes with no screen or
 disk activity before cycling power on the machine.&nbsp; And again it rolled back to version 1607.&nbsp; But this time there was a different error:&nbsp; 0xC1900101 - 0x40017: Failed SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during BOOT Operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not seeing any Mini dumps or memory dumps - but maybe I'm just not looking in the right place? There are some files under the "C:\WINDOWS\Logs\WindowsUpdate" directory if that helps.&nbsp; And I did save some setuperr.log files from the Panther directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I really don't know what else to try.&nbsp; The only other thing I can think of to mention is that I do have the Windows Search and SuperFetch services disabled due to high disk usage that they seem to cause.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late response. <strong>CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT BSOD</strong> happens when your CPU encounters a cooperation or a sync issue with its physical cores and threads. Usually, it is caused by the processor itself, but it is not limited to that. It
 could also happen due to driver issues and it is also possible that Windows 10 is not that compatible with Intel Pentium G3258.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>M</strong><strong>ACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION</strong> error also happens when the CPU detects a hardware problem. Your motherboard, RAM, or your CPU itself may be encountering issues usually from over usage or over stressing. It seems that the issues
 on your PC are caused by hardware incompatibilities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your question about minidump files, if there's no dump file, you could always check the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong> and give us the messages that are indicated on it. To use the
<strong>Event Viewer</strong>, kindly refer to this <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749408(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. Also, you could try using the Windows Update troubleshooter to address your issue with Windows Updates. You can download it on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you have some funds, we recommend upgrading your CPU just to play safe. We also found some reported issues regarding Intel Pentium G3258 compatibility with Windows 10. Intel Core i5-4460 is a good choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Error code&#58; 0xC004C003</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I downloaded &nbsp;windows 10 (32-bit)Home and installed it to my desktop on 16th instant (Through MEDIA CREATION TOOL, chose 'upgrade pc',then 'keep personal files only'). I have a slip at back of my windows 7 dvd box from Microsoft having written my windows
 7 home basic(OEM PACK) product key , after installation i used that key but failed.... so i skipped that step when i later tried to activate my windows 10 from settings this error was shown up. I had &nbsp;my genuine windows 7 ACTIVATED(after 4/5 clean install
 &nbsp;had to activate thru telephone activation ,mine being OEM version) , so i think i am eligible to get a free update to windows 10...I called MICROSOFT ...they suggested me to wait for a few time ...told me to keep my pc internet &nbsp;connection on and put off
 all the antivirus &nbsp;off...How long shoud i wait? Have i done anything wrong..please let me know....</p>

            <p>I have&nbsp;probably same problems:<br />
I upgraded Windows 8 Pro to W8.1. Things were going well.<br />
When the process ended up by requesting me to log&nbsp; on my laptop with a Microsoft account username and password, I got the message telling me the password was wrong. I knew it was not wrong because I was still able to log on into the web using the same password.<br />
After trying many times without success, I changed the password as suggested. Again, I have not been able to log on to my laptop using the administrator account...and again, the said-to-be wrong password still working.</p>
<p><br />

            Likewise.<br />
After all the downloading and wasted time to update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8, it then asks for a local account password. No idea I had a local account never mind a password.<br />
Bottom line is reverted to Windows 8<br />

Once I re-installed windows on my computer with the cd, the service pack 1 in the computer properties was missing.&nbsp; I manually added it with through the component services.&nbsp; It now appears in the computer properties.&nbsp; The computer properties shows windows vista
 home premium,service pack 1, 32 bit operating system.&nbsp; However, the sp1 (KB936330) will not install in the updates.

<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />To format a partition using Disk Management, use these steps: Open Start. Search for Disk Management and click the top result to open the experience. Right-click the new hard drive and select the Format option.
<br />
<br />Check this link, I hope it helps

            Hi Richie
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'This PC'
<br />
<br />On the right, right click that external drive and choose 'Format'
<br />
<br />Make sure the file system is NTFS, a quick format will do . . .

            I would assume that you have an acer laptop, this message is from a program called acer instant update service (if I recall correctly) which is used for e-mail purposes if you choose to use that program. I deleted the program off of my computer and have
 had no problems further.

            I dont think anything can help unless you replace the harddisc i know this very well if you make your pc go back to fabric mode i will still be there and if u use a virus program to search for it it will probably not help anyway so my advise for you is
 to change the harddisc

            It's some kind of program to help you get email faster, but I've found no use for it, and it doesn't seem to help the process in the first place. It's connected to the program called iuemailoutlookagent, and typing that into the search will help you find
 it, and you can delete it from there.

            The error messages DUMMYFORM and PREFETCH FORM are both appearing at random. Sometimes they come one after another and&nbsp; sometimes one of the either pops up, and prevents the shutting down. BOTH these applications or programmes are NOT listed&nbsp; in the list
 of "UNINSTAL".&nbsp; So, how do I uninstall btoh these?&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of these are causing unnecessary delays.&nbsp; This message is specifically addressed to the Microsoft Support Engineer who has answered the earlier query by someother user, and suggested that&nbsp; this program
 be unistalled.&nbsp; By this time, the Support Team MUST be aware that these do NOT appear on the UNINSTAL list. So, MICROSOFT must give a solution which can be acted upon.

<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>.  In the Scan Settings first set it to include scanning for Rootkits.  
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions, Home Page settings, Search service or Add-On's as shown here:  <a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can turn off its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Account Details tab.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Trading, borrowing and selling games....</h2>
                    
<p>I know a lot of people hate on the practices and some people like to do it.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Do you trade, sell or borrow games?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Something I have always done and will continue to do is buy/sell/borrow games with friends.&nbsp; In fact I bought Borderlands 2 from a friend who didn't love the game and had finished it for 30 dollars.&nbsp; That's not much less than a good auction will fetch on
 ebay and he wouldn't get much more than that at Gamestop.&nbsp; So I think he got a good deal considering he didn't have to go through any hassle.&nbsp; I also loan out and&nbsp;borrow a lot of games, so I see nothing wrong with that at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for trading in the Gamestop sense that most people think of, I think it's ok under certain conditions.&nbsp; If you finished the game or don't like it, and you want to trade it, go for it.&nbsp; Just don't give away your game.&nbsp; Gamestop will give you 20$ for a
 game they plan on selling for 55$.&nbsp; That is ridiculous.&nbsp; Make sure they have promotions going where you can get 35 or 40 $ for the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as I am bored of a game or I know I will no longer play it, I trade it in. Sometimes I just give them away to friends or family.&nbsp; &nbsp;That way someone else can enjoy&nbsp;them and&nbsp;they are&nbsp;not taking up unnecessary space. &nbsp;I usually only keep around 20-25
 xbox 360 games in my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't trade games w/ friends, as the friends that still live close to me, I don't see them as often as I would like. &nbsp;I don't trade or sell my games, because I never know when I'll want to play them again. &nbsp;Plus, I always regret selling something down
 the road, and I don't exactly need that extra 5 bucks the game will net me.</p>

<p>I used to trade-in games fairly often, but these days I can't trade 'em in or sell 'em, so it's a bit of a moot point for me. However, I do lend or just give out games to people I know so they can get some enjoyement out of them. In particuilar I like to
 loan games that I know they may never have gotten a chance to play due to low funds. Since money is tight these days they'll keep their money for games they're really confident about and ignore smaller, less known titles, so it's nice to let them get a shot
 of such games and experience titles that might now have otherwise.</p>

[/quote]I only buy new games, usually on release date, i never borrow or rent, until recently i used to trade games in when i had had my fill, but with trade in prices so bad at the moment i just keep hold of them, my son is happy now as he gets much longer
 to finish my games, i don't lend games to other people either...

<p>I like it. I think you will be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't. A lot of people buy games used, and even if they don't like selling their own games, they have to be able to see that someone has to trade them for a low price for you pay less.<br />
<br />
I don't sell games anymore unless I really absolutely despise them. I try to keep all of my games even if I do play them rarely, because if I sell them one day I say to myself "man, I really want to play that". I'm still regretting selling Red Faction Guerrilla
 way back, but I haven't had time to pick it back up. <br />
<br />
The only game I've actually sold this year was Battlefield 3. I was so disappointed with that that I decided to trade it in after not playing it a single day for a little over half a year. Even Battle Log couldn't remember the last time I played.</p>

<p>Interesting posts you all. &nbsp;I actually figured more people would be in the camp of pro trade ins haha.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm surprised more people don't lend or borrow games. &nbsp;I remember being a kid and the first game I borrowed from someone was The Karate Kid on the NES. &nbsp;It was huge fun for me at the time, though I'm sure now I'd probably hate the game today. &nbsp;I suppose
 though, it depends on the people you know. &nbsp;There are people I know that I would never loan a game to so I guess I understand why. &nbsp;

<p>I trade in games i'l never play again if I can get a decent price for them if not I keep them, I will never understand why anyone will trade in a game for like $1. Example, project slypheed, i will probably never play it again, but I bought it for $3 and
 can only trade it in for like $0.25 I will never sell a game for that price.</p>
