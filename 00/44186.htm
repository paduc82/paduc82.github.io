<h2>            Win7&#58; Red &#39;X&#39; Network icon when connected to internet____</h2>
                    
<p>I looked through the suggestions on <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/c3ee2c3f-82e5-44c7-8f40-ee7fb7f48c83" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread </a>and have had no luck. I tried updating the drives, but Windows said I'm already using the latest drivers. I tried the winmgmt /verify and /salvage repositories.&nbsp; Both seemed to change nothing and indicate that my WMI repository was 'consistent'
 (but only when started from a 64-bit cmd.exe; 32-bit cmd.exe gave failure messages with WMI repository (verification/salvage) failed, Error Code: 0x8007007E).</p>
<p>Perhaps related, but I have two network connections (1 is redundant) to my server.&nbsp; Each shows an access type of 'Internet'.&nbsp; Both are hooked up to my Home Network (one on Home Connection, the other on Home Connection2).&nbsp; System map draws a little map out
 to the world through a switch and gateway.</p>
<p>Of possible note -- though it shouldn't cause a broken network light, IMO, is that fact that I don't have IPv6 connectivity on either connection -- only IPv4, but this is unremarkable, since IPv6 isn't widely deployed, if at all, on home ISP's in the US.&nbsp;
 That shouldn't cause the network icon to display 'X', I would think -- which should mean no, or 'broken' connectivity -- but each of the two wired network cards shows normal Internet connectivity.&nbsp; I don't know of any other functionality that is impaired --other
 than the status icon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really want to hide it, since it 'should' indicate useful status.&nbsp; I just would really like it to indicate useful status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I am BTW, running Microsoft's Security Essentials, which has my entire system under complete scan w/no exceptions, and it verifies my system to be malware free (to the extent that Microsoft Security Essentials actually works :-)).</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Two Network cards in a computer both set on the same Network is not a good idea.</p>
<p>If you do not want to disable one of them at least set the one that you consider redundant with a larger metrics.<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/metrics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/metrics.html</a></p>
<p>As for the drivers. If the Drivers are the latest drivers form the vendor's support site, then leave it alone.</p>
<p>Otherwise. if Windows refuses to take the vendor's drivers. Uninstall the cureent drivers and force (by using the having disk option) to install the Vendor's drivers.</p>

<p>The cards are both Intel Gigabit Express cards.</p>
<p>Two network cards on the same computer to the same network are not a good idea, Jack?&nbsp; Then why does MS say that is the ONLY good configuration and that having them on different networks will cause a problem?&nbsp; By configuring both cards with a default gateway,
 you get the following message:</p>
<p>"Warning - Multiple default gateways are intended to provide redundancy to a single network (such as an intranet or the Internet).&nbsp; They will not function properly when the gateways are on two separate, disjoint networks (such as on on your intranet and
 one on the Internet).&nbsp; Do you want to save this configuration?"</p>
<p>In my case, they both have default gateways defined that lead to the same place.&nbsp; So it sounds like what I'm doing is exactly the only case that is supported.&nbsp; Alternatively, if I had a direct connection to my server&nbsp; or a managed switch, I could bond two
 channels together and get 1 200Mbps network port. &nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't have the managed switch part, so that doesn't work -- so for now I just use them as redundant channels as seems to be the supported configuration for Windows.&nbsp; Are you saying MS is
 wrong and that their product doesn't work (other than the fact that the network indicator doesn't show status correctly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks (for some reason, even though I check for alerts to be sent to me when someone posts, I don't get notifications, so I don't always know when a response has been posted)....</p>

            This symptom is now intermittent. I see no different in the details of each connection with it is working vs. not. In both cases, the ipv4 connection shows a connection to the internet on both connections, and no connection to the internet via ipv6. However,
 sometimes the icon shows an a red 'X' indicating a connectivity problem, and other times it shows as 'fine'. In either case, I notice no problem in network connectivity, so it's a case of the software crying 'wolf' when there is no problem, at this point.
 Unfortunately, that prevents really knowing if the 'X' is significant or not -- and unfortunately, as such, is 'noise'. Very unfortunate. I really believe this to be a step backwards from XP, where it shows (I still have an XP machine next to my Win7 machine
 that is faster at most** system-related/OS things on machine 1/3rd the speed), that shows both the upload and download indicators for BOTH interfaces, as they are used. Very helpful in comparison with a simple 'X', that is used for bot

<h2>            I can&#39;t type in windows 10</h2>
                    After recently upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10 I am able to enter my password when starting up my laptop, but when I try to type in apps like google chrome and spotify the apps freeze and then proceed to crash. I don't know what is causing this
 as it's not the keyboard because I can enter my password. Any help is appreciated.

            Hi ronbaer1,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing. 
<br />
<br />You are asking if a webcam is compatible with this model of television. This all depends on what device you will be using Skype with. As long as the camera is connectable to the device, and that device (computer or laptop, etc.) is connectable to the television, it will work.
<br />
<br />You may need some cable adaptors to be able to plug the device into the television, as it is not a 'standard' computer monitor with the correct ports. I suggest you investigate this,
<br />
<br />I hope I was able to help!

            <p>Sorry to hear of your problems. &nbsp;Do you get any type of error message when the download stops? &nbsp;Do you have a hard drive? &nbsp;Are you connected wirelessly or via ethernet cable?</p>
<p>You can redownload items from your download history. &nbsp;This can be reached on the console dashboard by going to System&gt;Accounts&gt;Download History.</p>

<p>Hi, no there is just the Message that it stopped downloading. I use a USB-stick because my hard drive is not big enough. Could tat be the problem? Otherwise it was no problem downloading other demos. I am connected wirelessly. Redownloading does not work
 as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
What country/region are you currently located in?<br />
<br />
What country/region is your LIVE account registered to? Please check <strong><a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
I ask this because sometimes people purchase consoles abroad or purchase consoles in countries where they shouldn't be sold. Any sort of promotional material in those consoles can only be successfully redeemed and downloaded in the same country/region they
 were meant for.<br />
<br />
For example, if someone is in Brazil decides to purchase a console in the United States, the promotional items in that console are only guaranteed to work on a United States Xbox LIVE account and while physically located in the United States.</p>

<h2>            Sticky Notes crashes right after opening</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago Sticky Notes in Windows 10 told me there was an update available, so I updated. Ever since then it crashes about 7 or 8 seconds after I open it. I've tried several things I saw online, including uninstalling and re-installing the app,
 which meant I lost everything in my notes (I was smart enough to take a screenshot first). Anyone know what to do? Can you go back to the old version?</p>

<p>I am having the same issue.&nbsp; It started after updating two computers to the October Update (v1803).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1803 update installed fine on my Dell desktop and on my Surface Pro 2017.&nbsp; When I started sticky notes on the Dell Desktop it asked if I wanted to sync with my Microsoft account and I said yes.&nbsp; I started sticky notes on my Surface Pro 2017 that has
 many ink notes and I got the same prompt to sync to a Microsoft account.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it crashes about 2 seconds after that dialog is visible so I cannot either pick sync or Not Now.&nbsp; Just stuck in an endless loop of crashing on my surface pro.</p>

<p>Windows 10 1803 when Sticky Notes is updated to version 3 on some computers as soon as Sticky Notes 3 starts to load the computer Blue Screens. Uninstall Sticky Notes 3 and reinstall of Sticky Notes 3 does not resolve the issue.&nbsp; So far I have found no solution

<p>I am also now experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Using a surface pro 2017 i7/16gb ram.</p>
<p>-Latest update I've installed: "2018-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4462919)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first opened sticky notes today after installing the above mentioned update last night. Sticky notes asked me if I wanted to sync with my account and I figured why not, then proceeds to crash. I am now unable to open sticky notes without it crashing profusely
 moments after starting up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if syncing with my account was what causes the issue, but I didn't do anything else differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is of high importance for me because of the practicality of sticky notes drawing/writing, visualization etc... Love the app. Use it for development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked App store for updates and it advises that everything I have is up to date.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Still having the same issue. The app opens. Sits for a moment, while the mouse cursor turns to an hourglass and then the app closes without warning (Takes approximately 15-20 seconds total).</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your issue to Microsoft communities.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing performance issues with windows 8.1. I understand that this must be inconvenient but rest assured, we are here
 to help you and guide you in the right direction.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>This issue occurs because Windows 8.1 introduced changes to mouse input processing for low-latency interaction scenarios. Therefore, games respond to mouse inputs differently in Windows 8.1 than in earlier versions of Windows.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you using a mouse or the touchpad?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Try the following: </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Try unplugging the mouse and plugging it back in. </span></li><li><span>Try minimizing and then maximizing the game.</span></li><li><span>Please check if there is any in game setting which is disabling the mouse pointer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Check if the mouse responds in any of these scenarios.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
To troubleshoot this issue,&nbsp;please use the following method.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 1: Compatibility mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please use the following link and try to install the game in compatibility mode and check if you are able to use your mouse.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did use both on my laptop, and also tried to install it onto my tablet what is used by pen and mouse, none of them worked.</p>
<p>Restart/cable check/replug did not work.</p>
<p>When minimizing the game it moves in windows and any other application, but when i switch back to the game it stays there where i left it.</p>
<p>Compatibility mode did not work either (nor at the install nor at the running)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have anything in mind to try?</p>

Our research suggests that this game is not compatible with windows 8.1 unless an update is released by the Game manufacturers. I’d suggest you to try running the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP).<br />
<br />
If this doesn’t help I’d suggest you to contact the game manufacturers.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful. Please let us know if you have any other queries regarding Windows, we are here to help you.</p>

    <title>usb dvd-rom not recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emic  say:</h3>
<h2>            usb dvd-rom not recognized</h2>
                    <div>Hello, <br />
I got&nbsp;two Acer Aspire 722 netbooks (Windows 7&nbsp; home premium OS) for my kids and purchased an external USB optical dvdrom to play dvds/cds. When I plug it in, I get the message "device driver software not successfully installed". It shows up in device manager
 as an unknown device.<br />
<br />
The drive came with a cd with drivers, but it appears they are w98 to XP era. Since I couldn't read the disk, I copied them to a flash drive, but they don't install. The instructions mention to check for a USB Universal Host Controller and to enable "On Chip
 USB" under "Chipset Features" or "Integrated Peripherals". I looked at the BIOS menu items, but there are no options resembling this instruction.<br />
<br />
The drive works fine on my desktop (Vista OS). It shows up as a Philips SDR089 USB Device if that's any help. On the desktop, the driver detail shows cdrom.sys<br />
I tried manually updating the drivers to the cdrom.sys on the netbook but&nbsp;it won't accept it as it appears to be looking for an .inf file (file type is locked to .inf).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? I found one post that said a netbook may not have enough power for this drive, but the drive has a second connector that goes to the power input so it seems like that should be adequate, especially with the netbook connected to AC power. It
 only needs the single usb to run on the desktop. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems like something is wrong with the drivers or USB controller settings, any advice is appreciated.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Hello Varisa,
<br />
<br />Regarding current rules only residents of Switzerland can buy a Swiss Skype Number.
<br />
<br />I didn't see any workarounds for this.
<br />
<br />Try to get support via chat: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/s...</a>. 
<br />
<br />Maybe they could suggest some alternatives.

            <p><strong>If the Reservation application (Windows 10 app) has a blank screen or does not work or is not available:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Check Windows Update for an updated version of KB2952664 (Windows 7 SP1) or KB2976978 (Windows 8.x)</strong></li><li>After installing the Windows Update, re-run the&nbsp;Compatibility Appraiser.

<ul>
<li>schtasks.exe /Run /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser"</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once started, it may take&nbsp;10 minutes or so&nbsp;for the appraiser to complete. Once&nbsp;complete, re-open the Get Windows 10 app and it will have the updated compatibility information.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your concern, we suggest that you try to perform a clean boot in Windows using this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Doing a clean boot does not solve my problem. When I am on the services tab of msconfig and I select hide all Microsoft services there are no other services running. I tried using a clean install of Win 7 professional and the results are always the same.
 Once I try to provision the target and the target has to reboot it goes directly to BSOD even in safe mode. I'm forced to use a recovery disk and restore to a RestorePoint I created before trying the provisioning or re-image the drive. After I recover the
 target and it boots up again I see a "Test Mode Windows 7 Build 7601" in the lower right corner.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One only works with internal wireless card removed</h2>
                    My Xbox One died the other day so I took it apart to clean it out. &nbsp;After cleaning it it still wouldn't turn on. &nbsp;I stumbled across that if I unplugged my internal wireless card that the xbox worked fine, other than not connecting to a wireless network
 and not being able to connect a wireless remote. &nbsp;When I plug the internal wireless card in while the Xbox is running, it will shut the Xbox off automatically and it won't turn on unless you unplug the internal wireless card. &nbsp;Anyone have something for this?
 &nbsp;I'd assume a ground a busted somewhere but I'm not too savvy with circuit boards.

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading through your post, it is determined that in an attempt to give power to the console, you opened the console and cleaned the inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would have been recommended here would have been to <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repair or replace</a></strong> the console, but as provided
 through our <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/my-account/warranty-and-service/xbox-support-terms-conditions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Terms &amp; Conditions</a></strong> the following information:</p>

</p><p>Concerning power issues with the console, it would be best to ensure that the issue is not due to wall outlets not giving enough power or the cable itself used for power causing these types of issues.</p>

                    <p>Hey! So my Forza 4 just crashes when i am trying to play Forza Horizon 4 on gamecapture on streamlabs (OBS). I can only play Forza 4 with display capture but its very laggy on the stream meanwhile it doesn't lag for me. I would like any suggestions to solve
 this problem because i really wanna stream Horizon. Is this a problem that will be fixed because i have seen alot of topics about this or should it be like this?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jesper!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you bringing this up, usually if a stream is lagging it could be attributed to the amount of hardware dedicated to the streaming software. I recommend checking out the Forza and OBS forums for additional information to hopefully end the lag for the
 stream. Check the links below for those forums.</p>

<p>You know this is incorrect. The dude can stream other games. The problem is that he can't get game capture to work. I am having the same issue along with ALL of the FH4 community... literally google the problem and you are slapped with many many many forums
 with NO FIX! So please remove the game capture block on Forza and for that matter ALL Windows 10 games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Aaron_H.</p>
<p>Make sure you've got the latest drivers for your graphics card.&nbsp; As Quake 3 Arena requires OpenGL which doesn't ship with Windows.&nbsp; Hopefully Intel has implemented it in their WDDM drivers.</p>
<p>It runs fine here on my ATI and nVidia graphics cards.</p>

<h2>            Changing default gamertag...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I'm new to Xbox ... I just bought a Xbox 360.</p>
<p>First I'm from Greece...</p>
<p>Few years ago I had bought the PC game "Batman: Arkam Asylum" and I had to make an Live account to play the game with the achivements. That period Live was not available at greece, and I tried to connect&nbsp;with my&nbsp;(old) hotmail account, but it didn't&nbsp;worked.
 So I played the game with a local (to save on pc) account (and no achivements). After some time (I had&nbsp;finished the game)&nbsp;the LIve became available at Greece and then i tried and made an account with the same (old) hotmail account, and played the game again
 to do the achivements. That time I noticed that I had a Gamertag, that I haven't choose, but it wouldn't matter because I just used it to play the Live games at my PC and I didn't want to do anything xbox live.</p>
<p>Now I bought a Xbox 360 and also I want to&nbsp;use the multiplayer, but I would like to use a gamertag that I like and my friends know how to find me...</p>
<p>Is it possible to make this change for Free (just this once)</p>
<p>Thanx, and Happy new year...</p>

<p>I have this gamertag enough time... because it was created automatic, when I had to use my old hotmail.com account to make a LIve ID to play games on a PC. But as I wrote before, then I just wanted to play the game and do the achivements... and then the
 Xobox Live was just activated in Greece and there was some problem connecting to your account, so I didn't pay any attention and keep playing my games at the PC...
</p>
<p>I bought the Xbox just today...and connected it with that account...</p>

<h2>            Error E66 &#40;one red light&#41; while installing new update May 2011</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>when i do the update on my older xbox 360 i get the e66 error with single flashing red light at the front of the console close before the setup is finished. when i turn the console back on and don't do the update it does work without it, but that obviously
 won't get me online. e66 is described as a problem with the firmware and the dvd drive and if u get it, then it could be due to the drive has undergone somekind of modification or flashing but none of that happened with my piece.</p>
<p>i already heard about other people complaining about their broken dvd drive after the update, but my update won't even finish. i wonder if other people have also experienced the e66 bug and if microsoft will also replace my console with a new one.</p>

<p>no, but i repaired the console myself after a ring of death (3 red lights). clamps that hold the cooler had to be replaced with screws and the problem was solved. but there was nothing modified or replaced other than that. my games and the stuff i bought
 at the marketplace are of course legal. i doubt microsoft can blame me for that.</p>

<p>If you have received the E66 Error, it indicates the console has been modified. Unfortunately you will not receive a replacement console as opening the console voids the warranty and violates the terms of use. Your console will never take the update due
 to this, which also means that without the update it will never be able to connect to Live.</p>
<p>In this case, buying a new console is the best resolution.</p>

</p><p>I have received two BSOD&nbsp;VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR when watching Netflix on Internet explorer 11 on recently upgraded Windows 10. This only started happening today and only happens when the show I am watching on Netflix is about to switch to next episode.
 Right when its about to show the little window showing next "next episode in 15 secs" it crashes the computer with BSOD&nbsp;VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR and a buzzing sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my GPU drivers and they are up to date according to Nvdia.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>uninstall and reinstall display drivers </strong>
and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <strong>uninstall display driver</strong>, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>and click <strong>device manager.</strong><br />
b. Click to expand <strong>display adapters</strong>, right click the adapter and click
<strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you may <strong>download and install latest display driver from the computer manufacturer's wesbite
</strong>and check.</p>

            I don't know if this helps, but I've just realized that this error only happens while I'm watching netflix on my main monitor. If I drag the IE/Edge window to my second monitor (Viewsonic projector) it works just fine.

<h2>            Wifi Networking Problem especially on Secured Networking</h2>
                    I am using pre-installed Windows 7 on Toshiba L510-432 notebook and I have problem in connecting to wifi network. There is intermittent connection should I on unsecured wifi network but worse is when connecting to secured wifi network where normally the
 message is 'mismatched key'. Upon trying many times, it gets connected but to 'Limited Access - No Network Access'. This happens every time connecting to secured wifi connection.<br />
<br />
Using Realtek RTL8187B adapter. I have updated Windows 7 and have also updated Realtek driver.
<br />
<br />
How to solve this problem?

<p><span>I had the same problem, but I FIGURED IT OUT! I went from windows vista home premium to windows 7 ultimate, and my internet kept&nbsp;disconnecting. I had
 updated the drivers to the windows 7 drivers from realtek website, but it made no difference. Here's what I did to fix this problem with&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b wifi:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Download the windows vista drivers for&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b</span></p>
<p><span>2. Go to&nbsp;Control Panel-&gt; Hardware and Sound-&gt; Devices and Printers</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on the name of your computer and click "device installation settings"</span></p>
<p><span>4. Turn off auto driver updates from windows. Otherwise, windows will automatically reinstall the windows 7 drivers for&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b, which would
 cause it to have the same problem again.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Go to Control Panel-&gt; hardware and sound-&gt; device manager and find&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b under network adapters and uninstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Go to the location where you saved the vista drivers for&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b. Install the visa drivers for&nbsp;realtek rtl8187b. Driver date should be:&nbsp;3/23/2009
 and the driver version should be:&nbsp;6.1159.323.2009</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now hopefully your internet is working properly again!&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            windows 10 activation issues</h2>
                    <p>I got a PC that someone upgraded to Windows 10 and I am getting the following error: 0x803f7001.&nbsp; I have tried all the suggestions: call the phone number(they could not verify my code), enter in code that goes with version of windows 10 (still get the same
 message), etc.&nbsp; I cannot revert back to Windows 7 that came with the computer because 7 is no longer on the machine.&nbsp; I do have the code for Windows 7, but that just gave me another code: 0x80041023.&nbsp; I have looked for this particular problem on the internet

            <p>I believe you can download Windows 7 from Microsoft if you have the Product Key, but if it is an OEM Key, you might have to get it from the manufacturer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly you could activate with the Windows 7 key, but you might have to first clean-install Windows 10 and select "I don't have a Product Key" during install.&nbsp; Then use the Activation Troubleshooter to try to activate with the Windows 7 Product Key.&nbsp; This
 might only work if it was at one time successfully activated with that Windows 7 Product Key (because the free upgrade date - July 29, 2016 - has past).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get the latest Windows 10 install through here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can update the existing install to the Anniversary Update, via Windows Update, you can try the Activation Troubleshooter too.&nbsp; There is some new functionality in the latest Windows build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support may be able to help by phone, since it was updated prior to July 29th, but failed to activate and you have the valid Windows 7 Product Key.&nbsp; There is Chat support offered in the Activation Troubleshooter for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you happen to use Assistive Technologies, you can still upgrade from Windows 7 for free, as described on this Microsoft page.&nbsp; There is rumor that this page may soon be pulled, although the offer remains for anyone with these requirements.</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have to download from the manufacturer and I cannot find on gateway where I would be able to do that. &nbsp;I have been to Microsoft website and they cannot help me. &nbsp;I tried to activate with the product key for Window 7 (I have the key) and it wouldn't
 work. &nbsp;Now, I would like to install Windows 7 from the advanced boot options, but I cannot get into those either. &nbsp;I thought maybe the hard drive was changed, but when I looked at the partitions, it looks like their is a separate partition that should have
 the factory settings on it, but I can't get to it. &nbsp;I've been working on this problem for a week and I do not see a solution to this issue. &nbsp;Gateway is of no use because their customer service sucks. &nbsp;I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Let's first check if the Product Key for Windows 7 (that it was actually upgraded from) matches what you have. &nbsp;If Windows 10 was clean-installed, this won't work, but if it was upgraded while Windows 7 was running and activated, the previous Windows 7 Product
 Key might still be recorded in Internet Explorer. &nbsp;A small free program (ProduKey) from Nirsoft can check for this and also Belarc Advisor. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On mine, you can see that the Internet Explorer Key matches the generic Windows 10 Pro Product Key, but on an upgraded install, Internet Explorer will show the previous OS Product Key.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Apparently, Gateway is owned by Acer now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can check what is on the partition that you see. &nbsp;If it is marked as a Recovery partition, you might have to use Diskpart to give it a drive letter. &nbsp;What does your Disk Management show? &nbsp;A Windows 10 install on an MBR disk will normally show a 500MB
 Recovery Partition at the beginning of the disk. &nbsp;If there are other Recovery partitions, one of them might have the Gateway Windows 7 files that you need.</p>

            It may also be worth mentioning that sometimes Windows 10 will not activate <em>
because </em>a Product Key was used during install. &nbsp;In this case, installing Windows 10 to a small partition and ensuring that no Product Key is used might activate OK (creates a dual-boot install of Windows 10). &nbsp;An MBR disk can only have 4 primary partitions,
 so it can be a bit tricky to get the multi-boot to work, if all of the partitions are used up already, but it can be done. &nbsp;Sometimes this fixes things and the main install auto-activates on the next boot, or you might have to use the generic Product Key on
 it or reinstall Windows 10.

            <p>I did use product key and got that very screen about a week ago. &nbsp;Still would not activate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My partitions are System Reserved 500MB NTFS and C: 698.15GB NTFS. &nbsp;I thought the system reserved might be the partition with the factory install information, but I'm starting to think a few things happened: the person who had this computer before me did
 something to the hard drive because gateway is not listed on this computer(should be able to get to recovery settings from the gateway menu in Windows), the Windows 10 might not have been a clean install and/or they changed the hard drive which is why I can't
 get into advanced boot settings. I have also been to gateway site and followed their instructions to get into boot settings, but one of the options on the system recovery options, recovery manager is not listed as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I just want to see if I can restore to factory settings and then see if I can re-install Windows 10. &nbsp;If you have any other suggestions, please let me know. &nbsp;Or you can tell me there is no hope.</p>
<p>

            <p>System Reserved is there from Windows 10 install. &nbsp;It has some files for doing Repair in Windows 10 and is also the System partition that the computer boots from before loading Windows. &nbsp;So there is no Gateway partition left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One problem would be if Windows 10 Pro is currently installed and your Windows 7 was Windows 7 Home. &nbsp;In Disk Management, you can shrink drive C: by 64GB to make a small space to install Windows 10 Home to. &nbsp;Don't use a Product Key and see if it auto-activates
 after install. &nbsp;If not, maybe your Windows 7 Product Key will then work to activate it (assuming that it is a Windows 7 Home key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows 10 Product Key shown is the same as mine, then that is probably the issue. &nbsp;Also it will show Windows 10 Professional if you look under Settings - System - About. &nbsp;It is not as common to have Windows 10 Pro on a consumer PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A small program that can tell which Edition of Windows a Product Key is for is pidgen.exe. &nbsp;By choosing System and then the Go! button it will read the current Product Key, or you can input your Windows 7 Product Key.</p>
