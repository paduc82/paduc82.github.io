            Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
We're glad you reached out. To be able to convert your 64GB USB stick from exFAT to NTFS format, you may have to install a third-party app on your PC. It's best that you contact the device manufacturer for further assistance. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to post your query anytime.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Mailbuzzer is obviously not an MS app.&nbsp; Your best bet is to contact the developer.

    <title>BH-503 &#43; multiple pairings does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brazilian joe  say:</h3>
<h2>            BH-503 &#43; multiple pairings does not work</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to have my BH-503 paired simultaneously with multiple devices. The connection would only be active with one device at a time, but I would like to be able to use it on any of the devices I use.</p>
<p>The scenario is this:</p>
<p>I have an iPhone, and a MacBook Pro with Windows 7 on Boot Camp. I would like to have BH-503 paired with all 3 and use on Mac while working, or on Windows when gaming on weekends. While walking to/from work, I would listen to music using the iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can pair the device at most with one system. If I pair with a second system, the first pairing will not work again. I have to delete the pairing and redo it &nbsp;to be able to use the headset. Then the second pairing stops working. Same applies to the third
 pairing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say, the pairing merry-go-round between devices is most unfunny. Is there any way around it?</p>

<p>actually it does. I have my comptuer, ps3 and my cell connected to the head set all at once. Here is what you do.. Make sure you pair each item one at a time while the other itmes that have bluetooth turned off.. Excample. My computer and ps3 are turned
 off as I pair my cell. Once cell is done I turn that off and turn on computer and pair. Once computer is done turn off computer and turn on ps3. Once you pair them you should not have to pair them again. Now the tricky part and I cant find a better way to
 do this.. When you want to use your items it is now called connect not paired. So to connect your items you have to hit connect on all your items at once.. For excample. In order for me to connect to the computer and cell I have to hit connect on the compter
 and my cell and push the button on the head set till I hear the beeps or beep and then let go. If you go past the first set of beeps then you will hear another set of beeps and those beeps are for pairing. It is kinda tricky, but once you get the hang of it
 its not so bad. I love this head set the only problem I have is there is no noise cancelling on the mic. so everybody I talk to they can hear everything going on at my house. If you have any more problems post it and I will try to help you out the best I can.
 I love the fact I can listen to music on my computer and if my cell rings I can switch over and chat without having to take off the headset...</p>

<p>thanks a lot "mpps" it worked for me...</p>
<p>I have nokia bh-503 bluetooth headset, a samsung galaxy y plus android mobile, &amp; HP pavilion g4 laptop.</p>
<p>what I did was:</p>
<p>1stly I paired bh 503 with my phone..</p>
<p>then i switched off my bh 503 bluetooth headset &amp; also switched off my android mobile bluetooth.</p>
<p>then I reset the settings of bh 503 by holding the multifunction key till the blue light blinks frequently...</p>
<p>then I turned on bluetooth of my laptop &amp; paired it with bh 503...</p>
<p>then i switched off my laptop's bluetooth so the light on bh 503 starts blinking green (DO NOT TURN OFF BH-503)...</p>
<p>now i turned on the bluetooth of my android phone and opened its bluetooth settings &amp; clicked on the gear icon corresponding to my device BH-503 (as it was already paired)</p>
<p>now there i saw 2 options namely: "connect to call audio" &amp; "connect to media audio"</p>
<p>now i clicked on "connect to media audio" and it showed connected to media audio with bh-503 but the blinking light on my bh-503 was still green...</p>
<p>now i turned off bh-503...</p>
<p>then i switched off and then on my android phones' bluetooth...</p>
<p>then i switched on bh-503 &amp; it connected to my phone for both calls &amp; media audio &amp; blue light on bh-503 starts blinking....</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>In Mac and Windows, as I can see, the most convenient way is to use the OneDrive for Business Next Generation sync client to sync both OneDrive for Business and&nbsp;OneDrive consumer files to the local computer, and then move between the synced folders. Just
 give it a shot on your side, and post back if you need helps on this. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Q: When you sync OneDrive for Business to your hard drive, Notebooks save as URLs.</p>
<p>If you upload this URL to OneDrive Personal, does this effectively copy the Notebook from OneDrive for Business to the OneDrive Personal account?</p>

<p>hi peter,</p>
<p>after testing it, i may have to correct that for notebooks. as you may noticed, the notebook file cannot be migrated simply by moving it between these folders.</p>
<p>the workaround can be like this: we can get a guest link as below so that the onedrive user can access this notebook via this link. to do this, you can just select the file and click
<strong>get a link</strong> on the top bar.</p>

    <title>Drop Down List Not always Displaying on Ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arc1950  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drop Down List Not always Displaying on Ribbon</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 and Excel 2007.<br />
<br />
I have an intermittent problem, sometimes when I click on a drop down list on the ribbon such as Font the list flashes but does not allow me to select an item. Also when this happens when I right click on a cell only the formatting part displays, the bottom
 sub-menu containing Cut, Copy, Paste etc just flashes and then disappears.<br />
<br />
Other times it works perfectly<br />
<br />
This happens with new workbooks and old spreadsheets.<br />
<br />
I have tried closing Excel and shutting down Windows but nothing seems to work.<br />
<br />
I have just bought a new computer and the same is happening on that.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled the add-in Office Tab but Excel is still the same.<br />
<br />
I have been using Excel for many years and not had this problem until recently, I am wondering as it's on both computers if it's a Windows 10 problem?
<br />
</p>
<p>I've just run Word 2007 and it also has the same problem.</p>

            <p>Do you have wireless keyboard and mouse? I had a similar problem and had to re-install the associated software but I would not expect the same problem on 2 different computers unless of course you are using the same keyboard and mouse on different computers
 and if so then it is not likely to be the install software but&nbsp;it could be a hardware problem with the keyboard and or mouse.</p>
<p>

<span>You are using a laptop with an oversensitive Touchpad: as you type, the Touchpad is picking up the vibrations from your typing and moving the insertion point to the cursor point
 randomly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can try the latest Synaptics driver which is supposed to resolve the issue (though I have not tested it) or you can download free utilities that will disable the touchpad
 while you type.</span></p>

<h2>            Can items on a Master Page show on top of regular page content&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am creating a template for other people to use to create printed presentations/flyers.</p>
<p>I would like to have my header and footer show up on top of page content (i.e. the user can not put a picture on top of the header or footer). This is required by the government agency that this project is for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?</p>

<p>Master Pages will always be in the background. Are you certain you are using Publisher and not PowerPoint?</p>
<p>If your users are regular Publisher users, you could create a header and footer, leave instructions in the scratch area that the header &amp; footer need to be brought to the front. This will have wrapping issues.</p>

 we’ve announced previously, Skype messaging, calling and video capabilities will come integrated into Windows 10 through the Messaging, Phone and Skype video universal Windows apps.&nbsp;These Windows applications enable quick and easy, free calling and messaging
 to other Skype users across phones, over 3G/4G and Wi-Fi tablets and to PCs Wi-Fi. With this build, you can preview the integrated capabilities on your PC while an upcoming Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview build will have these integrated capabilities for
 you to preview soon on mobile devices. Try things like Quick Reply from Action Center where incoming notifications will come in with the option to reply inline without opening the application. This is an early preview and you can expect some bugs, and more
 features to come as we deliver monthly updates.</em></span></p>

            Now that Messaging, Phone and Skype Video apps are installed on my PC as a part of the Windows 10 November update, is there any need to keep the Skype desktop app which I downloaded and installed from skype.com or can we uninstall it? The reason for asking
 this question is that whenever I get a call or a message, I see two notifications on my screen - one from the desktop app and one from the new windows 10 apps that came with the November update. Will the new apps offer all the same experience as the desktop
 app?

            well I get notifications if the messaging app is running on one of my desktops (on a different windows or minimized) &nbsp;but I don't have anything come up when the app is closed down. and according to the settings in the app for messaging it says it will
 use SMS/MMS to send messages. don't know what phones or anything will be allowed to be used for this. would like to know more info.

            Hello. As this is just a community area, Microsoft will not see anything posted here more than likely. 
<br />
<br />The best way to contact Microsoft about payment issues is through their support where you will talk with actual Microsoft employees.

In the top search box, enter <b>Outlook</b>. <br />

Could you also create a new User and see if Outlook opens in the new User.<br />
<br />
CREATE A NEW USER<br />
<br />
Go to System Preferences&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; Create a New User in Accounts (Users &amp; Groups). Switch to the New User by logging out under the Apple in the Menu bar or use Fast User Switching.

Outlook will not be in the Dock. Go to Applications and select Outlook in Microsoft Office 2011 to open.<br />
<br />
Do you still see the issue?<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If yes, then the problem is with your base files.<br />

            I had the same issue with Outlook yesterday. &nbsp;You click on the big "O", it jumps around and stops. &nbsp;Outlook was not opening.
<div><br />
<div>I deleted out the entire Microsoft Office, restated the machine and loaded everything back again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Went through all of the steps and tried to load the file that contains all of the messages and such.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It still didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then tried this. &nbsp;Held down the Option button and clicked on the big "O" for outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It went into a testing routine where it scanned the outlook file, created a new database, verified the database and it opened up Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything is back to normal and is working great.</div>

            Hello Jugie,
<br />
<br />Yes it is available, i have tested in Android devices, it should be enable for iOS devices too.
<br />
<br />As soon you are creating a event you can enable the Skype button.

<h2>            Nokia SU-1B Pen Code</h2>
                    I run an IT dept for a large Plc company,we currently use the Nokia SU-1B with our smart forms, unfornately we are missing a couple of bluetooth codes for our pens, we no longer have the card with the code on and due to wear and tear the code on back of
 the pen has rubbed off, is there a way of recovering the code by using the pen id? some one who designed the pen and assigned the id's would of also assigned the code which should be on a database, any idea's?

            I already looked at this the codes are not 0000, maybe the person who posted this should of tried it first, its no help to anyone, blue tooth headsets are 0000 or 1234 but not the pens, they have a unique number ie 8160, so my origional message still stands,
 can the code be found by the id? and where can i find out?

            Ok so the purpose of that was? the same link to the same info, no help, if you were refering to the sticker on the back of the pen, you didnt read my first post that said due to wear and tear the sticker as you call it has come off, so back to my first
 post can the code be recovered from the pen id? the pen id has nothing what so ever to do with the sticker! the stickers go ie 1H090078205 where as the pen id goes AJ3-AAC-AU4-F5A, these are completely different one is an internal id and the other means something
 to somebody on a sticker, on the above pen the code would be 8205 i know that, but whats the code for AJE-AAC-AU4-F5A, at least you reply which is an excellent starting point, just wish you had the answer then id be thankful.

            ok, missed that bit :)<br />
<br />
I doubt anyone here will be able to tell you how to translate codes from the pen into the pairing code, so it may be better for you to give us a ring. You can get the number or use the email form on the
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,76920,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page.<br />
<br />
Also, in future - dont be so aggressive. This is a user to user support forum and it relies on its members in order to help out Nokia owners. If you make aggressive/negative posts you are going to find that people just wont answer you..<br />
<br />
You might want to have a quick read of the <a href="http://discussions.nokia.co.uk/discussions/board/message?board.id=guidelines&amp;message.id=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks for the info Karim, I will use the contact us to further my search,<br />
"Also, in future - dont be so aggressive. This is a user to user support forum and it relies on its members in order to help out Nokia owners. If you make aggressive/negative posts you are going to find that people just wont answer you.."<br />
taken under advisement, however its not aggression its frustration and in your words "ok, missed that bit" only hinders matters when i get the same answer twice because you didnt read it properly, but its all taken as light humour,<br />
either way the good thing is this notice board works,and its a credit to yourselves for replying forthwith and i now have a point of contact, so thanks for your help, my search coninues,<br />
This also makes good reading!!<br />

            They are if your going to use it regulary, we use digital paper provided by a company called Sysnet - based in Scotland,they design ie, purchase orders invoices notpads as per the clients requirements, they also produce software for your mobile, we currently
 use a worksheet or time sheet and ticks the send box we receive the paperwork on e-mail within 20 seconds, showing this to our clients has increased our company turnover as we are able to bill the client the same day rather than waiting a week for the paperwork,
 the pens are now available from £90 also from Sysnet, there web site is www.sysnet.co. they are a great selling point to us.

<p>Hi, thanks for responding. I have installed it on my new PC, as I have Outlook 16, Word and Excel etc appearing and working fine. Do you think I should uninstall and try again?</p>

            <p>OneDrive is included in Win</p>
<p>In Explorer does Favorites now show two OneDrive entries? if so rt click, rename one as appropriate .eg. 'OneDrive 365'
</p>
<p>Then simply drag files from one to the other, and if you intend to use OneDrive as your default save location in any Office Component, ensure you are using the 'correct' OneDrive - you don't have to use OneDrive as the save location, in any doc, 'Save As'
 enables you to select the location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have misunderstood you in "I want the OneDrive files from that account on my computer" then in Explorer select the OneDrive that contains docs then copy/move docs to the local PC - Documents, etc.</p>

            The problem is that only One is showing in Explorer and it's not my old one with all the files I need (from Office 365)<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>It's the new one that came with the computer. Now I can only access my old OneDrive files online at OneDriveLive.&nbsp;

    <title>Internet explorer starts at windows startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william kochevar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet explorer starts at windows startup</h2>
                    I have Internet Explorer 11 running on windows 8.1. When I start windows, the metro version of Internet Explorer&nbsp; starts up. I looked at the startup items in task manager and there is no startup item for Internet Explorer. I scanned the registry with regedit
 and did find any entries related to the startup of Internet Explorer. I then went to the start directory in windows 8.1 and again found nothing related to the startup of Internet Explorer. I am running Norton Internet Security which has found no viruses or
 malware recently. Can someone recommend something that might fix this issue. I do not want Internet Explorer to keep starting at windows startup.

            <p><span>Hi William,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that Internet Explorer&nbsp;gets launch when you start your system. This issue could be caused if the registry files are corrupt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get a clear understanding of the issue, I want to know:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any changes on your PC prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 63, 80, 1)">When modern Internet Explorer gets launch automatically, does it displays any website? If yes which website is displayed?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you have already tried some troubleshooting steps from your end, and the issue is still not resolved .I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Delete scheduled Task.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Press
<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ DELETE</strong> Key Together.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Open
<strong>Taskbar</strong>, then click on <strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Performance and Maintenance.</span></strong></span></p>

</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Task Scheduler
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">to see if they are set to launch on startup there.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5) If you are able to see any task created to launch Internet Explorer on startup,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After trying the steps of method 1 if the issue still persists try method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform clean boot.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 63, 80, 1)">Check the issue in clean boot, there are&nbsp;possibilities that any third party application is triggering Internet Explorer to
 open after you restart the system.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Error installing IE 10 final - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edee2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error installing IE 10 final</h2>
                    <p>I first tried to install IE 10 for Windows 7 preview version when it first was released making sure all
<u>required updates</u> and <u>prerequisites</u> were installed and after installation I got the following error:</p>
<p>"ie4uinit.exe The application was unable to start correctly"</p>
<p>Now after trying to install the final version I am still receiving the very same error message, I even made sure the latest update released today (2.26.13) released from Microsoft was installed and a reboot was performed. I downloaded the final version of
 IE 10 and performed the install&nbsp;after which I am asked to reboot the machine, upon reboot I get
<strong>"ie4uinit.exe The application was unable to start correctly"</strong> which then renders Internet Explorer unusable at that point, I must then uninstall IE 10 in order to roll back to IE 9 to be able to use my browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All web searches and a search of the Microsoft knowledge base produces nothing, can anyone help me with this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home&nbsp;Premium x64</p>
<p>6 gigs ram</p>
<p>582&nbsp;GB unused space on drive C</p>

<p>When ie10 is ready for mass release microsoft would most likely issue it first through the windows update system.</p>

            <p>The only other updates I saw in the update system was windows 8 sdk update (yea i'll pass) is that the one you were referring to as you downloaded first ?</p>
<p>Did you uninstall the preview version first ?</p>
<p>I don't know why people jump the gun downloading untested new software even from microsoft,</p>
<p>Wait a few months after the release so others can work the bugs out :)</p>
<p>I did use ie9 until after nearly a year after it was released :)</p>
<p>ie8 was just fine as a bottle of wine.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The four&nbsp;most likely possibilities are :<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> 3rd party antivirus, antispyware, security programs. You may need to uninstall them<br />
and run their maker's removal tools to prevent trouble causing remnants.<br />
<br />
List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools<br />

<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Add-ins to your present IE&nbsp;- uninstall them.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>StartUp Programs running causing a conflict. Try an essentially Clean Boot and then try<br />
installing IE 10.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Some sort of Malware/Spyware - check thoroughly.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

Yes I have tried all&nbsp;four steps suggested by spirit X and none of them worked, I have still not been able to install IE 10 and have pretty much given up, at least until I do a fresh re installation of Windows 7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation of Windows 7 I am working with now is not more than a month old, I have no add ons on my current version of IE 9, I totally uninstalled my antivirus software then tried to install IE 10, I also performed a clean boot then tried the installation,&nbsp;I
 scanned my computer with three notable antivirus and three notable malware softwares and all is clean. I even tried uninstalling IE 9 through Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Programs and Features&gt;Turn Windows Features on or Off and that did not work either. Each and
 every single time I get "<strong>"ie4uinit.exe The application was unable to start correctly"</strong> after reboot after IE 10 installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I reverted my system back not very long ago to Windows 7 from Windows 8 so I was not very concerend about the malware/virus apsect but I perfomed it anyway, which by the way when I had Windows 8 installed on this very same pc Internet Explorer 10 worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do however have a custom theme installed, could this be part of the problem?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you have Service Pack 1 installed? If not install it then try.<br />

Did you check the add-ons installed in IE9?<br />

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes SP 1 is indeed installed&nbsp; and as I said in my previous post about, there are no third party add ons installed in IE 9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am reading in another forum I am a member of that this might have something to do with custom themes, I like to mod my system and in order to do that you have to modify some .dll files and it seems that others in my custom theme forums are having the same
 problems. If they run sfc \scannow and unmodify the .dll files IE 10 installs and works properly, the minute the mod the .dll files back IE 10 does not work and they are coming up with the very same error I agve above, so it only makes sense that is the problem.</p>
<p>If that is the problem and IE10 will not install because of some modified .dll files then Microsoft can keep IE 10. I'll wait untill the mod geeks&nbsp;figure out a workaround for it because I know Microsoft won't, untill then I am not going to change my whole
 system setup just to accomodate IE 10 ........ I don't need to have it that bad.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well I am not sure if a theme would block the IE 10 install though anything is possible.<br />
<br />
Download this and see if it shows anything. It is a very simple tool that runs stand-alone<br />
so it does not need to be installed.<br />

I downloaded the above BHO Remover by Xplode and ran it and just I thought and said in my previous posts, the response from BHO Remover was "No Browser Helper Plugins found on this system"

<h2>            Maps 3.03 can&#39;t search addresses and doesn&#39;t ask to go on-line</h2>
                    
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>That's really ridiculous. Your new version <strong>ovi maps 3.03 couldn't make good search&nbsp;by Address</strong>. You create search only by Places. But if you want to find at least street name - it failed. Again, before you run the new version around the world
 - could you ask any volunteers to check it? I found it on the first minute after installation.</p>
<p>Also <strong>Why you've removed 'Ask to go on-line'?</strong> That was&nbsp;wrong idea.</p>
<p>Also <strong>Weather info is not shown if you are in map</strong>, choose Show details and there were Weather info there - not it is missed (WiFi connection)</p>
<p>Now I remove that stupid version. I have 6710 Navigator and without Address search it looks really bad. Also I want to&nbsp;notice here that in old maps 3.01 it is possible to have Maps in English, but&nbsp;make search in&nbsp;local language (f.e, Russian)</p>
<p>I don't like Maps 3.03&nbsp;with functionality and interface it provides&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is already several threads that discuss about the 'correct' or 'working' syntax of search query. You can have a look f.e this one :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/F93575E1-828D-40CA-A074-18B90C519931">/t5/Maps-Navigation-and-GPS/Can-OVI-maps-works-off-line/td-p/616948</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you want that your problem checked by another user, you can post your problem details here. (f.e your search). And perhaps you could tell whether you were doing an ONLINE search or an OFFLINE search. Because you will need to download the Map of your
 country first to do the OFFLINE search (you can do it with Map Loader)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully help.</p>

<p>Hello comodo09,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>did you notice that even downloading maps does not solve the search problem in offline mode? This is what this discussion is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course I downloaded the map first. Then I still could not search when offline. But after searching in online mode once, I then could search even if offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This behaviour is strange.</p>

<p>Hi bbbs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i don't experience your problem. It is true that if we did an online search, we can then find the same place offline. Because there will be cache file that was downloaded from the server online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if i have downloaded the map via Map Loader. I can always search the place i downloaded in offline mode. Important to notice, usually OVI Maps doesn't find the place in another country, if we don't include the country name in the search query. Or perhaps
 you could try first searching for the city and the country. And then after your Maps showing that city, you can try to search again the more specific address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still face a problem, would you please let me know what is your search query and downloaded Map? i can then try it on my device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>After I searched online a single address, I could find <strong>other</strong> addresses of this country too when offline.</p>

<p>I did not use the map loader because it repeatedly failed. The latest error was a runtime exception (it's programmed in .net), something about a missing class I think. This happended after I tried to reinstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before that it did not work, telling me there wasn't enough space on my memory card (4GB free at this time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I downloaded the European maps as a zip file and installed this.</p>

<p>Hi warwick27au,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from where did you get your Australia map, is it via Map Loader or already bundled with the phone? can you post your search query here, i'd like to download the map of australia and try to search for it. Because i have ever downloaded Australia Map and offline
 search also worked, although not always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

    <title>How do I shut off the lumia 521&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samtcat01  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I shut off the lumia 521&#63;</h2>
                    I can restart my phone, but I can't turn it off completely unless I remove the battery.<br />
<br />
I've tried holding the on/off button. After I power the phone down, it immediately restarts. Tried the combos of Windows key + on/off button and Volume Down + on/off key. Same thing happens. It shuts down momentarily and then restarts the phone.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? <br />

            <p>Do you have it plugged into a charger when you try to shut it down? Holding down the power button, then sliding down the screen as prompted should turn the phone completely off. A WP will not stay off if it is plugged in however. It will start back up shortly.
 A phone that is off, once you connect a charger to it will boot back up. That is normal.&nbsp; the Volume Down + on/off key thing is a reset, and you would expect it to start back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have a charger connected, are using the hold down power, then slide the screen down when prompted method, and it is starting back back up, again, with no charger connected, post back.

<h2>            Unable to save Word 2016 documents</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Word 2016 (Office 365) is not allowing me to save documents. I tried to save with a different name and in a different location. I even tried to use a recovered file but nothing.</p>
<p>I cannot close the document since I'll lose everything I've been working on.</p>
<p>There were no active Com Add-ins (I checked the forum before) and I don't get any error messages. The "save as..." window just keep appearing any time I click on "save" or "save as...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried another thing. That is, creating a new file and copy and paste the other file. At first when I copied the first two pages and saved for the first time it worked but then when I tried to continue copying and save again it happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Sandra&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. excel and power point are working properly.</p>

            <p>Hi Sandra,<br />
<br />
Since you cannot close Word, let’s try the steps to save your content in Word first:<br />
1.Login in to <a href="https://www.office.com/1/?auth=2&amp;home=1&amp;from=ShellLogo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Portal</a> and click Word Online.<br />
2.Copy and paste your content in Word to Word Online (<strong>Note</strong>: Some functions in Word may be not supported in Word Online:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Differences-between-using-a-document-in-the-browser-and-in-Word-3e863ce3-e82c-4211-8f97-5b33c36c55f8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#__toc309629520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Differences between using a document in the browser and in Word</a>).<br />
3.You can find this document in your OneDrive for Business library.<br />
<br />
After that, please do the following for further investigation:<br />
1.Save the document using a different extension to determine whether this issue is related to the specific extension type.<br />
2.Run Word in safe mode: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Open Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</a>.<br />
3.Create a new document in Word to check whether this issue is related to the specific content in the problematic document.<br />
4.Provide a screenshot as below of your Word version by going to File&gt; Account.<br />

            <p>Hi Fraser,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had to close the document and start all over again. I hope I won't have any more problems with the new document I'm creating (if I'll have any when introducing content, images or tables I'll let you know here - point 3). In order not to lose all
 the information, I saved it as pdf before closing and I had no problems so I think that could answer action 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the Word version, it should be: 16.0.6741.2071&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I cannot run Word in safe mode but I'll try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sandra</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to upgrade? </p>
<p>2. Do you have any third party antivirus program installed? </p>
<p><br />
Make sure your graphics driver is a WDDM version driver. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p>There could be some third party program conflicts or driver issues while installing the operating system. I would suggest you to follow these steps provided here and check the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check for the issue.</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: Once you are done with clean boot, please follow the section ‘How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot’ under ‘more information’ in the article to put your computer back to normal startup.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Make sure that the hardware devices are all updated to the latest, if not, you may login to computer Manufacturer website and update them.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also disable antivirus program to see if that helps. If you have multiple antivirus programs, you may uninstall them.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Warning:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

Winston,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for taking the time to respond. Yes, I am upgrading and I did shut off all services and disabled defender. &nbsp;I have no other anti-virus running on my system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My drivers are all up to date and went to a generic video driver. There is no error code to try to narrow it down with. It installs fine in VM Box. So the dvd and the iso are fine. &nbsp;Is there any other ideas?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on your after installing Internet Explorer 9?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to go through the steps below and check.</p>
<p>

<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>

</span></span></span>Select <b>Internet Options</b> from the
<b>drop down menu</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>General Tab</b>, search for
<b>Appearance</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the <b>button Colors.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Use <b>Windows Colors</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Background color palette</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select a <b>new color</b> and then press
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>The changes you have made will only be seen if you have your browser set to open new tabs with blank screens. If it loads a homepage, this background color
 will not work because the website has a prefixed background color or image. 
<span>As an alternative, you may place a check mark on "<b>Use Windows colors</b>". This should make it default.</span></p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing<br />
<br />
1. What is the exact and complete error you get when you try to connect?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the Bluetooth device/Computer?<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to Bluetooth device driver compatibility. I would suggest you to uninstall the Bluetooth driver and re-install and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />

<br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span><br />
