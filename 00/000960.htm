<h2>            Form Javascript Not Working After OneDrive for Business Update</h2>
                    <p>After the recent OneDrive update, JavaScript meant to collect timestamps in our forms has ceased to work. Originally, the JavaScript was attached to checkboxes when pressed would automatically populate the date and time into a corresponding text box. This
 no longer seems to work after the new update. I was wondering if anyone else was having similar issues or if there is a way to enable this JavaScript to work again. These forms were made with Nuance PDF Advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h3> mralshahawy  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Nokia E7 automatically restart</h2>
                    
<p>I've been syncronizing my contacts with OVI Suite while power got down, Since then the e7 keeps&nbsp; restarting, It opens for about 10 seconds and then restart automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried everything:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the 10 seconds available I choosed "Factory reset", and "Factory Reset with data" and no use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried pressing the menu key + camera key + volume down + power key for 8 sconds till the mobile vibrate 3 times, but also in vain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pressed the power button for about 8 seconds till it shutdown, I pluged it in the power charger and battery is full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advise would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care about reset or hard reset, all I care about is to get device working without going to maintainance, because the mobile from another country.</p>

    <title>CK-300 and E71, no sound for navigation and music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masab---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            CK-300 and E71, no sound for navigation and music</h2>
                    This combination works fine for calling, but there is no sound at all for navigation and music (not from the phone either).<br />
I can use navigation, but without any voice. I can also open the music menu in Carmenu-software and start playin music, but I hear also silence.<br />
<br />
This web-page says that this should work with E71 (I suppose this should be valid then also for navigation voice?):<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A41043248" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A41043248</a><br />
<br />
-I have updated (or the Nokia service partner) the bluetooth unit in car.<br />
-I have the newest version of th Car Menu:<br />
You need the latest version of Car Menu ( <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4904233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://europe.nokia.com/A4904233</a> ) and the latest firmware for the Bluetooth unit (
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4884052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4884052</a> )<br />
-Nokia Car Kit CK-300 SW v.1.400 is now available!<br />
(By the way Nokia Web-site tells that the SW is V 2.4. If you look at the "log-file" in the phone it says V2.04.).<br />
-The software version of the phone is the newest one.<br />
<br />
I have VW Passat with basic radio/CD (model 300). Any idea why this won´t work? If the normal calling is working should music and navigation be possible to hear without any extra cabling?<br />
Do I need to use another AUX-connection to radio? If yes, this is possible, but will cost approx. EUR 300 by ordering the right adapter from VW.<br />
<br />
We also tried to connect the headphone cable from phone to Bluetooth unit. It didn´t make any change for the situation.<br />
<br />
The service partner of Nokia in Finland/Espoo doesn´t have any clue for this. I brought myself the newest software with me, they did this fo the first time. Luckily they did have the righ cable to do the update..

            Hi<br />
I am based in UK. I am using v 2.4 (2.04) on my handset (6210 Navigator). V 1.4 on the car unit. I get the same as masab regarding no audio output from the CK-300 car menu. I did have the AUX connection fitted, and the sat nav does now route to the radio. (an
 Audi Symphony), however there is background noise which I suspect is a wrongly matched impedance perhaps. Another problem is that the sat nav does not cut in quickly enough, which results in the start of the sat nav voice message being lost.<br />
It is possible to use the Blue tooth streaming into the radio but only if one uses the music player from the phone gallery; using the CK300 menu does not provide any sound output. Again the sound quality is poor.<br />
I suspect a firmware problem between v2.04 and v1.4.<br />
Any ideas please Nokia???? This has now lasted several months with delays getting a cable to update the CK300, and then the cost of extra cables from the Aux of the radio, and still not a satisfactory solution.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am just trying to solve the same problem with combination of E66 and CK-300. Calling is fine but I also do not have any sound for navigation and music.<br />
<br />
I do not have AUX cable connected as my Blaupunkt CD30 radio in Astra does not have an auxiliary input. I have only PH+ and PH- wires connected to the radio.<br />
<br />
I do not want to use my radio to play music from phone but I would like to use navigation and without sounds it is useless. The phone or CK-300 apparantly knows what to "pipe" into PH mono output and what to AUX stereo output so it can differ between phone
 calls and other sources.<br />
<br />
It means - is there any possibility to set it up that only phone calls will be forwarded to the handsfree unit?<br />
<br />
I would prefer to hear the navigation from a phone speaker.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for any idea.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />
Petr

            Make sure the ck-300 has the latest software. I had the same issue but the latest software solves the problem. Now the navigation instructions come through the same as a phone call with a radio mute.

            The navigation works for me BUT there is not a long enough delay between the navigator calling for mute, and the voice starting; this results in the start of the message being lost. Also there is No output from when using the car menu music player. The
 music player works, but the sound does not. What is strange though is that the standard music player does work, but the quality seems a little poor. So still some work to do Nokia please?

<p>I didn´t realise that there is a configuration setting in the Car Menu application in which you can choose that also other media will be sent out to car radio. After selecting this I can hear the Navigation commands in the car radio, although the first sentence
 will be cut off like described from other unhappy Nokia users as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there seem to be no need for an additional AUX-connection in the car radio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playing of music from E71 remains the same - only quitness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder, if I should make a reclamation about the above. Other way around I´m so frustrated and disappointed for this "quality" that I just probably forgot the dream of having only one device and buy a separate&nbsp;navigation system which can also play music
 (like TomTom) from a flash-disk. A proper navigation system can also act as&nbsp;replacement for CK-300 (hands free). I buy this stuff for the company I&nbsp;work for, the "recommendation" will for sure not be CK-300 and a Nokia phone.</p>

<p>The setting is only for the mute of the radio on either 'only calls' or 'all audio events'. This 'all audio events' enables navigation instructions to be treated the same as a phone call, in other words a mute of the car radio so the instructions can be
 heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You <strong>will</strong> need an aux in connection for the stereo music output of the ck-300 in order to hear your music from the phone (or wired MP3 player)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have this kit and it is great for calls, navigation instructions and music.</p>

<p>BINGO!&nbsp; At least I hope so. The new Car menu software (30 Jan 2009) lets the MP3 player in the Nokia 6210 Navigator connect using BT streaming, and uses the second CD player (CDC) in the Audi Symphony unit. The gain on the interface needs to be tuned, or
 in other words use the volume control on the telehone to get the right level so that the car radio volume control amplifies a good quality signal. Inbound calls interupt OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will test out the Satnav tomorrow. Thanks Nokia.&nbsp; It would be nice/helpful/useful/considerate if you could let us pioneers know what you are planning to fix and when though. Keeping an eye out to see if the firmware is upgraded is somewhat non customer
 focused. Maybe an alert on software updates??</p>

            BINGO. ver 2.06 of Car Menu - released on 30 Jan, seems to fix the MP3 player problem. So using the second CD interface on the Audi Symphony player, I get Blue tooth streamed. Just need to get the gain level right between the Nokia and the Car player,
 just adjust the vol level on the Nokia so that no distortion is picked up. I will now check the sat nav .

<p><span>Hello BradKenyon, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is no need to purchase another Skype Number if the calls will be coming from Costa Rica as well (while in Mexico).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once your Skype Number has been activated, you can provide it to all your contacts. They will be able to call you from mobiles and landlines and you can pick the call up on Skype, wherever you are.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information on Skype Numbers, kindly refer to this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks Melowin: I tried both methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Windows is updated. The updates I received today did not include any related to the Microsoft devices.</p>
<p>Method 2: My Bluetooth devices do not show up in the Device Manager possibly because they were never added/ connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is my basic issue. The Mice will not connect while adding them at Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They were working before I installed Build 16179.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the devices are not even being detected when I push the Bluetooth discovery button(s). (View Screenshot below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I have two of these keyboards and use them with different tablet devices. On two devices running this preview build I experience this issue. Connected to a device running plain 1703 both keyboards work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting obviously redundant instances from Device Manager does not help: Those zombies reappear automagically shortly thereafter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to clean up registry entries related to those instances fails with permission errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: A Logitech Ultrathin Bluetooth Touch Mouse, while working most of the time, occasionally stops working completely, or partly (scrolling is lost) with this build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something is very wrong with BT in this build.</p>

    <title>New profile picture doesn&#39;t appear. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommathewson  say:</h3>
<h2>            New profile picture doesn&#39;t appear.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I just installed Windows 10. I had Windows 8.1 and replaced my Outlook profile picture a couple of times with no problem. I recently changed my profile picture and clicked save. The new picture appeared. Unfortunately, when I reopen Hotmail, my old picture
 still appears. I have repeated the process several times but the old picture continues to show up. Any suggestions?

                    <p>I have been stuck at 10130 due to the build not updating and had hoped that the final release would allow me to final get past this.&nbsp; I tried several options of installing the official release -- using the Media Creation Tool to create USB / DVD and also
 trying the direct install from the web.&nbsp; None of the options are working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to install directly from the media creation tool program it gets to 91% and gets stuck.&nbsp; I left the computer for hours at this point and no progress.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing via the ISO burned to a disk but the installation asks for the Windows key and by Dell Inspiron 14z did not come with a key sticker.&nbsp; I have a Dell system recover disk but the computer will not boot to it or run any setup for it from
 Windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi leung.benjamin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. Since your appointments are missing in your Calendar, are these set to To-do list? If yes,&nbsp;did&nbsp;you change your To-do list settings to be deleted&nbsp;right-away? If&nbsp;a to-do list was set to&nbsp;Done and&nbsp;it's setting is set to
 right-away, once a to-do list was tag as done it will be automatically deleted on the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the appointments are set to events in your calendar,&nbsp;kindly provide us the step-by-step procedures you have taken when you cleaned&nbsp;up you&nbsp;calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward for your response for us to&nbsp;continue our support to this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

            The appointments are set to the calendar.
<div><br />
<div>I moved all my personal appointments to Outlook.com. I then check to make sure there were not appointments left in Hotmail.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;there were none, I created a new calendar and set the new calendar as default (I was planning on closing my Hotmail account).</div>
<div>I then deleted the old calendar.</div>
<div>That was when my appointments in Outlook.com&nbsp;disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My Hotmail account was NOT migrated to Oulook.com so I do no know how or why the calendars were connected.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly provide us the exact steps on how you moved your personal appointments to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, it is possible that the devices connected to your account would be a factor to why the issue is happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you you want to retrieve those appointments in any way, there is no way for us to do it.</p>

<h2>            Excel Templates on iPad - open as the template file and not a new file</h2>
                    <p>Excel on iPad</p>
<p>Version 2.02 (170415)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening an Excel Template file xltx - the template file opens. &nbsp;Then if Auto-Save is on - any changes done to it will save onto the template file. &nbsp;This is not suppose to happen. &nbsp;Even if Auto-Save is off - and the user taps on Save - it will update
 the template file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of a template file is that when a user opens it it creates a new file and the template is not overwritten.</p>

<p>Will this be fixed soon?</p>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested both on iPad/iPhone <strong><em>10.3.1</em></strong>, the latest Excel
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/microsoft-excel/id586683407?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
version</a>: <strong><em>2.0.2(170415)</em></strong> currently and I get the same result. The following screenshot shows the Read Only message when I open it from local.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7b4d5c4-4096-4b34-96f8-16fc5b0af70a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7b4d5c4-4096-4b34-96f8-16fc5b0af70a" height="307" width="624" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Given this situation, please try the following steps to reset your iOS devices to check whether it helps:</p>
<p>1) Go to your <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OneDrive </a>Online and clear <strong><em>Recycle bin</em></strong>;</p>
<p>2) Return to your iPad and close Excel;</p>
<p>3) Click Settings and scroll down to find <strong><em>Excel</em></strong>;</p>
<p>4) Click Reset Excel and turn on both <strong><em>Clear All Workbooks</em></strong> and
<strong><em>Delete Sign-in Credentials</em></strong>.</p>
<p>5) Start Excel again and sign in with your email address.</p>
<p>6) Open the template file (<em>xltx</em>) to see if there are any changes.</p>

<p>Leave the battery out for a while (at least 10 minutes?) to see if that helps.&nbsp; If not, try factory-resetting the phone.&nbsp; (<em>Yes</em>, this will delete any data you haven't previously backed-up.)&nbsp; Hold down the caps lock, space, and backspace keys while
 again powering-on the phone.&nbsp; Keep the keys held down until you notice something happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If those don't fix the problem, then you likely have a dud phone.&nbsp; (It happens. :( )&nbsp; Get it replaced right away.</p>

<p>If your television won't power on, you get it repaired or you buy a new one.&nbsp; Same thing for lots of electronic and electric devices.&nbsp; Electronic devices that are going to fail tend to do so within the first couple weeks.&nbsp; Just like a new, faulty television,
 think bad semiconductors or bad soldering instead of firmware.&nbsp; Your E72 has at least a 90 day warranty.&nbsp; Trade it in for one that works.</p>

That message suggests that Publisher has already closed the data source automatically, so it is not available to be closed. Try commenting that line out and testing again. If it runs correctly, that line is unnecessary and can be deleted.

            <p>hi john</p>
<p>
</p><p>appreciate your feedback on this, the merge is still running as the option is availble to cancel merge in the toolbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the merge is running also because it affects the activedocument.printoutex from:=1 to:=2
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I can fudge it by opening another instance and copying and pasting etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question still stands though,,,,,,,,,,,how do you CLOSE a mailmerge in Publisher using VBA?????&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Word - Show Full Comments</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit frustrated with the new comment format in Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to disable the drop-down comment. I am a research and my prof often writes paragraph long comments on my journal papers. However, the second I select the page to start writing I can't see his comments anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/455ead2f-0cf5-486c-b07d-91b454baea21" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you see above, these comments are useless. In Word 2007, they showed you the entire bubble. Similar to what I see what I select a bubble, see picture below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ab44c343-481a-4a1e-ba01-67729fd5156b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you see here, I want all comments to look like this all the time so I can read the comments as I am typing in things into my journal articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to change the width of the comments but some of the comments are massive and still have the drop-down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any suggestions. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Do the following: On the Review tab, click the Display for Review drop down, which is set to "Simple Markup" by default, and select "All Markup." That improves the situation a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, in Word 2013, comments won't display the way they print, which you can tell by looking at the Print Preview (File tab | Print). On the other hand, the preview/printout looks the same as Word 2010.</p>

            <p>Ya, I pretty much figured out that there is nothing you can do besides using the revisions panel, but even that gets screwed up on a regular basis when I am trying to edit. I am just rolling back to Office 2007 for Microsoft Word since I haven't been impressed
 with most of the changes. I can't believe they remove the functionality of seeing the entire comments, got to wonder what the people at Microsoft are thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, Excel 2013 has been an awesome improvement for the most part.</p>

            <p>I'm really not sure how I can elaborate further. I provided pictures and descriptions, but that pretty much sums up my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me what part you don't understand and maybe I can clear up your question?</p>

            Your screenshots show comment balloons. About the Revisions pane you simply wrote, "even that gets screwed up on a regular basis when I am trying to edit." You didn't explain how.

            <p>Thw revisions panel I solved. If you click away from the comment, the panel shows the entire document I'm the panel window. If you hit refresh, it goes back to just showing the comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primary concern is still the comments bubble, which there is no solution :(</p>

</p><p>You're right: for comment balloons, there isn't much you can do in Word 2013. Adjusting the "Preferred width" for the balloons may help a bit, but not if there are many comments on each page of the document.</p>

            <p>Actually, adjusting "Preferred width" for the balloons can help quite a lot, if you are not afraid to make them quite wide. &nbsp;Also, if you don't mind keeping the document in Landscape layout during the review phase, it will help even more. &nbsp;Exactly how much
 to adjust it may require a little trial and error for each document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how you do it: &nbsp;In the Review tab, click the little dialog launcher button in the lower-right corner of the "tracking" group in the ribbon. &nbsp;Select "Advanced options". &nbsp;Near the bottom of that dialog, you can adjust "preferred width".</p>

            My instructions are for Word 2013. &nbsp;The "Advanced Options" dialog is a little different for previous versions, but you can still accomplish the same thing.

<p>Thanks for the reply. I tried that and it works, but I really need like a 40 inch monitor to make it work where I can still read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is ideal is the ability to leave a comment open, similar to pinning it, so that I can type somewhere else while reading the comment.</p>
