                    Is this because I changed my MS password or is it evidence of a malicious attack?&nbsp; I do not use my Microsoft account email that often - do not understand outlook.&nbsp; &nbsp;However, is there an answer, a direct answer I can find there?

<h2>            Wireless Headphones not working in 10 on Surface Book</h2>
                    My new Bose wireless headphones won't work.&nbsp; They are paired with my Surface Book.&nbsp;They show as connected/paired in Settings but do not show as an option in Sounds.&nbsp; They won't work when jacked in, either...they don't show up as an option under sounds,
 either.&nbsp; I'm running 10 on a new Surface Book.&nbsp; UPDATE:&nbsp; These are Bose QC 35.&nbsp; I actually exchanged them for a new set, and went through the same procedure: problem solved.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;a Bose issue, not a&nbsp; MS issue.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Perry Clark,</span></p>
<p><span>DRM stands for digital rights management. DRM is a technology used by content providers, such as online stores, to control how the digital music and video files you
 obtain from them are used and distributed. Some online stores sell and rent songs and movies that have DRM applied to them. A file that has DRM applied to it is known as a protected file.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Player, as well as some online stores and devices, support or use a type of DRM known as Windows Media Digital Rights Management.
</span></p>
<p><span>In most cases, you don't need to worry about downloading media usage rights. The Player usually downloads them automatically, when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>However, there might be times when the Player can't download media usage rights for you. In these cases, the Player typically displays a message that lists your options.
 Just follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>If the Player directs you to an online store, you might be required to enter your account name and password to proceed. The online store might require you to update
 your billing information or pay a fee to download additional usage rights, such as the right to burn a song to an audio CD.</span></p>
<p><span>The Player can't download media usage rights automatically if the Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file check box isn't selected (by default,
 it's selected). To verify that you can download usage rights automatically, do the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the Start button , click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the Player Library, click Organize, click Options, and then click the Privacy tab.
</span></li><li><span>Verify that the Download usage rights automatically when I play or sync a file check box is selected.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Refer the following link for additional information:</span></p>

Hi,</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
My&nbsp;Windows 10 taskbar freezes every 10-20 minutes ie the clock freezes and I can't launch any programs. Windows explorer then restarts and everything is ok for another 10-20 minutes until it freezes again.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Microsoft recommended performing a clean boot so I did that but it didn't fix the problem. Under the clean boot, the task bar still freezes but restarts itself quite soon after freezing so it's a bit better but the problem is still there.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Any help would be much appreciated as this is pretty annoying.</p>

            Hi Dan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Screen Stuck at 100&#37; Brightness - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elihunter17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Stuck at 100&#37; Brightness</h2>
                    I recently bought a Lenovo ideapad 330 that came with Windows 10. Everything worked fine for the first two weeks until my screen is stuck at 100% brightness.&nbsp; I've looked around for a fix, and the one solution that everyone says should work (refreshing/updating
 my driver) hasn't helped.&nbsp; So either I'm doing it wrong or the problem is elsewhere. It's killing my eyes and battery, so I would love for some help here

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Family gold and paypal</h2>
                    
<p>Is it not possible to upgrade my membership from a single gold account to a family gold account using paypal?&nbsp; I have tried on my computer and I get the message that it cannot be processed at this time, and it's not even an option to get family gold on my
 xbox.&nbsp; Is this something that will be coming or am I out of luck?</p>

<h2>            Cannot hear sound from desktop Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using Windows 8.1 on my Dell Inspiron 15R N5110 and have problems relating to my audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I don't plug in my headphone: I can sometimes play audio (or video) from online website such as youtube. However, when I try to open audio file or video file using Windows Media Player (or other programs like: VLC, KMP...) I can't hear the sound though
 the video works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in my headphone the problems are the same except the I can listen to music from online website more frequently compared to without headphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried to reinstall the audio driver from Dell website, update Windows but the problems still remain..</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I resolve that problems?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; computer restarts when loading safe mode logon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> red5thedragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; computer restarts when loading safe mode logon screen, now stuck in it</h2>
                    I tried going into safe mode, but when I hit the logon screen, my comp would automatically restart after a few seconds. The seconds are random. Normal mode/startup worked fine. So I thought I could try using msconfig and had windows do safeboot with minimal
 .... That was a bad idea, since now my computer tries to always go into safe mode, and it always restarts at logon. I've managed to type in my password fast enough but it says it's incorrect, and then restarts a split second after. And I've also tried leaving
 it blank, but that was incorrect.<br />
<br />
I've tried pushing f8 during boot up choosing "repair your computer". I tried automatic fix, but that didn't work. I didn't have any restore points or images, so I couldn't do either of those. I tried the memory diagnostic and nothing was wrong. I tried using
 the command prompt and tried finding and running msconfig.exe in system32, but it wasn't there.<br />
<br />
After pushing f8, I've also tried selecting safe mode with command prompt, but it goes to the same logon screen, and then restarts. I've tried "last good configuration" and "disable automatic restart on system failure" or something like those, without any luck.
 I've also selected normal mode but since I've selected safeboot, that just goes into the safe mode logon and restarts.<br />
<br />
I've tried putting in the windows 7 disc, and managed to get to the menu with the automatic fix, restore point, and command prompt by logging in with the same name and password that the safe mode logon screen rejects. That means the safe mode logon rejects
 the correct password.<br />
<br />
Now, I just want to start up windows 7 normally.&nbsp; How would I disable that automatic start into safe mode without logging into windows?&nbsp; Or how would I do that through the command prompt in "repair your computer"?

<p>Thanks, but I figured it out, and in an easier way too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after doing some searching, I thought I should try editing the boot.ini.&nbsp; I found out that windows 7 doesn't use boot.ini, but uses the boot loader program.&nbsp; I figured out that I had to use the command "bcdedit" in the command prompt.&nbsp; I found the word
 "safeboot" for one of the parameters in the list bcdedit provides.&nbsp; Then I took some time and learned how to change that.&nbsp; I learned I had to use the command "/deletevalue" and from there, I got my comp to go back to booting normally.</p>

<h2>            When I turn my laptop on I get a &#34;other user&#34; screen</h2>
                    <p>Before, when I turned on my laptop I got my lock screen and then my sign in screen, but now I have this weird screen that says "other user" and underneath it, it says "The user name or password is incorrect. Try again" but I never typed anything, its just
 the first thing I see when my laptop is turned on... after I press ok I still get the "other user" screen, but I can sign in. I've tried signing in to here and it worked and my account was opened, but if I press the back arrow button I get my account and its
 picture along with "other user". I clicked my account and get my account sign in....</p>
<p>I was changing settings, but I didn't change anything that had to do with accounts and making a new one. I've tried going to the control panel and the accounts, but the "other user" is not there. What do I do?</p>

            <p>Here is the solution, i think.</p>
<p>1/ press the start button and at home screen type netplwiz</p>
<p>2/ your username should be highlighted, if not, disable the interfering one/s</p>
<p>3/ unclick the checkbox “must enter a username and password…”</p>
<p>4 enter your password, apply, reboot, should be a done deal!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>if not then go back to netplwiz,&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT "must enter username..." then apply then</p>
<p>DESELECT "must enter username..." then apply, enter password again and reboot!</p>

    <title>no sound from monitor mounted speakers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjdaso48  say:</h3>
<h2>            no sound from monitor mounted speakers.</h2>
                    I have an older monitor (AOpen f1513) that I hooked up to my Dell (Optiplex sx280) computer. There is no sound coming from speakers. I have checked the cables and they are all tight, and made sure the volume was turned up on monitor and in my sound devices
 in the control pannel. I also checked the display in control panel and it said it was a standard default monitor and was working properly. I figured when I hooked it up and rebooted it that my system would detect new hardware, and locate and install any additional
 software to make it function properly. I only can find two cables on the monitor. One is the powercable, and the other is the big cable with the blue und on it that plugs into the back of the computer. The only other place for a plug is the headphone jack.
 tried to find a manual on line but was just getting bounced around. Please send help, signed desperatly deaf.

<p>The AOpen website has no information about the F1513 (I checked).</p>
<p>If you follow the video cable to where it plugs into the back of the F1513, you<br />
should find that there is a 3.5mm (3/16 in) female mini-stereo plug.&nbsp; Plug one<br />
end of an dual-male audio cable into that plug on the monitor and the other&nbsp;<br />
into the green audio mini-stereo plug on your multi-media card.&nbsp; You can&nbsp; see&nbsp;<br />
an example of the cable you need as <a href="http://www.cablestogo.com/product.asp?cat_id=2002&amp;sku=27411&amp;st=27411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Hi Jjdaso48,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to have a speaker connection in the monitor to connect it from the sound card to work. You need to have a audio input
 port on your monitor speaker and needs to be connected through&nbsp;audio cable to the sound card on your computer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since you are unable to find the connection, I would suggest you to contact Aopen technical support to check how to connect
 and find the port to connect in the monitor for inbuilt speakers. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As a general rule, you should never delete anything that ends in .sys. These are system files considered essential for the proper function of the computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And yes, you do need the Nvidia driver installed to have good functionality of the PC, it's not&nbsp;exclusively&nbsp;for gaming. That driver allows the graphics card in your computer to work and do it's job, which is why once it was removed, the display got messed
 up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would do that system restore first thing and try to get that driver back installed. You may even have to go to you computer manufacturer's support site if the restore doesn't do the trick.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once you get that driver back installed, then we can go about trying to get the speed and performance of the computer up to where you want it.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Raw codec olympus e-p3 not supported in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>original title: raw codec olympus e-p3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently downloaded <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the new Camera Codec package</a>. I'm very happy to eventually get raw thumbnails for most of my cameras when using Win7 64bits. That was long overdue : I'm waiting since october 2010 !! more than two years ago.
<br />
<br />
But there was a big deception : one of the Olympus camera I own isn't yet supported. I thought it was just an accidental omission of the list of supported cameras, since both newer and older cameras are supported. But alas, i found out that the Pen Olympus
 E-P3 camera is still not supported. <br />
<br />
Here is the list of Olympus supported cameras : <br />
<b>Olympus</b>: C-7070 Wide Zoom, C-8080 Wide Zoom, E-1, E-3, E-10, E-20, E-30, E-420, E-450, E-520, E-620, EVOLT E-300, EVOLT E-330, EVOLT E-400, EVOLT E-410, EVOLT E-500, EVOLT E-510, OM-D E-M5, PEN E-P1, PEN E-P2, PEN E-PL1, PEN E-PL2, PEN E-PL3, PEN E-PM1,
 XZ-1<br />
<br />
You can note that there is support for the first, second and third generation Pens. But the inexplicably the E-P3 is missing from the list. And I confirm that while my E-P1 and E-M5 files are now appearing in the Window Explorer with nice thumbnails, they are
 still missing for the E-P3 !!<br />
<br />
Please Microsoft, take care of that problem. If you can show the thumbnails for the E-P1 and E-P2, and for the E-Pl1, E-Pl2 and E-Pl3, why not include the E-P3 ?&nbsp; Sure this is only an accidental omission.. Please repair it !&nbsp; I need those thumbnails..
<br />
<br />
NB :&nbsp; Are there other E-P3 owners having the same problems ? or Am I the only one ?
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for help... <br />

Well, it is rather surprising, that the E-P3 is missing from the list, since the E-P3 was issued one year earlier than the E-M5 which is in the list. It was issued at the same time as the E-Pl3 and the E-Pm2 (same generation of cameras). So you do probably
 have the needed codec in what Olympus transmitted you to achieve the present update ! It should only be a matter of including the camera in the list able to use those codecs.
<br />
<br />
Can't you check whether the omission was on your part before going to Olympus again ? It seems rather improbable that Olympus forgot to give you what is needed to handle the E-P3, since that was their flagship camera before the E-M5 was issued about one year
 later and since you have what is needed for the other cameras of the same generation.
<br />
<br />
Your answer is not a very fair answer. Before sending me back to Olympus, Microsoft should rather check that they weren't the one forgetting that camera model. Further a small customer like me is rather helpless in trying to deal with a far away corporation.
 Your engineers are better positioned than me to ask that from Olympus, in case that was needed.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your answer, which alas isn't very satisfying. <br />

No, I can't go back to the 32 bits codec, since I'm using Window7 64 bits. What I need is the thumbnails in the Explorer. Something that shows me the thumbnails when I'm opening a picture with a 64bits apps. I had the older codec installed and discovered that
 it was preventing me to see any thumbnails, even the ones which are available for the E-Pl1 and E-M5. So it really doesn't work on a 64bits machine in Win7.

<h2>            windows 10 IRQ &#40;ISA&#41; ACPI-COMPLIANT-SYstem - Computer now shows 511 of these and has slowed down considerably</h2>
                    <p>When trying to find out why a USB Com Port won't recognize the device but once and then the software using it has to be installed again, I discovered there were IRQ (ISA) ACPI-COMPLIANT-SYstem, a whole page of them with the last one showing 511 as the number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way and can the windows 10 IRQ (ISA) ACPI-COMPLIANT-SYstem be removed without causing major computer problems and can all of these be slowing my computer's response down, and how do you find out what is causing them?</p>

<h2>            windows movie maker chaning multiple text title color and font</h2>
                    So I am working on a file in windows movie maker, and I have multiple titles with text saying different things.&nbsp; At the end of the project I decided to change the text color and font type, my question is..is there any way to do a batch color and text change
 all at once or do I really have to click each one and change it?

            <p>Will try that again, but I just did a very simple search on "this pc" for "Driverupdate" and it found 12 entries: .job &nbsp;.exe etc, etc, etc. &nbsp;Some of these files date back to May of this year (?). &nbsp; Tried to manually delete them and they wouldn't be deleted.
 &nbsp;I would get a message that they had been deleted but when I look at the list they are still there. &nbsp;Will now try a re-reinstall of Windows 10</p>

<h3> silvio agovac  say:</h3>
<h2>            SideWinder X8 not responding</h2>
                    I've got a SideWinder X8 for about 10 months and it stopped responding. The blue light is constantly on, I can't turn the mouse off until i plug out the recharging cable (on/off switch isn't responding), and also the battery won't charge. So until i don't
 plug out the cable, the light will continue to glow.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens without an inserted battery, on a different PC and even after reinstalling drivers and software.<br />
<br />
There were no system changes when the mouse stopped working, and no interference via WiFi or any other waves.<br />
OS: W7<br />

<h3> dms99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I purchase activation key over phone from Microsoft Support&#63;</h2>
                    I have a pc with an OEM windows 8.1 pro 64 bit OS on it.<br />
<br />
I have installed VMWare Workstation 11 on it and have created a Windows 8.1 virtual machine from a backup of the same PC.<br />
<br />
The copy of Windows 8.1 VM requires activation.<br />
<br />
I understand that the&nbsp;virtual machine will require its own license for Windows 8.1 .<br />
<br />
Question: Can I purchase the required product key through Microsoft Support with a credit card when I call to activate this copy of Windows 8.1?

<p>
</p><p>Am I to understand from your reply that the answer is No, I must buy the key from some other place at Microsoft?</p>

</p><p>I can't find any way to purchase a windows 8.1 Pro product key from the&nbsp;URL you suggest:

            Hi Dwyer.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
