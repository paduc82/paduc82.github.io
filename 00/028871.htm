<h2>            Bing &#40;MSN&#41; apps and a few other things won&#39;t load in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 Tech Preview</h2>
                    <p>Recently all the Bing (now MSN) apps have stopped working on my PC running Windows 8.1.
<strong>T</strong><strong>he live tiles are updating correctly, but when I open the app it says no Internet connection</strong> and won't let me do anything. I cannot add new mail accounts (particularly Google) to the Mail app as well (it says something about
 could not connect to the server). The Store is working correctly so I have already tried
<strong>reinstalling the app</strong><strong>s</strong>. I also ran the <strong>Windows App, MSFT account and Windows Update troubleshooters</strong> but
<strong>nothing</strong> was fixed. I <strong>do not use</strong> a proxy, and I have verified those settings too. My ISP does not block Windows, Bing or Microsot site, an I don't have any third party anti-malware/firewall or malware (:p) installed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I recently installed Windows 10 Tech Preview on the system using dual-boot, and after updating the apps to latest version and configuring the system as per my needs the apps stopped working again. I am going to do a clean format of Windows 10 within
 a few days and note every step to see what causes this, but right now I would appreciate some help from people who have already fixed the problem or the MSFT guys who can do anything.

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I had reinstalled the OS (Windows 10) to check what caused this, and what I found was, a feature of Windows which I enabled(amongst many others) was causing it, But disabling the ones I enabled wasn't undoing the error. So I ran a
 system restore to the point when I used the ISO to install .NET 3.5(the first feature that I enabled) and everything was fixed. So I could not determine exactly which feature caused it.<br />
</p>
<p>But the problem for Windows 8.1 is that I had made those changes about an year ago, so I don't have a system restore point for that, and what's strange is the error occured a few days ago, everything was fine before October.<br />
</p>
<p>And I have already run 90% of those fixing methods before asking this question.</p>

            <p>Hi Chandradeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good to note that the issue with the Windows 10 Technical Preview has been fixed and your valuable suggestions will certainly help other community members to resolve their similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, there are various reasons for the issue with 8.1 including a conflict with any third party software, especially anti-virus or sue to some corruption in the system files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you mentioned that the system does not have an year old restore point to revert the changes. But, as the problem arose a few days back only, so, in order to diagnose the issue,&nbsp;I would have you restore the system to a recent date likely towards the
 end of September, when your system was working fine.</p>

<h2>            Excel Add-in &#40;3rd party&#41;, not showing up</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to download and use the CDC's mosquito vector index excel add-in from https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resourcepages/mosqSurvSoft.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a newer version of Excel so I downloaded the 2007 option, unzipped the folder, and opened it (I also tried the older version for trouble shooting and had the same issue).
</p>
<p>I then went into Excel--&gt; Insert Add-In--&gt; manage other add-ins--&gt;found the name of the downloaded file under "available add-ins"--&gt; clicked Ok.
</p>
<p>From my understanding, it should then appear under "My Add-Ins" in the top left corner, but it is not there (nor is it under the Data or Formula tabs). I have gone into the Add-IN manager multiple times and it lists it as "Active" but it is no where to be
 found.</p>
<p>Is it there somewhere? Is it being blocked?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated!!</p>

re: 2007 add-in<br />

Microsoft killed the use of menus/command bars with the release of xl2013.<br />
You have to use a&nbsp; xl2010 (or earlier) version in order to access any custom menus.<br />
<br />
It sucks for most, but for MS its great to be a monopoly.<br />

<h2>            outlook 2016 keep conversations together after initial email goes to a folder based on a rule</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure this question has come up before, so I apologize if this is a duplicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial comes in and automatically goes to a folder based on a rule (ie. all emails ending in @abc.com go to ABC folder). However, when someone replies to that email whose email address does not end in abc.com, that email goes to my inbox instead of
 keeping it together with the initial email. I know when I move emails I can say move and keep conversations together, but is there a way to keep the conversation together when the first email is automatically sent to a folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help!</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We can fully understand your requirement. However, if the user doesn't have the @abc.com, the rule will not apply for this user. So, his reply goes into your Inbox Which is an
 expected behavior. The only way to </span><span>keep the conversation together is mentioned by Amanda unless you move them manually.
</span></p>

<p>I had win 10 running and it updated to the newer screen. &nbsp;It was ready to restart for both win update of 1803 and the safety update. &nbsp;it said pending restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually it asks to restart, or when i click restart it will have the option restart and update. &nbsp;It did not show that option, so i restarted it, &nbsp;and it had that damn error for the wdfilter again and collected data and then restarted,,,, and was back to
 the old original screen with the ocean and inside the cave. &nbsp;Frankly, i think microsoft has gone bonkers! &nbsp;this has been looping over and over and back and forth all day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the 3rd time ive done &nbsp;reset and it it still freaking failed! &nbsp;It has the downloads, and yet fails at the restart and update! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does now have that file, but i cant delete it. &nbsp;Cant from inside, perhaps from command prompt but i dont know how to do that anymore. &nbsp;I dont have permission as admin, even though im the admin, on the admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only one os now and not two 10s, but still i am unabe to run 10 without that crash, and from what ive seen im not the only one this is happening to with the latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, at the update it states something about my microsoft account needs attention to get updates, but there is nothing to click on, i have checked everything and dont see anything. &nbsp;It did want me to login to the cloud. &nbsp;I did, but then turned it off. &nbsp;I
 dont like it showing up when im online and uploading. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know how to fix this crappy software. &nbsp;I guess im ready to dump it. &nbsp;This is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, i did both those. &nbsp;My system just kept crashing.. i tried to move all my files to another drive. &nbsp;doing this somehow currupted the c drive. &nbsp;I can get to restore on it, and click the file, but at the next screen it says i have to pick which drive, there
 is only one, and i can click on it, but i cannot check the checkmark so it wont go further, the next button remains dark . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to reset deleting all files and starting new, but it comes back almost instantly saying there is a problem, with only the cancel button available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now i think all i can do, is reformat that drive, and i dont remember how to do that.</p>

<p>Did you ever do a "clean" install to a Hard drive that has all partitions deleted, so that you have a clean build without any of the corrupted files this will check your system proper operation, as I had three systems running since the start of the program
 for Windows 10 and each system was a dual boot where both boots were the same build, one build was a clean nothing added or remove the 2nd build is where I would do all of the testing, if an issue would show up I would reboot to the clean build and test my
 system, this way I knew if it was something that got changed on the testing build, I now only use one system and haven't done much testing of Windows 10 as this forum has turned into a help forum rather than a testing forum.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I posted in your other postings some details about your system and any 3rd party software would help us to help you.</p>

<p>yes i did, last weekend, well i started it on thursday last week, but had to download the newer iso.&nbsp; and the the older one, as the newer one failed to boot.&nbsp; Just gave me a flashing dash, and the window screen, nothing more.&nbsp; The last time I copied the
 iso with 4 passes, and it boot right up.&nbsp; But then yesterday i got stuck in a loop, again with the latest update.&nbsp; After looping 3 times it finally stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a retired systems analyst from working on the b2 project, i dont think microsoft is testing any implementations, they are just tossing them out.&nbsp; I no longer belief in the old microsoft I knew when i was in college and worked there at the start up, before
 the two parted ways.&nbsp; This would never have been allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update yesterday.&nbsp; kept giving me the notice it was ready, yet when it shut down to update, it shut down.&nbsp; Id start the computer again, and it would load to 35%, then id be at the login.&nbsp; went through that 3 times, with all my settings being reset, except
 my background picture and colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Usually booting to only a flashing dash is seen if you try to boot a GPT-initialized USB stick on a Legacy BIOS device.&nbsp; The USB partition has to be marked Active and usually NTFS-formatted to boot a device that is in Legacy BIOS mode.&nbsp; I see this if I try
 to boot my old, non-UEFI Dell laptop from USB without preparing the USB stick properly.</p>

<p>Sir, in fact i did do this, you cannot delete that file, i tried several times.&nbsp; It was impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not what i implied? it is exactly what i implied and said.&nbsp; at login, both my monitors background were black.&nbsp; Nothing on the screen but an icon for the recycle bin, which when looked at and attempted to access gave the error no app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>opening up task manager showed no apps running. That is what i said and implied, plain and simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file also did not exist for several of my first tries, some how after log out it was being deleted, and then only being created each time i logged in.&nbsp; I tried to delete it several times when i could see it, but again, it would not delete the file.</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>I went to the FB account, selected account settings, and attempted to follow your instructions above. It did give me an option to unlink the Facebook account, but as soon as I click on the Unlink button, it sends me to a log-in through MS. I entered the
 FB account number, and MS says no such account exists. So, it won't let me delink from FB, and therefore I can't finish your instructions. I took the further step of amending this account with another gmail account I own, added a password, then attempted to
 delete the account. After I deleted the account, I removed the skype app from my laptop, downloaded it again, launched it, and the deleted account showed up again! I'm upset because my work group uses skype for chat and all the history/contacts exists on the
 gmail account. There's got to be a way to remove it. Let me know if you have any other ideas, thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi Sheridan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering Mojave might affect the low version of Word as you are using 16.12, we would suggest you check the update to update Word to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the latest version 16.21 (190115)&nbsp;</a> to check if the issue can be fixed on your end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains,&nbsp;<span><span>&nbsp;</span>you could also try
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>accessing Safe Mode on Mac</span></a><span> to ensure it is not caused by
</span><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25614?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>incompatible login items</span></a><span>.</span></p>

When do these lines appear? If they turn up after you have typed, say, three asterisks and pressed Enter, then see&nbsp;<a href="http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/CantGetRidOfLine.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://word.mvps.org/faqs/formatting/CantGetRidOfLine.htm</a>.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Rob Independent Advisor, I am here to help you to solve your issue.
<br />Thank you for contacting the community It is a pleasure for us to help you out.
<br />-
<br />There are a few different ways for saving emails to a USB drive.
<br />For Microsoft Outlook, it can depend on which format you want to save your emails. Think about whether you need just the text of the email or if you’d prefer that the message looks exactly like it does in your Outlook inbox.
<br />
<br />In Outlook, one option is to go to the file menu and click on the “Import/Export” option and then click on “Export to a File.” Next, you’ll click on the .pst option.
<br />Back up your email
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/back-up-your-email-e5845b0b-1aeb-424f-924c-aa1c33b18833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/back-u...</a>
<br />
<br />Outlook will also let you use the “Save As” option to move emails to your USB flash drive. 
<br />-Choose the file format that works best for your needs.
<br />
<br />-
<br />I hope this helps, 
<br />Please let me know if you have further questions.
<br />Remember, your feedback will be very welcome.
<br />Regards,
<br />Rob

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Entries Lost After Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Looks like I'm not the first person to face the issue of lost calendar entries after windows 10 upgrade, but can't seem to find a viable&nbsp;solution from the community board.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, the calendar is still on my iPhone, but how do I export that info to
 outlook.&nbsp;Microsoft, anyone, please&nbsp;help with resolving this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error message I get when I try to open my icloud calendar. Can you please help me get my icloud calendar loaded back to outlook like it was before I upgraded to windows 10.&nbsp; This is such a hassle.

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try following methods and verify the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Close Outlook.</li><li>Open iCloud for Windows.</li><li>Deselect the Mail, Contacts, Calendars &amp; Tasks checkbox and click Apply.</li><li>Wait a few seconds. Select Mail, Contacts, Calendars &amp; Tasks, and click Apply.</li><li>Open Outlook.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>The iCloud Outlook Add-in transfers your content between iCloud and Outlook. Follow these steps to turn on the Add-in:
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>File </strong>menu.</li><li>Click Options in the left panel.</li><li>Click Add-ins in the left panel of the Outlook Options window.</li><li>Look at the list of add-ins in the Active Application Add-ins section.</li><li>Select the iCloud Outlook Add-in.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When iCloud is set as your default account in Data Files, your data won't sync between your devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2010 and later:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select File &gt; Info &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data Files.&nbsp;</li><li>If iCloud is listed as the default account in the Comments column, select a different account.</li><li>Click Set as Default.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope it helps. Keep us posted on the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span></span></p>

            I too lost my iCloud calendar that was on Outlook (Office 365) with the Windows 10 automatic update that ran 12/14/2015. In addition, the calendar wasn't syncing correctly, so I lost a lot of appointments that weren't showing up on my iPhone. Is there
 any way to get the calendar back?<br />

<p>You've posted in sub-category Windows 7.</p>
<p>Windows Defender in Windows 7 is only a most basic protection against spyware. As soon as any other Anti-Virus&nbsp; product is installed, Windows Defender gets automatically disabled.</p>
<p>That's normal and how it should be. You shouldn't try to enable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>What is your Anti-Virus program?</p>

</p><p>You will need to use the AVG removal tool.&nbsp; Also, if this is Windows 7 system, I recommend upgrading to Windows 10 (it may be automatically removed if it is not compatible).&nbsp; If Windows Defender isn't running after the upgrade and it's the only AV installed
 - post back. </p>

<h3> frankgriffin- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Excel online in colour</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I have published an Excel spreadsheet online, by inserting the link to a webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cells in the spreadsheet are different colours.</p>
<p>When I try to print the online spreadsheet it comes out in black and white.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried various settings, different printers et cetera but I can't get it to print in colour.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Frank,<br />
<br />
To better understand the situation, please share with us the following information:<br />
1. Is the webpage in your SharePoint team site or external site?<br />
2. Provide your steps (including some related screenshots) to insert the link to the webpage.<br />
3. Is colored displayed on the webpage (not print)?<br />
<br />

<br />
For further investigation, please confirm the information below:<br />
1. Embed other contents (outside Office 365) to your public website, and check if the color can be printed normally.<br />
2. Use a different browser to check the outcome.<br />
3. Try using different printers.<br />

            The free upgrade from Windows 7SP1 or 8.1 to Windows 10 ended July 29, 2016. Plus replacing the motherboard means that your old computer is now a new computer in the eyes of Microsoft which would mean that you would have to purchase a copy of Windows 10
 or a license of Windows 10 for it to be activated. You may also choose to stay with the Windows 10 Insider builds but the Insider builds would never be activated.<br />

<p>I only had a glance at a couple of the logs so far, but I would try to delete any traces of downloaded Insider builds. Boot with Windows 10 install media and delete the folders at C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution and C:\$WINDOWS.~BT. You can use SHIFT-F10
 to get a Command Prompt from the installer screen. Check if your Windows volume is drive C: (sometimes changes in this mode) and then use
<strong>rd </strong>to delete:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">rd /S /Q C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try running Disk Cleanup from Administrator Command Prompt back in Windows. If you use
<strong>cleanmgr /sageset </strong>and select all options and later run <strong>cleanmgr /sagerun
</strong>it will delete all the files chosen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try running <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that you have no non-Microsoft antivirus installed. Use <strong>msconfig
</strong>to do a clean boot by disabling all non-Microsoft services (you can hide the Microsoft services to make disabling the rest easy) and disable all Startup items from Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try mounting your Creators Update, build 15063 ISO and run <strong>setup.exe
</strong>to attempt another upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried running the Activation Troubleshooter? If Windows 10 was previously activated on the prior motherboard, it may find your Digital License, as long as you were logging into Windows with your Microsoft Account on the old motherboard and using
 that same MSA now. Tell it that you changed hardware.</p>

<h3> doylesrader  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make comments display in PDF</h2>
                    <p>Here's what I want. I want to mark up a Microsoft Word document with comment balloons, then save it as a PDF and have the balloons show in the PDF. I can find all sorts of postings saying how to turn the comment balloons OFF when saving something to PDF,
 but I want the opposite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this successfully a couple of times, a few weeks ago, but apparently I changed something on my Word settings, because now when I put the comment balloons on a Word document and save it to PDF, all the comments are closed and not readable. I want a
 very simple thing: I want all the comment balloons open and readable when people open the PDF. Anyone who can figure out what I did wrong to make them closed and not readable, and can point me to how to reverse my mistake, will win my undying gratitude.</p>

            <p>Just to be clear, you are using the desktop version (= the locally installed version)&nbsp;of Word and not Office online? I believe that Word online never prints comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the desktop version, when comments are hidden or truncated, the reason is usually that there are too many comments on the same page so that Word can't display them all. You can try increasing the "Preferred width" in the Advanced Track Changes dialog
 box.</p>

 automatically using hash tags in one note?</p>

<h2>            How to have multiple rows show on a word table template output&#63;</h2>
                    <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>We have a&nbsp;computer system where the system generates a data file (behind the scenes)&nbsp;that is then used to create an output in word. We set up a word
 template for&nbsp;merging the oputput data points. For my output needs, I would like a data file format because I have names and addresses of 12K+ to send to a mail house. The suggestion was to create a word table template that I can then copy into excel. This
 works, however, I cannot seem to get more than one row of data onto a page. I have added the merge field “next” at the end of the last merge field in the last data column, I have added next at the beginning of the second row of data before the data field,
 I have added rows to fill a page (about 5) – nothing is working. Any suggestions please? I don’t want to have 12K pages of data output.</font></font></font></p>

            I have seen this solution and it would work if you have your data file and then go through Word to do a mail merge and can select directory. My problem is that the addressing logic for my name configurations in my computer system &nbsp;(for example, I have
 2 records and the addressing logic program combines the names into a Mr. &amp; Mrs. vs having 2 individual records) creates a file in the backend and the only way to view the output data is to have it download into a word document (template for the merge fields;
 for example the label names, address, etc); the system does not allow for an excel output. &nbsp; I have tried to see if there is a way I can create a "directory" template but I cannot see how to do that?
<div><br />
<div>Sorry if I am confusing! Any additional thoughts?</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

<br />
<br />I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />It could be that hasn't been built into the new OneNote app yet. Microsoft is actively developing it, though.
<br />
<br />YOu can provide feedback to them within the app by clicking the three dots for Settings and then choosing Feedback.
