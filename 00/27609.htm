<h2>            Do Human Technical Support &#38; Help Persons Exist On Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm 'told' that "Skype support agents are available to help through the Community and chat support."......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do actual Help &amp; Support human beings that I could ring, or chat to, exist on Skype?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>And, if there is, where do I go to contact them? </p>
<p>
</p><p>All that happens is I get shunted towards 'Community' which I don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I jsut want to connect with a technical expert who could talk me through how to do something.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In this case what does one do to actually USE Skype for a group conversation with video?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I'd also like to add a Skype number for myself, but this didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was' given' this ID no:&nbsp; <em>REQUEST-6086267d/2018060410</em></p>
But this is useless unless I can find WHERE I can make this 'request'.

<p>It’s a two step process now on the iPad. Select the email, then hit the arrow that says Reply. A new mail will open. Then hit the arrow AGAIN and an option will come up to select forward or reply all. That’s it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opion this was a very poor UI choice on Microsoft’s part when they did the redesign on the latest version. Hopefully they’ll fix this in the next update.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download Word documents directly to computer. Goes to Web Office Apps, but doesn&#39;t work there either.</h2>
                    <p>Since I downloaded the Office 365 apps, which run as software on my computer. Now, whenever I click a document link on most websites, it opens in the Office Web Apps. This is annoying, but wouldn't be the worse if it worked! However, usually the Word documents
 send me to a site telling me there is an error with permissions of the document so it doesn't actually download to the Web App or to my computer. Some Excel files are too large to open in the Web Apps, so those won't work either. Below is the error I get.
 When I click the Learn More link, it simply takes me to the Microsoft Office 365 website. I can't find any other information. I am running Mac OS X El Capitan and using Chrome, but I haven't found another browser to solve my problem.</p>
<p>The above being said, I have found my own solution which isn't great, but allows me to download the files. I right-click the link, select "Print." Then in the print preview there is a blank white page with the document link at the top. When I click that
 link normally, it works. This tells me that obviously there is nothing wrong with the files, but simply with my Office 365 settings that I can't figure out how to change.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,<br />
<br />
Could you tell us which SharePoint service are you using? <br />
<br />
If you are using on premise SharePoint which include the Office web apps, then it's a normal behavior that the Office web apps open when you click the document links. Since our forum mainly focuses on SharePoint online service, I would suggest you go to
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=sharepointadmin,sharepointdevelopment,sharepointcustomization,sharepointgeneral,sharepointsearch&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=Office+web+apps%3A+file+not+found%2C+the+url+of+the+original+file+is+not+valid+or+the+document+is+not+publicly+accessible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet Forum</a> for expert assistance. This is a dedicated support channel for on premise SharePoint 2013 related issues.
<br />
<br />
Besides, based on my search, the issue may occur when you open a document that has a file size that is larger than 10&nbsp;megabytes from a user generated URL. Make sure the document doesn't exceed 10&nbsp;megabytes.
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/482ec7e7-2fa4-42ca-92cd-f92f9367f0bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/482ec7e7-2fa4-42ca-92cd-f92f9367f0bb" /></a></p>
<p>Please refer to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff431687.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Configure Office Web Apps for SharePoint 2013</a>.<br />
<br />
If you are using the SharePoint online service which is integrated in Office 365, I'd like to know the following information for further investigation.<br />
1. Your Office 365 subscription<br />
2. The screenshots of the document links, their websites links and the links in print preview.<br />
3. When you click the print preview link, did it open the Office 365 apps or directly download to your computer?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jared</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. Here is what I know...</p>
<p>I don't know about SharePoint. I am using Office 365 with 2016 Office suite apps downloaded to my computer. I have the Office 365 education account through my University. I was directed to this forum by looking for help through the main website that the
 "Learn More" link referred to above brought me to. So it seemed to me to be relevant.</p>
<p>I previously had purchased Office Suite software installed on my Mac from 2011 or 2013 (I forget now), and never had this problem until I deleted that software thinking my new 2016 software would be providing the same or better services.</p>
<p>If you think I should go to a different forum, that's fine. The problem has been that I haven't been able to find who to talk to that could solve my problem. If you can help me, here's more information...</p>
<p>This also happens with every link regardless of the size of the file, and is independent of the link because I can successfully download these files through my print preview trick. And I never had this problem with my previous Office programs prior to the
 Cloud integration. I think it's clear this is a Cloud/Browser apps integration problem, and imagine that an option in the settings to tell Office 365 apps to not automatically download files to the browser apps would solve my problem outright. But I'm obviously
 not an expert in these matters, so whatever the reason, I just need to be able to automatically download files to my computer when I click them. I just don't have the need to use the online apps, and prefer the installed software on my computer. And I don't
 ever have any problems with this option with any files I download. So yeah... anyway, I'll attach a few more pictures too I guess.</p>
<p>Here is the webpage that I am sent to:</p>
<p>https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/filenotfound.htm?llcc=en-US&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, the Word documents always go here; the Excel and Powerpoint documents will go directly to the Office 365 web apps, but some of the Excel files I download are too large and therefore won't open online. I don't have the option to ask the provider
 of the file to reduce the Excel file size, as it is part of my job to access such large Excel data files. And, again, this is not a problem when I am able to download the file directly to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example of Download a Word Document from a link:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/698ef656-0876-491c-bc0e-6b14487f1158" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/698ef656-0876-491c-bc0e-6b14487f1158" /></a></p>
<p>From here, if I just normally left-click the link, it takes me to the above webpage displaying the error. I've found the only way to get around this is the process below. ("Save Link As...," "Copy Link...," "New Tab...," or any other option that I know of
 has not worked)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac3f577f-0f0c-445d-b71a-3eecd4d1873c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac3f577f-0f0c-445d-b71a-3eecd4d1873c" /></a></p>
<p>When I right-click and select "Print," it takes me to print preview and prepares to print a document. The document that would be printed is just a blank page with webpage info and the document link displayed below. I can left-click this link as one would
 expect to normally be able to click the link on the webpage itself, and it takes me to the normal download window allowing me to choose where on my computer to save it.</p>

 this point, everything is fine! I have successfully downloaded my file to my computer and can open it on on regular Microsoft Word software installed on my Mac, or anything else I care to do with it as a standard .docx file. I understand the benefits of the
 new Cloud services, etc. But I am simply not in the position to benefit from these services. I prefer downloading files to my computer as has been done since the beginning of Microsoft and the PC, yada yada yada. While I found a way to bypass this error, I
 don't understand why I need to do this and it is inconvenient. Is there a way to not have to do this? Is there a settings option somewhere that I can change how my Word (Excel or Powerpoint) documents are downloaded? Is there a way to disable the online Office
 365 apps unless specified, or any other solution?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Kerwin,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you so much for you detailed update.<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand you want to download the file instead of opening with the Office online apps when you clicking the file link on the website. However, I'd like to explain that the website you provided in the screenshot could be your school's
 inner site which is not supported by Office 365. The default open behavior for the file link could be set by your website admin, so you could contact your university's IT admin to change the settings for you.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your understanding is highly appreciated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Jared<br />

            <p>Thank you for the advice, and I will look into that.</p>
<p>However, files from other websites still open in Office 365 when I don't want them to, and sometimes I receive an error for Word documents. Though I see now that it looks like a different error when it happens, and it seems random. I still face the problem
 that when an Excel document is too large it won't open in Office 365 but doesn't give me the option to download directly.</p>
<p>But basically, are you saying that Office 365 does not have the ability to choose how I download my files, but rather the website host? If that's the case, fine, I'll just figure it out. But I have to wonder if I reinstall my older Microsoft Office suite
 and uninstall Office 365 if I will run into the same problem, or if I just strictly used Apple's software, Pages and Numbers. I also find it weird that the other students in my classes don't have the same problem, even though we download files from the same
 source. That's why I thought it was something I could change in my settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, thank you for your help and time. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

<h2>            Locked out of custom domain outlook email</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I check my custom domain outlook.com email through POP3 and send through STMP. As a result, I've been locked out of my account because I've been wrongly flagged for sending spam. I have received an email saying to log into my account, and follow onscreen
 instructions (verify account).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only way to verify the account is through sending a text/calling. Regardless of what number I try, I get the error message: "There was a problem and unfortunately, we have to ask you to sign in again. We're sorry for the inconvenience."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would really like to have this account verified so I could resume sending email through STMP.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div>Nicole</div>
                </div>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same thing happened in Australia or at least for me in Australia yesterday, 16th December 15. It started on the MSN website about lunchtime. I usually ad articles to my favourites folder to read the comments at a later date and have done so for months.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments attached to these were still coming up but then they also disappeared; yet I can still see the old notifications that someone had replied to a comment I made on Facebook over previous articles. The comments attached to saved articles were completely
 gone by morning 17th December 2015. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the site has been cyber attacked..... who knows and no one is telling at this stage.
</p>
<p>Maybe it is a case of limiting the sharing of knowledge and opinions which would not surprise me at all with the way the world is looking at the moment on the geopolitical scene.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>18/12/15 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever was going on it appears to have been fixed on the Australian site. Woke up this morning and the comments were up and running again.

            <p>My comment section disappeared recently as well. I checked into it and found other people had the same problem until they used a different browser. I found I can see the comments if I use Chrome or Internet Explorer 11 (type internet explorer into the Windows
 10 search bar to find and run it). Others have indicated Mozilla works also. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is, it seems to be random and there are reports that of the group of browsers I mentioned, some work and others don't, for different users.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the Edge browser, but until it "heals" I guess I'll be using a different browser if I want to view the MSN comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found it's handy to have at least two browsers. Sometimes sites work better with a particular browser.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I did not have an ISO of 10049 to create boot media, and I could not access the recovery menu as I could not get past the login or access task manager. (I was later told that shutdown while holding shift would get me to the recovery menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a rollback using 10041 media, and this was still unstable, so I performed a reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;will try&nbsp;update to 10049 again (although this is not currently available in windows update) before making any other changes.</p>

            <p>I had build 10041 running well. The update to 10049 was offered and accepted. It took an hour to download (I have a 60Gb/sec link). Once downloaded, it started "preparing" which took 2 hours. It then installed, which took another 4 hours. Eventually it finished
 installing then took another half hour "doing things".</p>
<p>
</p><p>During most of this process, the machine appeared to be locked or hung up, but I just left it alone to do it's thing. Every so often, after an hour or so&nbsp;of essentially nothing, the status indicator would jump 10 or 20%. The system eventually completed and
 I now have a running system. This note is being written from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line, here, is be patient. Eventually it gets done. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this update is so slow, I've no idea. I'm running this on a GA-X58A-UD5 with an intel i7-970 (stock), 24GB of RAM, and a 640GB WD Black drive. The update to 10041 and the original install both went fairly fast (well under an hour). This one took over
 6 hours total, and, again, mostly appeared hung up. The only indication that the system was doing something was the drive light flickering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, be patient. It will finish, however slowly.</p>

    <title>Office 97 Removal from Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesvaccaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 97 Removal from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I believe this is a little different from the normal problem of removing Office 97 without a CD.
</p>
<p>I had installed Office 97 on Windows 8.1. It worked OK. When I upgraded to Windows 10, I knew 97 would not work. I tried to remove it, but didn't have the disc.
</p>
<p>Needing the Office suite, I bought Office 2016 and installed it.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of 97 without affecting any files from 2016? I do not have the 97 disc.</p>

<p><span>You may not be able to uninstall the existing 2003, 2007 or 2010 Microsoft Office suite on your computer by using the

<li><span>The installation process did not complete when you tried to install a new program. Therefore, you are left with a partially installed program. When you try to install the
 program again, you are unsuccessful.</span></li></ul>

            <p>Uninstalling Office 97 should not affect the Office 2016 installation which employs a different folder structure from the older version. Uninstalling does not affect your personal files. You may need to repair Office 2016 after uninstalling 97 to fix any
 registry anomalies relating to shared resources.<br />

</p><p>If you mean Office operating program files, then no, you should not lose both versions. As Graham has pointed out, the version specific stuff is located in a unique folder.&nbsp; There is a little "shared code", but the uninstall process does not remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean the personal files you created with Office, then NO uninstalling definitely does not touch them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: when you encounter a page not found message for something you KNOW existed in the past (as opposed to a possible typo), try using the "WAYBACKMACHINE".&nbsp; This is a site that scans much of the internet and takes "snapshots" of pages it finds. Here is
 more info about it:</p>

            <p>Actually it didn't work. I was directed to "Fix it" for Windows 10. It searched for Office 2007 and of course, did not find it.</p>
<p>Is there a "Fix it" for Office 97? </p>
<p>I think I might have to do this through the Registry, but I'm not real confident.</p>

            <p>As far as I know, there is no "fix it" tool for Office 97.&nbsp; MS hadn't started doing Fix it's before 97 went out of support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it will not uninstall "normally", from the control panel, then you have the option of doing it manually. Yes, that means manually editing the registry. Follow the instructions in the link in my first reply.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other option is to use an "uninstaller" program.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thanks Rohn007,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Took your advice and&nbsp;downloaded IObit uninstaller. It removed Office 97. </p>
<p>Funny though, during the uninstall it asked for the Office 97 install disc. I just clicked "cancel" and the&nbsp;uninstallation proceeded without problems.</p>
<p>Thanks again!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PowerPoint -Excel Charts not linking correctly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robhemsath  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint -Excel Charts not linking correctly.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a power point with several charts that come from the different sheets in the same workbook.&nbsp; Each chart has series on both the x and y axis's&nbsp; that are dynamic named ranges.&nbsp; The charts are in the power point with links set to update automatically,
 however, on some but not all, of the charts the series values are not updating correctly when I open the PowerPoint.&nbsp; When I choose the select data dialogue, in PowerPoint the sheet name in the series value has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That [0] in this case should be SPCD.&nbsp; When I previously saved this file, it had the correct link and data, so the only thing different is I updated data in the underlying excel workbook and then opened the PowerPoint</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I manually update that [0] to the correct name of the sheet, the data updates and everything goes as planned.&nbsp; When I update the data in the excel file, the charts update correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would cause that change in the data source and how do I prevent that?&nbsp; I choose the dynamic ranges so I wouldn't have to go in and manually edit each range every time the data updates, so this a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I uninstalled the Office updates as you said, and after doing a restart, they all showed up again.&nbsp; Is this issue because I am on Windows 10?</p>
<p>I guess I will have to buy a new Office.</p>
<p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            We can&#39;t check in documents on SharePoint</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I would like to request your support with an issue that we have in the company.<br />
Recently some of the users started having some issues with checking in documents in SharePoint.<br />
They can normally check out a document and edit it but when they try to check it in again they getting an error message "You cannot save this workbook with the same name as another open workbook and add-in. Choose a different name, or close the other workbook
 or add-in before saving."<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the MS Office repair didn't helped. We also tried to update the MS Office in the most recent version, but nothing change.&nbsp;<br />
The last thing that we tried it was to delete the OfficeFileCache folder, but without luck.<br />
<br />
Do you know about this issue? Do you have solution for that?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.

<p><span>Hi Soultana,</span><br />
<br />
<del>By default, the auto-save feature in this version of Excel is off, that’s why we see this error.&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>If you turn Autosave off for a file which is stored on the cloud,&nbsp;if you turn AutoSave Off for a file, the program will remember and will keep it off every time you reopen that file. --&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-is-AutoSave-6d6bd723-ebfd-4e40-b5f6-ae6e8088f7a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What
 happens if I turn AutoSave off?</a></p>
<p>Please either turn Auto-save <strong>on</strong> or save the changes manually, wait and until the file is successfully saved and then Check in the file.</p>

<h2>            Compare Documents</h2>
                    <p>I am using the compare documents feature&nbsp;in Word. I am comparing 2 versions of a Lease and making my additional changes to the combined document. The problem that I have is that the Lease is over 60 pages long and when I save the changes and take a break
 I cannot reopen to continue making the edits. I have to start a new combined document. Is there a way to reopen the original compare documents session so that I can just continue to make my edits?</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can give!! </p>

            <p>Yes that is what I do but the problem that arises is that now that compare document has to become 1 of the 2 documents that are compared. I need to be able to reopen the 2 versions of the lease and continue making changes on the compare document.&nbsp;I'm sorry
 I'm sure I'm not really explain it correctly. Its a little confusing </p>

                    Sometimes by the time I can look at the band, the notification has gone and the band is back in watch mode. Is there a way to re-display the last notification, or better yet step back through them? I know I can go into each tile, but usually I want to
 see the latest and don't know if it was a SMS, eMail, or some other app.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There are new features that have been applied in Outlook 2016. One of them is the highlight color used in the said application. Outlook 2016 uses grey by default when highlighting text. Having said that, currently you don't have the option to change it based
 on your preference, as it is set by design. We would appreciate it if you raise this to our team as a feedback using our
<strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Feedback</a></strong> page so that they could check if they can add such feature.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            <p>Hi Brenda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<p><span>I'm glad you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>

            To go back to the publicly released Windows 10 you will need to do a clean install.&nbsp; Obtain an ISO or a bootable USB stick via the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you are prepared to hang on for a couple of months, continue with the Insider Program until it reaches the official Creator's Update build.&nbsp; Then you can simply opt out of new builds.

            Can't go with the clean install as I'll lose everything. I'll hang on for a couple of months. Thanks a million for the info. Helps a lot.

<p><span><span><span>If this is the case and you are on Skype for Windows 10 App, then this is a known bug in this application. When using the Open option, a copy of the image

    <title>Using 6300 as Wireless Modem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skyshred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using 6300 as Wireless Modem</h2>
                    
<p>Heya guys, I own a Nokia 6300 with a working GPRS contract with TPG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to somehow use my Nokia 6300 as a wireless modem so that my iPod Touch can use its internet so I can surf the web on a larger and better screen. Using bluetooth perhaps?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

            You can't use it in that way or there is no way you can share GPRS connection on 6300.

<p>It IS possible to share the GPRS connection on the 6300.</p>

            You can use the supplied USB cable to use your phone as a modem to connect your desktop or laptop to internet. There is an app for symbian devices called 'joikuspot' through which you can do wireless tethering. I haven't come across an application like,
 or itself, for non-symbian devices. So if you want wireless tethering better buy any latest symbian smartphone.

    <title>Using SharePoint Online as a File Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisyue8628  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using SharePoint Online as a File Server</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone comment on their experience moving their on premise File Server to SharePoint?</p>
<p>I would also like to know how people manage to save files from programs that are not Office 365 aware (aka not Office 2013/2016) such as Paint or Notepad.</p>
<p>Even saving off an attachment requires something that is visible to Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Of course I can use the OneDrive sync client but this will not work very well in a RDS environment where we are talking about significant sync changes on servers that are re-imaged to gold every night.</p>
<p>Also looked at a number of solutions such as NetDrive but these solutions are not reliable enough for me.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>I appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>Of the 3rd Party products, I have tried WebDrive and NetDrive. Both work OK but are not as reliable as I would of hoped.</p>
<p>Can you recommend any to look at?</p>
<p>The main drive is to consider using SharePoint as a Document Management solution and enjoy the benefits that would bring.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip on hosting on Azure but with around 3TB of data, I thought that would be a very expensive option.</p>
<p>We are on a 100MB link to the Internet.</p>

<p>I remembered looking at ZeeDrive but to be honest the pricing was quite high unless this has changed.</p>
