            Bit of a late reply this, but there is a fantastic piece of software that will definitely run on your N70 called wwigo (pronounced vigo). It's free, works via bluetooth and runs remarkably well. Check the website here:
<a href="http://www.motvik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.motvik.com/</a> I have used it with my N70 and N95 and it runs perfectly on both. One of the things we used it for was keeping an eye on our newborn child. I would start the app running on PC &amp; phone,
 put the phone in the baby's cot and we could keep an eye on him from downstairs!

</p><p>@E d watters,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the file.<br />
<br />
It appears upon inspection that the reason why this "empty" file is so big is because it maintains a cache of cells from 8 external files.<br />
<br />
Whenever a formula makes a reference to an external file, Excel stores a cache of all the values in the range, because it thinks it may never be able to reconnect to that external file ever again. It's a good thing, unfortunately it has the very consequence
 that this cache is arbitrarily big.<br />
<br />
Here is the rundown of the internal cache of values from the external files referenced in your file :<br />
<br />
(77 MB) Casemix - SHA-18-MASTER-6K.xlsm <br />
(6 MB) CASEMIX HOSPITAL-EXTRACTION MODEL-MASTER-1-T.xlsm <br />
(772 KB) Test Naas1-7.xls <br />
(124 KB) XLS/CM - 19082014/SHA HOSPITAL COMPILER-INPUT-2.xlsm <br />
(10 KB) ASF Merge output - 20062013paste specC&amp;amp;AG audit certFINAL.xls <br />
(8 KB) 01_Hospital Costing file - (JMES)&nbsp; 2012 (Constructed on 2010) (version 2).xls
<br />
(1 KB) ComboCode Tester.xlsm <br />
(554 B) Luked <br />
<br />
<br />
The total size is much bigger than your file size itself, which is "only" 8.5 MB. The reason why is that Excel compresses XLSM files. That's why the underlying problem is not obvious.<br />
<br />
At this point, there are two choices :<br />
- severe the ties with the external files<br />
- clear the cache<br />
<br />
Severing the ties cuts both the references and the cache. It may or may not be wise to do so depending on what you want because obviously if you are severing ties with the external files, you may just as well start with a brand new Excel file.<br />
<br />
If you are willing to do this, on a external file by external file basis, it is very easy. Just click on the ribbon / Name Manager. Then click on the "Refers To" column in order to sort the external references according to the files. If you scroll down you
 will see the links to Casemix - SHA-18-MASTER-6K.xlsm. You can multiple select those links and then click on Delete and then OK. When you save your file, it goes down to 800 KB, or just 10% of your file size. You may iterate over the remaining 7 external files.<br />
<br />
Clearing the cache is another beast because there is no way to do this with Excel. So I just did this manually with special tooling. A benefit is that even though the file went down to as low as 35 KB, it still has the ties to all 8 external files. Which means
 whenever you are going to use the corresponding defined names in formulas Excel will be able to reconnect to the files and fetch the values (it will ask). The unfortunate consequence is that whenever Excel refreshes new values it will recreate the cache that
 was just freed.<br />

    <title>Contacts folder missing in desktop Outlook, present in Office 365, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karincarlson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts folder missing in desktop Outlook, present in Office 365, and other Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>We have a user set up in Office 365 who is not a "real person," but an account set up to make it easier for everyone in our company to participate in creating and maintaining a shared address book/contacts list, one that is available on iPhones etc., without
 using OWA. Let's call this "person" "MrContacts." Recently, one of our users discovered that her MrContacts account in her desktop Outlook had two Contacts folders. Hm. So I had her remove the account from Outlook and set it up again. Removing the account
 did successfully remove the two (apparently duplicate) Contact folders. But then, mysteriously, there was NO contacts folder for the re-established account. To help our user diagnose this, I set up an account on my Outlook for MrContacts, and the Contacts
 folder appeared for me normally.</p>
<p>Is there a setting in Outlook (desktop) to not use, hide, or otherwise affect the Contact folder? What can I test or check or troubleshoot to figure out why my one user can't see the Contacts folder in her Outlook?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Karin,</p>
<p>From my experiencing, it's not feasible to hide to remove a default folder such as Contacts through Outlook settings.</p>
<p>To clarify the situation, I‚Äôd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Which Outlook version are you using?<br />
2. About the mailbox ‚ÄúMrContacts‚Äù, is it a user mailbox or shared mailbox?<br />
3. How do you add ‚ÄúMrContacts‚Äù, via a second account or additional mailbox?<br />
4. Could you reproduce the issue if you create a new Outlook profile for the affected user on her workstation or your workstation?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please provide the screenshots of the folders from your Outlook and the affected user‚Äôs Outlook.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

<p>4 - no, i did just that, i added the account to my outlook and it was fine. it's just happening on hers. here is a capture of her address book. i drew a box around the account with the missing contacts folder.</p>

<p>Hi Karin,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>According to the information, the issue could be related to the user‚Äôs Outlook. To further troubleshoot it, I need some more details:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the account set up using the Exchange mode, or IMAP/POP3? </li><li>Do you mean the user add it into the main profile of her own email account? If she create a new profile and set up the mailbox separately, will the issue occur?
</li><li>Normally, an Office 365 mailbox configured in multiple machines and devices should sync using the Exchange mode with each other. If the user makes some changes to the mailbox, will it sync with others?&nbsp;
</li></ol>

<p>Hi, Henry. Sorry - I thought my reply would post to the forum, but I see now that I am logged in that it did not.</p>
<p>To respond to your quesitons: </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is the account set up using the Exchange mode, or IMAP/POP3?</p>
<p>A: I believe it is Exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you mean the user add it into the main profile of her own email account? If she create a new profile and set up the mailbox separately, will the issue occur?</p>
<p>A: This is a separate account, different from her own email account. Essentially, she is adding two accounts to Outlook, both of which should have separate contacts lists etc: one for her own personal account, and one for the pretend user.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Normally, an Office 365 mailbox configured in multiple machines and devices should sync using the Exchange mode with each other. If the user makes some changes to the mailbox, will it sync with others?
</p>
<p>A: When it was functioning correctly, this was true, yes, for both her account and the pretend person account. As I mentioned in an earlier part of the thread, I did set up this pretend account on my system, and I was able to make changes to it. I have not
 been to her office to test whether she could see the changes, however.</p>

<p>hi karin,</p>
<p><strong>do you mean the user add it into the main profile of her own email account? if she create a new profile and set up the mailbox separately, will the issue occur?</strong><br />
<strong>a: this is a separate account, different from her own email account. essentially, she is adding two accounts to outlook, both of which should have separate contacts lists etc: one for her own personal account, and one for the pretend user.</strong><br />
i‚Äôd like to reconfirm whether the two accounts are set up on a profile and show on the same page, like the following screenshot:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=083282cc-34c3-45a8-92aa-cf0aaf9bfea6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d083282cc-34c3-45a8-92aa-cf0aaf9bfea6" /></a></p>
<p>if so, the two accounts are set up in the same profile. then please try creating a new profile and only set up mrcontact in the newly created profile, then let me know the resting result.

<p>in addition, since the issue doesn‚Äôt occur on your outlook client, but only on the user‚Äôs outlook client, this issue is probably caused by the specific outlook client, as henry said above. therefore, i recommend you involve our

</a>for the most dedicated assistance, then the issue can be fixed more quickly.</p>

<h2>            Outlook calendar invite attachments are not being sent</h2>
                    When a user creates a calendar invite with attachments, the recipients, while successfully receiving the invite, do not receive the attachments. It's as if the attachments are being stripped off the invite after it's sent.
<div>Does anyone have any ideas what might be happening?</div>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will assist you with the issue. However I have quick questions for you:</p>
<p>What is the type of email account setup on Outlook (POP3/IMAP/MAPI or Exchange)?</p>
<p>Does this issue occur with a particular type of attachments or any attachment and what is the size of the attachment?</p>
<p>Does the issue occur by sending from one particular user or any user?</p>
<p>Provide more details to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the email account is setup as Exchange, then you may also post your question in Outlook for Exchange forum for better suggestion:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Office 2010 and everything works. However at the top of the page for OUTLOOK I see the message "UNLICENSED PRODUCT" which prevents me from accesssing some options. I also grt a popup window saying this "THIS COPY HAS EXPIRED" I then click UPGRADE
 and go thru thru the activation process AGAIN. It accepts my PRODUCT KEY and then when I go into OUTLOOK I still get the message 'UNLICENSED" etc and the popup window telling me to upgrade</p>

            <p>Hi Wayne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to help you with the issue, but I need more details.</p>
<p>Which Office 2010 suite is installed on the machine?</p>
<p>Was Outlook 2010 purchased as standalone version or was it bought bundled with Office suite?</p>
<p>Provide more information to assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link which talks about which version of Office 2010 suite contains Outlook application:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/suites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/suites/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Office suite you purchased does not have Outlook as part of it, then Outlook 2010 installed on your machine is a trail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to purchase Outlook 2010, visit the link below:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry.... you need to go back to the Norton website and download the latest version of their product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable their toolbar Addon in your Web browser (IE11). This does not affect your web security (Norton runs in the background anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>from IE go Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced tab, uncheck "Enable third-party browser extensions". Save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close and restart IE for the full changes to take affect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should notice that the NOrtons toolbar for IE does not show any more.... select the Tools&gt;Windows Defender Smart Screen Filter menu and make sure that you have turned on the built-in security protection....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Norton's toolbar in IE turns itself on for no reason, go to the Nortons website to get a paid for version or to get instructions to remove their software from your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            help</h2>
                    <p><span>I am very frustrated with Microsoft now. I hope the powers that be will read this post and respond. I am ready to start bad mouthing to every company, community, social media enterprise
 I know I work for my local hospital and word gets around very quickly where I am from. Anyhow my story is I was a preview reviewer I had windows 7 did the preview insider and have had windows 10 for months now. recently I had an issue with my app store not
 working I have had several techs on my computer trying to resolve the issue to no avail, we tried resetting, we tried redownloading and&nbsp; still nothing I had 2 techs on my PC Hannah R and Christie E not sure which one changed my boot options and now I get the
 blue error Inaccessible Boot device ): all I wanted was my store to work?? I talked to a supervisor last night by the name of Nic very helpful but still this issue is not resolved. I am a single mom of 3 kids one of which is special they use this notebook
 for their homework obviously I have another computer but that is not the point. I even had the tech last night I was working with prior to the supervisor say to me well how much are you getting charged for this service?? still not the point&nbsp;. I cant afford
 the option of taking it into a shop to fix when it was they who created the need to have it fixed in the first place. Last attempt was made to check my hard drive and the test past ok I am still waiting for a call but now I have&nbsp;a 700 paperweight on my hands
 an my kids dont have the entertainment they deserve due to their incompetence. If Microsoft treats its consumers like this no wonder apple has done so well. But for the blue collar workers such as myself who cant afford the apples we dont have much choice
 and its sad. Last attempt to fix my PC was to reboot from internal cd/dvd, USB and nothing has worked please for the love of God can someone help me fix my computer.

<p>
</p><p>When you say tried to boot from DVD \ USB did not help, what happened what did you try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are probably aware an inaccessible device is not good and not easy to troubleshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start looking at an INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE &nbsp;you will need to boot of a DVD or bootable USB with the Windows 10 ISO disc image on it. When booting from a Windows 10 disc, on the 'Install Now' screen there is a 'Repair your computer' bottom left, there
 is a 'Troubleshoot' section with 'Advanced options' and 'Start-up Repair'. That may help.

            We tried to change the boot order in BIOS to have it boot from internal CD/DVD then from internal hard drive then from USB &nbsp;nothing worked. I just keep getting inaccessible boot devise we will restart and will continue that cycle indefinitely. So I can't
 even get as far as you are suggesting. I have the windows 10 downloaded from there and am waiting for a tech to call me on who to properly download to USB since they seem to think my CD drive is not working. Any more suggestions would be much appreciated thank
 you

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your machine have UEFI BIOS ?</p>
<p>If it does, it may have a setting for FAST BOOT...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This setting on my machine will not let you boot to anything except the HDD when set to it's fastest setting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your machine may normally boot to something like a EFI partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe as a test, you can try booting from a DVD or Flash by selecting the device in BOOT OPTIONS... usually something like F9 or F11, instead of actually entering the BIOS.. This only works for one boot... it needs to be selected everytime, as opposed to
 the actual BIOS setting that keeps the setting...</p>

            <p>Its not really Microsofts fault if a couple of "techs" changed something and caused the boot error. The question should be, why did they leave the computer in such a un-usable state in the first place. ?&nbsp; A good Tech wouldn't do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer Mr Happy posted is one of the first things to try.</p>
<p>Since you cant boot from the DVD, then you may have a <span><strong>UEFI</strong>&nbsp; BIOS. If you have this will be causing the non-booting from DVD or USB Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>What you can look for is turn off the computer fully ( not just restart). Now start it, look very carefully along the bottom of the screen, you should see a quick flash of what F Key to press to enter the boot menu ( this is different to setting the
 boot in the BIOS), some common keys are F5, F12, or ESC.&nbsp; You have to look close as it generally only flashes for a second or two, and you have about the same amount of time to press the correct F Key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You haven't said what the make of the computer is, different manufactures use different F keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Assuming it flashes, press the correct key, if it doesn't flash the key, then try each of the above mentioned one at a time, shut down try the next and hopefully you'll get the menu. You may need to try several times.
</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have the boot menu, use the arrow keys to move and select the DVD drive, follow what ever instructions it gives to select it, then you should boot to the DVD and run the repair as Mr Happy posted.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck.</span></p>

            <p>I respect your reply&nbsp; Mr Delany and I do understand its not Microsofts fault that a couple of techs changed it. However where Im from in&nbsp;health care we are a team and we stand by the name we work under. If Microsoft is hiring techs that leave work unfinished
 or have the attitude "its not my job" and they are unhappy with what they do or who they do it for maybe they shouldnt be in that field? And if thats the case I look further as to why Microsoft is hiring techs that dont like what they do?? Does Microsoft not
 understand how it refelcts on them with the people they hire????</p>
<p>It is an hp pavilion dv7 notebook BIOS is InsydeH20 Rev 3.5 last night I had to run hard disk check and it passed I ran memory tests and they passed start up test again passed. I am somewhat tech say but not as good as the folks in Microsoft I am sure so
 I was walked through a lot of it. From my end I'm not sure what other options I have to get rid of the recycling inaccessible boot devise we will restart your computer error. I tried esc and my options are</p>
<p>Startup Menu</p>
<p>F1 system information</p>
<p>F2 system diagnostics</p>
<p>F9 Boot device options (tried this all of the options did not work)</p>
<p>F11 system recovery (which does not work at all)</p>

            <p>So booting from DVD you never saw the 'Press any key to boot from CD or DVD ..' screen, white text at the top of a black screen ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The media creation tool can create to USB so perhaps run that again and look at the options for USB with a suitable size USB (8GB) that you can blank inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have&nbsp;an ISO downloaded that can be put on a USB as bootable via <a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rufus</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Options are far as I know for INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE, repair via the option I mentioned or options other perhaps people can perhaps suggest (or ones I can think of), Or re-installing Windows from DVD \ USB.</p>
<p>And thanks to the other posters all good advice and ideas in my opinion, keep em coming.</p>

            Yes I did and I was told to hit the space bar twice again same result in the recycling of inaccessible boot device. I was told i needed a 4GB USB but I need to go out and purchase an 8 which I will do now and thank you soooo much for the link to Rufus
 I wil try that as well.

            <p>Not going to quote two posts :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fully agree if MS are hiring techs who don't care they shouldn't be doing that job. Makes me wonder what MS are doing hiring clowns when theres plenty of knowledgeable and helpful people about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting the Press any key on the DVD boot, try the Enter key instead, some computers can be really fussy (read as awkward pain in&nbsp; the you know where)&nbsp; Otherwise yep, try the bootable USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll get it sorted, just may take a bit of time.</p>

<h2>            Floating text formatting palette missing in Word version 15.23 &#40;Office 365&#41;</h2>
                    I have Office 365 installed on two Mac computers. In both instances the floating text formatting palette has disappeared in Word. To clarify on what I'm referring to, it is the smaller version of the formatting toolbar that appears when you select a word
 or words. It was there at one time, I'm not sure what may have caused it to disappear.&nbsp;

I can‚Äôt find the Formatting Palette</a>, we can see that the Formatting Palette, which was in Toolbox in earlier versions, is not available in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 and higher version. The solution is finding commands on the ribbon.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            gracenote an copying problems</h2>
                    i've jus got round to buying a laptop (brand new) and i have a n95 8gb. i've had the pc suite installed and have all the other apps as well, msgin, backing up etc..... all of these work fine except the nokia music manager programme. well it loads up and
 lets me put music in the library. what i have problems with is a) the gracenote isnt working and it wont find the names of the tracks and, b) when i go to convert the tracks, which works fine, it wont let me copy any of my music and always, always comes up
 with an alert which just says, wait for it, "unknown error". what is that about? it wont even tell me whats wrong. now i've got around the gracenote problem by jus copying my music to WMP and then using music manager just search my laptop for music. its a
 new phone and when i finally got a laptop the 1st thing i wanted to do was get sum music on my phone. i've had nokia's b4 and used pc suite and got music on them far easier than this. its a joke as the laptop is brand new and the n95

<h2>            Nokia N8 Charging Issue</h2>
                    Is there any solution for the charging issue on Nokia N8? I even updated my N8 but the result is still the same.. The moment chargers pin is plugged in.. It shows... ''Unplug the charger to save energy'' and when the battery drains its next to impossible
 to charge it again.. Its truly frustrating.. I even tried to charge it using the USB Port when the battery drained.. But the result was still negative.. No signs or indications of charging!!!

            hi mate, have you tried reinstalling the current firmawre thru Nokia Suite at all? failing that, a hard reset is in store, predicating a visit to your nearest Nokia Care location for inspection.

<h2>            How to copy SMS Messages from Nokia E51</h2>
                    
<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a NOKIA E51 phone.<br />
<br />
I am transferring my SIM card to a new NOKIA E71.<br />
<br />
I have dozens of SMS messages (in several folders) on my Nokia E51.<br />
<br />
I dont want to lose them. I'd much rather keep them.<br />
<br />
<strong>How do I transfer these messages (and folders) onto my new E71 ?</strong><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I cant see any way to store them on the SIM card itself.<br />
<br />
Or is there a way?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes, I tried Nokia Suites</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to copy all the messages from my Nokia E51 onto my laptop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stored them in a folder on the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the messages were stored with the extension&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; <strong>VMG</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I cannot find the procedure needed to copy these messages from my laptop to my new Nokia E71 !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia Suite seems to have only one feature :&nbsp; <strong>IMPORT TEXT MESSAGES.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to use this feature,&nbsp; it required that the messages themselves be in format&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>.CSV</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (??)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, naturally, I renamed my text messages to&nbsp; .CSV</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, this did not help.&nbsp; Nokia Suite did not copy them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next,&nbsp; I simply opened the File Manager in Nokia Suite, and then <strong>Drag-Dropped</strong> the text messages onto my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the messages were stored in some obscure place on my phone :&nbsp; File System, Documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From here, I was neither able to open them,&nbsp; nor transfer them to my Message Inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No idea what to do next&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have SYNCED the messages from your OLD phone with Nokia Suite.. Disconnect the OLD phone and connect the NEW phone. Go to Nokia Suite--&gt;Messaging and Click INBOX at the top ..&nbsp;Now select ALL and Drag-an-Drop again to INBOX folder next to the phone
 icon at the bottom.Similarly select all messages in SENT folder at the top and drop them to SENT folder at the bottom .. Now check whether you get to open / see the messages in the new phone. But, I doubt whether the attributes attached to the messages in
 various other folders will stay intact !!</p>

<p>I did not SYNC from the beginning&nbsp; (maybe I should have)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I explained : when I opened my Inbox in Nokia PC Suite,&nbsp; I simply used Copy-Paste.&nbsp; (I highlighted all the messages,&nbsp; copied them, and then pasted them onto my laptop)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, now, my messages are stuck on my laptop,&nbsp; and I have no way of transferrring them onto my new Nokia E71</p>

As I stated already, I did not use Backup, because it focused only on the main Text Folders, and ignored other My Folders<br />

I used Copy-PAste<br />

    <title>Office 365 solution to MS Access database with Sharepoint List Tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle love  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 solution to MS Access database with Sharepoint List Tables</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>We have recently rolled out Office 365 business in our company. Previously/currently my work group had created and Access front end linked to SharePoint list as the data source.</p>
<p>We were using VBA in access to sweep an Outlook inbox and read Email data into a SharePoint list with additional columns we used to categorize these emails into further sub categories.</p>
<p>There were two email formats, from different sources, about equipment issues. These are automatically generated from other business systems. Using VBA regular expressions and other VBA string functions we would sweep the subjects and bodies of the emails
 to populate standard fields like serial number, type, location, owner, incident number, etc. There was logic in the VBA to ensure duplicates would not be entered so multiple users could import from their individual inboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is if this functionality can be automated now that Office 365 and OneDrive have been rolled out. Is it possible to create a flow from outlook directly to SharePoint or possibly another data storage method with the same logic applied and where
 to start. Access seems to be phasing out in favor of PowerApps, which would be a much better option for what we are currently doing and seems to have a much simpler user interface, but I am unable to figure out how to replicate the VBA code from Access to
 a flow or something similar. Can someone point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>I don't know if this is an answer to your question. Literally, earlier today I came across a reference to a new "Office 365" tool called MS Graph.&nbsp; It is not what you think.&nbsp; After a trivial scan of the tool, I
<em>THINK</em> it may be able to do what you want. Here are some links about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>Office- MS Graph- In the Beginning: PowerShell, EWS, and PnP ‚Äì</span></strong><span><a href="https://www.petri.com/exploring-office-365-graph-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.petri.com/exploring-office-365-graph-explorer</a><strong>
<br />
</strong>However good PowerShell is at automating common administrative tasks, it does not handle access to content. To close this gap, Exchange Web Services (EWS) handles programmatic access to data in user mailboxes. SharePoint also supports PowerShell, but
 the coverage of the SharePoint PowerShell module is less comprehensive and powerful than its Exchange counterpart. For this reason, the SharePoint development community built the SharePoint PnP (<a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Patterns
 and Practice</a>) initiative. PnP is an excellent choice for developers who want to extend SharePoint functionality. F</span><span>or programmatic access, Microsoft‚Äôs focus is clearly on a set of REST-based APIs for a common access approach to all manner of
 Office 365 data from Exchange and SharePoint to Teams and Planner.<br />
Collectively, the APIs are the Microsoft Graph, a single API to interact with Office 365 data via multiple endpoints. An endpoint is something like mail, contacts, calendar, or groups.
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>Microsoft hopes that programmers will <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
use the Microsoft Graph</a> to build new forms of applications that take a more holistic view of the data available to a user rather than the traditional stovepipe view bounded by a single application. The capabilities available through PowerShell and the Microsoft
 Graph are very different. Where PowerShell deals with administrative tasks, the Microsoft Graph handles some administration but manipulating content is more important.</span></p>

    <title>Using Data Validation to create a dropdown menu that displays numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bkwsnx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Data Validation to create a dropdown menu  that displays numbers only in a range with text and numerical values</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a column in which A1:A100 contains a value based on information from another part of the workbook.<br />
<br />
Each cell contains either the text value "N/A" or a unique whole number.<br />
<br />
What I would like is to have a drop-down menu created that will list only the numerical values, in order from A1:A100, completely ignoring any cell with "N/A"<br />
<br />
I've tried combinations using INDEX, IFERROR, ISNUMBER and OFFSET but haven't been able to get just the output I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Since you want the numbers to appear in ascending order in the data validation list (minimising the use of spare columns), i have had to use an addin (Morefunc) to get the result.&nbsp; For downlaod and installing the addin in Excel 2010, refer to point 4
 onwards at the following link - <a href="http://www.ashishmathur.com/extract-data-from-multiple-cells-of-closed-excel-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ashishmathur.com/extract-data-from-multiple-cells-of-closed-excel-files/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have downloaded and installed the addin, try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I have assumed that data is in range A1:A10</p>
<p>2. In cell F2, enter this formula and copy down</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(VSORT($A$1:$A$10,$A$1:$A$10,1),SMALL(IF(ISNUMBER(VSORT($A$1:$A$10,$A$1:$A$10,1)),ROW($A$1:$A$10)),ROW(1:1)),1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VSORT is the function of the Morefunc addin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. In cell G2, go to Data&nbsp; &gt; Validation &gt; List.&nbsp; in the Source box, enter this formula</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=OFFSET($F$2,COUNT($A$1:$A$10)-1,0,-COUNT($A$1:$A$10),1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can use your newly created @outlook.com account as an Alias of your Hotmail account. However,
<span>it is too risky for us to take the steps and you may not necessarily get it back in case someone else takes it before you. In short, you bear the risk of losing the alias name and the account name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>To give you an overview of the steps, please refer to the link below:</span></span></p>

    <title>Save Text Messages to SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ventalco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save Text Messages to SD Card</h2>
                    Hello there,<br />
<br />
I am planning to buy a Nokia 5310<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.yournextmobile.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/nokia_5310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yournextmobile.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/nokia_5310.jpg</a><br />
because I really like the Design, and the music functions.<br />
<br />
But one thing that is really necessary is being able to save and backup alot of text messages. (outbox inbox, everything) This Nokia has an sd slot,<br />
<br />
It would be great if there was a function on the phone itself, or from other software, that would allow me to automaticly save the messages to the SD card. And ofcourse also viewable on Pc later on.<br />
<br />
If its not possible on this phone, it would be great if you could give me some phones that can.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            Hi ventalco<br />
<br />
You need to be looking at such as "N" Series S60 devices for features such as this.

            I forgot to mention that if I can use Voip (skype preferred) that it would be a big plus,<br />

<br />
This seems like a really nice phone for me,<br />
<br />
(and if I could export those to my pc and import if I like)<br />
<br />
I tried looking for the models you suggested but I never had a nokia before so I am pretty new :)<br />
<br />
Could you tell me if its possible to save text messages on the SD of this phone, or how many on the internal memory.<br />
<br />
Or able to call people who are on skype, and if I can export and import text messages to the pc with bluetooth<br />
<br />

            Hi ventalco<br />
<br />
Please bear in mind that if a phone is network branded rather than generic SIM free version, some operators will disable Voip feature unfortunately.

            Ahh thanks for telling me that, I was planning to get one where I could sms to other countries alot.<br />
<br />
I will ask for information at a store, also do you know if I can have at least 200 inbox and around the same amount of outbox messages on this phone?<br />
<br />
And if there is a way to export and import them<br />
<br />
(oh and if it is possible to call people who are on Skype)<br />

Can I suggest that if you want to ask further specific questions about E51 that you post on "E Series devices" section instead as it will reach a wider audience?

<h2>            Serious disk error on Xendesktop and Server 2008</h2>
                    <p>Several users are complaining that they are getting "there is a serious disk error on file ~WRS{...numbers...}".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error randomly occurs here and there, doesn't seem to effect all users and also not every day. The error has been around for a while now. But just havent figured out a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have Word 2013. Versions 15.0.4867.1002 and also 15.0.4859.1001 so there doesn't seem to be a version thing.</p>
<p>Word is installed on a Server 2008 R2. User connects to it via Xendesktop.</p>
<p>Users have roaming profiles therefore I've thought of network problems? But then again we've got users who arent a Citrix users and have roaming profiles and report no troubles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing? Please help</p>

<p><br />
Why not use a summay row?</p>
<p>On row 22 enter a formula like this in B22:</p>
<p>=IF(COUNT(B10:B21),AVERAGE(B10:B21),"")</p>
<p>Copy across to K22</p>
<p>Then your MAX formula is simple:</p>
<p>=MAX(B22:K22)</p>
<p>And for the nth largest value:</p>
<p>=LARGE(B22:K22,n)</p>
<p>Where n = the nth value you want.</p>
