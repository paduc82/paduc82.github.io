<h2>            Mouse Problem in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro on my Pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 times out of 10, I have problems with the mouse not working fully.&nbsp; The pointer works just fine it moves around the screen, but the click action work some where. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way I seem to be able to get it working again is by signing out and then back in.&nbsp; This fixes it for a time, but then it fails again.<br />

            I installed Windows 10 on my ASUS netbook that is less than a year old, and was running Windows 8.1. The mouse pointer disappeared on startup. Repeated startups caused the mouse to appear but it was frozen. Once, some command key sequence I tried got the
 mouse working, and I called up a program, but the mouse soon froze again and when the computer was rebooted the program link was deleted from the desktop.<br />

                    I'm running Windows 7 64 bit on a Dell XPS laptop, plugged into a Dell SX2210 external monitor. &nbsp;Recenly purchased Datacolor Spyder4Pro color calibrator. &nbsp;Installed, works fine, goes through the entire calibrating process with no problems. &nbsp;But on the
 final screen, which is "Save" the created .icm profile to the c:\Windows\system32\spool\drivers\color directory, I get the following message:
<div><br />

<div>Any solutions? &nbsp;Why won't it save the profile. </div>

SaveProfileUsingCM.DeleteFile failed [C:Windows\System32\Spool\drivers\color\&lt;name&gt;.icm<br />
About all I have not done is invoke the command "net user administrator /active:yes"<br />
<br />
Changing the name of the profile has no effect. I have tried some ridiculous names and it is not likely that they all are under use by other software.<br />
<br />
I have disabled the relevant parts of my McAfee anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
I have explored file permissions and changed those of my original profile to include me as and administrator.<br />
<br />
I have followed the Datacolor instructions for completely deleting all traces of Spyder, including removing all profiles associated with my monitors from the Windows color manager.<br />
<br />
I have installed and run Spyder 5 Pro immediately after creating an entirely new user with administrator privileges and virtually no startup software.<br />
<br />
None of these things have had any effect.<br />
<br />
I first encountered this problem in mid June when I was still using Spyder 4 Pro. The problem has continued with Spyder 5 Pro. This suggests that it arises from a body of code which is common to both Spyder 4 and Spyder 5. Unfortunately I don't know enough
 to suggest what it might be.<br />
<br />
I have used Spyder products for many years without any problems, including Spyder 4. It is likely that the problem arises from a change made by other software. I have all sorts of software which updates itself automatically and it is possible that the problem
 arises from one of these. The only software I have which might want to take over part of the color management is iTunes, Adobe CC and Windows.<br />
<br />
It is possible that iTunes may have updated in the month before the problem started, but I don't really know. I don't think it will be Adobe CC as, as far as I can remember, there had been no updates for some months until the arrival of CC 2015 about a week
 ago. Finally, there is Windows. Windows updates almost very Thursday and sometimes on days in between. If any outside software is likely to have triggered this problem, Windows would be my chief suspect.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is the Microsoft Community post to which I am replying. This suggests that at least four other people have this problem. I was interested to note that the writer was using a Dell XPS laptop. I am using a Dell XPS 8300 desk top. Is this a coincidence?
 I've had no changes or updates from Dell as far as I know.<br />

<h2>            CA CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT upon issuance of certificate</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to issue a certificate using policy.inf from an enterprise Root CA in Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>
<p>I've connected the CA with HSM, and created the template for the cert issuance, such as getting the provider to be the HSM KSP.</p>
<p>I can issue some certs previously just fine with the template from GUI, but I tried issuing from policy.inf:</p>
[Version]<br />
Signature = "$Windows NT$"<br />
<br />
[NewRequest]&nbsp;<br />
Subject = "C=SG, O=Ezlink, CN=test-server.com"<br />
HashAlgorithm = SHA256<br />
KeyAlgorithm = RSA<br />
KeyLength = 2048<br />
Providername = "Safenet Key Storage Provider"<br />
KeyUsage = 0xa0<br />
MachineKeySet = TRUE&nbsp;<br />
<br />
[RequestAttributes]<br />
CertificateTemplate=ComputerHSM
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then when I submit, I get this error:</p>
<p>RequestId: 13<br />
RequestId: "13"<br />
Certificate not issued (Denied) Error Constructing or Publishing Certificate A c<br />
ertificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not tr<br />
usted by the trust provider. 0x800b0109 (-2146762487 CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT)<br />
Certificate Request Processor: A certificate chain processed, but terminated in<br />
a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider. 0x800b0109 (-2146<br />
762487 CERT_E_UNTRUSTEDROOT)<br />
Error Constructing or Publishing Certificate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, I can't issue anymore cert even with GUI. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated, thank you kindly,</p>
<p>

<h3> ÓùÓØÓ∫ÓøÔÇ Óî  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Stor.E Alu2 750GB external hard disk drive is not showing up.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I recently bought a new computer in which Windows 10 Enterprise x64 are installed. I have the aforementioned external HDD and I wanted to transfer some of my old files to my new computer. However, not only is my Toshiba ext. HDD not recognised, it
 does not <strong>even</strong> show up! The lamp of the Toshiba HDD shows that it works, but it cannot be shown up in Windows. Device Management does not list it under Hard Disks at all! It's like the external HDD doesn't exist, or isn't even connected!! I
 have tried using every USB port, even USB 3.0 (which I know is not compatible with), but nothing happens.
</p>
<p>Can anybody please give me an answer on what can I do for it to work?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us more information to help you further:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Have you assigned a drive letter for the external drive?</span></li><li><span>Does the drive get detected on connecting the same to another PC?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might be facing the above issue due to the unallocated letter for the drive. Unallocated drives are those whose drive letters are not allocated when initially partitioned or after formatting. You will be able to view the drive on your PC if you
 have allocated a drive name for the partition created. The drive will not be visible on the PC if you do not allocate a drive letter or a drive name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue may also occur due to some of the system components conflicting with Windows 10 operating system on the PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases will fix to enhance the performance of the system.
</span><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong> and select the top most search result<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>View all </strong>from left side panel of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Hardware and Devices, </strong>click on <strong>Advanced
</strong>option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After troubleshooting is completed, check for the status, close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to check if the device gets detected under
<strong>Disk management</strong> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Disk management</strong> option from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Check if WD external hard drive is visible in the window.</span></li><li><span>If visible, check if you can open the files in the <strong>File Explorer</strong> by right clicking and selecting
<strong>Open </strong>option form the context menu.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding. In answer for your 2 questions above:</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong>) No! Of course I have not! Every other computer I connect my external HDD assigns a drive letter automatically,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because it finds it immediately when I connect it! It follows the classic automatic "new hardware installing" process</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then, once the PC has found its drivers, I can access every file I have in it. The external HDD was not
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partitioned, nor formatted recently.</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>) Yes, it gets detected. At least to every operating system between Windows XP and Windows 7, including those two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the solutions you proposed me:</p>
<p><strong>M</strong><strong>1</strong>) Every time I do this it tells me that I must restart my PC in order for the changes to be in effect, but every time I
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restart my PC and then check, it tells me the same thing again and again and again.</p>
<p><strong>M</strong><strong>2</strong>) It does not get detected, of course. As I mentioned before, it is not detected at all. It is like it does not even exist,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; although the external HDD can draw power from the PC, as the LED light is flashing. I remind you that the
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; product is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Toshiba Stor.E Alu 2 750GB 2,5" external HDD.
</span></p>
<p>I will be waiting for further reply. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            4K Set top Box - Directv</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox&nbsp;One X; I also have DirecTV; My television is an LG webOS TV UH6350; my DirecTV receiver is Model&nbsp;C61K-700. When I run my DirecTV receiver model&nbsp;C61K-700 directly to the HDMI input on my&nbsp;television (LG webOS TV UH6350 ) I am able to get 4K support from DirecTV. However, when I Set up live TV with my Xbox One X by&nbsp;Connecting my&nbsp;set-top box HDMI output to the Xbox One HDMI input I no longer get 4k support. I receive an error stating my television does not support 4K and it automatically switches to 1080P. Does the XboxOne X Connection to my&nbsp;set-top box only support 1080P? Also, is anyone else experiencing&nbsp;this when they connect a 4K set box to the Xbox One X? &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Battlefield 4 won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t launch</h2>
                    
<p>So I installed BF4 to the xbone yesterday, just got it for xmas. Once it was done installing I then installed the China Rising DLC that came with it (took about an hour to download but that's never unusual). After waiting all that time I go to play the disc
 and it won't even launch the game. The only thing that comes up is a cityscape background and after a few seconds it goes back to the xbones home screen. I can't even go to the game's main menu or get an update from the game. Anybody know if there's an update
 that's suppose to fix this problem? Anybody know anything about this problem?!</p>

<p>G'day Sheeba! Let's get that game up and running for ya. Exit the game fully, then power cycle the console. Hold the console's power button for 5-10 seconds and allow it to shut down completely. Wait a full 30 seconds and then start it up again. Launch Battlefield
 4. Is there any change after that? Let us know if it gets beyond that starting screen!

<h2>            Set up xbox live for kids not working</h2>
                    
<p>Purchased XBox Live Gold for my kids.&nbsp; Trying to get them set up on the XBox 360 using their offline accounts.&nbsp; I created outlook.com emails for them, but when I try to connect them to Live it says:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Needs parents permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To create an account for a child, go to Xbox.com.&nbsp; Select Sign in, then Create a new Microsoft account.&nbsp; You'll need your parent to give you permission.</p>
<p>I already created his account and approved it with paying .50.&nbsp; In fact I've done it 3 times.&nbsp; The account never is enabled.&nbsp; Not sure who wrote this useless software but I'd sure like to know what magic I need to invoke to get it to work.</p>

<p>Same here.</p>
<p>Set up Xbox 360 for my son. Won't play some disc games e.g. Plants v Zombies unless I enter my c/card details. &nbsp;What's the go. Why should I need to do same to prove I'm an adult (parent)? &nbsp;You don't have to be an adult to have a c/card.</p>
<p>Checked internet status and all working fine, but keeps asking us to sign in to Xbox Live. &nbsp;Have done same but still doesn't work.</p>
<p>Hope somebody has an answer. &nbsp;Frustrating to have purchased games (discs) and you can't actually play them unless you go 'live' and/or need c/card details. &nbsp;May as well get my money back on the games as not entering my card details when have already paid
 for the damned games.</p>

<p>In order to use the account you created, you will need to download the account to the console -

support.xbox.com/.../download-your-xbox-live-profile-to-another-360-console</a> &nbsp;This will be different from your child's offline account. It is no longer possible to create a child account on the console, so you can't move their offline account to Live.</p>
<p>@Those having issues with Plants vs. Zombies - That is an online game. It requires a gold subscription in order to be played.</p>

<h2>            intermittent crashes&#47;reboots</h2>
                    <p>Starting today I have had 3 random powerdown/reboots that act like a quick power failed but the &amp;nbsp;home &amp;nbsp;power did not go out. The PC reboots immediately.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to examine the attached screen shot and tell me if it's Win10
 or maybe it's my powersupply? it's not the cpu overheating as I gave it a stress test and it did not shut down.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you‚Äôll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for posting the screenshot. That makes all the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crash is caused by the&nbsp;igfxCUIService2.0.0.0 service. That's the&nbsp;Intel HD Graphics Control Panel Service - the user interface that has the configuration settings for your Intel graphics chip. [igfx is Intel Graphics and CUI is Common User Interface.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a graphics card in addition to the graphics chip that came with your computer? If so, you should disable the Intel graphics chip - that's usually done in the BIOS or UEFI, whichever one your computer has. You shouldn't have both graphics systems
 operating at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a graphics card - if you're using the Intel graphics chip - you should check to see if it needs an updated driver for Windows 10. If it already has a Windows 10 driver, go to Device Manager and uninstall the driver. Then restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not likely that Windows 10 caused your problem. Upgrading an operating system is very complicated - no matter who's doing it - so complications do happen.</p>

            <p>thank you for the reply. No, I do not have a separate graphics card and I recently did install the "upgraded" Intel chip set drivers. I installed the ones from my Asus motherboard days before and had problems so googled new drivers and installed them. I
 will take your advice and advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean it will revert back to Microsoft generic driver?</p>
<p>

            <p>the auto reboots started Aug 20. On Aug 19 I installed a 10 yr old Epson scanner driver that does not work (also had problems on Win 7 but "sorta" worked sometimes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Aug 17 I installed the drivers you request I disable. &nbsp;Is it possible the Epson driver is the problem? But then if I'm not tying to run the scanner, that driver would be inactive where the graphics driver is always active. I will disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the subject of my Epson Perfection 1200 Photo scanner - at least 12 yrs old, maybe 15 - am I just out of luck on this? Epson has no drivers after XP. &nbsp;Does MS not have a generic driver Win 10??? &nbsp;I can still use it with Win7 but have to reboot for each
 use. I get one run before the OS think's it's not connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I just disabled the driver but now my graphics are screwed up and act like there is no driver at all. It reverted to a basic generic low res driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the original Win10 driver that was there right after the upgrad? it was working ok then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apparently bad driver I installed just before the crashing started came as an Asus download when I searched for Win 10 drivers.<br />

            <p>In looking at the attached it appears the current vga drivers came in with Win10. I was mistaken, I did not include these with the recent Asus chipset and audio dvr update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm or deny from below that this dvr is the generic MS Win 10 dvr? &nbsp;8/7 is the date I installed Win10 over Win 7. IS THERE ANY GOOD REASON I SHOULD BOTHER TO UPGRADE TO NEWER INTEL/ASUS GRAPHICS DRIVERS? Not a gamer, just routine graphics needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It keeps crashing while I type this proving its not the old Epson dvr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok, just made some changes so am back editing this to see if it crashes. I totally removed the old graphics dvr below then did a reinstall letting windows search for a dvr. It found one and installed it. &nbsp;It's a different one than before. so far so good!
 When I did the earlier Asus dvr update I installed the chipset and sound dvr. would new graphics dvrs have come in with that too? So far no crash so I may be good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does &nbsp;that msg below mean where it says "requires further installation?". Again, the dvr below is now gone, deleted, removed and a new one is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>still crashing so not that graphics driver. maybe I need a different one? The service flagged is an artifact from PDF ConverterPro which I removed a few days ago. I just disabled the service to see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>could it still be a graphics driver issue? Is this pdf service a non-fatal issue?</p>

            <p>Hi, still crashing in spite of removing graphic driver, reinstalling what Windows found on the web and what I found on the Asus site for Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now trying the above but need clarification on something. After booting in safe mode, do I do the clean boot or are these 2 separate things to try? Once I do the clean boot, won't that undo safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've removed the drivers and apps installed just before this happened with no improvement. Is there a chance an MS update is not compatible with my Asus Z87m-plus motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step I'll replace the supposed Win10 chip and &nbsp;audio drivers with the Win7 versions on the motherboard CD. That was working fine originally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that I could type this in over 5 min in safe mode indicates that safe mode may disable the conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Exhausted all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphic card drivers and all other Win10 Asus motherboard drivers.

<p>I've removed the apps installed just before the crashes started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more ideas? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install another copy of Win10 to slowly load apps to see what breaks it but it's hung up on authentication. Any tricks to getting a 2nd Win10 installed?</p>

    <title>The network browser is not showing all connected devices on our - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The network browser is not showing all connected devices on our network.</h2>
                    <p>I've recently taken over an IT roll in our company, still learning as I'm going.&nbsp; The last guy set up automatic back-ups but directed them to back up onto the same hard drive that the original files are on (not sure what the point of that would be since
 back-ups are supposed to be in case of hardware failure).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the process of trying to fix this, we have a Buffalo NAS connected to our network that is set up for the majority of our documents. The NAS has another SSD in it that wasn't being utilized, so I figured I'd set that one up for back-up files, the only
 problem is the only way we can connect to the device is through existing shortcuts on our PC's, but the back-up software we are using (NovaStor) can't find devices through shortcuts, it has to find it through the network browser.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 32 PC's on our network, the network browser only shows a few PC's in the list.&nbsp; All computers have "Network Discovery" turned on.&nbsp; Can anyone explain to me why?&nbsp; I tried contacting Microsoft Support, but the virtual agent is useless and I scheduled
 a call back from an actual person but they never called, so basically Microsoft Support is completely useless/non-existant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using Windows 10, all computers are connected to the network by ethernet cable through a router and switches. All computers have no connection problems, but can't see all devices on the network.&nbsp; Occasionally all devices show in the list, but that
 only lasts for a couple days and the last time was before I took over this role, I check back daily to see if it's connected so that I can fix our back-up issue without having to move the files off of our main drive every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello JSV_450,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is for you. I'd be glad to answer your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new Skype on Android, we automatically set your status for you. For more information, you can check on this link
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34742/how-do-i-change-my-presence-status-in-the-new-skype?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for the Skype for Linux (5.3 is the latest version), we suggest you to use one device at a time for the Skype status issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>So I should use my phone only, and forget about Skype For Linux? The idea is you cannot set the status in Linux, I assume it thinks it knows better than me. The phone switches when away or if it disconnects due to low/no cell coverage. Then the conflict
 starts. Not me setting anything. The concept of "automatic" status is okay but you are kidding yourself if you do not think a manual override is not required. The user must be able to set this in Android, Windows, iOS, Mac and Windows. Skype used to have that,
 and needs to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the version of Skype for Linux, an update to the Preview version was installed. The current latest of that is
<span>8.6.76.57286. The S4L beta 5.3 was superseded by S4L beta 5.4, then by the preview. 8.6. The version you are mentioning is quite old.</span></p>

            Once it shows who wins, just left click on it (either White wins or the other option), you get a prompt asking "Would you like to play again?" If you select "play again" - that'll be playing same person.<br />

            Hey Glenn Austin,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
The game matches you with players from around the world by sending some computer information and a unique ID to Microsoft.
<br />
<br />
When a game ends, you can play the same person again. To play the same person again, make sure the person who you were playing the game with, is connected and agrees to continue playing the game.
<br />
<br />

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue. However, there could be several reasons why you are unable to connect to your Wi-Fi router on Windows 8.1 system. The firewalls (Windows or third party) generally obstruct
 the network connection, even after being disabled. It is, therefore, sometimes suggested to completely remove the security software with the help of its removal tool to resolve the connection-related issue. However, you should reinstall/update the security
 software after troubleshooting to reinstate system's security.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Other factors include a third party software conflict hindering the connectivity, corrupted wireless network adapters or misconfigured Windows settings for network discovery.</span></p>

<br />
<p>0x80200011&nbsp; BG_E_MISSING_FILE_SIZE<br />
The above return code relates to BITS and the use of a proxy server. Unless you're using a proxy server, then the issue is most likely related to the installed antivirus/security suite's use of&nbsp;a proxy to screen emails&nbsp;or the installed Version of the Windows
 Update Agent needs to be updated but it fails to do so.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb &gt; in the&nbsp;<em>Search programs and files</em> field type in&nbsp;<strong>cmd<br />
</strong>Under Programs, click on&nbsp;<strong>cmd</strong>.<br />
<br />
The Command Prompt window will open.<br />
At the prompt, type the below in exactly as written <strong>including</strong> the spaces, and then press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh winhttp show proxy</strong><br />
<br />
If no proxy is being used, the output will look like this</p>
<p>Current WinHTTP proxy settings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct access (no proxy server).</p>
<p>If the output differs from the above, then&nbsp;<strong>right</strong> click anywhere in the window and choose&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong><br />
<strong>Left</strong> click right before the C in Current and drag the white area so that includes the output text.<br />
Now&nbsp; <strong>right</strong> click on the window frame at the top next to C:\Windows\system32\cmd and choose&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong> &gt;<strong>Copy</strong><br />
<br />
Then paste the output into your reply, please.</p>
<p>Back in the Command Prompt window type in <br />
<strong>exit</strong><br />
press Enter. That closes the Command Prompt.</p>
<p>Also, please make another updating attempt from Windows Updates in the Control Panel.<br />
Click the Start orb &gt; in the Search programs and files field type in&nbsp; <strong>wuapp</strong><br />
Under Programs, click on wuapp.<br />
When Windows Updates opens click the Check for updates link in the left frame.<br />
When/if updating still fails, close Windows Updates.<br />
<br />
Now click the Start orb once more. In the Search field type in&nbsp; <strong>windowsupdate.log<br />
</strong>Under Programs, click on&nbsp; <strong>windowsupdate.log</strong><br />
Please copy and paste&nbsp;<strong>the last 50 or so lines</strong> of the WindowsUpdate.log into your reply.<br />
Be sure to&nbsp; <strong>include</strong> the output from the Command Prompt window concerning the use of a proxy, too, please.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to Disable Mediabuttons and use the regular F1-F12 keys - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Disable Mediabuttons and use the regular F1-F12 keys</h2>
                    <p>Heey everyone!<br />
</p>
<p>I have been struggling to use my F1-F12 keys as the buttons were set to default on mediasettings.</p>
<p>This meant that in my case, F1 would mute/unmute, F2 would lower the volume etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I like to play some games in which the F1-F12 keys are very important so of course this stressed me out. Especially since I could not find a solution. I tried several, SHIFT + FN, FN + ESC. FN + CAPSLOCK and they all didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw some threads that said I could change it in the BIOS. Guess what?! I had a different BIOS in which it didn't work! After chatting with HP tech-care it came to the conclusion I had to buy a new keyboard myself which, of course, I didn't like after spending
 over ‚Ç¨1000,- on a pc + monitor. So I ventured in the darkest corners of the internet (no just kidding, just googled and googled and googled).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND I FOUND A SOLUTION! So if you have experienced the problem and tried all options mentioned above without success, LOOK NO FURTHER!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ill go to this in a step-by-step solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Google AutoHotKey and download the software (might look sketchy but I dont see any problem with the software).</p>
<p>2. Install it</p>
<p>3. Go to your desktop and right-click -&gt; new -&gt; AutoHotKey Script (give it a name, make sure the name ends in ".ahk")</p>
<p>4. Right click the icon on your desktop and click "Edit script"&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Use the following script (just copy paste it to start with)</p>
<p>
</p><p>; F1 key by default, Fn+F1 is now Play/Pause</p>
<p>MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE::F1</p>
<p>F1::MEDIA_PLAY_PAUSE</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>; F2 key by default, Fn+F2 is now Mute/Unmute</p>
<p>VOLUME_MUTE::F2</p>
<p>F2::VOLUME_MUTE</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>; F3 key by default, Fn+F3 is now Volume Down</p>
<p>VOLUME_DOWN::F3</p>
<p>F3::VOLUME_DOWN</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>; F4 key by default, Fn+F4 is now Volume Up</p>
<p>VOLUME_UP::F4</p>
<p>F4::VOLUME_UP</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>; F5 key by default, Fn+F5 is now Media Prev</p>
<p>Media_Prev::F5</p>
<p>F5::Media_Prev</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I only needed these 5 keys so I stopped there. NOTE: these are my settings on my keyboard, you will have to link it to the media button, so this only works if your F1-F5 were attributed this way, if mute and volume down are switched for example, make
 sure this is switched in the script as well. Below is a list with the possible media buttons that are assigned to your F1-F12 keys.</p>
<p>

</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>7. Save the file (just press "save" , not "save as") and close it.</p>
<p>8. Double click the icon on your desktop.</p>
<p>9. PROFIT! You can now use your regular F1-FXX buttons, however you mapped them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it helped you and that you found this solution without raising your bloodpressure in anger :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Please start by testing your RAM:</p>
<p>I like Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . Obviously, you have to get the program from a working machine. You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. You want the pre-compiled bootable ISO (.zip). Unzip the file
 you download by double-clicking on it and drag the contents out. You will now have a file called memtest86+-4/00.iso (the version number may be different). You can delete the .zip file now. Put in a CD-R disc and start a third-party burning program such as
 Roxio, Nero, or the free <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> (unless you have Windows 7 which can burn .isos natively). You will need to burn the file as an image, not as data. Refer to your burning program's Help if you don't know how to do this.<br />
<br />
Leave the CD-R in your optical drive and restart your computer. When you restart the computer you will see messages:<br />
<br />
1. Possibly a message that says something like "Press F12 for temporary boot menu". If you have this message, press that function key. Use your arrow key to select the CD/DVD drive and the computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
2. If you don't see a message about a boot menu you will need to go into the BIOS to change the boot order. This message will say something like "Press F2 to enter Setup". Press that function key and you will enter the BIOS. Find the section about boot and
 change the boot order to CD/DVD drive first, hard drive second. Save your changes and exit Setup. The computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
The test will run immediately. You can remove the CD while the test is running. Then boot with the media you made (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let
 the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.</p>

            I'm not really sure what you're doing with the Guest account but it should not be used. It sounds like you've enabled Guest and then renamed it PC-Assistant. In any case, do not use the Guest account you see in the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 The Guest account is a special system account, not one meant for when you are feeling hospitable. It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Linux, Unix, and OS X for a reason.<br />
<br />
From TechNet:<br />
<br />
"The Guest account is intended for users who require temporary access to the system. However, if this account is enabled, a security risk may exist because an unauthorized user could gain anonymous access to the system through this account."<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978%28TechNet.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
So if you enabled Guest, disable it now and create a Standard/Limited (Vista, Windows 7,&nbsp; XP Pro/XP Home) for your visitors. Call the new user account something like "Visitor" or even "PC-Assistant". If you renamed Guest, name it back to "Guest" and then disable
 it.<br />
