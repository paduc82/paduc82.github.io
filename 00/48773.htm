<h2>            Deafult Gateway issues</h2>
                    I have a user on a dell laptop running windows7. When he starts up his computer, or has it on the dock, its fine. When it is off the dock it will sometimes lose connectivity--it still shows full bars, but no internet. Going to the Network and Sharing Center
 and clicking on the globe will run the troubleshooter and fix the problem--the issue is listed as "Default Gateway could not be found - Fixed"<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to prevent the issue in the first place?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>From your description I understand that you are
<b>receiving error message </b></span><span>"Default Gateway could not be found” when you off the docks.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To understand the issue better, please answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was it working fine earlier on this computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes on the computer before this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any other computer connected to the same network? If connected, are you able to access Internet on the other computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the mentioned methods:
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
<b>Manually assign the gateway settings.</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may manually assign the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine. Before assigning the IP address and the Default gateway
 manually, make a note of the IP address on the computer. </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To do this click on start button, in search box type cmd and hit enter and type ipconfig and press enter. This will display the IP address, make a note of it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In system tray, right click network icon. Choose Open Network and Sharing Center.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on Local Area Connection and click on Properties. Double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Example: Old Ip address is 192.168.0.1</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Let the Subnet mask and default gateway be the same.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Apply and Ok and restart the computer and verify if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>You may also try to contact the Router manufacturer and try to reset the router settings and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Also try to uninstall the network adapter from the device manager and restart the computer. Later allow Windows to install the generic drivers and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Before uninstalling the network adapter, I would suggest you to create a System Restore Point manually, so that in case, something goes wrong while performing these steps,
 you may always perform a System Restore.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Follow the steps below to uninstall and reinstall network adapter.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the start search box type 'devmgmt.msc' and press enter</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Device Manager, expand Network Adapters</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the installed network adapter and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer and reinstall the network adapter.</span></p>
<p><span>While uninstalling the device drivers make sure you place a check mark against "Delete the driver software for this device".</span></p>
<p><span>For reference:

            <p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>The issue has been known for some time, and turns out that some of the other users have it as well when they are on the wireless, with the same quick fix.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Was it working fine earlier on this computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know if this has always been an issue on the computer, or it was only noticed recently, but the computer works fine most of the time, and the issue is easily fixed when it happens. It is just a question of preventing the interruption<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes on the computer before this issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>I did not make any changes, and I doubt the user did, but given how this problem has been persist for a while, I don't know if we can uncover what if any changes were made.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have any other computer connected to the same network? If connected, are you able to access Internet on the other computer?</span></p>
<p><span>The company is on the network, and no one has had any issues at the same time, although some other users have reported a similar problem with a similar fix. I myself sit two doors down from the first user, and I'm always on the wireless (my hard line
 is saved for other laptops I'm building) and I haven't had any issues myself, and certainly not at the same time.<br />

            I&nbsp; have updated the wireless drivers, and that seems to have fixed the problem.<br />

<h2>            Print spooler fails, code 7034 &#34;The Print Spooler service terminated unexpectedly&#34;. disk error</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I had a disk cluster go bad in the middle of localspl.dll</p>
<p>I've tried a lot of things, but first a recap of my system and the problem.</p>
<p>Win 7 Ultimate, OEM, 64-bit.</p>
<p>No new printers in the last week.&nbsp; Print was working fine last night.&nbsp; This morning - print spooler is not working and system clearly having a problem.&nbsp; Ran a ScanDisk with sector scan and repair options both checked.&nbsp; Found one error in the middle of the
 file indicated above.&nbsp; Since then I've tried everything I can think of and stuff that I've found on the internet.</p>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<p>Replacing localspl.dll (via another system) from the copy in winsxs (found via search).&nbsp; Was the same version and size.&nbsp; There is no dllcache and if there is a similar animal on Win 7, I don't know about it.</p>
<p>Before that I tried SFC /scannow</p>
<p>I've dumpped everything from the spooler.</p>
<p>I've tried the fix-its, but I can't seem to find one that will work on Win 7, 64 bit.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter is useless - can't even tell the service failed in the middle of it's operation.</p>
<p>I hate the thought that I'm going to have to scratch re-install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;rant&gt;I can't even do an upgrade in place because of the stupid inability (Microsoft shame) to do an upgrade in place from an OEM disc.&nbsp; Come on, that disc could check to see if it was the same version and do it - the code already exists - argh!!!!&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
<p>I need some ideas please,</p>
<p>-greg</p>

<h2>            Heroes of might and magic 3, doesn&#39;t work properly on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I first install the game, usually everything works fine, until the moment, when I try to play multiplayer mode. After I start multiplayer game with my friend I am not able to move my hero anywhere ( I don't have movement path) , I am not able to end
 my turn ( the button is disabled) I am able only to enter the castle and buy troops. After that when I try to play single player the same things is happening. Bellow is the screen that I see. Before I used to play the game normaly on windows 7 and older.</p>

<h2>            Scrolling with touchpad sluggish and intermittenly unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>For about a week or so, two finger scrolling has been a pain.&nbsp; It seems to be affected by content loading.&nbsp; It's present in all browsers and some apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I'll be scrolling, then it'll just kind of get "stuck", it won't scroll much at all, then it'll start scrolling again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought that the 2 finger swipes weren't getting registered, then I tried the "auto scroll".&nbsp; I middle clicked in the page and began auto scrolling down, and it was still happening.&nbsp; It would just lag from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I noticed that it seems to correspond with pages with infinite scroll. Like Facebook.&nbsp; This wasn't happening at all before, and it just started about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running windows 10 AU on a dell xps 15 (9530).&nbsp; I've updated all the drivers.&nbsp; From both the Dell website, and the synaptics website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scrolling with the touchscreen works fine, it's just with the touchpad.</p>

 made sure I had the pre-requistes, followed the steps as outline on microsoft site,downloaded SP3 again and installed.&nbsp; It would only restart in in safe mode.&nbsp; I've tried everything, no matter waht I do, XP SP3 causes the computer to restart only in safe mode.
 I am totally frustrated. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>What is causing XP SP3 to only start in safe mode anfter installing? What can I do to fix this?</p>

    <title>File explorer working slow in tiles view - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File explorer working slow in tiles view</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new computer last week and I installed a clean installation of Win 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>My new machine has 16GB of memory, a Core i7 Haswell processor and a gaming motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mapped some network drives from a NAS I have.</p>
<p>Whenever I open a directory that has a large number of files on one of the drives, the file explorer becomes unresponsive and takes ~20 seconds until it becomes responsive again. Even when I let it load all the files and their thumbnails, once I go back
 and reopen the same folder I get this slowness.</p>
<p>My old computer (4GB of memory, Core i3, and a cheap motherboard) has the same drivers mapped from the same NAS on the same router on a Windows 7 and I have no problems with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it to be a well known issue, but none of the solutions I found did any good.</p>
<p>I do get a much better performance when changing the layout from "Tiles" to "List".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried (and didn't work):</p>
<p>1. Change the folder options to display icons instead of thumbnails.</p>
<p>2. Remove the status bar.</p>
<p>3. Create a new user.</p>
<p>4. Reset the file index (delete and re-index).</p>
<p>5. Stop indexing on those folders.</p>
<p>6. Stop windows defender from scanning the network drives.</p>
<p>7. Check the updates (can't uninstall&nbsp;KB2919355 and&nbsp;KB2962409 is installed already).</p>
<p>8. Change folder content type optimization.</p>
<p>9. Turn off network discovery.</p>
<p>10. Delete the icon cache.</p>
<p>11. Reboot. Lots of reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one has any idea of anything else I can try? This is becoming very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>I got the same message, but after I entered my credit card information it worked. Although you're not paying anything it is still required. To enter credit card information do the following: 1. Hit the xbox button 2. got to settings and select "Account Management"
 3. Under "Your Billing Option" select "Manage Payment Options" 4. enter Credit card info 5. Try getting the free xbox live again.</p>
<p>It worked for me, and I hope could Help others with my problem.</p>

<p>Any subscription you buy on the console will automatically turn on Auto Renew. In order for that to work, there must be a credit card on the account it can charge when the account auto renews. &nbsp;Even though it is a free month, you must have a credit card
 on the account to start the subscription.</p>
<p>When that free one month is finished it will renew into a paid 1 month subscription and charge the payment method you added.</p>

<h2>            Multi Boot options&#58;  Where is the Boot Manager&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the future I hope to run Win7 64bit, XP 32bit and another OS. &nbsp;So a triple boot. &nbsp;I can use 3 small SSD's or I can triple partition 2 small SSD's and run them in Raid 0. &nbsp;I'm attracted to the latter because of the performance increase.
 &nbsp;I'm wondering where the Boot Manager is stored and can I put it on all 3 drives if I go with that scenario. &nbsp;I'm looking for more control I guess. &nbsp;Mechanical control is far superior to software control but isn't always available unfortunately. &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><strong>Stop Windows Media Center Services from Start Up<br />
Excerpt :</strong></p>
<p>Run <strong>MSConfig</strong> (System Configuration) and go to <strong>Startup</strong> tab. Uncheck the item entries which has the<strong>ehome</strong> as path to the command, such as ehTray.exe. This will prevent MCE related services to be startup up.
 To be safe, you still need to disable WMC services as above<br />

<h3> jim99owr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to access printers over the network </h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Network Printers are seen as "Offline" but are all connected with IP addresses. &nbsp;However I'm using Windows 7 and can't access them over the network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer troubleshooter says that the printer is turned off.&nbsp; Clearly it is on (I can see it next to me).&nbsp; I'm on a home network.&nbsp; It worked several days ago.&nbsp; I can print to it from another&nbsp;PC in the same room&nbsp;(it uses XP) over the same network.&nbsp; I've
 restarted both the printer and the PC with Windows 7 but it still won't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have another PC in the same room using Vista.&nbsp; It will not print to the printers either &amp; indicates it cannot communicate with the printer.&nbsp; Again, it used to work fine.&nbsp; I'm
 not sure what has changed.&nbsp; The printers are a HP LaserJet 3390&nbsp; and an HP Color&nbsp;LaserJet CM1017 MFP.</p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try these steps and let me know if it fixes your problem:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1: Temporarily disable any security software installed on your computer and check if that makes any
 difference.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Disable antivirus software:</span></span></strong><span><span>
 &nbsp;<br />
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Make sure you turn-on the security software
 and Windows Firewall later.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong><span><span><strong>Update
 the drivers for your printer.</strong><br />
<br />
Refer these links for more information:<br />
<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</strong> <br />
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></strong><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Find and install printer drivers<br />
</span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-and-install-printer-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Find-and-install-printer-drivers</span></span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3: Restart the print spooler service.<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.<br />
a. Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type administrative tools, and then click Administrative Tools.<br />
b. Double-click Services.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
c. Right click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
d. On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
e. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,<br />
type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If nothing helps, then manually add the printer to local port and check.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Step 4: Manually add printer to local port.<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span><span><span>a. Go to control panel and click on Devices and printers.<br />
b. Choose Add a printer and then select Add a local printer. Click on Create a new port. The default in the drop down box is Local Port. Do not change that.<br />
&nbsp;c. Click Next.<br />
A dialogue box will appear asking for you to enter a port name. Type in the \\computer name\printer name .<br />
d. Type your computer name and the printer name (\\PC\printer name)<br />
e. Click on ok and exit.</span></span></p>

<h2>            duplicate desktop screen &#34;stacked&#34; on first desktop on one monitor after using dual monitors Netflix on television</h2>
                    
<p>duplicate desktop screen "stacked" on first desktop on one monitor ---- came about after using dual monitors (Netflix on television extended</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer kept crashing after I had hooked up a dual monitor.&nbsp; The second monitor was my television, playing a Netflix movie while I also used my computer to work on.&nbsp; After separating the two, I kept crashing for a few days.&nbsp; I tried to remove the second
 monitor from the display settings, but cannot figure out how to do this if it is at all possible, but I do believe this is the problem and the cause for the double desktop view on my computer now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to confirm what this problem is for certain, and/or instruction how to fix it if you already know what may cause this problem.&nbsp; Any assistance at all would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I have been trying to figure this out for two days....</p>
<p>Of note, in the heat of the Las Vegas area, I was thinking it may be due to overheating, but I actually cooled it in the refrigerator for a short time and restarted it, but still have the problem.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point, computer proceeded to restart....got past the screen where Windows XP is loading then received this!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may refer these methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.
<strong>For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:<br />
&nbsp;1. Click Start. <br />
&nbsp;2. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
&nbsp;3. Type at the command prompt <strong>CHKDSK /P</strong> and press ENTER to scan the disk.<br />
&nbsp;4. Then type <strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then&nbsp;press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.<br />
Once chkdsk completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I did everything but 3 and 4.&nbsp; Can't move the card.&nbsp; Windows Update is demanding I install Windows 10 before it'll let me update anything else.&nbsp; Of course, that kills Windows Media Center and there are no alternatives that support
 DRM.&nbsp; I'd upgrade to Windows 8.1, but I figure I'd have to pay for that.&nbsp; Windows 10, ironically, is free.</span></p>

<h2>            Side bar in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 has this annoying side bar with some features like search, devices, and settings on it.&nbsp; Every time I am doing something in a program and I get too close to the right side it will pop up and block whatever it is I am trying to do.&nbsp; How do I
 turn off the stupid thing?&nbsp; I hate it!&nbsp; Also, is there a way to leave on the bar with the X to close it all the time?

            <p>The sidebar you're referring to is called the <strong>Charms Bar. </strong>If you'd like to disable it, follow
<strong>these </strong>settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click the taskbar in the desktop (the strip along the bottom that shows your open programs), and select
<strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>2. In the window that appears, select the <strong>Navigation </strong>tab.</p>
<p>3. Uncheck <strong>When I Point to the Upper-right corner, show the charms. </strong>
That'll disable the charms bar. You might also want to play around with these settings if you'd like.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1) Via the desktop version, the call doesn't come through, stops immediately, and then gives the notification 'missed call'. Restarting the program doesn't help</p>
<p>2) Via the webversion (chromee), the call rings one time, then stops and I get the notification that the call is not included in my subscription, even though:</p>
<p>a) it is covered under my subscription (I call this number monthly)</p>
<p>b) skype even gives the notification 'covered by subscription' under the number itself in both the desktop version and the web browser</p>
<p>c) I have plenty of minutes left under my subscription</p>

    <title>Sculpt keyboard battery drain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g.o.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt keyboard battery drain</h2>
                    <p>I love the sculpt keyboard and I have three of them across work and home. One of them suffers from battery issues. It practically eats the battery in a couple of months while my work keyboard can run more than a year of 5day/week use without requiring a
 replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried keyboard/computer combinations and I'm somewhat sure that it's the keyboard. I believe it requires a repair but I'm not even sure if it's covered under warranty or Microsoft offers repair services for accessories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have the same problem?</p>

            ? How would that help?&nbsp; The system hidden desktop.ini files are used to store specific data about a given folder.&nbsp; Those really aren't unexpected and troubleshooting really isn't going to do anything to them.&nbsp; You can delete them if they bother you.

            If the desktop.ini file shows up on the desktop, it means the option&nbsp;"Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)" is unchecked in Folder Options Control Panel, or the Desktop.ini file(s) lost the "S" (System) attribute.

<p>Although I do not have the solution for you, I will chime in to say this annoys me as well. The answers provided to your question are typical, unrelated and divergent from&nbsp;the issue so clearly stated. It's really funny to see that MS suggested virus scanning
 as the end all answer, as usual. I'm guessing your intelligent enough to figure out "they" are going to do nothing and you (we all) just have to put up with it.</p>

            <p>I doubt there is much you can do about it, but Hotmail apparently is ignoring Internet standards, particularly RFC2821 (<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2821.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2821.html</a>), which
 states:</p>
<p>Verbs and argument values (e.g., "TO:" or "to:" in the RCPT command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and extension name keywords) are not case sensitive, with the sole<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; exception in this specification of a mailbox local-part (SMTP<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Extensions may explicitly specify case-sensitive elements).&nbsp; That is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a command verb, an argument value other than a mailbox local-part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and free form text MAY be encoded in upper case, lower case, or any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; mixture of upper and lower case with no impact on its meaning.&nbsp; This<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; is NOT true of a mailbox local-part.&nbsp; The local-part of a mailbox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MUST BE treated as case sensitive.&nbsp; Therefore, SMTP implementations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; MUST take care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts.&nbsp; Mailbox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; domains are not case sensitive.&nbsp; In particular, for some hosts the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; user "smith" is different from the user "Smith".&nbsp; However, exploiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes interoperability<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and is discouraged.<br />
<br />
So you can ask here in the Hotmail vorum (you are in the wrong place), but I doubt it will help much:&nbsp;
