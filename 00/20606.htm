<h2>            Extra blank line between footnote line and first footnote of Report &#40;business design&#41; template</h2>
                    I downloaded Report (business design) template, and on the second page where I'm typing the body of the report, I want to add a footnote. When I add it, an extra blank line appears between footnote line and first footnote. How do I stop that extra blank
 line from being inserted with the footnote. Thanks in advance.

            Somebody made a mistake when creating this template, by including an extra paragraph mark in the footnote separator. To remove it (you only have to do this once to fix all the footnotes in the document):<br />
<ul>
<li>Click View &gt; Draft, and turn on nonprinting characters if they aren't already showing.</li><li>Click References &gt; Show Notes.</li><li>In the top bar of the Footnotes pane, set the dropdown to Footnote Separator.</li><li>Click the Reset button.<br />
</li><li>Change the dropdown to Footnote Continuation Separator, and click the Reset button again. (This would affect only footnotes that are so long that they get split onto a second page.)<br />
</li><li>Switch back to Print Layout view.</li></ul>
<p>If you plan to use the template again, you'll have to open the template itself as a document, and make the same changes there. That will prevent the problem from appearing in new documents based on the template.<br />

    <title>Nokia PC Suite support for Outlook and Thunderbird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> altair8801  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia PC Suite support for Outlook and Thunderbird</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am currently using the Microsoft Outlook 2007 combined with Nokia PC Suite to synchronize the contents of the Outlook with my Nokia N73 smartphone. I am now considering to switch e-mail client from Microsoft Outlook to the Mozilla Thunderbird. So my question
 is then, is Nokia PC Suite compatible with Mozilla Thunderbird?<br />
<br />
I have in fact already installed Thunderbird, but it is not available as an option anywhere in the settings for Nokia PC Suite. All I can find in the Nokia PC Suite settings is a tab called "Microsoft Outlook" where I can choose the different Outlook profiles
 or change settings. In my humble opinion there should be a new tab added called "Thunderbird" or similar right next to the "Microsoft Outlook" tab in the settings for Nokia PC Suite after installing another e-mail client such as the Mozilla Thunderbird.<br />
<br />
I know that there is this option to choose what e-mail client to use upon installing Nokia PC Suite, where I have chosen Outlook. Does this mean that I have to reinstall Nokia PC Suite to get this choice to choose e-mail client to use? If I do reinstall Nokia
 PC Suite, will I even get to this option at all? Since I am only reinstalling Nokia PC Suite and it is already configured once to be used with Outlook, I'm thinking that maybe this option will not even appear upon reinstalling Nokia PC Suite.<br />
<br />
I don't have a clear memory of it but I think I once reinstalled Nokia PC Suite for some reason and I was not presented with this option to choose e-mail client as the first time I installed it. So this may require complete uninstallation and deletion of files
 and Windows registry for Nokia PC Suite, and then a fresh installation of it to get to this window where to choose e-mail client.<br />
<br />
Even when and if I get to that window, it's no guarantee that I will be able to choose Thunderbird even thou it's installed. Why? Because I know from experience that commercial and proprietary software like Nokia PC Suite tends to only support the industry
 standard platforms and systems and applications, or de-facto industry standards like the extensively used Microsoft Outlook and other Microsoft products. I know by experience that such software as Nokia PC Suite love to lick Microsoft's **bleep**. Don't you
 think?... or don't you know? You disagree? Well lay it on me, tell me what you think!<br />
<br />
I would love to be able to synchronize my mobile phone with my computer, even if I may use a Linux or other nix-like operating system. But if Nokia PC Suite doesn't even support e-mail clients other then Microsoft Outlook, such as the Thunderbird, then it's
 probably too much to ask for a Linux support for Nokia PC Suite. Or is it?... does Nokia PC Suite support Linux?...

            There's no point in spending time trying to get Nokia PC Suite (or Nseries PC Suite or Ovi Suite) to work with applications it doesn't support.<br />
<br />
PC Suite's PC Sunc supports Microsoft Outlook Express, Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Organizer and Lotus Notes. Various versions.<br />
<br />
If you try to use any other application, it just won't work, and even trying is a waste of your time.

            Thanks for your answers!<br />
<br />
By this time I have made a clean install of Windows Vista at least three times, and on one occasion I remembered to check this this thesis of mine that I mentioned above. So for the purpose of testing if it's true that the Nokia PC Suite installation process
 or Nokia PC Sync configuration wizard does not present the user with the option to choose Mozilla Thunderbird as e-mail client, I have done the following.<br />
<br />
I have made a completely clean, out of the box installation of Windows Vista on the computer (retail version, non-custom branded Vista version). After installing the needed and important drivers for the system and other software required for the proper operation
 of the system and few other software, I went on installing Microsoft Office with Outlook 2007 as one of the first software applications. Then I installed Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird. After I had done that, I installed the Nokia PC Suite.<br />
<br />
As my thesis predicted, after successfully installing Nokia PC Suite and the Nokia PC Sync configuration wizard was started, I was not presented with the option to choose Mozilla Thunderbird as my e-mail client, even thou both Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla
 Thunderbird were installed prior to or before Nokia PC Sync. In other words, if this was a limitation of the Nokia PC Suite or it's installer, where it does not recognize e-mail clients that are installed after Nokia PC Suite itself, then installing the e-mail
 clients in this order should make Nokia PC Suite recognize it. But it did not, or at least as long as the Mozilla Thunderbird is concerned. Thus, this proves my thesis - Nokia PC Suite is currently not compatible with Mozilla Thunderbird. And Mobile Sensei
 Petrib confirms this also.<br />
<br />
Here follows a screenshot of the actual Nokia PC Sync configuration wizard.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/9803/nokiapcsyncsd3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/9803/nokiapcsyncsd3.jpg</a><br />
<br />
I'm afraid we will have to bear with this. I personally don't believe that there will ever be any official release of Nokia PC Suite that will have full support (or any at all) for other e-mail clients then just Microsoft Outlook and Lotus, or that there will
 be any official Linux or nix-like version of it. Not today, not in next five years, and not in one thousand light-years from today. We can hope, but the odds are pointing in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
So bear with Microsoft Outlook, and the Windows **bleep**. No pay, no play! Unfortunately... fortunate for Microsoft, Nokia, and others alike, but unfortunate for us end users.<br />

<p>I agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a way of persuading firms like Nokia to provide support for software like Tbird, but it will always be a question of money. So they have to be persuaded that this could be a means of attracting new clients. This is only likely to happen if some
 other maker does it first and Nokia start to lose customers ;-))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, detailed information such as e-mail client compatibility of synching software is not readily available in shops when you're choosing a phone (and don't ask the assistant, most of them will tell you anything to make you happy). So these things
 have to be researched very carefully.</p>

<p>And you people from Nokia, you waste your consumers' reliance. The next mobile phone will be chosen upon it's level of support for Thunderbird.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can suggest as a workaround is to either change your <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name?q=display+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">display name</a></strong> or create another account

                    I upgraded from Win 7 pro to Windows 8 pro (a clean install). I then reinstalled Office 2010 (and Norton Intenet Secruity, in case that's relevant).&nbsp; Outlook worked fine before I switched to Win 8 and now I'm repeatedly getting a message that the program
 "failed to update headers" referencing port 993.&nbsp; The account I'm accessing is an&nbsp;IMAP account (aol mail).&nbsp; I tried running scanpst, but that did not help.&nbsp; I also tried turning off Norton's email protection and that also did nothing.&nbsp; Thoughts?

<h2>            Office 2016 for MAC&#58; Default Save As folder is not the same as from where the file originated from</h2>
                    <p>If you open a Word, Excel or Powerpoint file and then want to Save As a new version, the browser does not start in the folder where the original file was from. This is particularly frustrating if the user does a lot of this and they have a long pathname
 to the files in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This symptom only appears to be on Mac versions of Office 365. Windows behaviour works fine.&nbsp;One way which can make it slightly less frustrating is to reset the default Save location in options. This could save some time if the path is common or near the
 requuired location. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows systems are often easier as they have the benefit of mapped drives, whereas the Mac Alias route is not as easy.</p>

            100% sure!&nbsp; This issue is baffling.&nbsp; Since this post I have been trying different users log ins. One user was able to access the database for a day.&nbsp; I came in and signed the next day under that user and it gave me this message again.&nbsp; I have accessed
 the folder where the database is stored on the server and I still get the error.&nbsp;

            It would appear that the database is now corrupt - as can <em>easily</em> happen when you connect over wireless. Access is very demanding of network speed and quality; even a good wireless network is going to be really risky.

                    <p>Hi Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently able to connect into a SFB Conference from a SFB Client but my Polycom Group 310 configured with a SFB User account connects but fails to negotiate video and audio although I can see the endpoint trying to connect into the conference.</p>

            hello  Mark 
<br />For Skype to work correctly, the following ports need to be open in your firewall:
<br />
<br />443/TCP
<br />3478-3481/UDP
<br />49152-65535/UDP + TCP
<br />If your firewall restricts access to these ports, you will need to update your firewall settings before you can use Skype.
<br />
<br />you can read more here

<p>Hi Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the port range required for a SFB Client, but can you confirm what port range would be required to connect from a SFB Client into an AV-MCU Skype Bridge, due to its capability to connect multiple endpoints the port range must be a lot greater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have a customer who's Polycom Group 310 can connect point-to-point to either another Polycom Group 310 registered with a Skype address, but unable to connect into a SFB Meeting room, the endpoint connects but doesn't negotiate any video and audio
 which looks like the local Firewall is stopping the video and audio streams from connecting from the Polycom Group 310 on the private network, to the SFB AV-MCU located in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            these are all the port range that you need 
<br />remember the 443 and 50.000-59.999 are very important 
<br />TCP 80, 443

<h2>            How Can I Put a Last Updated in My Excel Footer&#63;</h2>
                    Many official forms and documents require a "Last Updated" date to be visible to the reader. In certain cases, creating a form or report is
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6100833_can-last-updated-excel-workbook_.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 in Microsoft Excel than in Word. However, the date function in Excel's header and footer and formula options does not update the inserted date each time a workbook is saved. Consequently, the date shown does not accurately reflect the last time the workbook
 was updated. Fortunately, Excel allows its users to customize functions for special requirements, such as inserting a "Last Updated" date into their workbooks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do know the Macros that can be created to put it in a&nbsp;cell in&nbsp;the workbook itself, but is there a way to put it in the footer so that it's always there and all I have to do is add that particular preset footer?

<p>I can't really do that since I do not know your data provider.&nbsp; It should be a simple task to call (or stop by an office), show them your device and ask what the settings are.&nbsp; I would expect they would help....</p>

            <p>If you have Denim update you may group any email account or any application you have on your phone.</p>
<p>1) Pin one account to the start screen</p>
<p>2) Pin the second account to the start screen</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;Put the second pin over the first for a moment and that's it, you have two accounts gouped on a single tile.</p>
<p>You can do this with all your accounts.</p>

<h2>            App Installation progress bar shows it slows to a crawl when around 95&#37; complete</h2>
                    <p>Maybe just a "feature" but I've noticed that when I install a new app under windows 10 technical preview the progress bar is fine - but slows down markedly when its almost complete.&nbsp; It gets to 98%, I &nbsp;go away, do something else - come back - and its still
 showing 98%.</p>
<p>Then eventually it changes. More of an irritation than anything else but really the twirly icon would be more use than a progress bar that doesn't properly show progress!</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Which Build is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
As Windows 10 is still under testing all apps/hardware may not work as expected or hardware venders might not have released the Windows 10 compatible drivers. I would suggest you to try install the Sound drivers in compatibility mode and see if that helps.<br />

            There is no build number now. &nbsp;As stated, the automatic update installed Windows 10 Pro over the top of the installed Windows 10 Enterprise Preview. &nbsp;This is NOT a program compatibility problem. &nbsp;The Microsoft Update on 7/27/15 installed an audio driver
 that does not work! &nbsp;A fix would be greatly appreciated!

<p>Just try and open it in 2007. It should be OK because 2007 is backwards compatible with 2003.</p>
<p>From MS documentation:-</p>
<p>Compatibility mode in PowerPoint 2007 ensures that you will be able to open and save PowerPoint 97–2003 files without converting them to PowerPoint 2007 files.</p>
<p>In compatibility mode, you can open, edit, and save PowerPoint 97–2003 presentations, but you won't be able to use all of the new PowerPoint 2007 features. In PowerPoint 2007, compatibility mode is triggered when you do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a file that was saved in PowerPoint 97–2003 (.ppt) format. </li><li>Convert a PowerPoint 2007 file format to a PowerPoint 97–2003 file format by using<strong>Save As</strong>.
</li><li>Set PowerPoint 2007 to save all presentations in PowerPoint 97–2003 format.</li></ul>
<p>If my comments have helped please Vote As Helpful.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change profile picture</h2>
                    <p>I am about ready to throw my computer out the window. I have had endless troubles with the new skype including it not recognising my login details, despite setting up a new account last month. It also did NOT merge my accounts as it promised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't even update my profile photo (I have none at this point)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever is behind the Skype migration to the new Microsoft platform should be taken out and shot</p>

<p>The mailbox quota is set by your mail host.&nbsp; Contact your ISP and see what you need to do to get back under quota.&nbsp; It's also possible that the incoming message that got bounced was huge.&nbsp; If somebody was trying to e-mail you a 50MB attachment there might
 not be much you can do to accomodate that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you not receiving ANY inbound messages or just that one that keeps getting rejected?</p>

</p><p><span>Dear Microsoft ,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been a happy user of Microsoft products for a long time .</span></p>
<p><span>Something happened the other day that did nothing to help our relationship .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I decided it was time to upgrade to a newer version of MS Office just to be really disappointed to find out that as a
<strong>United States Veteran</strong> , I'm not entitled to your so called <strong>
"Veterans"</strong> discount for Microsoft Office . You say that only active duty and civilian employees qualify .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That's not just <strong>false advertising</strong> , it’s embarrassing .
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I mean , come on , less than 1 ½ % of our population are Veterans and you feel it necessary to refuse your discount for those of us who served Honorably for more than 4 years ?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For God and Country</span></p>

<p>MS does have military discounts for veterans</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stephan provided a link to a 10% discount page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, check at the PX / Base Exchange that you qualify to shop at. They may have the licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: if you do get a military discount for a 1yr 365 subscription remember that you have to go back to the PBX to get the explicit Military product key.&nbsp; If you let it auto renew it is most likely to renew using the 365 Home price.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can buy and activate up to 5 product keys for a 5 year term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The "HUP" is a better deal, if you qualify (and it is still offered)</p>

<p>
I have used the url

<h2>            Printing to PDF from within Word to a custom size page.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I am trying to convert my Microsoft Word novel into a PDF file - the printer insists it has to be done via the Print to PDF process, not the Save As/PDF process. They will not accept files saved in this manner, on the Print to PDF way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Word document is formatted to a 5x8in size. But when I Print to PDF, the text comes out much smaller (about half the size it should be) with huge margins on all sides. Well, that's how it looks in the Print Preview. I have tried changing the PDF page
 size to 5x8 before hitting Print, but the same thing happens. As this file will be professionally printed, it MUST look exactly as I want it to look, and that is NOT happening, no matter what I try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best result I can get is to change the paper size within the Print to PDF screen to Statement, but this size is 5.5x8.5in - too big!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest I do?</p>

            The available page sizes are determined by the current printer driver and Print to PDF doesn't appear to cater for custom sizes. You would do better to use a driver that does allow such page sizes - such as PrimoPDF. You can then set both the document
 and the printer to your preferred page size and that is what you will get.<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Home Install on Windows 10 won&#39;t show in &#34;Apps&#34; or Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I just completed installation of Office 365 Home on my desktop PC, which is running Windows 10. After completing the installation, I looked under all apps and cannot find the program apps (Word &amp; Excel) listed. I can find them in the program folder on my
 C: drive, and right clicked on them, sleecting "add to start menu". Still don't show. I was able to right click on them to get them to "add to task bar"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Office 364 Home on my Surface Pro 4 this past weekend and the apps show in the start menu... any ideas as to why it won't load in my start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you might be able to provide.</p>

            I uninstalled Office and reinstalled it... No entries shown in apps. Not even an Microsoft Office folder shown... So I went into file explorer, and to the MS Office folder, found Excel and Word app icons, right clicked on each and selected "Pin to Start"...
 they now show as tiles on the start page, and in the "all apps" listing... Shouldn't those automatically be listed when being installed in the "apps" listing and on the Start page?

<p>Same thing happening to me. My wife doesn't want me to upgrade any more machines until we get this one settled. Tried watching videos on MTV, Netflix, and Hulu Plus and I could watch them just fine as long as I didn't hit the maximize button; but who wants
 to watch a video on 25% of your screen when in the living room...?</p>

            <p>Same issue here I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using youtube.com as an example:</p>
<p>-Open video</p>
<p>-HTML 5 video player is loaded</p>
<p>-Go full screen</p>
<p>-video player crashes after a minute or two</p>
<p>-page reloads with FLASH video player (not HTML 5)</p>
<p>-I can watch video fine with Flash player</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happens 100% of the time for me.&nbsp; I did a clean install of 10 and updated drivers blah blah blah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this...</p>
