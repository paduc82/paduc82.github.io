<h2>            PLEASE DO NOT SCARE CUSTOMERS</h2>
                    I've been an MCSE for over 10 years.&nbsp; Just upgraded to 10122 via Fast Track.&nbsp; I'm a S/E, so my 2.2 GHZ laptop has well over 500 programs installed on a 500 GB hybrid drive.&nbsp; During upgrade, install went along through, "Applying settings", then said "This
 won't take long", then&nbsp;after three or four minutes, said "this is taking longer than expected"...PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.&nbsp; Merely tell customers the progress, do not state "This will not take long".....instead, state progress "applying settings".....then, "still
 working", or whatever makes sense.&nbsp; It would be much better if you could take the time to estimate the progress based on the number of programs, the average time to upgrade, etc., like Explorer copying files.....how many minutes estimated to upgrade 500 programs
 --- since it did finish without a problem.&nbsp; In addition, a progress bar like Explorer Copying, would be a much needed improvement, also some progress indicator like a spinning circle.&nbs

            <p>It would be nice if there were a dos window open listing the operations being performed instead of a spinning circle. &nbsp;When I can see a dos window processing commands, it lets me know that the system is actually doing something. &nbsp;Animation loops, like a
 spinning circle or hourglass give no actual information, since it could simply be stuck, or it could be actually doing something and there's no way to know which is which.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also bad when the installation includes blank screens, that in my experience can be up to 30 minutes long, where Windows 10 is still actively installing itself, but were it not for the hard drive light flickering, one might think the system has stopped
 and attempt a reboot or something, which will horribly mangle the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the windows update isn't a batch file that naturally lends itself to a dos window, but even if it's gibberish to the non-techie, having information spew forth accomplishes two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It tells you that the system is doing something important.</li><li>It tells you not to mess with it while it's doing something.</li></ol>
<p>People are not used to a "windows update" taking 3 hours, so unless the process is better narrated by Microsoft, a lot of people may think something's wrong and actively interrupt and corrupt the installation when they click the upgrade to Windows 10 button.
 &nbsp;I completely agree with you that Microsoft should be careful not to alarm users, either by giving bad/useless information, or not giving any information. &nbsp;If it's not actionable information, it's not information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I can't stand is having time as "yesterday" or "today" or "a few minutes ago". &nbsp;I can do a windows update today, look at it tomorrow, and it will say that it checked last at 4PM today, when it's not even 4pm yet today. &nbsp;It's telling me that
 yesterday at 4pm is today. &nbsp;"a few minutes ago" will stay that way for hours. &nbsp;<strong>Give the actual date and time instead</strong>. &nbsp;Please don't dumb things down! &nbsp;Cutesy conversational tone does not go well for technology you need to work with, instead
 of just play with. &nbsp;"something went wrong" is a terrible error message. &nbsp;It says absolutely nothing. &nbsp;It's the equivalent of "oops". &nbsp;It should say what the actual error is, and give you a button to display the event log of the error. &nbsp;Windows 10 is extremely
 frustrating in lacking information to the end user, particularly when it's so buggy and we're trying to get it to work.</p>

            <p>I have a *BETTER* idea - fix the <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">inefficient</span></em></strong> process so that it doesn't take so blasted long!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking "the registry" which is GROSSLY INEFFICIENT from what I can tell. &nbsp;I suspect it does 'paranoid cacheing', i.e. "better re-read it from the disk ANYWAY, just in case 'something' *might* have changed it after the last time the OS wrote to the
 disk drive". &nbsp;It's probably inherent in the design, like too many "object oriented" things that encapsulate and isolate TOO much and thereby create inefficiencies, like re-re-re-opening the same key and re-re-re-enumerating it over, and over, and over, and
 over, and over...</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>problem being, I think, that they're creating "windows.old" and MODIFYING SECURITY DESCRIPTORS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's why I say that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually delete 'windows.old' when I upgrade, after testing everything. &nbsp;It's contents are obvious. &nbsp;but to do that, I have to 'take ownership' of all of the files. &nbsp;This is a PAINFULLY! SLOW! PROCESS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this *kind* of thing (i.e. 'take ownership') is happening during the ugprade, then it MUST be a slow, painful, and irritatingly inefficient process. &nbsp;THIS would GREATLY "un-enhance" "the experience", and yeah, maybe 'scare' users into thinking the computer
 was hung up or something when there's no feedback to say "I'm busy right now, here's what I'm doing."</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Compact View</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please forgive me if I did not find the right forum as I cannot locate the appropriate Microsoft help community category and sub-category for Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Mac OS X&nbsp;Microsoft Teams chat native client I would like a compact view to better read the messages on the screen since messages that are not threading generate lots of empty space. I have not been able to find this setting if it is available. Advice
 or assistance would be appreciated, including if there is a more recommended client.</p>

</p><p><span>If so, you can hover your mouse to the right border (the red arrow in the above screenshot), then drag the border to the size you want. This can shorten a part of the blank area.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>the official answer from Microsoft is No. The only phone that will I think actually get the update from 6.5 to 7 is the HTC HD2 but all other phones won't be able to get official updates from OEM or phone carriers. To get OS 7 you should buy a Windows phone
 7 to get it.</p>
<p>Hope I was able to help,</p>

            Ok. I find the way by myself.
<div><br />
<div>First, You just connect the Windows Phone device with your PC. Your PC will found your device like a flash drive. You just click and rename (Like rename your flash drive name).</div>

<div>That's it.</div>

            <p>Hi BernieRole,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it is possible to change the name of your Windows Phone 8 device using the Windows Phone App. Please do the following:</p>
<p>- Open the Windows Phone App</p>
<p>- Click Settings</p>
<p>- Then click Preferences</p>
<p>- And then select Change Device Name</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p><br />
Kind Regards,<br />
Sheena M.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive system file causing rogue &#34;How do you want to open this file&#34; dialog</h2>
                    <p>For the last few weeks I have had "How do you want to open this file" dialogs popping up at random intervals. Trying to open the file causing this reveals it to be due to OneDrive's system file&nbsp; (.849C9593-D756-4E56-8D6E-42412F2A707B)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried stopping OneDrive and deleting all copies of this file using PowerShell then restarting but that didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I stop it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Might part of the problem be because I have both University and personal OneDrive folders? (It happens on several different computers with the same logins).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Caspar</p>

<p>Hi Casper,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we couldn't reproduce the same issue on our side with the latest version of the OneDrive sync client, I assume that this is because you are using an old version of it. Please try updating it
 to <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=844652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the latest version</a> to fix this issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists after you updated the OneDrive for Business to the latest version, I'd appreciate it if you could provide us with the following information for further assistance:</p>
<p>1. Please click the OneDrive for Business icon in the taskbar &gt; More &gt; Settings &gt; capture a screenshot of the version information;</p>
<p>2. Please take a screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As suggested in the previous post, create a new Windows User Account (Administrator type) on the system and not a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link to create a new Windows user account.</p>

<h2>            Documents, Pictures etc folders appear on desktop</h2>
                    <p>Build 10130 (not had this problem on previous builds)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an SSD fail at the weekend and had to clean install after replacing it. I use a separate Data drive so that's usually no big issue but since the install my main folders (Documents, Music and even Desktop) are appearing on my desktop (which
 I normally keep completely empty). Properties says they are my actual folders for these (ie they are not short-cuts and if opened they do contain my files). If I right-click there is no option to delete. If I right-click and then REFRESH, they disappear but
 re-appear, apparently at random, later</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info, I change the location of these folders using Properties so that they are automatically redirect to my D: drive, but this shouldn't be the issue (beta software aside, of course!) as it's never cropped up before</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise this may just be a beta bug but i cant find any reference to it elsewhere on the net and it's REALLY annoying not understanding why its happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else seeing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have posted this in another category but no replies so I hope no one minds me cross posting)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lumia 635 missing buttons on screen since anniversary update issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is the deal. Since the annyversary update on my Windows 10 phone, the "buttons" on the lower part of my touch screen are semi visible or not visible at all. This is a huge problem for me, because I can't write texts, refresh Edge or do anything that
 requiers those buttons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this issue fixable? The phone is fully updated, of course, and I really don't want to do a factory reset if it's not absolutely neccessary.</p>
<p>I can't find any similar problems on that category on the web.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

To better assist you, kindly answer the following questions:</p>

<li>Which version or OS build does your phone have?</li><li>The "buttons", are these the one on navigation bar at the bottom?</li><li>Have you used the Upgrade Advisor app prior to update?</li></ul>

<p>It got fixed though with the update I got a couple of hours after opening this thread.</p>

<h2>            E52 and Gmail</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have problem to get emails from gmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up gmail e-mail account useing nokia e-mail solution. After setting it up nokia got some e-mails from inbox but not every thing.</p>
<p>For gmail nokia is using automatically imap connetcion and it is ok for me. But some kind of reason it doesn't download all e-mails.</p>
<p>I change download options so that nokia should download all messages, no size is important. But still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also funny is that I downloaded google application for gmail and when I open this ap and go to gmail, then&nbsp;I can see all my e-mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does someone else useing first mentioned solution? Does it work ok for you?</p>

<p>Yee, I know about this problem with gmail, but this is't reason why I can't update e-mails. This was only two hours prbolem and already fixed but mine problem started early and still is there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I didn't mention is that I'm useing gmail over IMAP protocol in outlook and all works well. So I do not think&nbsp; there is problem with gmail.</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the mail you do NOT see on your phone are mails that you label with filters as they arrive at gmail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe, on your mobile phone, you can navigate to the subfolder "all mail" underneath the inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>your lost mail is probably there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you won´t get a "new mail" alert from your phone (works only with inbox?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess nokia mail just does not understand gmails labels...</p>

            Arrgh. This new email client. Gmail FAQ is outdated - their instructions doesnt fit. And nokia E52 doesn't have manual setup.<br />
Now I can access only SENT messages folder. But no receiver, or ALL messages are displayed. So, I can't even reply to sender.

<p>got E52.</p>
<p>I added my google apps email to mail. sync actually worked mails appeared, also calendar entries did. but at end of sync I always get message "unable to sync".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also saw some E52 reviews with home screen images showing Gmail icon in active standby (not shortcut but there where mail, calendar, wlan,... is).</p>

<p>&nbsp;Photoshopped screens? :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;just joking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually there is Gmail icon on my active desctop... But I don't use it. I prefer classic wallpaper with shortcuts on keys. It is sad, "bubble"-reminders on simple desktop are not so good as on active desktop. And there's no organizer reminder in this mode...

<p>The e52's build in mail client support gmail sync. Its using intellicsync. The syncing is made through a nokia server.</p>
<p>I set up a gmail and a hotmail box, one gmail icon and one hotmail icon appear on desktop. Delivery of gmail is promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sent item has a backup copy on gmail's sent folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For contacts, The sync program(ctrl paneo-&gt;phone-&gt;sync) supports syncML. Set up a syncml profile for gmail contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gmail's syncml only supports contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For calendar, set up a free goosync a/c. Then set up a goosync's syncML profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drawback is no automatic sync for contacts and calendar. User also need to change sync profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quite satisfy with this method since its cheap.&nbsp; It can handle multi email box. Mail for exchange can only handle one mail box.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to ask whether one can use Ovi.com to sync with E52. I went to its website but did not see the E52 listed. Are there manual settings one can enter in the sync program in order to sync calendar, contacts and notes?</p>

    <title>N96 USB connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samhastings  say:</h3>
<h2>            N96 USB connection</h2>
                    I'm trying to connect my N96 to my computer via USB, but I'm having a few problems. I've managed to establish connections in this manner in the past. Here is exactly what's happening:<br />
<br />
1. I open the Nokia PC Suite (I'm running Windows Vista)<br />
2. I click "Connect Nokia Device" and select Cable Connection from the dialog box that appears.<br />
3. When prompted I'm connecting the USB cable between my laptop and my phone as instructed.<br />
<br />
The Nokia PC suite software doesn't recognise the phone at all, and the "Next" button remains disabled.<br />
<br />
All that appears on my phone is a menu to choose an internet connection for some reason. Selecting any of the options brings up the an error message saying "Drive New Drive unavailable. Try again?". Cancelling when prompted to select a connection makes the
 same selection screen appear again after a second or two.<br />
<br />
I've made sure "PC Suite" is selected under Tools &gt; Connectivity &gt; USB.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for support via the Nokia support section on this website but helpfully the Nokia N96 isn't even listed on the list of products!<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>I would like to have an @outlook.com address effectively replace an @hotmail.com address.</strong></p>
<p>I would like it to be the account by which I sign in to Microsoft services (i.e. to use it as my Microsoft account for PC, email, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Although&nbsp;I have seen an article to upgrade and change an old @hotmail.com to an @outlook.com account from within&nbsp;the Outlook.com Settings (<a href="https://blogs.office.com/2013/08/21/a-better-way-to-manage-aliases-and-primary-email-address-for-your-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://blogs.office.com/2013/08/21/a-better-way-to-manage-aliases-and-primary-email-address-for-your-microsoft-account/</span></a>),
 has the&nbsp;'Add an email alias' function replaced the 'Rename your account to an @outlook.com account' function? Because I&nbsp;can no longer see the option on my&nbsp;Outlook.com Settings page. Would the option 'Create an Outlook.com alias' have replaced it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;if I create a new&nbsp;@outlook Alias under the @hotmail account and make it the Primary account, set it to be the new
<span>Default "From" address, and then remove the @hotmail Alias from my newly created @outlook Alias, will I still receive emails from the @hotmail address within the @outlook address?

</span><span>Or does it still need to exist as an Alias?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help. I really need to sort this out before I upgrade to Windows 10, so I can use the @outlook address as my Microsoft account, whilst still keeping the emails, contacts, and history that I have accumulated over the years with the @hotmail
 address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Buzz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, your&nbsp;@Hotmail.com account cannot be&nbsp;changed to @outlook.com account but you can use an alias instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alias is an additional email address (please understand, it will not replace your @Hotmail.com domain) which can be used to send emails if you set this new alias as primary. However, you can remove @Hotmail.com alias after you have added&nbsp;your new outlook
 alias as the primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are&nbsp;upgraded to Outlook.com (Preview) interface, then follow the steps below to change your from address and aliases.</p>
<p>1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a> using your Hotmail account.
</p>
<p>2. Click on the <strong>Gear</strong> <strong>(Settings)</strong> icon and select
<strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Expand <strong>Mail &gt; Accounts &gt; Connected Accounts</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Under <strong>From Addres</strong><strong>s</strong>, click on <strong>Change your from address</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

<p>Yes</p>
<p>All account aliases can be used to login.&nbsp; You can also limit which aliases can be used to login.</p>
<p>You should be able to login with a different alias address even though does not show in the sign in box.</p>

<h2>            Temporary File Sharing with OneDrive for Business</h2>
                    Hi. I am unable to find information on how to share OneDrive files on a temporary basis. When I send a file to share, I need to be able to specify how long the recipient can access file. Unfortunately, the forums do not provide this specific information
 (at least the menu options which appear on the screen captures are different to mine).

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to set expiration time when you select specific people, sorry for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to suggest you leave a comment to <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint UserVoice</a> to let the product team know your requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround now for you is to contact your administrator to enable the external sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

    <title>How can I change my background&#47;theme color after changing it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brown.beth  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change my background&#47;theme color after changing it once&#63;</h2>
                    When I upgraded from Hotmail to Outlook, I used the background color options that appeared in the upper right hand corner of the webpage under the little gear icon (next to the messaging icon) to change my background to dark orange. Now, I have decided
 that I do not like this color very much and want to change it. However, the color options no longer appear under the little gear symbol! I have tried looking through all of my account settings options but there does not appear to be a page for choosing background
 color/theme there way there used to be in Hotmail. How can I change my background color now?<br />
<br />
Moreover, assuming that there <i>is</i> a way to change the color back... is there any way that I can choose a background that is anything other than a solid color? I really liked the pretty savanna background theme I had in Hotmail that changed throughout
 the course of the day to reflect the passing of time... That pretty theme was literally one of only two reasons why I have been sticking with Hotmail instead of switching over to Gmail so without that advantage (indeed, Gmail's background options may be worse
 than Hotmail's but they're certainly better than what seems to be Outlook's!) I feel so tempted to up and leave Microsoft email.<br />

                    <p>Hello!,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user with two mailboxes mary@**** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Mary &nbsp;manages other peolpe's calendars through her *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account. &nbsp;Companies XXX and YYY have merged which means her *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account has to be merged with her mary@**** account.</p>
<p>The accounts are in the same tenant<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how to I merge these accounts without causing the calendar meetings to start acting up?</p>

</p><p>We are not able to merge the 2 mail accounts into 1 mail account. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a workaround, we can export the PST file of the account mary@**** account and import it to the mailbox

<p>Literally every major smartphone on the market shows SMS messages on the lock screen by default. Some even allow you to reply to that message right on the lock screen!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setting you want is in Settings&gt;System&gt;Notifications &amp; actions. Find the app you want to make private (in your case, Messages) and turn on "Keep notifications private on the lock screen". When your phone is locked, you can't see the contents of the message.</p>

            <p>Hi Noeli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start working on this by checking if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>Phone update</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating the phone software, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. To soft reset the phone, just press and hold the power and volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue as Noeli. I just tried your suggested advice then and it unfortunately did not allow me to download the United States speech pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous phone was a Lumia 640 which&nbsp;I had set to have all my region, language and keyboard as Australian but speech I had set to United States and it worked great. Since having my Lumia 950 XL I am trying to set the same settings but it will only work
 on the Australian speech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you got any further ideas that might help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

 About &gt; reset your phone.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure to back up all of your files before performing a hard reset.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Go to Settings<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Backup &gt; Apps + settings &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Back

<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help on this matter.<br />
I was able to successfully fix the problem using the device recovery tool and the phone is working better than ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly after the first hard reset my keyboard wouldn't download correctly either but I continued on with the device recovery tool to see if it would fix the original issue and the keyboard one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery tool did tell me that my device had the latest software installed and was up to date but the flash and reinstall has fixed the problem.<br />
</p>
<p>The first attempt on the recovery tool did not work and it gave an error message.<br />
The second attempt worked flawlessly. After the reset, each download for speech, keyboard etc has downloaded and asked for a device reset to complete the installs.<br />
</p>
<p>A top effort on your behalf, thank you for taking your time to help me with this issue.<br />
