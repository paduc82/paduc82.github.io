<h2>            No notification on messages and emails plus poor battery charging</h2>
                    After updating my Lumia 730 windows 8.1 to windows 10. I noticed my messages, email and other doesn't notify me any longer at the notification center. I have tried several times to check the notification maybe its off but my notification is "ON" but i
 don't get notification as i used to get before upgrading to Win 10. Secondly My battery performances too has depreciated drastically after upgrading, it takes about 8-10hours to get a full charge and discharges in less than 4 hours. Many times it is plugged
 in it will indicate "plug in not charging" The phone is 2 years old. Could that been that the battery is bad? Please i need urgent answers. my email is&nbsp; thanks

    <title>Cannot Delete or edit some calendar entries - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Delete or edit some calendar entries</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the problem a few times now where one of my Calendar entries is unable to be deleted. I use 3 calendars all of which are shared. When I delete it, it will be gone from my phone calendar, and all other persons shared calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entry has always been an 'all day' entry.</p>
<p>If I try a permenant delete, the message "could not complete the deletion, the items may have already been deleted"</p>
<p>If I try and edit it, the message "the item cannot be saved to this folder, the folder was deleted or moved, or you do not hav permission. Do you want to save a copy in the default folder for this item"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up untill today I have been using Outlook 2007 where I have now had the problem twice (out of over 100 entries) in the last few weeks. I have only had this problem since sharing calendars, and both times have been different calendars.&nbsp;Today I upgraded to
 Outlook 2013 and the problem still exsists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I right click on the entry and delete, nothing happens at all - even no error messsage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone could help, I'd be very grateful as this will cause problems in the future when I revisit jobs in the past and my computer shows an entry that should have been deleted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for not being able to reply to your post in a timely manner. Let me help you rectify the issue about deleting Calendar entries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to verify if you are unable to delete those Calendar entries when accessing your account through the web or if you are deleting the entries using a mail client. If it is the latter, I would suggest that you contact the support team of Microsoft
 Office Outlook for better assistance. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>You&nbsp;can refer to this

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If the issue happens when deleting the entries in your Outlook.com Calendar which is web-based, we will need additional information from you to be able to determine its root cause. Please provide the answers to
 the following questions on your next reply:</font></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span><font color="#000000">Does the same issue happen when other Outlook.com Calendar accounts are accessed on the same computer?

                    After doing a 'windows update' download yesterday, another window popped up indicating there was an update for 'flash' so I pushed the tab to do the update.  WELL, guess it was a 'third party' download....and all **** has broken loose on my once well functioning NEW HP 2000 Notebook PC!  I have uninstalled everything that got downloaded 'inadvertently'  yesterday to get rid of whatever the 'malwear' seems to be, till there is NOTHING left to uninstall.....YET I still have CONDUIT as the opening page on google chrome, bing, or ANYthing, even plain Internet Explorer.  The tool bar shows Mixi.DJ everywhere and I can't get rid of it!  It's permeating every page I open and shlogging up my system with incessant POP-UPs and garbage windows flashing perpetually.  What can I do to get rid of this NASTY Conduit which is sabatoging my system and hence my work????? 


(PS:  Windows 8 was already on the laptop when purchased so that's the operating system....)

<p>Each rescue scanner will miss things – because none of them will have a perfectly complete and up-to-date set of definitions; so you might need to use several of these rescue scanners, or something like
 the Shardana Antivirus Rescue Disk Utility, which creates a custom bootable CD or flash drive that includes multiple rescue scanners:</p>

<h2>            Bing is very slow</h2>
                    I've been using Bing now for over 3 yrs and it's been great. A few weeks ago, I got an e-mail from Plublising Clearing House asking me to enter for a contest by using their search engine. I did 'one' search to be entered. The next day Bing would hardly
 even load up, when it finally did load, it's verrrrrry slow. It's been that way ever since. At this point, it's not even worth trying to use Bing. I can use any other search engine and they all work just fine. I have Vista and use firefox. I want my d@mn Bing
 back!!!!&nbsp; I just wonder if PCH had something on their search engine to disable Bing??

            All of a sudden it started working like it's supposed to 1 1/2 days ago. I have no idea why but just glad it is. I still feel that it had something to do with PCH search. I 'think' it might have tagged bing in my browser with some kind of bug that would
 disable it(for a certain amount of time) so I would start using their search. I'm soooo sick of marketing BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

            I'm having the same issue using Excel 2013 32 bits on Windows 7 64 bits. Any Excel or CSV file created by exporting data from a different program (a data acquisition software) will in protected view. After clicking on Enable Editing, the spreadsheet will
 turn grey, I can still move the cursor but not see any value in the cells. I have to exit Excel and open the same file again, this time it won't open in protected view so I can work with it.<br />
<br />
It is annoying and time consuming to do this when I have to open multiple output files to extract data to work with, so I hope Microsoft fixes this issue.<br />

            <p>Any actual fix or resolution to this issue? &nbsp;I've recently upgraded to Windows 10 x64 from Windows 8.1 x64 and suddenly began experiencing the problem that josemaldu reported. &nbsp;When opening a file with Excel, if the "enable editing" button needs to be clicked,
 I do so and immediately the contents of the spreadsheet disappear - replaced by a gray field in which it is impossible to see the cells. &nbsp; I can then close entirely out of the workbook and reopen it successfully with everything visible, but it's a tedious
 workaround with the volume of data I need to access daily. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, this is Excel 2013 x64.</p>

                    I'm trying to use Microsoft Word 07 on my Windows 8 laptop, but the whole program is locked and when I try to type, a message appears in the bottom left that reads "This modification is not allowed because the selection is locked." I have a free trial

                    <p>How do we set the default format for headers and footers? &nbsp; Since 1992 Word has always opened new documents with the same headers and footers for odd and even pages. &nbsp;That is what I want. &nbsp;But sometime this month Word has decided on its own to open my new

<p>Further to what Charles replied, there is much more to the Normal template than most users realize... That's why you can't effectively just save a new one by using that name. A valid Normal.dotm template
<em>must</em> be generated by the program. The template also stores a variety of operational information, such as custom keyboard shortcuts, Styles, &amp; other document defaults. Often the user takes actions which affect the Normal template without even realizing
 it :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to avoid the notification is to visit <strong>Word&gt; Preferences - Save</strong> to clear the check for Prompt before saving Normal template. Most experienced users will advise against doing so, though... The belief is that it is better to be notified
 in order to avoid saving unintended changes. I agree, but it's an available option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're getting the notification even when you're certain that nothing has been done to affect the template it may be due to any of several issues, including a corrupt template. It seems that this is rather common due to the variety of changes made to
 the program since its introduction in conjunction with Apple's <em>sandboxing</em> requirements. In order to test, you can do either of 2 troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After Quitting Word, rename your current Normal.dotm [something such as oldNormal.dotm is fine] then launch the program to see if the notification appears when you Quit. Word will generate a new Normal.dotm template.
<em>Or</em>,</li><li>Create a new User Account on your Msc. Log in as that User then launch Word to see if the notification appears when you Quit the program.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result &amp; we'll go from there.</p>

<h2>            I can send messages to facebook chat but can&#39;t receive replies in Mango</h2>
                    Me and my friend were testing out the facebook chat compatibility of Mango. I sent a message from my windows phone to my friend while he was online in facebook. He received my messages and replied but a lot of the messages didn't arrive to me phone. About
 1 out of 20 messages push through and I receive them on my phone but the others are just lost. We gave it some time because we thought it was just delayed but it's already been a full day (24 hours) and none of the lost messages arrived. I am seriously concerned
 about the reliability of the &nbsp;threads feature in Mango. Is this also happening to others?

            Do you have another browser you use, chrome/ firefox ?
<div>Bing is a search engine that can be disabled but you will have to have another installed and make it your default browser.</div>
<div>Give some more information about what you do want to use,</div>
<div>You can add google toolbar or firefox toolbars to ie9,</div>
<div>But the reality is you can also go straight to google and download google chrome and never have to see bing again.</div>
<div>But you will need to go to internet options, and manage addons,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Search providers section, and make google the default.</div>
<div>Downloading chrome will pretty much do this for you.</div>

<p>Sounds like one of three possible options:- your home page is set to Bing, or you have a Bing Toolbar, or an Addon offering Bing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>I would click on the Tools link (or the clog symbol whichever is visible) and that will allow you to click on Internet Options. Several Tabs will appear, General being the first one and this will automatically highlight your Homepage that IE uses. If its
 Bing, delete it and replace it with&nbsp;what you want it to be eg Google ? just type in the Google web address etc.</li><li>If its a Toolbar you are referring too ie Bing appears&nbsp;near the top of Internet Explorer, right click with your mouse in the blank area at the top of IE. This will&nbsp;result in&nbsp;a drop down menu with all the different Toolbars you can have. Ticks will be beside
 those that you use.&nbsp; If Bing is one of them, click it and the tick will disappear as will the Bing Bar on IE.</li><li>If thats not solving the problem, then its probably an add on. In which case simply open Internet Options again (see above) and go to the Programs Tab.&nbsp;Click on Manage Add Ons and when the new Window opens up, look for something that refers to Bing. Click
 on it and then move the mouse to the bottom right of the screen and click on disable and then close.</li></ol>

<h2>            Lost all my hotmail emails after my account was hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>my hotmail email account was hacked this morning, a spam message begging for money was sent to all my contacts. I directly changed my password when I discovered this. I can now access my hotmail inbox and other email folders, but they are all empty from
 before the attack. I have tried to retrieve through deleted emails but without success. I only find those old emails I actually have deleted previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please could you assist me getting access again to all my historic emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you!&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Ebaa,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community using my experience with Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that your account was hacked, but you still have access to it.
<br />
<br />You can try to restore emails using suggestions in this support article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-com-cf06ab1b-ae0b-418c-a4d9-4e895f83ed50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restor...</a>
<br />
<br />If not, you can try to retrieve the emails with Email Recovery App <a href="https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380447?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/o...</a> First insert the Microsoft Account from which you want to retrieve emails (These instructions better to perform on PC in browser)
<br />1. Login to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/</a>
<br />2. Click the gear icon at the upper right side of the screens then click view full setting.
<br />3. Select Mail &amp;gt; Customize actions, then click “Get Add-ins” and hit save. (Note: If you already have the “Email Recovery” under Customize actions, please proceed in clicking on it, then hit save, and proceed in step # 10.)
<br />4. In “Inbox” folder, click an email (if you don’t have an email, please try to send a test email to your own email account, then once you received the test email, please click on it.)
<br />5. Click the “Gift” icon (Get Add-ins)
<br />6. Type and enter “Email Recovery” (without quote symbol)
<br />7. In the search result, under the “Email Recovery”, click “Add” button.
<br />8. Click “X” icon to exit.
<br />9. Go back to “Customize actions” page, click “Email Recovery” and hit save.
<br />10. Again, in “Inbox” folder, click an email, then the “Email Recovery” icon will be visible now, and click on it.
<br />11. Recover both Recoverable Items and Purges.
<br />12. Please do not do anything while the recovery is in progress.
<br />13. Once it’s finished, a folder will appear on the left pane which contains the emails that you recovered.
<br />Please note that there is no guarantee that those emails will be restored as it depends on server status and what happened to the storage space where they were stored.
<br />I hope these helped to recover your emails you’re looking for.

            <p>Thank you for the pointer. Unfortunately, that thread is five years old. It was suggested there to (1) delete com.microsoft.Outlook.plist and start over, or (2) edit that plist file and replace Calibri with the font of choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a file ~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Outlook.plist, but it hasn't been modified since January 2016, and it does not contain any references to fonts. In fact, It's only nine lines long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved that file out of Preferences (after quitting Outlook), and when I launch Outlook the plist file is not recreated in the Preferences folder (or anywhere). Outlook no longer uses the plist file? It would explain why the application cannot remember
 my font settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another one of the suggestions was to repair permissions, which I did using the command line, since El Capitan no longer has that in Disk Utility. It did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still stuck.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to confirm if other settings in Outlook preferences can be saved. If not, the issue may occur when the Outlook client is not install correctly. We suggest you re-install Outlook 2016 for Mac.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Doud_FtC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please do/confirm two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Will you be able to grab the following file from the Mac on which you're running into this issue and send to us? You can email it to&nbsp;Outlook for Mac Feedback &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>/Users/[Your User Name]/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/MicrosoftRegistrationDB.reg&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>2. Are you saying that the default fonts revert back to Calibri 11 even if you do not quit and relaunch Outlook - can you please confirm this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. When you change the default fonts, can you also change another preference - say for example, "General&gt;Hide On My Computer Folders" and uncheck that / or check it if it was unchecked previously &nbsp;- and then quit and relaunch
 Outlook - And please tell me if what the state of that preference is? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Can you check the permissions on MicrosoftRegistrationDB.reg? To do this, please right click on the file in finder, choose 'Get Info' &nbsp;and then expand 'Sharing &amp; Permissions' - Can you tell me what permissions you have
 on the file it should say something like 'username (Me) | Read &amp; Write'</span></p>
<p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Long story short............</p>
<p>I Googled a few things about permanently delete just for a test Cortana via the Edit Group Policy/ Local Group Policy Editor, and I accidently deleted her completely. Under the 'Not Configured', 'Enable' &amp; 'Disable' I simply went back to old settings which
 was 'Not Configured'. She obviously didn't come back, otherwise I wouldn't have this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I somehow edit it else where? - In that case, let me know. Not that I need Cortana much, it's just weird not to simply click Windows Key and ask a question, but instead I've to open Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time to read this, and I'm hoping for an answer soon. Thanks again.</p>

            I did that it still don't work. and this is the error message they give me. Thanks MysticBeauty, I see the new message from yesterday at 11AM. Unfortunately, the problem seems to be on your mail provider's side - their server at mx1.hotmail.com accepted
 the message; the exact message from the hotmail server was this:<br />
{quote}250 &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; Queued mail for delivery{quote}<br />
Code 250 in SMTP (email-speak) means that it accepted the email. You'll have to contact hotmail support about how the messages were lost.<br />

<h2>            Today Screen Notifications for Emails in Subfolder</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of any third party software for the today screen in WM6 that notifies you when you receive an email in an exchange sub-folder?&nbsp; The default "new messages" notification only seems to work with your main inbox, which is
<span style="font-style: italic">really </span>inconvienent.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p><span>Dear Larry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To narrow down the issue, I’d like you to confirm whether the issue happens when you search a specific file in a site library in SharePoint Online. If you copy and
 move the file to another library in another site, wait some time and do a search on the home page of another site, what’s the result?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>About “&nbsp;Is there a reason why I received a 404 error and a bad URL request when I do a search on my SharePoint homepage?&nbsp;</span>“, could you upload some screenshots
 for our reference?</p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards</span><span>，</span></p>

<p><span>Dear Larry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates and help us in confirming that the issue only happens in a specific document library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the description, it seems that the&nbsp; issue happens when you select a folder. If yes, I’d like you to confirm whether the issue happens when you click on all
 folders in the library. Meanwhile, if you do a search in the document library directly and select the folder, can you access the folder?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the situation, I suggest you first
<span>clear IE cache via Tools&gt;Safety&gt;deleting browser history,&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)"><span>reset
 IE</span></span></a></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;(do the similar steps in other browsers), close the browser and then

<p>Hi Cliff</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the issue happens when you select all folders.&nbsp; I went ahead and did a search in the library and was able to access the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleared the cache and browser history and that did not resolve this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Cliff</p>

<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the issue may need some backend investigation which is out of the boundary of our forum support, I would suggest you create a support ticket from the Office 365 admin center. For how to create the ticket, you can refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/contact-support-for-business-products?view=o365-worldwide&amp;tabs=online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact support for business products - Admin Help</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Dialing Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have outbound VOIP dialing on my Skype account. &nbsp;Until recently I had been able to open a list of contacts within in Outlook 2013 and right click on a card and select "Call" which would popout a second level menu with the phone numbers, select one of them
 and initiate a Skype call. &nbsp; Now when I do that it brings up the standard modem dialer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling Skype, rebooting and reinstalling Skype but still get the same behavior. This happened once before a couple of years ago, but I don't remember how I fixed the issue.</p>

<h3> mikelo321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installed Office Mobile 2010 but still have 2007 as default</h2>
                    I recently installed the free update for Office 2010 from the Marketplace.&nbsp; There were no errors.&nbsp; I was prompted to restart, which I did, but now in my programs list I have:<br />
<br />
Excel Mobile<br />
Excel Mobile 2010<br />
OneNote Mobile<br />
OneNote Mobile 2010<br />
PowerPoint Mobile<br />
PowerPoint Mobile 2010<br />
SharePoint Workspace Mobile 2010<br />
Word Mobile<br />
Word Mobile 2010<br />
<br />
Regardless of which version I click on, the older version opens.&nbsp; I am not able to access any of the 2010 applications, only the 2007 versions.&nbsp; The original Office is not listed in my Remove Programs.&nbsp; How do I correct this?&nbsp; Either remove the old version
 or at least overwrite the original version, or change the default to the new version?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows Mobile 6.5 on HTC Imagio.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            I installed it on the device, not the storage card.&nbsp; I looked for executables but had little success.&nbsp; With Excel, it does not matter which version I click on, it goes to my list of Excel files and then regardless of what I select, the old version of Excel
 opens.&nbsp; I also tried selecting New (file) to see if that helped.&nbsp; The same is true for all of the Office Suite except for SharePoint which did not have a previous version.&nbsp; With SharePoint, the 2010 version opens.<br />

            This is what I'd do if I were having a problem like this....<br />
<br />
I'd uninstall Office 2010 from my windows mobile device<br />
I'd install <a href="http://www.s-k-tools.com/index.html?sktools/m_feat.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SKTools</a> to the phone<br />
I'd reinstall Office 2010 to my phone<br />
<br />
Then <a href="http://frommypocket.pocketprimer.com/2009/04/01/rearranging-applications-on-a-mobile-device.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I'd go check SKTools to find out where Office 2010</a> was installed on the phone.<br />
If the shortcuts that you use to access the application still point to the old version of Office, you could either edit the shortcuts to fix them so they point to the Office 2010 applications or you could create new shortcuts that point to the Office 2010 applications.&nbsp;
 See this artilcle, entitled "<a href="http://frommypocket.pocketprimer.com/2007/01/15/taking-shortcuts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Taking Shortcuts</a>" for more information about how to create &amp; edit shortcuts on a windows mobile device (I wrote this article several
 years ago, but it's still applicable to your phone).<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot preview txt &amp; html attachments in 64-bit Outlook 2013. Other office attachments work fine. The preview handlers work fine in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is this file cannot be previewed because of an error with the following previewer:<br />
Windows TXT Previewer/Html Previewer</p>
<p>To open this file in its own program, double-click it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue or is there any fix available?</p>
<p>I think I have never seen them working on x64 installation.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Is the computer on network/domain?</p>
<p>What type of email account is configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Exchange and Exchange Active Sync)?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no diagnostic tool available to find out when and where the problem is created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may check if you can find the event viewer logs which will display the application name which is causing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to open Event Viewer in Windows 8.1:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>1. Right click the left hand corner of your Windows 8 screen.</p>
<p>2. Click Event Viewer.</p>
<p>3. Expand Windows Logs.</p>
<p>4. Click System. There you will see a list of events represented by a red stop arrow or yellow exclamation. Click on either to view details of the problem that occurred.</p>

<p>Hello Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and I verified in my environment that a user could only see, so we started to check and identify some differences, I performed the procedure on a computer with the problem and it was solved.<br />
Follow the procedure:<br />
</p>
<p>1- Quit Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Copy the .DLLs and folder to the "C: \Program Files\Windows Mail" and "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Mail"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b51ff504-6ebf-4cc6-858f-5cf8a9695c89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b51ff504-6ebf-4cc6-858f-5cf8a9695c89" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You will need the required .DLLs, in my case I copied from the machine that worked.<br />
<br />
3- Create a ".reg" file with the following script making as needed bold changes::</p>
<p>

            no idea, will have to haggle your local nokia centres to get a release date for your region. however, reviews and news say that 5800 will probably not be available until Q1 next year. bummer.

<h2>            SMS sync not using incremental mode</h2>
                    I'm using my phone service for a while<br />
when i was first time installed it and using it, it can sync SMS using&nbsp;<span>increment</span>al mode<br />
ie, when&nbsp;my mobile&nbsp;device increase with 1 SMS, when&nbsp;synchronization, it just add 1 SMS in my phone website<br />
but after format my mobile device, and installed my phone service again and sync up.<br />
when next time&nbsp;synchronization, my phone application will delete all the SMS in website and add all local as new.<br />
it was strange, everytime it cost me too much battery.

<p>Yes, it was a scam. You should contact your bank immediately and stop payment.</p>
<p>I would do a fresh install on your system to clear up any possible malware planted by them.</p>
<p>After your machine is clean, then you should change all your online passwords as they could be compromised too. Or at least do this from another machine.</p>

<p>It's a common scam that you could have ended with the Task Manager. Now you must consider everything on your computer has been compromised. Passwords, PIN numbers, financial account information. A clean install of Windows is a good option, but at the very
 least, the following.</p>

<h2>            Deleted Email From Inactivity</h2>
                    <p>i have a couple of deleted @live accounts due to inactivity, I need to access them for certain verification purposes, i tried to re-create them but it said "This email is part of a reserved domain. Please enter a different email address." I have a hotmail
 account that I still use and i came across adding email alias, and i was wondering if i can add the deleted @live accounts to my hotmail account as alias emails, allowing me to be able to see the emails being sent to my deleted accounts. is this possible??
 if this doesn't work, is there any other possible way to get those emails being sent to my deleted accounts somehow? or any way to revive those deleted email accounts?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> To keep your Outlook.com account active you must <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=267895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>sign in</strong></a> to the account at least once every 365 days. </p>
<p>After 365 days of inactivity, <strong>your email</strong> will be deleted and cannot be recovered.
</p>
<p>After 5 years of inactivity, your Microsoft account <strong>will be deleted</strong> and cannot be recovered.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Have you a Back up of all your important email data that you can access?</p>
<div>
<div>If your data is important it is prudent to back it up, especially if it is in the cloud and not under your control</div>
<div>When you signed up for the email account there was (in the fine print) the Terms of use which clearly said that the user is responsible for the data and not Microsoft.</div>
