            Hi  kesavsreejath
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try these options to go back to Home:
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Click Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type:
<br /> slmgr /ipk &lt;ProductKey&gt; 
<br />
<br />(Replace &lt;ProductKey&gt; with one of these below)
<br />
<br />    YTMG3-N6DKC-DKB77-7M9GH-8HVX7 
<br />
<br />Exit the Command prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />Option 2: 
<br />
<br />There is another way you might be able to downgrade to Home without having to reinstall everything, but its pretty advanced. 
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor (WIN + R, type regedit, hit Enter) 
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion
<br />Change EditionID to Core (double click EditionID, change value, click OK). In your case it should at the moment show Pro
<br />Change ProductName to Windows 10 Core. In your case it should at the moment show Windows 10 Professional
<br />Browse to key HKEY_Local Machine &gt; Software &gt; Wow6432Node &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows NT &gt; CurrentVersion, change the same two values as in steps 3 and 4 above
<br />Close the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Download and launch the Media Creation Tool, do an in-place upgrade by launching the setup from desktop (not booting with Windows 10 Home install media)
<br />When asked, enter your valid Windows 10 Home product key then select what to keep (settings, personal files and apps, only personal files or nothing)
<br />Windows 10 Home in-place upgrade will be done now. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. 
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That‚Äôs it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            Hi, 
<br />for home computer this error code says the activation and possibly installation were made illegally. This could do unfair seller, technician or any other person during computer repairing. 
<br />So you need to use factory tool to restore Windows or to ask authorized service workshop to restore licensed Windows.

            Hi kesavsreejath
<br />
<br />To resolve this, you will need to backup your data and clean install the Home Single Language version of Windows 10, to get that version, you need to install version 1703 of Windows 10, which Microsoft does not make readily available . . 
<br />
<br />This is a reliable and safe method to create version 1703 Windows 10 Bootable Media
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 ISO (any version)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then use Rufus to create the bootable installation media from that ISO:

<p>Hello touchdragon,</p>
<p>I suggest you try&nbsp;a different mouse to verify that your hardware is good. Otherwise, you need to check and see if the game is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Next, r<span>un System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, right click CMD<br />
Click ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.</span></p>

            Press Alt-H A. If that doesn't tell you, press <em>Escape </em>twice, then Alt-F B. The latest version is 15.4.3555.0308. If you've been running WLMail for the past three years without updating, you may still be running WLMail 2009. The last version of
 that is 14.0.8117.0416. Think hard before updating/upgrading, and back up all your data (accounts, messages and contacts). Better ask your other questions first.

<h3> onstagecorpse2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Gamertag password</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm in the unfortunate position of not knowing the password to my Xbox LIVE account and Gamertag.</p>
<p>I got my Xbox 360 when it first came out, many years ago, and when I was very young. When it asked me for an email address to link to my profile, I didn't have an email. So I quickly hopped on my computer, made a bogus email with bogus details, and linked
 it up. My Xbox Gamertag is, and always has been,&nbsp;OnstageCorpse.</p>
<p>Years later, I can't do anything with my profile because I've forgotten the password.&nbsp;My Xbox still tells me the email address&nbsp;I made&nbsp;(it's
<strong>[Removed by Moderator]</strong> for some reason), but I can't access it. I've spent hours trying to guess the password with no luck. All the personal details I put into the account were rubbish numbers, so I can't recover the password from Yahoo. I've
 tried everything I can think of to somehow recover it, but nothing has yet worked.</p>
<p>So my question is, is there anything I can do? I'd hate to lose years of progress on my Gamertag just because of a stupid mistake I made all those years ago, but I'm out of ideas. Can somebody help me? Thanks a lot for any advice or suggestions.</p>

            Hi and thank you for your response.&nbsp; I have tried this twice and while it fixes it for a while, it comes back after a short time.&nbsp; Is there a way to defeat this function all together?&nbsp; Why would anyone want to save a solitaire game anyway?&nbsp; Rather defeats
 the purpose doesn't it?&nbsp; And share???? seriously???? why???

    <title>Fix Needed&#58; Win 10 First Anniversary Upgrade Has Alert Pop Up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fix Needed&#58; Win 10 First Anniversary Upgrade Has Alert Pop Up Opening at Every Startup. Getting error message &#34;Security Warning  C&#58;&#92;Program Files&#92;Synaptics&#92;SynTP&#92;SynTPEnh.exe&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Fix Needed: Win 10 First Anniversary Upgrade Has Alert Pop Up Opening at Every Startup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I downloaded and installed the Windows 10 First Anniversary upgrade yesterday (Aug. 2), an alert pop up has been opening every time I start or restart my Gateway laptop.
<br />
<br />
The alert is about a file named "SynTPEnh.exe." That is a Synaptics file that I got from Gateway last February when I got a driver to fix my trackpad (a driver not findable via Windows Update, you have to go to Gateway direct to get it.)<br />
<br />
I have not had this pop up since February, it started only after upgrading to Win 10 First Anniversary yesterday.
<br />
<br />
After a lot of effort and trials and tribulations, I finally came to realize this is being thrown up by Windows Defender. I have devised a workaround, but I would like to get this fixed properly (and the workaround does open a loophole for a longshot malware
 attack, unlikely but possible).<br />
<br />
I am inserting a picture of the pop up. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e030d7db-4220-401c-989f-3807b080069a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e030d7db-4220-401c-989f-3807b080069a" /></a><br />
<br />
Yes, I saw the check box to uncheck: "Always ask before opening this file." I'm supposed to be able to uncheck that, and then the pop up will stop coming up. However, unchecking it does not seem to take, it comes up next time I start up or restart anyway, and
 with that box checked all over again. Something seems to have been broken in the Win 10 upgrade, possibly in Windows Defender, that is not allowing the unchecking of that box to be held, and so the pop up just keeps popping up whenever I start up.<br />
<br />
The work around I found was in settings in Windows Defender -- it allows me to exclude a file I specify from being scanned. I put the name of this file in that list, it is the only one in the list. With that, the pop up stops coming up.
<br />
<br />
However, that exclusion function notified that not only would that specific file not be scanned, but also any file "associated" with it. That could open me to malware if the malware were to come in and "associate" itself with this file. Yes, I know that would
 be a longshot, but it still could happen, especially now that I've pointed it out in a public forum. And this file need be excluded only because of something misfunctioning because of the Win 10 upgrade -- something needs to be fixed so that pop up can be
 stopped as it is supposed to be able to, by unchecking that box.<br />
<br />
Mine is a Gateway laptop, running Windows 10 Home, listed as v. 1607, Build 14393.10. I have 4 GB RAM, 64 bit OS, 2.20 Intel Pentium CPU B960.<br />
<br />
That Synaptics file is listed as v. 17.0.6.13, and involves enhancements for my Synaptics touchpad.</p>

            <p>Thank you. And allow me to explain one point better. Yes, I am at Windows 10, First Anniversary. However, MS had the old one posted for download yesterday, even as late as 11 a.m. when I downloaded it. Since MS does not give the downloader any way to identify
 the download, you just have to act on faith, and so it turns out that I installed the November 2015 version all over again , because MS had the wrong version up. That is when this problem started, after installing that. But I have since gotten the correct
 download, and so am at First Anniversary, but the problem continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file got corrupted, it was during the install yesterday of the November 2015 version, which I already had on my computer. And installing the First Anniversary version simply carried over the problem, did not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I had thought I might try reinstalling the driver again. But since it controls the trackpad, and the trackpad is working perfectly, I am not so sure it is corrupted. And as they saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just one other point, you must have missed what I wrote about Windows not being able to get the driver I got from Gateway. If I get it, I will have to go to Gateway direct and download it direct.&nbsp; There are certain updates that Windows cannot get, and this
 is one of those, and it is machine specific. And without this updated driver, my trackpad is nearly useless. So, see the paragraph above about if it ain't broke - I don't want to start a problem I don't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, I guess reinstalling it is the first thing to try. But do at least note that it was the OS installation that damaged it, if it is damaged.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll get to that in the next couple days - I'm bogged down just now. I will report back.</p>
<p />

            <p>Reporting back: I uninstalled and reinstalled the driver, and that seems to have fixed issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One minor thing now missing, an icon in the task bar for that file is now not there, and I can't directly open the .exe file (probably because it is already loaded at startup) to get it in the Task Bar. I guess it doesn't produce a Task Bar icon like other
 things do when it is opened. That used to be in the Task Bar in the part&nbsp; where you click on the carat.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, the functions from that icon in the Task Bar are no big deal, I have never used them, can't imagine I ever would. I don't even remember what they were.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I reinstalled the driver, upon startup, that pop up window came up again. But now, all I had to do was unclick that one box asking that question, and this time it held, with that the pop up no longer comes up with a start up.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>And the trackpad seems to work just fine.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar Icons Blink or Refresh Randomly and Periodically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> studio sanctum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar Icons Blink or Refresh Randomly and Periodically</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">Does anyone here have any clue why Windows 10 taskbar icons randomly and periodically blink/refresh? It is driving me crazy!!! I have searched and
 searched to no avail. It has been reported time and again here and sadly the generic responses by the mods couldn‚Äôt be more pathetic. It‚Äôs as if when you ask a question here they throw up a bunch of canned responses and don‚Äôt even really consider the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">For no apparent reason at all the Windows 10 taskbar icons just blink/refresh randomly and periodically. Do Microsoft not see this GUI eyesore?
 Are other users so oblivious that they don‚Äôt see it either? If you do a Google search you will find that this has been going on for many years. How long does it take to fix an issue with Windows? How many years? What does it take to get Microsoft‚Äôs attention?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">T</span>he sad reality is that I bet MOST people wouldn't ever even notice, but my OCD is on level 10. It happens randomly, the icons in the taskbar
 will just blink, like they are refreshing. Same thing happens when you empty the trash. Give it a shot. Delete something and watch your desktop icons. This same blink happens in the taskbar randomly for no reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a former Mac user I can tell you that you DO NOT ever see crap like this. And if you did it would be fixed immediately.
<span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)"><span>Just have a look at this!

Google searches on this issue dating back to 2015!</a></span></span></p>
<p>And before any mod responds back with the same old generic canned responses, please just don't waste your time or mine. Take the time first to read all the posts on this issue already and all the "solutions" that have been given. I have tried them ALL. NONE
 of them work. I am on a brand new Windows 10 PC with the latest version of the OS and all drivers installed. I couldn't get a "cleaner" machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is this issue "just exists" and Microsoft is expecting people to just look the other way and ignore it. Not happening!</p>

            You obviously did not read my post and once again just posted a canned response with terrible advice. Let me speak loud and clear. This is NOT machine specific. I do not have a problem with my particular install. This is the 4th brand new powerhouse PC
 that I have built this year. They ALL exhibit this behavior with totally fresh clean installs of Windows starting day one from the very first bootup. Why won‚Äôt Microsoft acknowledge that this is a bug that has been plaguing Windows user for years now (not
 just me, search online). Please stop responding with generic canned responses that you copy and paste from some script you are reading! The denial is infuriating!!

<h2>            Lumia 640 LTE - Stopped working after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated windows OS in my Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE windows phone from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, phone started to behave weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can just accept the call with touch but not letting me enter my PIN to get to the home page ( I have a Work Email attached to this phone) and I am not able to go to home page and it seems performance is very BAD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone have similar experience with the update ? If I want to restore the factory settings, how do I do that if I am not able to get to settings ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks<br />

<h2>            Recovering Windows Live E-mail Storage Folders after crash</h2>
                    After a computer crash that required reinstalling Win 8, I reinstalled Windows Live E-mail; but I need to recover the storage folders. I have a backup (Acronis TruImage) but don't know where the folders are on the backup or on my computer. Also, since
 I'm using WLM now, I've created new storage folders so don't want to lose those when I reinstall the old folders.<br />

<h2>            0x80190001 error when trying to connect feedback hub</h2>
                    <p>i have difficulty connecting to feedback hub under certain attempts such as:</p>
<p>signing in settings of weather and some other points which lead me to to feedback hub.</p>
<p>I do not have any problem in windows updating</p>
<p>no problem in microsoft edge connect</p>

            Hi  umitsayman
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Feedback hub 
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates 
<br />
<br />You can also perform a repair upgrade which will reinstall Windows 10 while keeping your apps, files and settings in tact. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. 
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That‚Äôs it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:
<br />

    <title>What is &#34;Start Capture Service&#34; and why does it want my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> methodician  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is &#34;Start Capture Service&#34; and why does it want my password&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> After each computer restart a dialog pops up (screen shot below) info, saying "In order to start capture serviceyou need to provide administrator credentials" (and yes the missing space between "service" and "you" is verbatim making
 me even more suspicious this is a hacker overseas or whatever) and asking for my User Name and Password. I don't know what "Start Capture Service" is and declining to enter my username and password doesn't seem to have any downsides.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Questions:</strong> So, is this some phishing scheme? Who is really trying to get my login credentials and why? Is there any reason to provide my password? If not, how do I get this dialog to stop showing upon each restart? Most important: what the
 heck is "Start Capture Service"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've grown skeptical of this kind of behavior. It did start after a recent Windows update. Immediately after that update I lost my desktop background image, my icons rearranged, and some other system preferences were wiped, making me yet more suspicious.
 Of course, this is Microsoft so any and all of these things could be par for the course.</p>
<p>

            <p>I know, posting this AFTER windows 8.1 is released, am I right? hahaha, anyways...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-What you should do first is to start up the Task Manager and disable any third-party video engine management (catalyst, etc.) from start up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Restart your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Open the Control Panel and navigate to the Power Options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Click on Change Plan Settings next to the Active plan.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Click on Change Advanced Power Settings</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- The first culprit will be located here under Switchable Dynamic Graphics. The graphics card creates your glitch in reaction to the Maximize Performance option here. Switch to any other option. Click Apply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-Open any of the previously offending apps and check results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-So long as your issue is resolved at this point, open the task manager and re-enable your third-party graphics manager. Restart your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-If the problems return after restart, make sure that any hardware acceleration is based Per Program. Then you may want to play with your anti-aliasing options.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That is all I have. If there are still problems, you need somebody to look at your computer specifically. Or perhaps Windows 8.1 resolves all of this :P</p>

<p>Yeah, they usually don't pre-announce them when they are really bad.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it'll be some pointless DLC for something awful like Crackdown 2 and Risk Factions/Deadliest Warrior. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find a list of previous;y downloaded DLCs on your console via the Download History (System, Account, Download History) or go to this link (<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History</a>) and
 reload the DLC to your download queue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this solves your problem.</p>

<p>Go into your "Settings" and then you need to cling on "Account Management" from there you should see "Download History" once there you simply need to find the DLC and re-download. ^^</p>

            Hi Mike.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes you have a choice to go back to Windows 8 at any time you want.  We will help, all you have to do is ask.
<br />
<br />But to try to get the keyboard working try running the keyboard troubleshooter from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't fix it then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Finally if you want to go back to Windows 8 follow this tutorial to reinstall it:  <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clean-install-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clea...</a>
<br />You can download and create bootable media to do the install from here:  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/cr...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Message List issue with Windows Live Mail 2009</h2>
                    After a hard drive upgrade I am having an issue with Windows Live Mail 2009 that appears for messages imported from the backup folder. The message headers will not display true in the&nbsp;Message List&nbsp;pane for any other folders than the Inbox and all of those
 appear to have redownloaded from the mail server marked unread and do display normally in both the Message List and the preview pane. However all of the sent messages and drafts and saved messages which were imported appear&nbsp;as messages To my account and From
 my account in the&nbsp;Message List&nbsp;pane. The correct information appears on the full message headers of the saved messages, so this is a display issue involving the&nbsp;Message List&nbsp;pane. Also if the search function is used it will provide accurate search hits for
 keywords like the actual To field or From field for a sent message.&nbsp; So the correct data is definitely there on all the saved backup files and the search can find and group messages accordi

            <p>This is a well-known oddity in the import function that occurs in certain circumstances. To correct it,</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder for the sent items.</li><li>Create a new folder on the desktop.</li><li>Select the messages in the imported <em>Sent items </em>folder, drag them out of WLMail and drop them on to the new folder.</li><li>Open the new folder and check (e.g. using <em>Details</em> view and sorting by<em>Type
</em>) that all the messages have the extension .eml . Any message whose subject ends with a period ('.') will probably have the extension ._eml . This has to be corrected*.</li><li>Select all the messages and drag them back into the folder you created at (1).</li><li>If all is well, delete the original imported <em>Sent items </em>folder and the temporary folder on your desktop.<br />
</li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. However, the .eml&nbsp;backup files are&nbsp;NOT corrupted and the messages themselves are evidently not&nbsp;the issue which appears to be an application glitch.&nbsp;All of the messages&nbsp;display normally in the half window&nbsp;Message Preview Pane and display
 normally&nbsp;when opened full window&nbsp;in the Message Reading Pane and show correct headers there,&nbsp;unlike the incorrect From and To fields which appear in the Message List showing&nbsp;beside&nbsp;a preview pane.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;none of the file extensions for the files in the application
 folders&nbsp;appear corrupted so&nbsp;broken .eml&nbsp;file name&nbsp;extensions&nbsp;isn't or isn't apparent as&nbsp;the problem.&nbsp; The problem is IMO&nbsp;in the WLM&nbsp;application itself, something about the Message List pane application is not working correctly to recognize and sort and display
 the headers of the imported messages correctly.&nbsp;IMO the issue is&nbsp;not&nbsp;with the integrity of backup files which are being imported. Probably not an issue, but there is a wlmail.fol file in each folder but deleting it doesn't help either. Once I saw the file
 extensions are intact, I did not do the command line or copy / replace operation&nbsp;because&nbsp; I think, or&nbsp;am guessing&nbsp;the&nbsp;issue is an application&nbsp;glitch or&nbsp;error. However,&nbsp;it appears you are telling me the backup files being imported are corrupted even though&nbsp;the
 backup files&nbsp;look okay&nbsp;and they open fine ?&nbsp; The Message List pane is not&nbsp;reading snd sorting&nbsp;and displaying the message headers accurately, but the headers are definitely&nbsp;intact on the .eml files.&nbsp; Something in the application is not recognizing the message
 headers correctly.&nbsp;Is there a "message list" or message store inventory file "master list" that could be causing the issue ?</p>

            <p>It's a minor bug. The message list entries are extracted from the message database, while the displayed message is taken from the .eml file itself. As a message is imported, its headers (<em>From:</em>,
<em>To:</em>, <em>Subject:</em> and <em>Date:</em>) are written to the message database. This is where the error creeps in for some reason. I didn't say anything about corruption or integrity of the imported messages.<br />
<br />
When a message is dragged from the WLMail interface to an Explorer folder, the program creates a new file with the subject of the message as its name and eml as its extension. If the subject happens to end in a period, which it often does, the filename would
 be <em>subject..eml</em>, which is highly likely to give problems in some circumstances. WLMail helpfully converts one of the periods to an underscore character, but unfortunately picks the wrong one to convert.
<br />
<br />
If you then try to drag a bunch of .eml files into the WLMail interface, if just one of them has the extension ._eml, the process will fail.<br />
<br />
If you drag a selection of properly-named .eml files into a WLMail folder, they will again be indexed, but this time without the
<em>From/To</em> confusion. <br />
<br />
The wlmail.fol file is a simple text file telling the importing program the name of the folder. Deleting it will simply mean that the importing program won't know the name of the folder it's importing from.<br />
<br />
Trust me - the drag-out/drag-back procedure has worked for all those who've asked about&nbsp;this problem&nbsp;before.</p>

            Thank you for&nbsp;your help. I certainly hope this works. A few thousand e-mails are affected so I want this issue&nbsp;fixed.&nbsp;Please clarify your instructions&nbsp;with&nbsp;more&nbsp;specifics. I know part or all of this is done from Explorer.&nbsp;For step 1 please&nbsp;confirm&nbsp;are
 you working in Windows Explorer with the WLM&nbsp;application closed ? &nbsp;All of this is under the hood in Explorer with WLM closed, if&nbsp;I am understanding correctly.&nbsp;For steps 1 and 2 do you mean create&nbsp;TWO separate new folders, if so do you mean&nbsp;from Explorer&nbsp;create
 a&nbsp;New&nbsp;Folder&nbsp;inside the account folder in the WLM application folder?&nbsp; The existing folder named Sent Items will need to be deleted and the New Folder renamed to Sent Items&nbsp;complete the process, if I am understanding correctly.&nbsp;Or should the renaming of the
 New Folder be delayed until AFTER the WLM application is opened and renamed from within WLM ? &nbsp;Anyway I&nbsp;am not clear e

            No joy on the suggested&nbsp;fix. Your proposed fix has been tried a couple of different ways and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;NOT working for me.&nbsp; This appears to be a significant application FAULT not a "minor bug" looking at this from where I am sitting. Only the Inbox messages
 which are redownloaded from the mail server are synchronizing and displaying true headers in the Message List pane adjacent to the Preview pane.&nbsp; ALL the other folders have an incorrectly displaying Message List pane.&nbsp; I have even deleted the Mail.MSMessageStore
 file and its backup file stored in the Backup folder of the WLM&nbsp;program folder in order to force the reindexing and that did not work either. How about it Microsoft ....what is the story on fixing&nbsp;this "minor bug"????&nbsp; I am not a novice user.&nbsp;Already uninstalled
 and reinstalled WLM and the "minor bug" is persistent. I have good eml backup files that won't display true in the Message List pane&nbsp;after importing from backup folders.&nbsp

            <p>It's not a good idea to do any file and folder manipulation in Windows Explorer, because all such actions will be invisible to the message database whose job it is to keep track of which messages are where. The folders you see in WLMail are virtual folders
 with only superficial&nbsp;resemblance to those in the store folder in Explorer. This is normally of no consequence, because the database knows what's what.</p>
<p>The instructions&nbsp;I gave are for the common fault of incorrect display of <em>To</em> and/or
<em>From</em> in the <em>Sent items</em> message list after import or recovery, but should apply equally to other folders with the same fault. I thought they were pretty unambiguous:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 is to create a new folder <em>in WLMail</em> to contain the 'massaged' files.
</li><li>Step 2 is to create a folder on the desktop, then </li><li>Step 3 to drag messages <em>from</em> the message list for the WLMail folder where they're incorrectly displayed
<em>into</em> the new folder on the desktop.&nbsp;<br />
This makes use of the WLMail feature that creates a new file when a message is dragged out of the program interface.</li><li>Step 5 is to drag these new files back into the WLMail interface. Once the program has had time to index them, the message list display anomaly should be no more. If it is, the original messages that didn't display properly can be deleted - Step 6.</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling the program will not have any effect on the store folder, so it's not clear to me what you were trying to achieve by doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can only suggest that you follow the instructions carefully on a small&nbsp;batch of messages - a couple of dozen, say - to see what is supposed to happen and to convince yourself that it works. I would also suggest that while trying to sort this out, you set
 WLMail to <em>Work offline</em>, disconnect from the network and disable all&nbsp;running security software in order to minimize interference with the complex processes that are going on.
<br />
<br />
Each time you conduct an operation on a batch of files, allow WLMail to settle down before moving on to the next batch. You can see how busy the program is&nbsp;by&nbsp;keeping an eye on wlmail.exe in Task Manager or Resource Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            <p>The problem has been resolved and more than 8,000 messages are now each and every one displaying accurately.&nbsp;Actually what helped was simply remembering how I had done this once before several years ago and the issue then was the same as now, my own lack
 of having concise instructions from the software provider.&nbsp; Yeah I figured it out that you can't really go under the hood in the closed program and move files or copy into files or substitute folders as was possible to do without any issue in the old Outlook
 Express as Windows Live Mail is a different animal with associated programs other than the e-mail interacting somehow with the data base for the message stores and there is a dynamic index which requires file manipulation from within the GUI of the open application
 "by the numbers" and preferably while offline.&nbsp; So I'm going to spell out the lowdown on the issue and include a bit of a rant towards Microsoft for not having this information in a basic Help File or prominently easily available as basic instructions regarding
 Backup AND Restoring procedures for Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; What happens is everybody does Backups and it becomes routine ....but it is rare that a Restore is done and it is already stressful because something broke and usually a hard drive or a power supply ....but
 it may be years before that occurs so people forget the details of a rather unusual type of Restore for an application.&nbsp;After freshly installing WLM and being told there is a shortcut for opening the application found in the programs menu #1 go offline ....pull
 the power plug or disconnect the modem . #2 Go to the shortcut in the programs menu and open WLM&nbsp;#3&nbsp; Go to Tools&gt;Accounts&gt;Import&nbsp;and browse to your exported to backup&nbsp;.iaf files for your Mail accounts and open / import each .iaf file.&nbsp; A set of default folders
 will be created automatically associated with each account.&nbsp;#4 Go to File&gt;import&gt;messages&gt;select Windows Live Mail for the file type (.eml ) &gt; Browse to your exported Msgs folder and click on it &gt; Next &gt; select All Folders The importing will take a few minutes
 and the imported files will not go into the default folders which were created automatically when the Mail accounts were created, but will appear in the Storage Folder in a subfolder named Imported Folder.&nbsp; After the importing of the messages completes, #5&nbsp;Expand
 the Imported Messages Folder and highlight the first on the list which should display a Message List pane that reads correctly with the Preview pane. Usually the first message on the list will be automatically highlighted, but if it is not highlighted then
 do that manually. #6 Edit&gt;Select All &gt; Edit &gt; Move To Folder &gt; highlight the target destination folder of the same name in the default folders that were automatically created for the associated account &gt; click OK and all the messages will be moved from that
 one folder in the Imported Folder to the active account destination folder. After the files move is complete # 6 Highlight the second folder on the list and repeat the procedure for #5 for each folder descending.&nbsp; If there is not a folder of the same name
 as the folder from which the file is being moved from the Imported Folder, then create a new folder having the same name in the destination account folder.&nbsp;# 7 After the contents of all the folders have been manually moved to the active account folders, delete
 all the empty folders. This may be done at one time by deleting the Imported Folder.&nbsp; This is the way that works.&nbsp; I am not a Microsoft MVP and I did not stay at a Holiday Inn last night .....because I was drinking coffee all night and figuring this out for
 the second time in the past five years.</p>
<p>Now it is so simple and user friendly huh ....so why on earth wouldn't Microsoft want to prominently post the 7 magic steps to spare folks hours and hours of futility .....knowing very well there is only one way it works and that is the 7 steps I just described
 ?&nbsp; I'm tired now so I will just leave it with the masterminds who think we need browsers with 4 layered tool bars to add to the grief of a wide screen format that is already too short on vertical screen real estate.&nbsp; They ought to turn that widescreen format
 sideways, it would be closer to right for their theory on aspect ratio along with some other things like for example&nbsp;easy to find instructions on restoring Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Where is my little green&nbsp;planet icon for a&nbsp;history shortcut in Internet Explorer
 ?&nbsp; Small world disappeared&nbsp;didn't it. &nbsp;Why make such a useful shortcut obsolete and substitute nonsensical&nbsp;and untrimmable stacked toolbars ?&nbsp; The same rationale as doesn't post simple Backup and Restore instructions for the cornerstone e-mail program for
 the world.&nbsp; Okay I'm done with my rant.&nbsp; Tell me it isn't justified.&nbsp; Anyway thanks to those who tried to help, but this is a road I have travelled before .....and simply forgot how it was done because it has been awhile.&nbsp; Now I have my 8,000 plus e-mails
 squared away nicely......again....just like before.&nbsp; Might be something there huh.</p>

            <p>After uninstalling WLM.... I navigated to the directory and deleted the entire WLM folder before reinstalling WLM.&nbsp; Also I&nbsp;ran a registry cleaner and repair before doing the reinstall. And yes I did go offline and had an eye on task monitor every second.&nbsp;
 It was pulling about 15 to 40% CPU load steadily for WLM which is ten times normal CPU activity. But my anitvirus I should have exited because it was taking CPU to 100% here and there ...AVG really did not like what I was doing ....so yeah good advice to exit
 any security programs so they don't have a coniption fit over the rather extreme processes that are running.&nbsp; But hey whatever works.....if it gets the job done.&nbsp; The 7 steps do work.&nbsp;

<h2>            windows 7 home premium update</h2>
                    <p>I am not a computer expert so bear with me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clerk at the computer store in town informed me today that my windows 7 home premium computer cannot and will never be able to be transferred to windows 10.</p>
<p>About 3 months ago or so i went to a microsoft page and I thought it said that i was able to do so and that they would contact me when I could update my computer with windows 10 . I have an icon thing on my computer now that says "get windows 10" After reserving
 an update I thought it said microsoft will contact me when this will happen. He suggested i buy a new computer with windows 10 already on it or one that will be updated automatically if i wanted to try windows 10. He also said microsoft didnt know how to update
 the computers that are old due to a glitch they didnt know about when they promised people to update windows 7 computers like mine and that nobody who has windows 7 home premium can ever get windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to make sure he is correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He is wrong. Lots of people with Windows 7 Home Premium have moved to Windows 10. Quite a few have also suffered terrible disasters. Some of their machines are beyond repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any strong reason to move to Windows 10? If not then you might want to continue using Windws 7 until you replace your PC. Windows 7 will be fully supported until January 2020.</p>
