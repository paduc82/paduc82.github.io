    <title>How do I disable Styles Pane in Word 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I disable Styles Pane in Word 2016&#63;</h2>
                    The 'Styles Pane' just keeps popping up and blocking my text when I am trying to write a document. I don't want the WORD screen all the way open all the time. How can I disable the Styles Pane and keep it disabled. I already check Preferences and if there
 is a command there, it was not obvious. Thanks, Mark

            <p>There is no means of disabling the Styles Pane altogether... Word is a Styles-based program, so that would be a rather counterproductive step :-) However, there are 2 considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>AFAICT there is no 'trigger' to display the Styles Pane other than by clicking the Styles Pane button on the Home tab of the Ribbon or use of the built-in keyboard shortcut
<strong>Shift+Command+Option+s</strong> (unless you've assigned a custom keystroke), &amp;</li><li>When the Pane <em>does</em> display it always should be in a docked position on the right side of the document window. Even if it had been floating when last closed it should return as docked when next summoned, There's no reason for it to 'block' any text
 unless you manually drag it to a floating position.</li></ol>
<p>If the situation is as you describe, something is amiss with your installation. Before any troubleshooting it would be best to first confirm that;</p>
<ul>
<li>your Version of OS X is fully updated, &amp;</li><li>your installation of Office 2011 is fully update [v15.23 is current]</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">If using Yosemite, run Disk Utility to repair disk permissions, then Restart your Mac after applying any updates.</p>
<p>If those steps don't resolve the issue, please reply with verification of the version info as well as any additional details you can supply.<br />

            <p>Sorry, your answer was not helpful. You incorrectly stated that the 'Styles Pane' is ONLY triggered by clicking the Styles Pane button, or by using a complex keystroke. That is simply not the case. I ONLY use the tool bars to edit, and the use of the tools
 bar routinely opens the Styles Pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, if the WORD working window is not fully open, the Styles Pane pop-up will block the work window until you manually close it. I have NEVER dragged a floating window anywhere. Again, perhaps I did not express myself clearly, but your answer did
 not respond to my question.</p>

            <p>Are you sure your using Word 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made two screenshots (and reduced them by 50% &nbsp;to post here) showing Screen with style menu not activated and Activated. Note I don't use the fancy Clors I use classic Gray style:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-Activated:<br />

<p>Explanation of Annotations in Activated style menu:</p>

<li>Circle indicate location of Style Menu</li><li><span>Doubled-sided arrow pointing between Style menu button and Text annotation</span></li><li><span>Second double-sided arrow from Text the partial view of the&nbsp;</span>opened style elements.</li></ol>
<p>If the above don't look like your screen first go to Word menu&nbsp;→ About word.</p>
<p>It should verify it is 15.21 or above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word 2011 Looks different and style menu is accessed differently. &nbsp;I will post another Reply immediately after this one to show differences.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Are you using Skype for Desktop or Skype for Windows 10 (UWP)? Also, may I know what status you’re seeing on that specific contact? If you add someone
 on Skype, </span><span>the person is added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request. After they’ve accepted your request, you can see when they’re online and make free voice

<p>Hi Van</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Window 7. &nbsp; The issue is that some of my friends who I been chatting with via skype for many years, &nbsp;have suddenly become "new people" to me (suddenly they are no longer in my contact list!). &nbsp;When I try to add them back to my contact list via
 the button "add to my contact list" that appears in the chat window I have with those people, it is simply not functioning. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried any possible way wanted to add them back to my contact list but still in vain. &nbsp; Could you provide any alternative way that would allow me to add them back to my contact list ?<br />
</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
</p>

            WHat I'm suggesting will display the value of { MERGEFIELD X } (e.g. you might have { MERGEFIELD Client } instead) as the prompt in the dialog box. Then you type the contract date in the dialog box, and the FILLIN should display the result.

<h2>            Office 365, student version. Cant use it probably, since its blocked and i cant edit it.</h2>
                    <p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the office 365 student version. And when I first installed it, it was working perfectly.
</p>
<p>But then after a few weeks it would block the programmes and say I didn't have the license to use it and I had to login with a different login. I tried to log out and log in again - that didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I haven't been able to use it for weeks. </p>
<p>I went to the IT support at my university (#### University), and they weren't able to help me as well. Because everything on their system was alright. They said that I had to call Microsoft and talk to you guys, and after a big struggle with just getting
 through, they told me that they couldn't help me and my university had to make a case in the Microsoft portal.
</p>
<p>But my IT support at my university had never heard about that but tried anyways. They told me to write here to you guys and try on the phone again even though I was told that you couldn't help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically I have a Microsoft that doesn't work and nobody can help me with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope you can help me since I need Office for my school work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many regards&nbsp;</p>

            In the long run, you will need to work this out with your school's IT department. It is possible that your computer came with a trial version pre-installed. That could be interfering.

            I second flagpole on that. Nokia nHD screens are simplt too thin for qwerty in portrait mode! They're like just 2/3 the width of an Android phone screen, and even on my SGS I am sometimes mistyping on portrait qwerty, and I dont have large fingers IMO.<br />
<br />
On a lighter note, Anna update will have portrait qwerty all over the interface.

<h2>            Outlook 365 can&#39;t connect to my Gmail server</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I had to reinstall Office 365.&nbsp; I setup outlook with my personal Gmail account and it connected fine, but when I try to add my business Gmail account, it keeps saying that it cannot connect to the server.&nbsp; I triple checked my IMAP server settings and except
 for the username and password, they are identical to the ones for my personal account.&nbsp; I really do not understand because it was working fine in my previous installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The weird thing is that even though I cancelled the addition of my business e-mail account, Outlook did add it to the list on the left and it also created the .ost file.&nbsp; I am confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for your help.</p>

            A. Delete account and set it up again 
<br />Just delete existing account from your Outlook and set it up again. Just put your gmail ID and it will set up everything for you.
<br />
<br />B. Change gmail settings
<br />1. Go to gmail account 
<br />2. Click on profile pic &gt; My Account 
<br />3. Sign-in &amp; Security 
<br />4. Click on Apps with Account access 
<br />5. go down and set Allow less secure apps to ON. 
<br />
<br />Just do it once and check whether it works or not. If it works, make it OFF again, if you are more security conscious. Then you can opt for 2 step verification in gmail.

<p>Hi and thank you or your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot let Outlook setup the account automatically because even though it is a Gmail account, I use my own domain. Outlook can never find the server.&nbsp; I have setup this account manually multiple times and never had this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried again and this time, it says it could not create the Outlook Data file because the disk might be full or write protected.&nbsp; The thing is, it does create the .ost file and my personal e-mail .ost file, which works, is in the same folder.&nbsp; So what
 gives?</p>

            1. Try to do like this - Right click on Outlook icon &gt; Run As Administrator. Now try to set up.
<br />
<br />2. If still having problem, create a new Outlook profile and use this to set up new account - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>

<p>Thanks for your time, E for Excel.&nbsp; I am still having the problem.&nbsp; I even tried to change the location of the data files and I still got the same message that it could not create the date file because the disk was either write protected or full, which it
 is not. I ended up setting up a forwarding rule in Gmail from my business account to my personal account and setting up a rule in Outlook to move e-mails from my business account to a specific folder. Not ideal, but workable.</p>

<h3> taywee139  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Word Files Opening in Read-Only Mode&#59; Save As not working either</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my Office apps and noticed that all the Word files on my hard drive open in Read-Only mode now. This has never happened before. I've tried looking for solutions but haven't found any that have worked. Of course, you can try saving the
 file with a new name, but even that's not working. I keep hitting the "save as" button after changing the file name but nothing happens. I've tried changing the properties of multiple folders by unchecking the Read-Only box in the attributes, but that doesn't
 work and the box appears to re-check itself when I go back and check the properties afterwards. However, I copied some of my files into my OneDrive folder and they open, edit and save like normal. This problem is extremely annoying. Is anyone able to help
 me? Thank you!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>My experience is this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have word documents saved in one drive.&nbsp; When I try to access them via the shared link, or directly in office 365, Word reports "Sorry.&nbsp; We ran into a problem"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to create a new document in office 365, Word's progress spinner just keeps spinning.&nbsp; No response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to create a new Excel&nbsp;spreadsheet in office 365, Excel reports "Access Denied - You do not have permissions to open this file in the browser."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on </p>
<p>- Internet Explorer 11.379.17763.0, update version 11.0.115 (KB4489873) </p>
<p>- Office 365&nbsp;Version 1808 (Build 10730.20304 Click to Run) semi Annual</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Version 1809 (OS Build 17763.379)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my license status in Word (desktop app) it says "unlicensed" which is incorrect.&nbsp; When I click "[Manage Account] | Admin | Setup Products" and access the office 365 portal, it shows my license assigned to my user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was working yesterday in OneDrive, nothing appears to be working today.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to note was there was a Microsoft Store update that occurred on my computer this AM&nbsp;(not initiated by me, or through windows update).&nbsp; There's&nbsp;no listing of the install in Windows Update, or Programs and Features.&nbsp; I only got a notification card
 that it was upgraded.&nbsp; And many of the apps in my windows start are now underlined and non functioning,&nbsp;or if on the start page, they are blacked out.&nbsp; One blacked out was the Adobe Acrobat Reader App.&nbsp; When I clicked on it, I got a window that said Acrobat
 Reader was now replaced by Microsoft Edge for PDFs.&nbsp; Did this under the hood Microsoft Store install goober my licensing for Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I need my OneDrive documents to work.&nbsp; It's impacting my business substantially.&nbsp; I've been trying to troubleshoot this all day.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read every words in your post carefully and I want to share you my idea.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your experience, I suppose your license was interrupted by Windows update, Have you reactivate your office and use Word regularly now?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Although there is no relationship between desktop client and OneDrive online, I just care about your latest situation and I can give you some suggestions about activation by the way.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let's focus on the slow in OneDrive for business.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There are so many reasons could cause delay (the size of files, network environment, browser, three-part apps), it will cost you a lot of time to troubleshoot and I know you have already spend a lot of time on finding root cause. In order to save your
 time, I strongly suggest you using </span><span style="font-weight: bold">OneDrive sync client</span><span> that will allow you open the files stored in OneDrive like open the files locally. You can
</span><span>access your files even when you’re offline.</span><span> You can read
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/sync-files-with-the-onedrive-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Sync files with the OneDrive sync client in Windows</span></a><span> for details.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope my answer give you some assistance.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eric<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            There are different types of security WiFi can use, but it sounds like your university is using WPA2-Enterprise. When you move around the uni, do the access points use the same name?

<ol>
<li>Go to <b>Settings</b> on the phone</li><li>Navigate and tap <b>Wifi</b></li><li>Flick Wifi off or on.</li></ol>

            <p>Greetings hirababulogantha!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!<br />
<br />
It's my understanding that Windows Phone itself&nbsp;isn't capable of logging into all of the&nbsp;nearest WiFi hotspots automatically&nbsp;just because&nbsp;all share the same SSID (name).&nbsp;&nbsp; This usually takes software on the University side to pass your MAC Address around from
 hotspot to hotspot to let each piece of University equipment know you are ok to log into each with the same credentials.&nbsp; Otherwise, you will need to log into each of the major hotspots manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Having said that, as you start creating a profile for each hotspot, over time the phone will begin to automatically log into those that you already have a profile for; presuming the MAC Address of the current hotspot is the same as it was previously.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The downside to this kind of environment (having a Network with the same SSID on all network points) is that it becomes easier for an evil 3rd party to attempt a "Man in the Middle" attack, mimicking the known SSID used by the University.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you have a quick chat with your University's IT staff to find out what you should and shouldn't be able to do...<br />
<br />

<p>Yes it can be updated if the device vendor makes it available.&nbsp; Sometimes a device cannot handle the increased functionality so they will not provide an update.</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for your help on this.&nbsp; I think my issue is how to set the first label.&nbsp; I do have the merge set to labels and then am choosing to finish &amp; merge.&nbsp; I'm totally sure it's operator error!&nbsp; I just can't get it figured out.</p>
<p>Any more suggestions?</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by "how to set the first label". Your initial post indicates you have one label appearing in the output, which implies you've done its setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing in your reply indicates you did the 'update labels' step...</p>

    <title>Help, Please&#58; Where&#39;s My Calendar&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no idlady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help, Please&#58;  Where&#39;s My Calendar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>EDIT:&nbsp; UPDATE -- help still needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've found the problem, but I have no idea how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, the Calendar (as well as the Birthday and Holiday calendars) in the Exchange ActiveSync data file wound up in that data file's Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; I'm personally suspicious that it happened when I was messing around with iCloud-Outlook integration
 because I'm absolutely positive I didn't delete the Calendar, but . . . </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, how do I move the Calendar out of the Deleted Items folder because normal methods don't seem to be working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reasons I don't understand, the deleted Calendar wasn't visible in the Deleted Items in the normal view.&nbsp; The only way I found it was by clicking the three "Show More" dots at the bottom (Mail, Calendar, People, Tasks, . . .) and choosing Folders:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26b02ef6-31d8-4e01-b450-a310cd7bddfe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26b02ef6-31d8-4e01-b450-a310cd7bddfe" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to drag &amp; drop the Calendar out of the Deleted Items folder, and right-click doesn't give me the option to Move or Restore the Calendar, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>________________________________________</p>
<p>I'm feeling really stupid here, but I've somehow "lost" the ability to see the Calendar I use in Outlook and would appreciate some help finding it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll explain the best I can, but please feel free to ask for clarification if I don't explain well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Outlook 2013 (15.0.4797.1003, part of MS Office 365 ProPlus) on a Windows 7 Pro machine.&nbsp; Because I need to be able to sync my Calendar and Contacts with my Windows Phones, I&nbsp;set up an Exchange ActiveSync account for Calendar &amp; Contacts (only)
 a couple/few years ago&nbsp;-- that's the only Calendar I use and I use it all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;That data file&nbsp;also set as my default data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I noticed that when I went to the Calendar to add a new appointment, the calendar that was displayed was
<strong>not</strong> the calendar I use.&nbsp; I have no idea when/how that happened -- the last new appointment I added was&nbsp;about 10 days ago&nbsp;and everything was normal then.&nbsp; (Except for adding new appointments, I mostly use the Reminders window rather than going
 to the actual Calendar, although I do use Calendar Search a fair amount for historical info.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reminders are still working as they should with the Calendar I use, thank goodness; also, the correct Calendar info shows when I hover my mouse over Calendar at the bottom of the OL window (Mail, Calendar, People, Tasks . . .).&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when I go to Calendar,
 the correct info shows in the To-Do frame on the right.&nbsp; But, the calendar info in the main (center) frame of the Calendar window isn't
<strong>my</strong> Calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't figure out how to add new appointments/events to
<strong>my</strong> Calendar.&nbsp; Also Search isn't finding stuff in <strong>my</strong> Calendar, which is a huge problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent quite a bit of time today trying to figure this out with no luck and am starting to panic -- my Calendar is how I keep track of everything important in my life going back to 9/2000 (that's not a typo).&nbsp; Since the correct&nbsp;Calendar still shows in some
 places (see above paragraph) and is syncing with my Windows Phone, I think it must still&nbsp;exist somewhere, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be <strong>extremely grateful </strong>for any help -- TIA.</p>

<h2>            Updating Windows Defender - Error Messages - FFFFFFFD, 80070714, 80070002,</h2>
                    <p>I need help please for a number of errors which have appeared since I updated to Windows 8.1 from 8.0. The first thing is the fact that Windows Defender has not Updated itself for 6 days, even though automatic updating is on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I surveyed the updated history items and noticed it had tried to update many times but failed each time. I have tried updating manually and just when you think it is about to finally finish, the update program stops and returns to the desktop screen, and
 when I check to see if it has been completed, I find it has again failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked through, and tried many so called solutions on this site with no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates and error messages I have received have appeared on the following Defender Updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.177.770</p>
<p>1.177.943.0</p>
<p>1.177.979.0&nbsp; - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1130.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1207.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1268.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1340.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1369.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>1.177.1485.0 - (KB-2267602)</p>
<p>
</p><p>plus others since. As mentioned, I have tried various "remedies" including the onsite diagnostic tool which comes up with nothing more&nbsp; than an error message itself - 0x80070002. I am at wits end and am about to stick an axe through my Windowsphone and was
 about to do the same with my "NEW" laptop. The laptop is 64 bit based which came new with Nortons Programs on it including Anti-Virus and anti-malware preloaded on it as trial software. I have uninstalled all Norton programs via the uninstall software program
 in the software and have removed other folders and files left behind which were not removed by the uninstall. Any advice would be appreciated, Cheers Cashy.</p>

            <p>Hi Defend Team, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it appears that all other updates to other programs have gone through successfully. The only update that I have had any trouble with is the Windows defender Updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unsuccessfully twice more since I wrote to the forum for help, with the same error message appearing 0x80070002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that Defender says I am up to date, yet the Update page says I was unsuccessful, including the history page...???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried&nbsp;as to which notification I should believe, and which is right and which is wrong...????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would the update say I was unsuccessful and to check communication with the net, and yet the other says the complete opposite, in that I am up to date..???.....the mind boggles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still at a loss as to what is going on and would appreciate any advice please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Have just Updated latest Silverlight Update, and was successfully completed. Again tried to update Windows defender with error message 80070002, stating it was not successful...???

            <p>Hi again Pa Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct answer is yes to all you questions. Uninstalled ALL Nortons Prog's, using the uninstall files that came with the programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logged onto the Symantec Website and downloaded the Norton Removal Tool, and logged off the internet and used the tool from the desktop. The program done its thing, and then assured me all Nortons files, folders, etc. had been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then closed everything down, logged off, restarted the machine, and hooked back up to the net, and then proceeded to update my Virus Definitions,..... VooWaallla, Error Updating Defender... message...80070002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How strange, that is??&nbsp; Virus Definitions KB2267602..(1.177.1833.0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I updated what looked to be 20 Odd Updates from Microsoft for Windows 8.1 etc. and guess what,...all updates went through......except..(you guessed it)..Virus and Malware definitions KB2267602...(1.177.1958.0).....Got me stumped!!..Why some and not
 the one I need. Have done a malware check, and came up clean, nil viruses etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am almost to the point&nbsp;of wiping this thing and going back to Vista. Clean hard drive, but not yet. Lucky my mother taught me to be patient and to persevere.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried most everything, so thought I'd give your suggestion a go. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had already done the business of using the "SymNRT utility" and followed Pa Bear's instructions as outlined above with nil results, I followed your link above to "manually" download the latest malware definitions, and then ran the Windows Update Diagnostic
 tool and it found another Updater error which it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down and restarted my machine, and then made a shortcut to the desktop from the download file of the manually downloaded updater and then run the update. It came up positive and all seems at this stage to be FIXED.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a quick scan (150,000 files) and Windows defender informs me that all is okay. I will complete a FULL SCAN later on this evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proof in the pudding, that all is well, will be tomorrow when,&nbsp;Windows Defender Updater updates the latest Malware Definitions. If all is well then, then perhaps the problem I have may be fixed. Fingers crossed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Guys, (for now that is)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Cashy.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been off the net trying to find and sort out my update probs, and have made things a bit worse, to the extent that I had to go out and buy this 3/4 version of a laptop today to help me out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been&nbsp;able to find the problem so now have to re-format the hard-drive and re-install all software. because unlike Windows98 I was unable to find a file with the re-install files for 8.0 or 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have I believe found some of the problems with the installation of new upgrades and updates with pre-installed Windows which comes as a package deal from manufacturing companies whom have an agreement with Microsoft for a leasing agreement. and it appears
 to me that this is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When purchasing a new Laptop for example. a Dell, Toshiba, or even the new little HP&nbsp; that I purchased today, I have noticed that each&nbsp;Brand has their own&nbsp;App Installer, Computer Diagnosis program, and Program Shell and also that updates "should be carried
 out through these programs" as the windows registration number is licensed through these and attached accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an update is carried out manually or automatically outside of this shell, then the Windows Registration number accorded to that particular appliance is bypassed causing the error messages, as the system does not recognise the new registration number given
 it by the upgraded version of windows and hence creates all the other problems&nbsp;with other upgrades and updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I right in going along this train of thought, as mostly the only solution is to re-install the original version and registered number? I would appreciate your thoughts on&nbsp;this and also PA Bears and Steve's as if this were to be the case then a whole lot
 of problems could be solved overnight, hopefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Guys, This may help and may not but is worth looking into. I firmly believe this is part of the problem.&nbsp; Cashy.</p>
<p>

            <p>The process for restoring to factory settings differs for each PC manufacturer, but in Windows 8.x there is an option available:</p>
<p>Restore, reset, refresh Windows 8:

<p>
</p><p>The junk that is installed by the PC makers should have no bearing on Windows Update functionality. The PC maker's maintenance programs typically update drivers and installed software from the PC maker only.</p>

<h2>            How to download and install the 64-bit version of Microsoft Security Essentials</h2>
                    <div>I have Windows 7 Home Premium (<strong>64-bit</strong>) with Internet Explorer 9. I downloaded the most recent version of Microsoft Security Essentials, located at
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a>.</div>
<div>How do I know that I downloaded the correct <strong>64-bit version</strong> of Microsoft Security Essentials? I clicked the blue "<strong>Free*download</strong>" button on the main page.
</div>
<div>However, I did <strong><u>not</u></strong> click beneath the "Free* download" button where it says "More languages and versions", and where it gives the option to download the 64-bit version.</div>
<div>What is&nbsp;the recommended way to download and install Microsoft Security Essentials (<strong>64-bit</strong>) on Windows 7 Home Premium (<strong>64-bit</strong>)? Is it required to go to "More languages and versions" to get the 64-bit version, or the "Free
 download" button auto-detects the operating system?</div>
<div>How I can be 100% sure I installed the 64-bit version of MSE if I just clicked the "Free* download" button and NOT specifically "More languages and versions" right underneath the button. Thank you so much!!</div>

            <p>Hi headlinneshow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize this isn't the perfectly comforting answer that clicking a few buttons and seeing a page confirming it's the proper version would be, but if it installed properly, updated properly, scanned properly, and is showing green indicating that it is protecting
 your system then it installed the proper version (otherwise you'd have had or be having problems doing some or all of the above).&nbsp; In essence, the fact that it works means you have the right version installed (and yes, the button is designed to detect and
 install the proper version if you don't do it manually).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>

<h2>            InfoPath 2003 - Form Won&#39;t Open</h2>
                    <p>I just created a pretty complex form and went to change the&nbsp;code for one of the buttons. The scripting module hadn't been installed on the computer&nbsp;I was&nbsp;using so I answered yes to the prompt to have it installed right then. I started to edit the code for
 the button - minor stuff - just to change views.&nbsp;After the install, instruction said to close InfoPath and re-open so that's what I did but I didn't finish the code so now there's an error and the form won't open. is there a way to edit the code of a form
 without opening it? Please tell me there is a way to open this form. I spent literally hours&nbsp;and hours on it.&nbsp; Here is the exact error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Form template: 
file:///C:\Users\Ginger\Documents\LI%20TaxCut\AddClient.xsn<br />
InfoPath cannot open the selected form because of an error in the form's code.<br />
The following error occurred:</p>

<p>Also, need be, you can save the XSN as source files by changing the file extension to CAB, opening the CAB and copying the files out. You'll find your script file there. To re-pack, right click manifest.xsf, select Design to open in Design mode and then
 Save As to save as an XSN again.</p>

<p>After hours of frustration I downloaded and installed Firefox.&nbsp; Opened the firefox browser and check the webcam at a site that was not working with IE11.&nbsp; The camera functioned perfectly.</p>

<p>That suggests you may be able to get further with IE by turning off Protected Mode (or perhaps putting the problem site in the Trusted zone).&nbsp; A related alternative would be elevating the iexplore.exe task.&nbsp; That would both turn off Protected Mode and give
 the task whatever extra permissions running as an administrator would give it.</p>

            Am not familiar with the SalesForce email process so first question is, does this occur when you are creating an email via SalesForce or when only using Outlook?
<br />
<br />The reason for the above question is the following describes a similar issue which if applicable would be something that needs to be addressed via SalesForce settings
<br />
<br />BCC is automatically populated in outgoing emails, how do I change this?

<p>Hi Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only happens when I'm using outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed my email setting in salesforce and selected "No" in the auto BCC: option but that didn't seems to make any difference in outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that helps</p>

            Unfortunately, as I originally mentioned, not familiar with Salesforce/Outlook integration. Provided the link as a possible cause if relevant but can't find anything current in reference to this specific issue.
<br />
<br />That said, my initial question would be - Does Salesforce result in the use an email template which may have become corrupted?
<br />
<br />As for a suggestion, would be to create a new Outlook profile in the event the profile as become corrupted and configure the email account again. (no need to delete the existing Outlook profile, just be sure to set the new profile as the default for the next time Outlook is opened for the purposes to determine if this resolves the problem)
