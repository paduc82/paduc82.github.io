<p>Good day Sir, thank you for taking precious time out of your busy schedule to read through my error and let alone making an effort to write back to me. I have attached an image with the error I get after rebooting and I have checked device manager, and things
 look normal there....Kindly advice or give me some insights to allay this problem.</p>

            <p>From the toast on the lower right hand corner, I see the USB stack couldn't recognize the device. However, I don't see any device in a failed state in the device manager - which is strange. At the least you should see an Unknown device under "Other" devices
 category. It's possible that the device failure is transient.&nbsp;In that, it fails initially but then it drops off and starts up fine. What's the device? I do see one composite device (most like a keyboard) in the picture. So your statement about all devices

Good day sir, thank you once again for your kind response. Yes I must admit that I find the behavior quite eccentric too. I have a attached a keyboard, mouse, etc to a four-ports USB HUB which I connected to one of the main USB ports on the Laptop. This is
 why I came to the conclusion that all devices do not work after a reboot. Perhaps it is a hardware glitch, I'm using&nbsp;Hp pavilion G6 Laptop, with Intel Core i5. I get automatic updates from Microsoft every now and then, so I failed to root out the problem that
 is why I had to seek help from professionals like you.

<h2>            Indie Games Will Not Work&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I Just recently downloaded the college lacrosse 2011 and NLL 11 indie games from the marketplace. For both games, they start up and display the typical green "indie game content is not rated by microsoft etc." screen and pause at that the screen. Then, with
 no error notice or anything it just reverts me back to the dashboard. I've already tried the delete and re-download methods and those failed. PLEASE HELP!!!</p>

<p>Hello there blackmamba185. Sorry to hear you're having trouble with the indie games playing on your console. Is your console set to US or another region? Usually, indie games aren't allowed to play outside certain regions, thus might be your problem. If
 you are set in the US, make sure your console has no restrictions towards games as well and is an adult account. If the issue still persists, try re-downloading your gamertag. It could be a problem of your gamertag being slightly corrupt which a re-download
 should fix. If the problem still continues, I would advise to call customer support to see if they can help you any further. Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Old Xbox360 wireless racing wheel&#58; Recalled</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I have an xbox360 racing wheel I recently wanted to start using again, and I found out it has some faulty parts or something. The wikipedia article(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_Wireless_Racing_Wheel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_Wireless_Racing_Wheel</a>)&nbsp;I
 read about it said the first models were recalled. It sounds pretty unsafe, really. I was wondering if I could get a replacement or some sort of rebate. I realize it's a long time after the recall, but still they sold me a faulty product. I called 18004MYXBOX,
 and basically the guy told me to post about it, he couldn't do anything.</p>

<p>Any advice? :3</p>

<p>-Carol x Brady</p>

<p>The only way it is possible to get refunded partially or fully is you need to return it to the retailer in its original packaging with the proof of purchase if it was online you need to email the finace department of the retailer</p>

<h2>            Long loading and freezing. DR3 and BF4 did i waste my money&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I recently got the xbone with deadrising 3 and battlefield 4. When i die on dr3 it just loads and loads until about 15 minutes go by and i just say f it and shut it off. I downloaded a 10GB update and it still has this issue even after ive reset multiple
 times. Battlefield 4 lets me in a match and i lag the whole game then when i go to another match it freezes where the dashes are in the upper right of the screen. What is going on here these are both new physical copies that have been updated and reset. Ive
 read on other peoples posts that this is common but that was in 2013. Do any of u still have this issue or am i alone? Have they still not fixed this? Youd think this would be top priority for microsoft to fix...&nbsp;</p>

<p>well battlefield I would say yes...I might have a total of 10 hours into that game since launch...and thats being optimistic and including the campaign...the campaign was the highlight of my battlefield 4 nights...very cool fighting scenarios on land/water/air....other
 then that...multiplayer lags half the time so I dont play much...though it is action packed and alot of fun on days when the servers seem to be running ok...which again with EA isnt reliable or enough of. &nbsp;I'm hoping the lag gets sorted out soon...but dont
 hold your breath. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't generally have the freezes, but the long loading times seems pretty standard (although it's supposed to be nowhere near 15 minutes; usually only supposed to take 1 minute or less) - it does it when you die in Ryse too. However, look at it this way
 - it never loads UNTIL you die; so, don't die and it won't have to load. That's a fairly good trade off, IMO, especially considering everything that happens in DR3. Also, don't worry; you get used to it. ;)</p>

<p>So everytime it freezes or doesnt load up i have to reset it by holding the power button for 5 seconds? Will this hurt the console eventually?</p>

<p>15 mins is far too long, it's crashed for sure, usually go back to home screen, press the options button, quit game properly and restart. It does not always need a hard reset. It's the game so dice at fault for bf4 :) not had this happen with titanfall yet...
 so could be bugs in the new games not being used to the system.</p>

<p>I know with Dead Rising 3 the loading times are on the long side but 15 minutes? that's way too long, have you tried deleting and re-installing the game and updates to see if that solves it?</p>
<p>As for Battlefield 4, I hear it's a lot better but I haven't played MP in a while but this game has been full or problems since release so I'd say it's down to the actual game/servers than anything on your end.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>cleaner... it would be an issue they would have fixed if it was a universal problem... it just seems like it a personal isolated problem really.. so how could MS fix it just for you...</p>
<p>BF does lag.. DR3 does have a slight load time when you die...but some other info would help... &nbsp;how are you connected... how many people are connected.. what is your net speed.... who is your ISP .... &nbsp;coming into a forum saying my game lags.... waste of
 money.. MS should fix this does not help in the overall scheme of things...</p>

<h3> trickydickel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer Driver for Brothers MFC 4800 printer using a USB conection fails all the time with PnP error . Was working fine until Windows 10 update changed the driver</h2>
                    This a&nbsp; on going problem with Windows 10. Whomever wrote the software or changed it from Windows 7did not realize that the MFC 4800 is a printer, copier, and scanner... NOT JUST SCANNER.&nbsp; Please fix this problem. The original fix (before the update) is
 so antiquated that after appling the fix and disconnecting the USB connection you have to go through the process AGAIN.

    <title>Windows 10 failure and System Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickstevenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 failure and System Restore</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10 last week. Yesterday, windows 10 needed to update, so I updated and restarted the computer. Then I began to notice issues with my USB drivers. Windows didn't recognize anything that was inserted into the USB drives. This was curious,
 so I restarted the computer. Cue an endless repair loop on restart. I was unable to refresh or repair the OS. Luckily, I made a backup of Windows 8.1 before upgrading to windows 10. Unfortunately, because the versions of windows didn't match, I was unable
 to restore the disk image of Windows 8.1. <br />
</p>
<p>The computer in question originally had Windows 7 on it and I purchased the ugrade to Windows 8. Before Windows 10 crashed, I had never had an issue with activation. Now, because the computer no longer has Windows 7 installed and I can't use my upgrade as
 a stand alone activation, I now have Windows 8.1 installed and can't activate it. (I was able to wipe the drive with Windows 10 and reinstall from the Windows 8 upgrade I purchased. I then proceeded to update the computer to Windows 8.1 last night.)
<br />
Now, I'm attempting to restore my original OS from before the Windows 10 upgrade using the system image I created.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I receive this error:<br />
&nbsp;"The system image restore failed. Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer that has different firmware. The system image was created on a computer using BIOS and the computer is using EFI."<br />
So, I have two problems, but I hope that restoring my system image will cure my activation problem.

            <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;activation issue is because the System Image you used is not correct. You can install any system image but it will not activate unless you use the correct system image. Therefore, first make sure that you use the correct image then try to install and
 further activate your Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might need to contact your&nbsp;manufacturer and ask for an&nbsp;original system image to install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you&nbsp;have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why did my PC restart&#63; Loop</h2>
                    <p>After my PC updated it became so slow that it's unusable. I tried different things and even restored it back before the update but nothing worked. So I decided to reinstall windows 10. I thought that everything would be fine because the installation seems
 to be working but then this showed up:</p>

<p>When I click next it just loads for awhile then back to this. I don't know what to do. I ran out of options to try that's why I decided to post here for help.</p>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thanks for taking the time to help me. How can I reboot Safe Mode in the sign-in screen if my PC goes to that blue screen I was talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I turn it on it just loads and shows this;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2cd45e5b-fd6e-4c83-bcc4-fbb2fadf73e5?upload=true" /></p>
<p>And then my only options are to press Next which then loads the PC back to this. My other options is to shut/restart the PC by pressing/holding the power button, then again after turning the PC on it just goes back to load the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to boot Safe Mode from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again! I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>
        </p>

            Hello cherrybomb666,
<br />
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />What are your modem manufacturer and exact modem ?
<br />What is your FAI ?
<br />In my opinion, you should contact your FAI, it's a FAI issue, not a Windows one.       
        </p>

            The modem is a HITRON CODA 4582U. My FAI said it's my computer since my smartphone accessing wifi from the same modem can connect to the 5g.

            Hello,
<br />Ok for your FAI.
<br />But in my opinion, it's a modem issue. 
<br />Anyway what are the manufacturer and exact model of your pc?
<br />Reinstall your wifi driver from the manufacturer website

<br />You didn't answer.

<br />It will be useful to reinstall your drivers.

</p><p>I am quite sure it is not a printer connection nor functioning problem because I&nbsp;can print&nbsp;after I connect my old computer running XP by the same USB cable to this printer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall and install the printer again and again under "device and Printer", but it still says the printer is in Error.</p>
<p>Could you please show me step-by-step how to fit this drive problem, which I have spent days and days without any success?</p>

                    <p>The current windows fonts that appear in open windows in title bars, inactive windows, etc are hard on my eyes. &nbsp;I want to know if there is a way to change the actual font to a different font, such as from 'Arial' to 'Courier', etc. &nbsp;There used to be a setting
 in Windows seven that would allow this but I cannot find it in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you would like to change the default font in Windows 10. Unfortunately, that option has been removed in Windows 10, therefore, you will not be able to change it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are facing difficulty due to the font size, you can try the steps given below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Type "make text and other items larger or smaller" in the search bar and open it.</p>
<p>2. Under "change the text size only", you can choose the appropriate option and select the font size depending on your preference.</p>
<p>3. Click apply to see the changes and make the appropriate changes.</p>
<p>4. Repeat the steps for the other categories also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, do let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

<h2>            Background disappears randomly</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10, after an upgrade from 8.1, on a Lenovo Ultrabook. I frequently switch between using my computer as a laptop and plugging it in to an external monitor. Unless my computer is on when I plug it in or unplug it from the monitor, most
 of the time my desktop background goes to black. This sometimes even happens if I'm in laptop mode and am waking the computer up from Sleep, though it happens less frequently under those conditions. My version of Windows is genuine, and this doesn't happen
 100% of the time, but just enough to be annoying. I've been hunting through various forums to try to find a solution, but so far no luck. Any thoughts?

<h3> gediminas juka  say:</h3>
<h2>            When Windows 10 installs graphics drivers, there&#39;s no catalyst control center included.</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Original Title: Windows 10 and AMD graphics</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello. First of all, it can be difficult to understand my English, because it's not my native language, but I'll try. I tried to install Windows 10 on my HP laptop many times, but each time I install it, I have issues with my graphics card.
</p>
<p>Some laptop specifications:</p>
<p>Processor: AMD A8-6410 with Radeon R5 graphics.</p>
<p>Graphic card: AMD R7 M260.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>The issue is that when Windows 10 installs graphics drivers, there's no catalyst control center included and laptop is not as good as it was with windows 8.1. Drivers from HP support don't work properly (a lot of lag in games), but it has catalyst control
 center and u<span>nfortunately, after some time windows reinstalls drivers by their own.</span></p>
<p>I hope you understand my problem and can recommend anything because I really like Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            dvd drive does not recognize blank disk</h2>
                    
<p>My dvd drive suddenly stopped working to burn dvds.&nbsp; It has worked a couple of times on disks that it previously would not recognize.???&nbsp; The drive will play and dvd, cd or even burn a cd.&nbsp; It just will not recognize a bland dvd-r.</p>
<p>Here is a list of my computer parts and things i have tried.</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 530</p>
<p>Windows Vista Home Basic</p>
<p>dvd driver&nbsp; - HL-DT-ST-DVD=-RW-GSA-H73N ATA Device&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Location 0(channel 1 target 0 lun 0) pc says this is working properly</p>
<p>I recently installed a clean version of Vista from disk.&nbsp; still had&nbsp;problem with no "burning program" installed</p>
<p>Installed all new updates for Windows, including Service Pack 2</p>
<p>Installed all drivers from Dell.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>uninstalled dvd drive and restarted.&nbsp; let pc find new driver.&nbsp; no help</p>
<p>Removed upper and lower filters from registry.&nbsp; no help</p>
<p>run microsoft fixit for dvd drive problems.&nbsp; no help.&nbsp; This did work one time but I am not sure why or how.&nbsp; I have tried multiple time since with no result.</p>
<p>run norton scans for viruses.&nbsp; none found.</p>
<p>Can anyone please help.&nbsp; I am quite sure the drive has not gone bad because it will work on rare occasions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Rustypence,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><span>Do you have any third party DVD burning software installed on the computer like Nero or Roxio?</span></div>
</li><li>
<div><span>Where exactly are you seeing the message “no burning program installed”?</span></div>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps below and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may temporarily try to remove or uninstall third party CD or DVD writing software like Nero or Roxio installed on the computer and verify if you
 are able to access the CD / DVD. If it works fine you may have to contact the DVD writing software manufacturer to check if you need to make any changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Norton Installed on the computer you may try to disable the Norton software temporarily to see if it resolves the issue. Later re-enable
 after checking. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to use a different make of DVD media to check if it helps you to burn the disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also contact Dell to run a diagnostic tool to verify if<span>&nbsp;</span>DVD drive diagnostic tool may be available and run the same.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; Currently I do not have any third party dvd burning software installed on my pc.&nbsp; I have a clean re-install of windows vista home basic from disk.</p>
<p>I am not receiving any error messages,&nbsp; I just meant that I did not have a program installed.&nbsp; No error messages.</p>
<p>I do have norton installed.&nbsp; I uninstalled it.&nbsp; Still nothing when I insert a blank dvd.&nbsp; I know the dvda&nbsp;are good because i have used about 20 out of a pack of 100 and they worked.(on this pc).</p>
<p>When I insert a blank dvd-r into my drive I can hear it start spinning.&nbsp; I open "computer" and then &nbsp;right click on the drive and it will lock my pc up for about 1 minute and then stop spinning and tell me to insert a blank disk.&nbsp; My pc will then unlock
 and every thing else is normal.</p>
<p>While it is spinning a picture of a small disk will appear and disappear a few times above my cursor.</p>
<p>I will try to find a diagnostic tool from dell and let you know what happens.&nbsp; Thanks and if you come up with something from new info please contact me.&nbsp; this is driving me bananas.</p>

            I have a similar drive model and am having similar problems. I know when mine started, a virtualbox guest crashed within my Vista 64 host. After that I got the infamous windows error code 39. I removed upper and lower filters and the drive reappeared in
 windows. The drive works fine if I boot into something other than Vista 64. When I put disks in the drive, it can usually read them, unless they are either blank media or finalized writeable media. If I run Fixit, no errors are reported and it says nothing
 needs fixed; the drive MIRACULOUSLY starts working for reading and writing media until the disk is ejected. But, I have to run fixit on every writeable disk I want to use in windows.

            Running Windows 7 Pro. This problem did NOT occur before I installed these MS updates (KB2729452) (K82760413) (K82737019)(K82729449) (K82719033) (KB890830) (K82687311) (KB2596660) (KB2596848) (K82687307)(K82727528) (K82761451)(K82761226) (K82687404) yesterday.
 Two things happened. 1) I get the error "Windows can't read the disc in drive X:" on all my DVD/CD drives in Windows Explorer. 2) The autoplay window that used to come up asking what I want to do (burn audio cd, copy files to disc, etc.) no longer comes up.
 I can copy files to the disc using Roxio and I can create an audio cd using roxio..
<div>READ HERE!</div>
<div>One of these fixes reset the autoplay settings in windows. &nbsp;When I cahnged the autoplay settings to "ask me every time" for blank cds and dvds. I now get the autoplay window and in Windows Explorer when I click on the dvd drive with blank media it asks
 if I want to use it like a CD/DVD or like a USB flash drive. &nbsp;Problem solved. &nbsp;</div>

            I have been having the same problem for a few days.I just fixed my problem 30 minutes ago. I am running XP. I went into services and checked the settings for IMAPI CD-Burning. It was set for manual and not started. I changed the settings to started and
 automatic. I then checked my dvd drive and everything is okay now. I hope this fix helps anyone who is having this problem.

<h2>            Windows 10 crashes because of my graphic card driver</h2>
                    <p>Help me. I am so annoyed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a two months old graphic card Nvidia gt 730. It was working great with windows 7. When I updated my windows to WIndows 10, things became horrible. Randomly, the screen freezes when I scroll down/ up in Microsoft edge. If I leave it without moving
 the mouse till it is completely downloaded it gets back to work after seconds. The screen turns to black for a second and come back again to work normally. Many times the system crashed and restarted by itself or I had to restart it. Many times I get this
 error message after the system gets back to work after freezing for second. This message says. "Display driver NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 353.62 stopped&nbsp;responding and has successfully recovered"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 automatically updated my driver once I updated to windows 10 from window 7. In gaming, Sometimes it crashes or freezes. I checked my memory with memory software in windows 10 and it was fine. I have another hard drive with windows 7 and the system
 works fine with my graphic card. So. I think there is conflict between windows 10 and the graphic card,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you help me. I like windows 10 but I am forced to get back to windows 7 if I can not solve this problem</p>

            <p>Mr. Joythar K</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all let me thank you so much for your quick reply. Today I did what you have advised me to do. I found some updates from Microsoft. I installed them and I restarted my system. After singing in to windows 10 I updated the graphics/display drivers.
 I found no new updates for the graphic card. It says ' You have the last available driver for this card. Hopefully the news&nbsp;updates from Microsoft that I installed today would solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a question here. I have Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;You said I can run my graphic drivers in compatible mode. Can you explain how I can do so? The problem is in the graphic drivers not in an application. When I run "
<span><strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows" </strong>
The only program from Nvidia that can run run in a compatible mode in the list is Nvidia Express. I believe the problem is in the compatibility of the drivers of the graphic card&nbsp;with the system not Navidia Express software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Any suggestions. Thanks again for help. I like Windows 10 so much.

<p>1- the system freezes for second</p>
<p>2- thescreen goes black for a second</p>
<p>3- the following error message apppears.</p>

            <p>2 solutions:</p>
<p>1) Revert to Win 8.1</p>
<p>2) uninstall all nVidia drivers and work with Microsoft generic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be mostly on the GTX 700 series, specially if they are mobile version. I think the problem is Microsoft's Windows 10 power management rather than the nVidia drivers... i could be wrong.</p>

            <p>I believe sooner or later I will go back to windows 7. The best system ever. I still get the same error messages few times a day. Sometimes the system could restart my display drivers and after some seconds of freezing I come back to work. Sometimes, the
 system crashes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will enjoy it a little and know everything about windows 10 then I will format the C partition and install a new fresh windows 7 or 8.1. People says windows 8.1 had problems too and it is better to install windows 7. I don't know which system I should
 use. I don't want to install windows 8.1 and I face the same problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BY THE WAY, I have NVidia Gt 730 not a GTX version. Mine is a cheap but a good one for basic games</p>

</p><p>Today I installed windows 8.1. Also I installed the Nvidia drivers from their web site. Everything is OK and I have no problems. I didn't get any error messages with my display drivers. I have been using the new fresh windows 8.1 for about 10 hours and I
 played games and everything is fine.</p>

            The problem is none of the links seem to help out or troubleshoot those currently using windows 10 and, needing to go back to windows 7. I never used 8.1. Also, the&nbsp; problem is getting worse it is now refraining from black screen, and instead just freezes
 up completely making me manually reboot. I wll sign back on and it will do it right away again. I tried to rever to windows 7 again but it wont let me swaying files for that are no longer on your computer. I don't have a recovery disk, and no idea what the
 **** to do. Please Help, I have already updated drivers till I'm blue in the fave, that doesn't seem to be the problem.

    <title>Master Boot Record virus reproductions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norman elias  say:</h3>
<h2>            Master Boot Record virus reproductions</h2>
                    <p>hello Microsoft community. I recently bought. ROG PC (GL550) and ESET security for it. A month later I got a DEFO virus in my Master Boos Sector MBR and the ESET security program couldn't fix it.
</p>
<p>I ran mbrcheck.exe and the source code is not recognized. </p>
<p>Then I looked online for ideas on how to reset the MBR and opened the command prompt to preform "bootrec" commands (I couldn't preform bootrec commands in safe mode, so I performed them when system was running)</p>
<p>After this my computer went into crash mode (I did auto repair in advanced settings and I get a srt\srttrail unable to fix issue)</p>
<p>So I did a factory reset, didn't keep any personal files (don't have any), </p>
<p>then I try to open windows programs and none of them work and the computer gives me crash reports, won't finish upgrades, or open some/any windows applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer has to be perfect. (It's brand new)&nbsp;</p>
<p>i ran system diagnostics and did a thorough check and the computers BIOS is running at optimal</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this moment I am running a chkdsk \r \c:&nbsp;</p>
<p>i know it takes a while but why will my computer not register or upgrade windows or not open any applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any step I preformed that I shouldn't have?</p>
<p>is there another process I could use?</p>
<p>i have a windows 8.1 pro disk in chinese. I don't want to install it because it's language pack is chinese and I can't change that.. and the registry key when I bought it is invalid -_- ( just bought it yesterday)&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you again for the help and support</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Controller password entered wrong- now locked out</h2>
                    <p>I dont have xbox live and dont play online. My little sister typed the wrong password into the xbox one controller multiple times. Now it says im locked out and must log online on microsoft to prove its me and “enter password”. I have sucky wifi rn but it says i have to update my game before i can log online. So i connected to the sucky wifi and waited 3 hours for the update to finish. It finishes and says “something went wrong and could not update.” So am i just locked out my xbox forever? Is there anyway to prove its me by logging into Microsoft by phone?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. If drive is not shown then continue below.<br />
<br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded to Windows Vista<br />

When you insert a CD or a DVD, Windows Vista may not recognize the disc<br />

CD/DVD drive does not appear in Windows Vista, or you receive this error during Windows Vista setup after booting from the DVD (AHCI)<br />

CD-R drive or CD-RW drive is not recognized as a recordable device<br />

Hardware devices not detected or not working - A Mr Fixit<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Hope these help.<br />
