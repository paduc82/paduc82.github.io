</p>
Which Antivirus to buy?
<div>
<p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.&nbsp; I want to emphasize that the
<em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are strictly an ANTIVIRUS product</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install only one product in my client’s computers.&nbsp; My support comes as a condition that they use that and only that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk. Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections or claims to make your computer
 run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until last September, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security&nbsp; September 2014,&nbsp;Symantec (owner of Norton) decided
 they would no longer sell an Antivirus-only product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of research, I decided on <em><strong>Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp;</strong>
</em>I have installed it&nbsp;114&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;those PCs and there has never been any kind of a&nbsp;problem or any infections, and this has been over a course of about 15 months now.&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is not expensive. It uses very little of the computer’s
 resources.&nbsp; One of the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its “Wallet” function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients know well that if they install any “Internet Security” (IS) product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that the other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems
 than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose
 the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; The IS product&nbsp;will actually hide the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical home Windows computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection software installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

            <p>Please read my posting again.&nbsp; I am specifically recommending Bitdefender antivirus 2015+.&nbsp; It is an AV only product.&nbsp; It does have a thing called Wallet there that is kind of a pain in the neck but you can neuter it.&nbsp; If you would like I can give you specific
 directions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In my client PCs, Bitdefender adds about 30 seconds to startup, then becomes completely unobtrusive.&nbsp; There is a gaming mode in the product which should be exactly what you need.</p>

<h2>            100&#37; disk usage on Windows 10 Laptop &#40;Even after a complete reinstall&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have been dealing with this issue for over six months, and it is a pain to use my laptop. On startup, and waking up from sleep the computer is completely slow. It hangs and is absolutely frustrating to use. I have searched for all the solutions I could,
 and none of them worked. (Chkdsk, defrag, reinstall/refresh system, manually set virtual memory paging size, disabling services such as: "Windows Search" and Background Intelligent Transfer Service, windows update, antivirus scan, anti malware scan, anti spyware,
 and many more)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is my last resort before I just say forget it and throw linux on this unit; I need for the device to actually work when I need it. The laptop taking up to 20 minutes to go down from 100% disk usage is insane. When the disk usage goes back to normal
 (such as now) the laptop works completely fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know what can be the problem because there is nothing, but google chrome, and evernote installed. (2nd fresh install) so any solutions.</p>

 times with the only result of anything is hitting F2 as it boots... even then ran the BIOS and nothing changed. At a total loss no idea what to do. My computer did update its self about a week ago but had, had no glitches following until now.&nbsp;

            Hi Shelly,
<br />
<br />Windows Update KB4074588 has caused a problem with your USB Ports (Hub Drivers), you mosue and keyboard are fine . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Copy the command below (depends on your system). then in the Command window, right click to paste, then hit Enter to run the command
<br />
<br />For 32bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />For 64bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />
<br />Close Command and Restart your System
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you can get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as Admin and copy the command below (depends on your system). then in the Command window, right click to paste, then hit Enter to run the command
<br />

            Hi Shelly, no nothing on the keyboard to press . . .
<br />
<br />Just as you see the spinning dots, press and hold in the power button on your PC until it basically crashes
<br />
<br />Sometimes it can take a couple of attempts to get the timing right . . .

            OK Shelly, we will try a different approach . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            How do I &#34;go offline&#34; from the commandline&#63;</h2>
                    I have programs that need internet explorer and outlook express to be in the offline mode in order for them to work correctly. Currently, I click on Files&gt;Work Offline before starting my programs. I was wondering if it was possible to do the same via the
 command line.<br />

            <p>Digging around a bit I found this article:&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195730</a></p>
<p>What you can try is go to to </p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings</p>
<p>in regedit and backup the registry key (read the Help file for regedit to understand how to use it, if you haven't before).&nbsp; Then prior to running any programs you can try to merge that key and see if then, when you start IE or OE, they start in Offline
 mode.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The value name is for the "GlobalUserOffline" and the value of 0 means online and 1 means offline.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>See if that works.&nbsp; If not, you may have to do it work HKEY_USERS as the article describes and then you'll have to figure out the proper SID, but then you can do the same as I suggest above for that key and it should work.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you get any error message when the Windows Media player shuts down?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you try reloading the files what exactly happens?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are the files that you are trying to load saved in the Libraries?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not get any error message you may look into Event Viewer to check what is causing Windows Media Player to shut down.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To open in Event Viewer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on Start</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the Start search bar type ‘Event Viewer’ and hit Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the window search for the same service and check if any error has occurred or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This might also happen if any of the background program is conflicting with the smooth running of your computer. To help troubleshoot error messages
 and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is
 unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run.
 These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing
 restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop check if the issue persists, follow the steps given in the article and figure out which of the program is causing the
 issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

    <title>Getting .dll issues trying to use pen with Photoshop CS2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robozombie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting .dll issues trying to use pen with Photoshop CS2</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I know CS2 is pretty damn old and it's totally possible this may not even work I thought I'd ask here anyways. So I'm trying to use the Pen in CS2 and I wasn't getting any pressure sensitivity, so ovbiously the first thing I did was install the Wintab
 drivers for the SP3 from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. However, upon actually launching CS2, <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f01bc6df-30d6-4c4d-a682-f957e9075c4b" />popped up and CS2 crashed to desktop. I'm thinking it's because the drivers
 are x64 while CS2 is a x86 program because at one point in time there used to be x86 N-trig drivers for the SP3. Still, that's just me guess but does anyone else know what's going on.</p>

            <p>I checked around the web and here on the forum and you can look at this thread: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-performance/install-missing-msvcp100dll/966d29ba-e5a0-4290-943b-d5fb4b6a984c</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the missing .dll file used to be with Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can attempt to uninstall the program and then try to re-install it using the compatibility mode (right click on the installation program file and click on the compatibility tab).&nbsp; Select "Windows XP Service Pack 3" and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw another web link to Microsoft for Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555 (you have to log in to get it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Community Moderator Edit: Removed link and reference to rogue website that is known to have malware)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate alternative is that you and a whole bunch of others need to at least get within the 20th century!&nbsp; That 'Good Ole' software just won't be working sometime in the near future no matter what you do.&nbsp; I know, I know!&nbsp; Adobe charges enough to buy
 a Cadillac for their software and even more for their subscription service but they do make real good software.&nbsp; You may have to break down and invest.</p>

            <p>Oh boy, reading over the initial post I realized I forgot a bunch of info (which is why I specially pointed out the pen in the first place.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so first I installed CS2 before installing the x64 N-trig WinTab drivers and it ran perfectly fine. Then I installed the WinTab drivers and started getting the MSVCP100.dll problem. Then after uninstalling the N-trig drivers, it worked fine again and
 I didn't get the .dll pop-up (granted I still don't have pressure sensitivity in CS2 but at least it works.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I probably should update one of these days, it's just that Adobe stuff costs a buttload of money :p</p>

            <p>There is something that I recommended on a different thread that might be of use.&nbsp; The N-Trig pen for the Surface Pro 3 was actually designed for note taking and basic drawing.&nbsp; Nothing complex.&nbsp; However, WACOM has a pen tablet that attaches to a regular
 computer and has its own stylus pen that you work with.&nbsp; It might work with your older software and may attach to the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check out more on this here: http://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works with the Pro 3, you might have the best for both worlds and it is not that big - plus you draw on a screen.</p>

    <title>windows 7 starter homegroup trying to connect to other win 7 homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fatfei  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 starter homegroup trying to connect to other win 7 homegroup not working as expected</h2>
                    I have two samsung n140 netbooks, both come with win 7 starter, I am trying to get the homegroup networking going.<br />
<br />
i set it up with defaults on both to share the picture, video folders etc under homegroup sharing.<br />
<br />
It asked me to create a homegoup password which i did (this might have come about because i intially connected one of the netbooks to a pc running win 7 ultimate which is where i created a homegroup password but this pc is&nbsp;no longer connected to the network
 its just the two samsung netbooks)<br />
<br />
anyway when i connected this other netbook with the first one it asked me for the homegroup password which was successfully entered by me. However nothing has been straight forward since. The only pcs in my home group are these two netbooks running win7.<br />
<br />
ive managed to get to a point where in the home group folder the netbook names are displayed in eachothers homegroup however nothing is listed in eachother homegroup network shares when trying to access over the network.<br />
<br />
I can cannect to both pcs over the network the old fashioned way by sharing folders and accessing the network folder in my network places and can read and write however not in home group.<br />
<br />
Homegroup is where i do want to control the networking not by any other means, i'd be very greatful if someone can point me in the right direction please or whether or not its win 7 starter restricting me from nework accessing in homegroup.<br />
<br />
<br />
many thanks<br />
<br />

<p>Hey fatfei,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Let me clear some of the basics of networking in Windows 7 Starter edition.</p>
<p>You cannot create a HomeGroup from a computer running Windows 7 Starter. You can only join an existing HomeGroup from a starter edition.<br />
This must be one of the restrictions posed on you while trying to connect the two starter edition of Windows 7 over HomeGroup.</p>
<p>So the only option left out here is to upgrade to other version of Windows 7 that support creating HomeGroup via Windows Anytime Upgrade or stick to the way they are connected at present.</p>
<p>For detailed information, please read this article.</p>

<h2>            how do i keep same desktop whether sign on as Administrator or User</h2>
                    <p>I usually sign on as standard user and most app install programs are ok with my entering Admiistrator password or select 'run as administrator'.&nbsp; However, some do not offer that option and require me to log on as Administrator.&nbsp; So two questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I do not know why I have to exit and log on as administrator.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When I log on as Administrator, I get a whole new desktop.&nbsp; Can I set up so that I use same desktop whether signed on as Standard User or as Administrator?</p>

            <p>Hi Rw9683,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be an issue with permissions of files and folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The below steps will help you modify ownership and permissions of folders and files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the file or folder, click
<b>Properties</b>, and then click the <b>Security</b> tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Advanced</b>, and then click the
<b>Owner</b> tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Edit</b>, and then do one of the following:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click
<b>Other users and groups</b> and, in <b>Enter the object name to select (examples)</b>, type the name of the user or group, and then click
<b>OK</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the
<b>Change owner</b> to box, click the new owner. </p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<b>Replace owner on sub containers and objects</b> check box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Yes</b> when you receive the following message: </p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory folder name. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you Full Control?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>All permissions will be replaced if you click
<b>Yes</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> folder name is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>OK</b>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>For your Information:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>An administrator can take ownership of any file on the computer.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Assigning ownership of a file or a folder might require you to elevate your permissions using User Access Control.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            Thanx.&nbsp; That certainly helps me uderstand and use permissions better.&nbsp; But let me try and better explain the key problem.&nbsp;I want to have two icons on the opening screen.&nbsp; One for me and one for a guest.&nbsp; I want my icon to require a password and open for
 me as the Administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the Guest to&nbsp;open (without a password) to exactly the same desktop and files, but without Administrator privileges.&nbsp; I will select those files and assign privileges&nbsp;that I do not want the Guest to have access to.&nbsp; Currently,
 every time I create a new user, regardless of user status, I create a new desktop, whereas, I want there to be only one desktop that all users, including myself, use.

            <p>Hi Rw9683,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not possible to have same desktop icons to appear on other user accounts. If it was not possible then what is the use of concept multi user account. So you need to log in as administrator to perform those tasks with need administrator
 privileges.</p>

<h2>            Max the Curse of Brotherhood</h2>
                    Anybody here thinking about getting today's new store game Max, it looks an interesting puzzle platform game, the reviews have been pretty promising so far, and at £11:99 it could be worth go. I'd be interested to see any ones views on it.

<p>Not sure about this game, from what I've seen online it looks gorgeous for a platformer, but the gameplay I've seen looks a little lacking. I think if and when they decide to give us games for gold on the One this will likely be one of the first.</p>

 have to be rather quick to solve some, all in All I'd give it a 8 as once it's completed I can't see me playing again apart from mopping up the last few cheevs

<p>Хотел сразу после покупки консоли купить Naruto ,Sniper Elite 2 и Call of Duty MW2 (Конечно из-за отсутствия читеров),но обнаружил что этих и многих других игр в Xbox LIVE не приобрести.Живу я в поселке(Пестово,Новгородская область,Россия) Тут от PC то нету
 лицензионных дисков...Xbox купили в отпуске,думали что можно в Интернете(Xbox LIVE) купить любую игру за деньги с кредитки или Microsoft Points.Но ошиблись.Может как нибудь можно купить эти игры не на дисках?</p>

<p>В русском лайве действительно с загружаемыми играми несколько грустно, хотя ситуация слегка выправляется. В качестве выхода можно предложить 2 варианта:</p>
<p>1. Завести US аккаунт и покупать через него. Есть конечно определенные хитрости с покупками (покупка пойнтов, голды, региональные ограничения), но в целом метод работает и за американский лайв не банят.</p>
<p>2. Покупка игр в российских онлайн магазинах. Наложенным платежом почтой высылает OZON вроде, можно еще чего подыскать. Иногда можно наткнуться на очень вкусные предложения - щас на озоне предлагают Скайрим недорого.</p>
<p>3. Покупка игр в зарубежных магазинах shopto.net и game.co.uk (хорош ценами на б/у диски). Я в своё время на Шопту купил MW2 в железной коробочке за 1000 рублей по акции.</p>
<p>Живя в глубинке, я бы порекомендовали именно 2 и 3 варинаты, ибо в наших магазинах цены всё равно дикие. Я хоть и живу в относительно цивилизованном месте, использую варианты с пересылкой дисков.</p>

<p>Сейчас глянул Ozon.Вроде не дорого диски продаются,да еще и доставка в нашу &nbsp;Евросеть стоит 125р.Оплата &nbsp;при получении заказа.</p>
<p>P.s увидел цену беспроводного джойстика-приятно удивился,всего 1590.Но почему то он не может быть доставлен в нашу Евросеть.(Нету пункта Самовывоз Пестово, Евросеть, ул Советская д 2А)</p>

<h2>            Activate Windows - nothing working</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden I have received the watermark showing, "Activate Windows - Go to PC settings to activate Windows". Now, I've clicked this, and it says No Key Management Service could be contacted (Error code: 0xC004F074).&nbsp;Furthermore, entering my product
 key BIOS OEM says it's not suitable for this version of Windows. (I have Windows 8.1 Pro.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried (in elevated command prompt):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. sfc /scannow</p>
<p>(Nothing wrong was detected.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">slmgr /dlv</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fPNILJL1.png" /></p>
<p>then...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fDP3It36.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Re-entering the key by doing;<br />
</p>
<p>slmgr -upk</p>
<p>slmgr -ipk XXXXX-XXXXX etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do. I've also tried entering my product key which ends in 6T9 as the above screenshot says, but it simply says: "this key doesn't work". The BIOS OEM key results in something saying it doesn't work for this edition of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/why-activate-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>First bullet point from here MIGHT be the solution, but I have no idea how to actually carry out what it's asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This may have something to do with the fact some months ago my hard drive was damaged beyond repair and I had to get a new one, but I'm not sure what to do next. My laptop came with Windows 8 pre-installed, and I initially updated to Windows 8.1 before the
 hard drive change. When I got the new hard drive, I think I had to reinstall Windows 8.1 (not 100% sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            For the life of me I can't understand how Microsoft built such a wonderful new product and leave us at the mercy of an inadequate mail app,<br />
<br />
Why couldn't they build the same functionality as is in Outlook, for instance?<br />
<br />
While deleting mail the way you instruct, I inadvertently clicked on one and was flooded with malware from one of the emails.<br />
<br />
This is on you.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft isn't going to fix this, then I will have to start using the same caution with all apps built for Windows 10.<br />

            <p>The current alternative is to use Mozilla Thunderbird - it's free and it's fully functional. I don't understand why this new email client has LESS functionality than the one in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the "live" tile doesn't seem to be working. It doesn't preview new emails like the 8.1 version did. Whoever authored the new one should be ashamed of themselves. I like Windows 10, overall it's a vast improvement over previous versions, but with this
 one glaring exception.</p>

            <p>This is unacceptable. For instance there is no "right-click" on the deleted items folder to empty it. &nbsp;In order to delete many at a time in any folder, they must be individually Ctrl-clicked rather than being able to select a range with Shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the Microsoft help screens suggests clicking on the deleted folder and then using the Edit Menu. There is no Edit Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mail app needs a MAJOR overhaul, - and quickly.</p>

            All these posts point to a big bug bear with the mail app. Very frustrating as even when you have deleted each email they seem to reappear again and again in the deleted file. At least in windows 8 they went and quickly with the ease of ticking ALL. Please
 resolve this issue Microsoft. Overall I am liking Windows 10 but hey I also didn't mind 8.

            <p>IKR SAME. Windows 8 was fine. Very good in fact. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ANYWAYS, the real question is:&nbsp;Are&nbsp;WINDOWS or MICROSOFT going to DO anything about this? I haven't heard of a statement or comment being released by them showing that they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess they aren't doing anything about it then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a shame.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If I understand you correctly, y</span>ou wish to delete the mail in Mail app without opening them first.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can delete the mails in Mail app without opening them. Refer to the following steps:</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Open mail app.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Select the mails to be deleted, click on the Trash button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use the arrow keys and <strong>Delete</strong> key on the keyboard to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

Sorry, but this answer isn't helpful at all. We need to be able to select ALL or a range of emails to delete (some of us have hundreds to delete) and to be able to empty the Spam and Trash folders like we used to be able to. This is is serious flaw with the
 mail app. Most of us don't have the time to waste clicking and deleting each email, one at a time. And what happened to the preview (without opening the email) feature??<br />

            I gave up. Like so many things in W7, where you used to have a choice, now there is no choice and you must accept whatever someone else has decided even if it doesn't work. I finally just started using QuickTime even though it doesn't work as well in Windows
 as Windows Media Player.<br />

    <title>Stuck in Automatic Repair loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew farren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck in Automatic Repair loop</h2>
                    <p>My PC has been having issues with the Audio hardware and drivers as well as running sluggishly. So I decided to reset it to factory default. I did my usual and uninstalled all thirty party programs and removed all user content manully as to eaze the load
 during the process. Nothing important, just games, video files, ect. And started the advanced start up and selecting reset PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 6 hours, windows still hadn't gone pass "Preparing..." so I hit the reset button. Windows booted up like usual, this time I decided to go ahead and reinstall windows via disk. Popped it in and went through the motions and selectes the the hard drive
 i wanted it to install on. It was unable to install, then I foolishly hit the format button for the harddrive. Still couldn't install, so I reset the PC and now i am on a constant loop "Automatic Repair". The only things I can do is access BOIS and enter the
 boot device menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many "Help Tips", but they all assume I have access to an ounce of the operating system. I need assistance desperatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Info:</p>
<p>The OS I was using was the Free Windows 10 upgrade for windows 7-8.1 users. The OS disk inserted for the reinstall was for windows 8.1 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second HDD is empty more or less and contains a partion of Windows 8 from an old pre-build. Not sure if it is useable since I ripped away from its original Motherboard, CPU and RAM. Screenshoot seen below is what pops up when I try to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Alternatively, am I able to format the HDD on a different PC and partition the space for the OS(perhaps install it as well)?</p>

            <p>Try the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this fixes the issue, then add the devices one after the other until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then we can update driver software for that particular device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to create a Windows 10 installation media and then try to perform a Automatic Repair and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create an installation DVD by following the article below:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is a Windows system recovery tool that can fix certain problems, such as missing or damaged system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform Automatic repair follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Insert the Windows 10 installation media and boot the computer using the disc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;You need to check the computer manual on how to set CD/DVD drive as the first boot device in the BIOS.</p>
<p>2. Once you boot using the Windows installation disc, on the Windows 10 installation window, click on Repair your computer.</p>
<p>3. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>&nbsp;and in the<strong>&nbsp;Advanced options</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. You may choose Automatic Repair from Advanced boot option.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>

            <p>So I fiddled with the BIOS a little and had the CD-ROM containing the OS disc boot and load first. Allowing for me to access the Advance Start Menu as well as the install menu. I will try to see if it works 100%, but hopefully anyone else in this situation
 can find this useful in the future. Will post if anything changes.</p>
