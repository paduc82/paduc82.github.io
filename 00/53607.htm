<h2>            Skype To Go Numbers to India not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am calling to India from Canada using my Skype To Go numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working previously but of late is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot hear the other person and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the to go number and recreating it. But the same local number gets assigned and doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i try calling from Skype app using the dialpad option, it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is persistent for the past 10 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find a Help number to reach to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Help link keeps pointing me to posting question on the community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Can someone help with this or provide a contact number to reach Skype Team to help ?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>GP</p>
<p>

    <title>Missing Games on Demand - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thedeathspartan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Games on Demand</h2>
                    
<p>There are a few games that have never been added to the Xbox 360 Games on Demand that are very high in popularity. I've noticed that a lot of them are games that require 2 discs. Not only would these games be perfect for Games on Demand but with the high
 space in most hard drives I don't quite get why they have not been added to the Games on Demand library. PlayStation has added these titles to it's library. Below are some of these games. If anyone can think of anymore make your case for it being added to
 the Games on Demand library.</p>
<p>Mass Effect 2</p>
<p>Mass Effect 3</p>
<p>Dead Space 2</p>
<p>Dead Space 3</p>
<p>Splinter Cell Blacklist</p>

<p>These are very important games and would be great editions. I'd also like them to add Turok from 2008 because it was really fun. What do you guys think?</p>

<p>In the case of the two Mass Effect games they would have to rework the games to eliminate the disc switching.</p>
<p>Given how cheap the games are now at retail I'm not sure there is as much money in a digital release as you seem to think.</p>

<p>I could see that being a potential issue but they have these available for the PlayStation Network. To do it for one console and not the other is baffling to me. The money being made may not be astronomical, but I still believe they would do well. These
 are all very popular games and I believe a lot of people would purchase these, especially if Xbox had a sale on them.

<p>I have found it strange that some of these really good games such as the ones you listed not being available digitally to be confusing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I do think any game that is released show have a digital release as well. &nbsp;This does seem to be the case for Xbox One at the moment.</p>

<p>"I could see that being a potential issue but they have these available for the PlayStation Network."</p>
<p>Because the Mass Effect games on PS3 are single discs. Bioware can't just copy and paste this code and it'll magically work on 360.</p>

<p>Kanaye is right. The reason these titles aren't available digitally is because they require two discs. PlayStation uses Blu-ray, which has superior storage, whereas the Xbox 360 does not.</p>

<p>There are numerous 360 games that require several discs, but have digital versions that work without issues. LA Noire has three discs, but has a digital version available on the Xbox store. Max Payne 3 has two discs.</p>
<p>EA chose not to do the work to make the games available digitally on 360. Because EA sucks. Disc swapping isn't the issue. S'just laziness, and cost, and a lack of savvy for what consumers want... wanted... don't want. EA blows.</p>

<p>It is definitely an EA thing. &nbsp;I bought Dead Space a few years ago on demand and was shocked I couldn't also buy DS2, so I wound up picking it up on disc for like 10 bucks.</p>

<p>Some games cache to the hard drive or unload textures and other elements much more than others. The drive doesn't provide sufficient bandwidth and causes texture issues and slowdown if the entire thing is installed to the drive and it's simultaneously caching
 to and from it. You can install it from your own disc copy and suffer the consequences - but any complaints are not supported and they'd just tell you to uninstall it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, If they were to sell the game in a state where this happened - then they would HAVE to support it and they simply can't. GTA 5 digital really shouldn't have been released - or they should have at least put a disclaimer on it. Battlefield 3 and 4
 were never made available on digital for this very reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can work around this problem by installing the digital game to a separate drive and in essence it would be used as a disc - still keeping the HD free for caching. But, that would be too complicated to put on the storefront.</p>

<p>Pretty sure that's still not the reason the games aren't available digitally on 360. You will notice the trend is a majority of EA games. Wouldn't surprise me if the 360 platform was a testbed for the one-time use online/used game codes EA were rolling out
 at the time. Along with laziness.</p>
<p>BF3 and 4 are available digitally on PSN. GTAV on both 360 and PS3 had the exact same issues with assets and texture loading, indeed the 360 version had higher frame rates than the PS3 in the Digital Foundry comparisons. The 360 version was two discs obviously,
 PS3 one, and the digital versions performed identically.</p>
<p>CoD AW is two discs on 360, yet is available digitally on 360. Activision and 2K/Rockstar can do the digital versions without issues. But for whatever reason EA didn't bother. Maybe they thought they could reap more cash from online code sales as opposed
 to Xbox Store sales. Or maybe they just wanted to see the ana<span>l</span>ytics for those used-game codes on a platform. Who knows...</p>
<p>What we do know is... a majority of EA games, huge franchises: Mass Effect 2 and 3, Battlefield 3 and 4, Dead Space 2 and 3 etc. - lack digital versions on the 360. For probab<span>ly rubbish reasons.</span> {=|</p>

I see. If his Prefrences are set to Online. Then he can try either the following solutions, that can sometimes fix profile issues like this one. Do make sure to check the Prefrence settings again though just to be sure.<br />
<br />
Clearing his Xbox 360 Harddrive Memory Cache by going into Settings then Memory and pressing the Y button. Follow the on screen prompts and it will remove recent Updates for games. Nothing else will be deleted and you can Update them again once you play them
 again. This has been found to fix Gamerpics not updating for other people on your friends list, so it could work for this.<br />
<br />
Or he can try Deleting his PROFILE ONLY in Memory Settings and then Download/Recover it back to Xbox LIVE using the Windows Live ID and Password that can be found in the Account settings.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
Sorry that I reply on this even if it is one year ago. I've got the same problem: I installed a skin pack, but it doesn't recovered every icon. I forgot to create a recovery image or so, and I don't know what to do.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to download the original dll files for Windows 7 HP 64x?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance,<br />

<h2>            Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse won&#39;t pair with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 8.1 Enterprise 64 bit and am trying to connect a Arc Touch BT mouse.&nbsp; This is the Bluetooth version WITHOUT A DONGLE, so please don't post trouble shooting for the version with a dongle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to add the device in Bluetooth, it will not recognize it unless I push the Bluetooth button on the mouse, and then it will say it cannot pair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken out the batteries and put them back in, turned it on and off a million times, turned the computer on and off a million times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked fine with windows 7 on a different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help that isn't generic copy and paste over and over from someone overseas would be great.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this did not work and now it won't connect to my Bluetooth headset.&nbsp; It shows that device as paired, but will never connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the headset from my devices, and now it isn't discoverable by my computer either unless I hold the Bluetooth button down.&nbsp; It will pair, and it looks like load drivers, will stay connected for a minute (and not usable) and then just say paired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some issue known for Windows 8.1 for reconnecting Bluetooth devices that have been added and then removed previously?&nbsp; Something stored on the computer that is causing a conflict?</p>

<p><b><span>Alternatively, </span></b><span>try these “free” on demand scanners which will not interfere with your resident AV program -

 is a dialog with 3 check boxes:&nbsp; The first option is to Enable Free Trial of Malwarebytes Pro and you must uncheck the first option to install the free version without real time protection enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may need to rename the nstallation file to 123.exe or
 something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.&nbsp; Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>

    <title>Camera won&#39;t turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jldp321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    <p>I just got my surface book this morning and the camera was working and I set up facial recognition. It went to sleep around 8:00 at night and all of a sudden, my computer wouldn't turn on the camera and said I needed to fix privacy settings. I did that for
 everything and it still wont turn on, neither will facial recognition. I just got this computer and I'm moving into college tomorrow, this is extremely annoying.</p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Kaspersky (anti virus and privacy stuff) and one of the features lets me know if someone or what app is using my webcam. A notification popped up and I blocked it which didn't allow my camera to be used because it was just the software telling me
 that my webcam was being used, so I unblocked it. HAH whoops</p>

<br />
<br />Are there any anti-virus applications installed? Sometimes these have features to block certain devices, such as a web cam, or microphone. 
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,

            Since you didn't tell us what the "program that I used for work" is, I can't point you to its support page. Therefore I can only suggest you contact the program mftr.'s tech support.

            Hi Herbie11 
<br />
<br />That setting has nothing to do with Windows, or its settings or keyboard drivers
<br />
<br />The functionality of those keys are provided by the manufacturer of your PC.
<br />
<br />Check the Alphabetical list of installed Apps for applications made by the manufacturer of your PC, you may find a utility created by the manufacturer to turn off that functionality, though sometimes, you cannot change what those keys do . . .

<h2>            System and software windows are seems blurry in after upgrading to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I upgraded to windows 8.1 and now system as well as other software windows are seems blurry. I upgraded system to all latest drivers for entire hardware, even i for performed screen, color and true type text calibration. but issues is still there and many
 windows are unclear.<br />
<br />
I think this issue is not limited upto display driver versions. My system is Lenovo ideapad Y500 with Nvidia Geforce GT650M, Screen resolution 1920x1080.<br />
<br />
I tried many thing n also installed latest driver update (compatible for 8.1) from Nvidia graphics but the problem is still there. many softwares are showing blurry text n graphics.<br />
you can check these things in following captured screen on my system.<br />
<br />
These 3 windows belongs to same software Quick heal, still PC tuner windows on left is clear, sharp but Antimalware and Quick-heal windows on right are blurry. Even there is system window as well as context menu option for Intel rapid storage in taskbar and
 that text is blurry too.<br />

<br />
Also double tap feature for right click, context menu on touchpad (Synaptics pointing device) is not working.<br />
<br />
**All drivers compatible with windows 8.1 are updated from OEM site (crosschecked from hardware sites) with release date 16 OCT 2013

            Thanks for your helpful information. It seems that blurry text problem is solved, i changed setting to customize sizing option and put text to 124%. No actually that problem was not only for Quickheal but also for other software and system windows but
 now it's solved everywhere.<br />
<br />
But double tap is still not working.<br />
<br />
Another problem occuring is unexpected blue screen restart. I'm using Toon boom harmony 10.0.1 build 7547 whenever after starting toon boom whithin 10-15 min or less system shows blue screen n restarts. After that issue i was using that software for 4-5 hrs
 for couple of times. But again situation is same. <br />
<br />
I did things in adv. setting to get minidump file so that i can send it to u but there is no such a file after bluescreen resatrt. I'm finding system event log too but no success. I'm enclosing info got from event viewer<br />

<h2>            Permanently removing the alleged album &#34;art&#34; from Windows Media Player</h2>
                    I&nbsp;would DEARLY love to permanently remove 100% of the album art from my songs, I do not want or use it, and it just wastes my computers resources. I purchased the CDs for the music, not for the&nbsp;(ahem) fertilizer&nbsp;on most covers. How do I accomplish this?
 I looked here already, but I am still getting all of that ""art"". YES the privacy options to update music files are UNCHECKED, but it is all still there. This is REALLY annoying. I had all of them deleted (several years ago) from my library before I started
 getting&nbsp;the renewal and revocation, restart to continue processing error (which STILL remains unresolved on my end), but one solution rebuilt my database and now all of&nbsp;that alleged "art" is back. How do I get rid of it?

            <p><span>Hello Rose Mary Wicker,</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following steps to remove the album art.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to change the view option in Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Organize drop down arrow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Folder and Search Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select View Tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Show Hidden Files, Folders and Drives.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Un-check next Hide Protected Operating System files (recommended).</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>redo all the changes done to the Folder Options to default, once the troubleshooting is done.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to delete the album details.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the folder that contains the music files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I would suggest you to delete the following files from the folders.</span></p>
<p><span>AlbumArt_{GUID}_Large.jpg</span></p>
<p><span>AlbumArt_{GUID}_Small.jpg</span></p>
<p><span>Folder.jpg images</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to delete these files from all the folders which
 have the music files.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to rebuild the Windows Media Player Database.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Exit Windows Media Player.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click Run, type %userprofile%\Appdata\</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Local folder and open Microsoft folder.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the Media Player folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</span></p>
<p><span>Now check whether you have the album in the Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:
</span></b><span>Remember to disable "retrieve media information" and other similar options in WMP(Windows Media Player) to prevent it from downloading the same thing again from internet.</span></p>

            <p>You have GOT to be kidding. Not only do I have to remove the art from each folder individually, but I have to REBUILD my database AGAIN(!?) afterwards? NO WAY! I just rebuilt (several days of typing the song information manually!)&nbsp;the database&nbsp;trying to
 resolve that revocation and renewal processing error (STILL&nbsp;unresolved on this end)&nbsp;and unfortunately&nbsp;got it all back! It would be easier to get a different player that WILL get rid of it&nbsp;(and the revocation and renewal processing error) more easily than deal
 with all that BS. </p>
<p>Is there a diffferent option?</p>

<p><span>If he you are not willing to go through all of your albums manually, you might have to download a third-party tag editor of some kind to be able to edit the metadata on your album artwork permanently.</span></p>

            <p>Manually!? I already tried a few&nbsp;and got them back on next reboot (YES, the "options" settings were unchecked) That is why I said it didn't work! I have NO IDEA what a tag editor even IS, so I have no intention of screwing up my computer that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not willing? You say that as if I have 3 or 4 albums, that is not true, we are discussing several hundred folders that I already had to type in the song/album information manually into the library&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will just get a different player program&nbsp;since WMP is&nbsp;becoming increasingly more&nbsp;difficult to work with.</p>

            Hi...saw your similar post on another thread and would be interested to know a bit more about your issue. I have W7 and WMP 12 and have absolutely no problem keeping album art in order, so if you are willing to dig a bit deeper get back to me. Thanks-Ric.

<p>Do you get the fatal error when trying to uninstall Bitdefender or on the network connection?</p>

<p>If you are getting the fatal error when trying to uninstall Bitdefender, then I would suggest you to run the Fixit:

    <title>KB4497934 will not install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernard46  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4497934 will not install</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Home 1809 and I've been having some problems trying to get the latest updates installed. Right now I'm in the situation where I'm trying to install KB4497934 and I've been trying to install it for some days. I must have tried to do
 it around 5 times at least so far but each time it goes through the process, apparently installs it and reboots and then after a few minutes of a black screen with the circling dots it comes up with a message saying "We couldn't complete the updates - Undoing
 changes" and after a long while reboots and then tries to install the update again. As a result of this process it has now erased all the records of previous updates as well, so the Update Activity screen is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me any hints as to where I might find some sort of log file (I presume there will be one) where I might find some clues about what is going wrong. I've run the Windows Update troubleshooter and it says there are no problems. However I have
 a vague feeling there may be a permission problem somewhere because at one point in the past (not recently) I had to install an update (it may have been 1809) via the command prompt but as an administrator (I think) - however it is a while ago and it's very
 vague in my mind now - things have been running OK with multiple updates being installed since this vague recollection, so it may not be relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on where to find a log file relating to an aborted update?</p>

            Hi Bernard46 
<br />
<br />Since you are still running version 1809, your best option would be to upgrade to version 1903 manually, which should resolve any difficulties you are having with Windows 10 updates . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft have released version 1903 of Windows 10, click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date

<p>Thanks DaveM121</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought about doing that but I was hesitating because I have had problems in the past with this particular machine (it was originally Windows 7) when trying to get the 6-monthly refreshes installed - in fact I think I may have had the problem with
 1809 (if not it was with 1803) which was why I was seeking any advice on where I might find a log file to shed some light on what was actually going wrong with the KB4497934 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a shame Microsoft can't provide some easily accessible basic information on what went wrong at the time the problem occurs. I will give the 1903 update a try but before I do I'd like to be certain there isn't some way I can find some error log or diagnostics
 for the problem - I'm not terrible comfortable just bypassing problems - you never know when they're going to come back and bite you again, or even in a worse way.</p>

<p>I just got KB4497935 for the new build, 1903.&nbsp; I suppose it is the same as 7934 but for another build number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was strange but after I had installed and rebooted I got a message saying the update was still waiting to be installed.&nbsp; I had it check for updates again and the message went away..</p>

<p>I think I had something like that a couple of updates ago but it's unfortunately not the case with this one - I'm just doing a DISM and SFC now and then I'll probably try what DaveM121 was suggesting - it may be tomorrow before I get a chance to do it though
 as its getting pretty late here now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM and SFC have completed and its looking for Windows Updates now but taking forever. Its just come back with a Defender update and also KB4497934 again, so I'll let it do them and report back tomorrow since it will take best part of an hour to do
 them.</p>

<p>Well you could knock me over with a feather! Would you believe the problem seems to have gone away - I say gone away because I'm not sure what I have done has fixed the issue or whether I've just been lucky and bypassed it since I never knew exactly what
 the problem was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway overnight I left the machine doing the KB4497934 update for about the sixth time and this morning it all appears to have worked - Windows Update says it is successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned last night that I had followed some Windows Update troubleshooting notes on performing DISM and SFC. the actual commands I used (in case they are of use to others) were&nbsp;</p>
<pre><span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></pre>
<p>The DISM one took an awfully long time to run - 30 - 45 mins but did imply that it had made a change (unfortunately I didn't make a note of the exact words it used, since I wasn't expecting it to do any good), however the SFC one was much quicker and didn't
 make any comment other than that it had finished successfully. I was sceptical about running these two commands because I have run them many times previously and they have had absolutely no effect on any system, but maybe this time there was an issue which
 DISM fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts, observations, suggestions - much appreciated. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.</p>
