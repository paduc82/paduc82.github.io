<h2>            After running AVG Tune-up, my Excel files will not open, get Windows message &#34;preparing to install&#34;</h2>
                    After running AVG Tune-up, my Excel files will not open (Word, PowerPoint are&nbsp;OK) and instead I get the Windows message "preparing to install".&nbsp; I do not have the disk available to complete this action.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have restored the back-up from AVG Tune-up (reversing
 all AVG Tune-up actions) but the problem persists and AVG have been unable to troubleshoot the issue.&nbsp; So - there is a chance that it was not caused by AVG Tune-up but that is my suspicion. &nbsp;Also, for some reason, my "Sysytem Restore" points, although apparently
 available, do not work.&nbsp; Any ideas how I can get my Excel back?&nbsp; I run Windows XP and, although I can't open Excel to check the version, my Word and PowerPoint are 2002.

            <p>The VFPOLEDBSetup does NOT include the ODBC driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have to find a copy of the ODBC driver. The above install will run just fine ‚Äì but it not the ODBC driver.</p>
<p>Looking at the VFP download page, it looks like the ODBC driver is not in that list.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I don‚Äôt know of a download source, but the ‚ÄúoleDBSetup‚Äù you are running is not the ODBC driver.</p>

            <p>You are correct it is not an odbc driver. &nbsp;It has replaced it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However it is required to access FoxPro tables from either access or excel for example.</p>
<p>It is used to create dsn with odbcad32 in syswow64. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This worked in every os upto win7x64 inplace upgrade &nbsp;to win10 x64.</p>

            <p>Actually, Just installing the oleDB even on a windows 7 box will not result in you having a working VFP ODBC driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 by default included:</p>
<p>dBase VFP Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may well have been the case that installing that oleDB package allowed Excel or other programs to read FoxPro files ‚Äì but in those cases you are NOT using ODBC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of Access, you not using an oleDB connection (unless you limiting this discussion to ONLY using ADO code and VBA).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To link to VFP files with Access and ODBC, you simply need ODBC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Excel and other programs allow ODBC or a choice of oleDB providers to import data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So some other program, perhaps a VB6 or some other package was installing the ODBC driver ‚Äì perhaps some application that required ODBC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spooled up a clean VM copy of windows 7. Installing the oleDB did result in extra ODBC items appearing in the ODBC manager, but I STILL could not use them from Access. The ONLY way to make them work was install the VPF odbc driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in fact I did not even have to install the above oleDB provider‚Äì but just the ODBC driver.</p>
<p>So you never really did need the oldDB provider ‚Äì but installing it does suggest that additional entries in the ODBC manager would appear as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to install the ODBC driver, and the oleDB provider is not required for linking tables from Access.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, what is different is around windows 8 or 10, the dBase and VPF odbc drivers are not included in windows anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this goes back to you having to install an ODBC driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can certainly agree that the oleDB provider in the past may well have ‚Äúdisplayed‚Äù additional entries in the ODBC manager because additional parts of oleDB allowed such drivers to work and now be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, at one point in time you had to install the VPF odbc driver for this to occur and work ‚Äì or existing ones in windows which were activated by installing the oldDB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thus far, you have to install the VPF ODBC driver and the package you are using does not include the ODBC driver as far as I can tell. And as I see it now installing JUST the ODBC driver will fix this without needing to install the oleDB package.</p>

            <p>As a FYI, the link on the Microsoft page for the ODBC VFP driver is not shown. However this link does seem to work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfoxodbcdriver/Install/6.1/W9XNT4/EN-US/VFPODBC.msi</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfoxodbcdriver/Install/6.1/W9XNT4/EN-US/VFPODBC.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfoxodbcdriver/Install/6.1/W9XNT4/EN-US/VFPODBC.msi</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things:</p>
<p>The driver is out of support. It only works for VFP tables up to 6.0, so for tables that use 7,8 or 9 features the driver will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing the above however will give you the same drivers that you were likely using on windows xp to windows 7. As noted, the VFP odbc drivers are not included with windows 10. And as noted installing the oleDB provider will ALSO not include the ODBC
 driver.</p>

            <p>Sure, that's is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just keep in mind&nbsp; ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù is a bit of semantics here. When they say the oleDB provider is recommended, that suggesting means you are to drop use of ODBC and use oleDB to grab the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just keep in mind that the oleDB provider does not have ODBC and installing that oleDB provider does NOT give you ODBC use from Access. So you being told that oleDB is the recommended replacement - but that means you NOT using ODBC anymore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just keep in mind that the suggesting to use oleDB driver ALSO means you going to be dropping ODBC here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the day:<br />
Installing oleDB does not result in ODBC drivers being installed nor does that act give you use of ODBC drivers, and our context here that means installing oleDB will not give you use of linked tables from Access via the ODBC driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install the ODBC driver I noted, but that's only good up to 6 version FoxPro tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can certainly install the oleDB provider and write ADO code inside of Access, but again as noted installing the oldDB driver does not result in ODBC drivers being installed and available from Access. So you not get use of linked tables - but you can
 write ADO code to read such data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are most free to install and adopt the oleDB provider ‚Äì but that act not going to get you ODBC drivers. The suggesting to use the recommended oleDB provider ALSO MEANS you are to drop using ODBC drivers. And dropping ODBC means no linked tables from
 Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: if you were using linked tables, then the VFP ODBC driver must have been allowing you to read the beyond 6 version tables in FoxPro.&nbsp; I not aware of any ODBC drivers for beyond 6 version tables. We can thus conclude that if you were using linked tables,
 you were in the past using the VFP ODBC driver - and you thus should be able to continue to use the VFP ODBC drivers. There are no new drivers for ODBC since your issue arose, so logically one should be able to continue to use the SAME ODBC driver you were
 using in the past since they not changed since that time frame.</p>

            <p>Hi Thanks for the all the info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a stored copy of VFPODBC.msi installed it everything works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to confirm I have Office Pro Plus 2013 and using Access 2013 running on a clean fresh install of Win10 x64 1607. &nbsp;I am reading , not writing fortunately, to VFP 9 tables and I think this is why it all works. &nbsp;I did read a note somewhere that the ODBC
 driver is only fully compatible up to VFP6 but will read only VFP 7, 8 &amp; 9 tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked with an old XP machine that had the oleDB installed but yet the ODBC admin still showed only VFPODBC which by the way is dated 1999. &nbsp;So obvioulsy whatever benefit the oleDB driver has I don't need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>It made ‚Äúall of a sudden‚Äù sense that in the past you likely were using the VFP odbc driver - so some "hope" did exist for a solution here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it sounds like you can read 7-9 tables ‚Äì updates may or may not work in some cases, but it sounds like reading tables is ok and allowed (so you assuming here is also correct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that the suggesting of using oleDB does not clearly state that this ‚Äúsuggesting‚Äù also means to drop ODBC. (so I agree with the confusing on this issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it sounds like you have a working setup ‚Äì your persistence has paid off!</p>

<p>When you say that you have tried everything that we might suggest, it makes it difficult to suggest something new.&nbsp; If you could tell us what you have actually tired, we can possibly add some new ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way that might work is to do an in-place "upgrade" of Windows 10 to the very same version as you now have.&nbsp; Mount the install media or ISO file in Windows and run setup.exe from it.&nbsp; This will reinstall Windows 10 without changing your installed Apps
 and data, just as an upgrade from one version to the next does.&nbsp; Often this can fix issues that have been otherwise difficult to troubleshoot.</p>

                    I can't figure out a way to put the Skype icon on the system tray.&nbsp; My previous version of Skype allowed me to put the Skype icon on the System Tray and would indicate when a new Skype message came in.&nbsp; Excellent, user friendly behavior.&nbsp; This new version
 seems to have removed those features.&nbsp; Am I missing something here?

<p>This isn't a great answer, but I had the same question. What I found is that a new computer came with the Skype
<em>App </em>installed. I found a link to the regular old Skype application here:&nbsp;https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the app and installed the desktop application and viola! a systray icon. HTH.</p>

            I would prefer to use the latest version. Its a shame we have to keep using the non-recommended version to just get a systray app icon.

    <title>Office 365 installed Word and Speak will not change voices. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tracypad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 installed Word and Speak will not change voices.</h2>
                    <p>I am so tired of hearing Microsoft David's voice when I mean to have Microsoft Zira, or, better yet, one of the Ivona voices / now Harpo, I bought for my screenreader. Here's what I used to do to make Word (which is still clunky in the accessibility department
 and doesn't surface even the Speak command in the QAT for text-to-speech) pick up the actual voice I wanted to read to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install the Ivona voice and set it as the default voice for the entire OS. Do this in Control Panel only. The Metro option will effect nothing in Word.</p>
<p>2. Go into Word and set my Language as English (Canada) -- I believe as the default. This would pick up the new voice for much easier listening, seeing as Ivona voices have some
<em>inflection</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this work with the O364 installed version of Word? Well, apparently not. So now I've gone backwards in the accessibility capabilities of my computer. I'm not too pleased with this. Does anyone know of a way to change this so that it works? I'll continue
 trying to change out the voice and have Word (somehow) detect it. If I find an answer, I'll let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Why don't I use 'Read Aloud'? It uses Zira, at least! Well, I can't use my arrow keys to edit my document as it reads is why (using the keys can also cause Word to crash). This is a very basic and helpful functionality that Speak
<em>does </em>allow. Why have Word read aloud to you, if you can't correct the copy? I mean...? Writing is my career. I'd love it if the software could be flexible and consistent around TTS accessibility!<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi there! Okay. My own testing is coming up fruitless re. changing voices. The problem I have is that the voices really do lack inflection when reading, and that makes
<em>all </em>copy sound bad. Kira is probably the best reader for this situation, as she does tend to sound more excited than aggressive, but I can't have her read, apart from Read Aloud (which won't let me edit freely, or use, say, CTRL + &lt;-- to get to a correctable
 passage or word in a hurry). Meantime, Speak is one of my very favourite things about Word, and a secret best-friend to dyslexics. Word isn't exactly used the same way as the Learning Tools in OneNote that it feels like you adopted the Read Aloud technology
 from. Btw, I appreciate the Learning Tools, as is. I really like them. I feel like Word's just not there for some reason. Here's the information you need:<br />

            I'm not sure what to post about? Changes to 'Read Aloud', or to 'Speak'? Or both? Also, a change to the voices to inflect them would be helpful, because then your copy wouldn't sound terrible. What do you think, Suzanne?&nbsp;

<h2>            Nokia C3-01 shortcuts and Opera problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've owned a Nokia C3-01 for about 3 months and everything was alright until now. I have two different kind of problems :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- first of all, the Opera browser won't start, it had been working fine and now it just doesn't boot anymore. I cannot upgrade it, nor re-install it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- second, which is really really annoying, I can't set up the shortcut bar and the go-to menu as I want. There is only a predetermined list of widget that I can choose. For example, I want (or wanted since it doesn't work anymore) &nbsp;to have Opera in the shortcutbar
 on the main screen, but it isn't on the list. Same problem with nearly every applications I find useful. If I want to use them I have to follow a painful way through folders and folders...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed by accident Opera from the go-to menu and cannot get it back there too !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone is encountering the same issues and can help. I've googled for these but didn't find anything, so excuse me if the topic already exist here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx a lot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jim</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Regarding Opera mini, it just doesn't work well in C3-01. Try installing UC Web, this browser is very fast, more interesting and overall richer in features than opera mini.You may visit 'wap.ucweb.com' from your mobile browser to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The solution to your second problem is that you have to run your application atleast once, then it is listed in 'application list' when you are personalizing your 'goto-menu' or 'shortcuts-bar'. It so happens that every application you run whether from
 phone memory or memory card is listed in application list which becomes tiring after sometime.</p>
<p>-Also update your phone software from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps....:smileyhappy:</p>

<p>Hey I am also encountering the same problem but not with opera mini but with whatsapp and store. I deleted it by mistake of my shortcut bar but then I couldn't see it agen, I tried what you said Vinit to Run the application but when I go to application list,
 the only things I see are community and Nokia browser.</p>

<h2>            Music App Constantly Stalls Lumia 635</h2>
                    <p>So I've bought the new Lumia 635, and love Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Except the Music app.&nbsp; I've reformatted the brand new SD card twice, and the app constantly crashes when I play mp3 from it.&nbsp; Is there a storage limit on the phone?&nbsp; It is a 64gb Micro SD card.
<br />
<br />
I have done a soft and hard reset on the phone, to no avail.</p>

      If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />
      <br />

            To convert an image to text requires OCR software. Your scanner may have come with a suitable OCR package amongst the software pack that came with it, or you could use Microsoft Office Document Imaging which is part of the tool kit provided with Office
 2003 - though you would probably have to re-scan and you would certainly lose the formatting. MODI is not installed by default.<br />
<br />
Hand written text however is going to be a challenge for the very best OCR software and probably impossible unless all the recipes were written in the same hand, which would give you a sporting chance of training the OCR software to recognise the hand written
 letters. My instinct tells me that it would probably be quicker to retype the recipes (or pay a copy typist to do it for you).<br />

            Yes I use IE not Edge - delete browser history is checked (can't do this with Edge which is why I do not use it). Problem was if e.g. I'm on YouTube and go to full screen display I get an annoying box at the bottom asking me if I want to allow once / options
 for this site. Never happened on XP, want stop this annoying box. MS had an online go at this (ref 140584911414) - this changed me to Edge an also killed all my Outlook server settings! Thanks Microsoft!

<p>another reply suggested I go to IE options, security, internet zone, custom, misc,, display mixed content and set to ENABLE - this did nothing! Still have the problem, never happened in WIN XP. What are Microsoft playing at? They took remote control of my
 PC yesterday to attempt to fix this, when they had finished I was left with an incomplete version of Edge (no home page etc) and my login to Outlook had lost all my email server settings! Took me an hour to reset it. Get a life, Microsoft!! Who pays your bills
 anyway? BTW want to remove Cortana (can't) Windows Defender (can't) Xbox apps (can't) Surely I choose what apps I run</p>

</p><p>Windows 10, Internet Explorer. When I access a site like YouTube and select full screen I get an annoying box at the bottom "Do you want to view... Allow Once, Options for this site" etc. I don't want this. Did a live session with Microsoft, when they<br />
had finished I was left with Edge, no homepage and also all my Outlook settings had been deleted, had to re-enter the lot! Also I don't want Cortana, OneDrive or Xbox but it appears that they cannot be removed. I don't want Cortana spying on what I do!!

</p><p>I keep posting a question but the forum seems to lose me each time. If I use IE such as YouTube when I select full screen I get an annoying box at the bottom saying "Do you want to view in full page ... allow once / options for this site" I don't want this.
 Did a remote session with MS to fix this - when they had finished I ended up with Edge, no home page and all my Outlook settings eg server connections had disappeared! Thanks MS, took me an hour or so to restore things. Also I don't want Cortana (the spy)
 or Windows Defender (I use McAffee) but these seem to be uninstallable. Is this a case of MS knows best? Also cannot uninstall Xbox. Anyone any clues??</p>

<p>Then you are blocking and/or deleting the Cookie that would "remember" that you always want to see videos in full-screen. If you want to resolve this issue, you will have to stop doing this.</p>

<strong>"</strong>GroupName<strong>" </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>-LinkType</strong> Members
<strong>-Links</strong> member1@contoso.com<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>member2@contoso.com. Please be kindly noted that it is not feasible to add external guest via this command.</p>

            I'm no expert, but I help setup a car kit once and we had to tell the car kit which phone was the default, as the N73 doesn't scan constantly and automatically connect when a paired device comes into range.<br />
<br />
Ensure the N73 is detectable, then once in your car - activate the car kit, which should detect and establish a connection with the phone.

            I have an N73 and 616 too and it works fine!<br />
<br />
But make sure you start the connection from the 616, it doesn't work any other way. So go to User Data -&gt; User 1 or whatever and Usage mode -&gt; Bluetooth phone, then you can search for and pair with the N73.<br />
<br />
Worth also noting that N73 supports the Remote SIM mode but this has to be turned on from your handset's bluetooth menu. Only use this if your 616 has an aerial plugged in!<br />
<br />

<h2>            Show Formatting Mark for Keep with Next</h2>
                    <p>In Word 2010, I generally have all my paragraphs set as "keep lines together", because I don't like paragraphs breaking over pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of this when I am displaying formatting marks I have bullets to the left of all my paragraphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For certain paragraphs I like to set them to be "keep with next".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there is no way that I can see (via formatting marks) which ones these are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I can display (when editing) which paras are "keep with next"?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>An easier way to make the determination than going to the Paragraph dialog would be to assign a macro containing the following code to a button on the QAT and then when you click that button, it will tell you whether the first paragraph that is selected

            <p>Thanks Doug</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I was hoping to "see" formatting etc marks to show this direct on the screen, ie without having to "go into each paragraph" (via macro or other).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the "bullet" (ie keep lines together) formatting marks seem to disappear if I click the "set as default" buttom on the paragraph&nbsp;dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this does not always seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if the solution is along the lines of ensuring my style is (by default) set to keep lines together.&nbsp; I will experiment with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(As an aside I find styles far harder to work with / control in Word 2010, than in 2003.)</p>
<p>

<br />
there are 8 identities in from previous backups in Office 2008 Identities. <br />
the current one has database of&nbsp; 21.68 GB which contains a database, a rebuilt database that failed has 20.1MB, and from 2011 (march and october) i find "old database" with ~13 GB and "old database 1" with &lt;18 GB<br />
<br />
plus the disk is almost full. i have thrown out everything i could and it is still only 9 GB available of 237 GB. i have transferred everything to external HDs and dropbox (~12 GB). emptied the trash, but still not much room.

            What data you need to delete is up to you, no one here would be able to suggest anything regarding that.<br />
If a rebuild fails, create a new identity to open entourage first.<br />
<a href="http://www.office.mvps.org/how_to/new_identity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.mvps.org/how_to/new_identity.html</a><br />
If that works you could look into importing the old database into this one.<br />

<h2>            How to setup proxy authentication in Windows Phone 8&#63;</h2>
                    I've connected my Lumia 920 to the workplace WiFi setup, but proxy authentication is required. How do you do this on Windows Phone 8? (it was available in WP7)

            <p>Hi, I was having the same issue but it seems to have been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first "handling" was to set up a wifi hotspot using my PC (Windows 8.1) using CONNECTIFY and also installed&nbsp;CCPROXY as a service (ccproxy handles my credentials for the authenticated proxy that my workplace provides). I then created a user in CCPROXY
 for my phone so I can connect my Windows Phone 8.1 to my PC using the wifi hotspot and to the Internet through the CCPROXY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works fine and provides internet connectivity for my phone, so I was happy. The drawback of course is that you have to have the PC on and acting as a hotspot at all times. No PC, no internet connection to the Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I recently did not have my PC on and my phone still worked! In other words, Windows Phone 8.1 seems to have "learned" the connection to the particular workplace proxy and is now providing the credentials directly.&nbsp; It does not prompt me for user
 name and password, but it connects regardless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for a fact that my workplace proxy has not changed at all, as I still need to provide credentials for my PC when I connect to the internet.&nbsp; But I read somewhere that Windows Phone 8.1 had several improvements on connectivity and it appears that it
 now remembers connections to that particular proxy and is handling them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p />

<h2>            How to &#34;accept&#34; contact request with the latest version</h2>
                    <p>How come it's impossible to "accept" contact request!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My parents had to re-create their Skype account as their account was disabled because of the latest version! Now, they can't even accept my request to add me to their contact, so I can't reach them without using "request contact" message field which doesn't
 allow me to re-send the request too often to continue the conversation...&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is going on???&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI, my laptop is Win 7, parents using Win 10... does it matter!?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Back in the previous version of Skype, your friends and family had to send you a contact request and wait for you to accept it before you could talk to them. Now, this is no longer necessary. Your friends and family can talk to you immediately, and you can
 do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When someone reaches out to you for the first time, you can choose to accept or block messages or calls from that person.</p>

<h2>            I need a formula that will calculate a value if a date falls in a date range.</h2>
                    Here is sample of what i am trying to do.<br />
<br />
Cell E1:&nbsp; Hire Date - ie: 5/1/2018<br />
Cell Q1: Salary - $50K<br />
<br />
I have a table that I am trying to calculate the value of the salary (based on days) per month and for it to automatically enter into a month.<br />
<br />
Forecast Table:<br />
<br />
Cell BT2<br />
April 2018<br />
<br />
Cell BU2<br />
May 2018<br />
<br />
Cell BU3<br />
June 2018<br />
<br />
What I am looking to get is a formula that enters the value of the salary in each month it would hit on my forecast?<br />
<br />
My result would look like this:<br />
<br />
April 2018&nbsp; 0<br />
May 208 - (36.99*31=4,246.58)<br />
June 2018&nbsp;&nbsp; (4,246.58)<br />

</p><p>Please note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Presently we have <strong>mentioned Month / Year in text format (ex. "April 2018") in column A as per your query</strong>. In case this contains a valid date the formula may change &amp; become simpler;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Presently we have only taken the date of joining into consideration for calculation of monthly salary, per your query. In case you want to consider the date of leaving also the appropriate change can be made.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac Office 365 send&#47;receive failing</h2>
                    <p>We are seeing an issue with a user who after several days is unable to send/receive messages. Removing the profile and setting it up again appears to resolve the issue but only temporarily. Details about the environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS version: 10.12.2</li><li>Outlook version: 15.29</li><li>Hybrid On-prem and online Exchange with AD FS</li></ul>
<p>We have several users on Macs but a majority of them are using OWA as their primary email client because of the issues they are experiencing with Outlook for Mac. We have one user who is insisting on using Outlook for Mac instead of OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have verified there are no updates available, verified the user can authenticate through OWA and sign in to Outlook with out issue initially. We were able to grab debug files from Outlook and found this error periodically:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After spending some time with Microsoft support on the phone today, I could once again configure the account as an Exchange/Office 365 in Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before moving on, I did validate the account itself by setting up an Exchange profile on a Windows machine, which worked flawless. Then, on my Mac, I created a temporary user account and set up the same thing there - also worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By Microsoft support's suggestions, I opened up the keychain app in the OSX user account not working, changed to "All objects" and then located and deleted all entries (excluding the ones of type "Key") that showed up when searching for the following:</p>
<p>- Exchange</p>
<p>- Office</p>
<p>- 365</p>
<p>- Outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to authenticate the first time when Outlook was started after this (of course, since all entries were deleted) but this seems to have done it for me.<br />
<br />
Let's hope it stays up for the next few days, but since my config did work for roughly a year I have high hopes...</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What are you using to sign in to Skype for your second account? Are you using the email address? Or a personalized Skype Name?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you‚Äôre using your email address on your second Skype account to sign in to Skype, that means the account was created by signing in to Skype
 using the email address and to delete it, the Microsoft email address needs to be deleted.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the second account has a personalized Skype Name and not yet linked to a Microsoft account, you need to create a dummy Microsoft account
 and link it to the Skype account you want to delete then follow the account deletion process for Microsoft.
</span></p>

<h2>            Friends search results are limited and i cant find some of my friends.</h2>
                    <p>I ask some of my friends about their skype names but i cant find them because the search results are limited.</p>
<p>For example if i search about a name and surname "maria maria", it show me on results only 20-25 people on results. I cant scroll down to find more people. Check this picture&nbsp;https://imgur.com/a/LCp9T</p>
<p>It show me only 25 people with this name but i cant scroll down to find the people i want.</p>
<p>In our country we have alot of people with the same name and surnames, this means that is impossible to find my friends with these search limits.</p>
<p>I try the skype versions of windows 10, android phone and browser version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can i skip this limit so i can find my friends?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the contacts you want to add are not appearing on the results, I suggest you to use their unique
<em>Skype Name</em> when searching them on Skype. Other people might have the same name on the directory, so it will be harder to search using display name.</p>

</p><p>If the people you want to add as contacts don't know how to check their Skype Name, please advise them to follow the steps on this link:

<h2>            Outlook 2016 search stopped working.  Did index rebuilds. On latest update</h2>
                    <p>All was fine last week.&nbsp; Windows 10 Enterprise 64.&nbsp; C Drive is a 1T SSD. 32G of Ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the weekend the system had some problems resulting in a lot of resets and reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the Outlook quick search doesn't work.&nbsp; It never completes the search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt the index. Takes over an hour if I don't touch the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails go to the Outlook data file which is about 5Gigs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run scanPST.exe on the Outlook data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebuilt the index again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook and Windows are on the latest level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 909 folders and the index rebuild says there are 66,690 or so entries. There are about 6 email accounts but just about all go to the data file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot operate Outlook without the search and need it to find the emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get this working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should be in the Index Search locations?</p>

            1. Try to update your Office installation first. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Look into following - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2769651/outlook-search-returns-no-matches-found" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/276965...</a> (Note rebuilding index takes some time. Hence, you will have to check after rebuilding is completed)
<br />
<br />If above didn't solve the issue
<br />
<br />Below are general troubleshooting options for Outlook. Try one by one and and check after each step (leave step 3 as you have already done that)
<br />
<br />1. Create new Outlook profile to rule out corruption in Outlook profile. - <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/create-an-outlook-profile-ha102749460.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Repair your Outlook data files - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-Outlook-Data-Files-pst-and-ost-64842a0a-658a-4324-acc6-ef0a6e3567cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Run SCANPST.exe. Open your Outlook &gt; Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; Under processes tab, right click on Outlook.exe &gt; Open File Location &gt; This location contains SCANPST.exe which you should double clikc to run
<br />
<br />4. Disable Anti-virus temporarily. 
<br />
<br />5. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />6. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile. 
<br />
<br />7. Right click on Outlook icon and run as Administrator.
