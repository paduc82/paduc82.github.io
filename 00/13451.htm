<h2>            Auto Accept&#47;Decline calendar meetings in outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple conference rooms at my office, all with their own user mailbox. They are all set up as shared calendars so that anyone from the office can see/reserve any time frame they want. I recently went in and set up the auto accept/decline feature
 so that anytime an employee creates a meeting and wants to reserve that conference room all they do is select the time frame on their calendar and invite the conference room. The conference room should automatically accept the invitation with the explained
 settings in place. When I would try and reserve a time frame for a conference room by using the above steps, it would show up on the calendar for the conference room but would not accept the invitation automatically
<em>unless&nbsp;</em>I was logged into that computer in said conference room. I do not know why this is. Why will the conference room mailbox not auto accept my meeting invitation unless I am logged in on that computer?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your response. Microsoft Community is intended to be used by Home users where they can get assistance to everyday home user type questions. Your issue with the auto accept/decline feature for multiple shared calendars, on Exchange accounts,
 in Outlook 2016 is better suited for the IT Pros in our TechNet forums. With this in mind, we suggest that you post your question on the link provided below:</p>

<h2>            Microsoft needs technical support...</h2>
                    
<p>Im not sure if im in the right place , but here goes anyway's...<br />
And if im in the right place , <strong>i want the whole community to take their part in this discussion, because we need Microsoft to listen and take&nbsp;immediate action.</strong></p>
<p>Ive had enaugh of this !!!</p>
<p>If I become arrogant in my post , then i think it reflects on how my experience with office365 is, and since microsoft is one of the Top IT companies in the world , I think its time they start solving some of these problems
<strong>right away...</strong></p>
<p><strong>First off :</strong> Office 365 concept is great , i like this idea very much. Everything in the cloud, everything secure, and you get all these benefits like the whole office package , and a huge storage space for your documents and pictures for
 a low price..</p>
<p>And alot more you can do with it...</p>
<p><span><strong>But ....</strong></span></p>
<p>Every single company that I move to office365 will get mad at me and im loosing customers because of this...</p>
<p>Ive tried every single scenario , on moving mail and files to the cloud , but <strong>
every single scenario brings errors and disapointment....</strong></p>
<p>Ive spent weeks and months searching the forums to try to solve <strong>huge</strong> amount off issues after I started the process of moving to O365 in my community...</p>

<p>OK,,, just like Right now ....</p>
<p>I just finished moving a company to o365 .. with alof of errors and problems along the way..</p>
<p>At least I got all their Data to sharepoint, (10.000 documents that took only 4-5 gb of sharepoint space) (With errors)</p>
<p>Their mail is <strong>still not up in the cloud.</strong>.. and when I try to do that , all computers just crash and nobody is able to work because outlook will just freak out !</p>
<p>Right now , I have the owners laptop computer .</p>
<p>I told him .. "Every user can have 1 TB of personal OneDrive Data, and you can sync your work documents to the Laptop and work anywhere in the world.."</p>
<p>He said : "WoW , thats nice ,, please bring me to that place...."</p>
<p><span><strong>BUT ....</strong></span></p>
<p>Ive had his computer now for a week. and all im doing is moving his pictures to OneDrive and syncronizing the sharepoint to laptop.</p>
<p>It should be easy... Right ??</p>
<p>He is becoming VERY angry for all this time away from his computer..... And asks me , "How difficult is it to move some pictures to the cloud , and syncronizing sharepoint documents to my laptop"</p>
<p>HE'S right !!!!!!</p>
<p>How freaking difficult is that ?!?!?!</p>
<p>It should be so smooth that he should be able todo that him self....</p>
<p>Ive Had every single error moving his pictures to OneDrive !!!!</p>
<p>And now im getting Every single error when im syncronizing sharepoint online to his laptop......</p>

<p>I need this to work !!!</p>
<p>This is my life here ... my work and my reputation !!!</p>

<p>When I sell companies Office365 i say : "Office 365 is the future, everyone is going there , everything soo easy and smooth..... You get all your documents secure, backed up, accessable from anywhere, on any device,,,, and it is 100% the way to go for you"</p>
<p>When the companies say "O.K. you got me,,, i want it "</p>
<p>I start the process of moving the files ... Error Error Error Error Error !!!!</p>
<p>After finishing the file transferrs i start moving the mail ... Error Error Error Error Error Error Error Error !!!</p>
<p><strong>Im afraid of moving another company to office365.</strong>.. But I want to offer my customers the concept of "The cloud"</p>
<p>Since I started writing this post , ive had to restart the laptop 6 times, &nbsp;because OneDrive is giving me all kinds of errors ... never the same.... and it has only completed 20 word documents since i started writing this post !!!. (Its a new computer by
 the way , with a good internet connection)<br />
I´ve even had this one error "We're having trouble connecting to the internet, please contact help desk"</p>
<p>But when I ping microsoft , i get a good reply... So I have internet .. But why ,, why .., why is OneDrive having trouble connecting to the internet !</p>
<p>I got another error like 30 minutes ago saying "Credentials needed" .... But I have already loged in with the right credentials, and ticked keep me logged in !</p>
<p>Documents for companies , is important..</p>
<p>Personal pictures from employees are important...</p>
<p>This should be 100%</p>
<p>The laptop owner is coming here in 2 hours to pickup his computer , and im getting Red X´s all over sharepoint and OneDrive !!!!!</p>
<p>What the **** am I suppose to say to him ???</p>

<p>The process of moving a company to office365 should be something like this :</p>
<p>after verifying the domain , it should be fairly easy to move the mail to the cloud...
<strong>In every scenario ! (IMAP, cutover, staged, importing, whatever ! )</strong></p>
<p>Moving files to sharepoint should also be fairly easy and smooth....</p>
<p>Users should be able to use office365 on-prem and online easy...</p>

<p>I remember the good old days, when companies used FTP and mapped drives from file servers.</p>
<p>And you could just backup everything to off-site servers.</p>
<p>Everything worked , and everything was easy to setup...</p>
<p>Cheap for companies , and good for business !</p>

<p>Sighhh ... I could go on and on .. but im going to shut up now !</p>

<p>Please take note there is a service incident going on for Onedrive for Business. Migration to O365 is smooth especially when performing email migration. You have to choose the right time and look out for services outages.

<p>Oki,, now its only few minutes untill the owner picks up his computer ,,</p>
<p>And the computer is freezing every time i get into windows ....</p>
<p>Im unable to access windows....</p>
<p>I really dont want to stop sync and start over , because his pictures were 30 gb , and that would take days to sync to his laptop again....</p>
<p>This is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>This is the way I use as well..</p>
<p>Import tool</p>
<p>I feel like its the best way.</p>
<p>But i have come across some errors along the way....</p>
<p>Can I ask you few more question :</p>
<p>Do you use the import tool for sharepoint data as well ?</p>
<p>When you are importing huge amounts of mail with the import tool...</p>
<p>Do you just say to your customers ... im sorry , but your old mail will not be accessable untill the migration process is complete and mapped to users ?</p>
<p>Because it takes alot of time importing 50 mailboxes , each mailbox with 2-5 gb per size...</p>
<p>And then everyone has their calendars ,contacts and memo´s wich does not go up with the import tool ... does it ?</p>

<p>Hi Iris</p>
<p>Thanks for the follow up.</p>
<p>I cannot check it now..</p>
<p>I had to delete the whole sharepoint folder within the computer and resync everything.</p>
<p>That fixed the issue for this company</p>
<p>I just hope other companies we are servicing are not experiencing any issues on sharepoint.. Their sharepoint files are very important and if they have been changing hundreds of files within their sharepoint folders while there is no syncronization and then
 some days later OneDrive sync´s all the server files to the computer ... Their whole work last week is for nothing... "Hundreds of files"</p>
<p>I hope nothing happens with company files,,</p>
<p>And I hope microsoft can prevent something like this from happening again.</p>
<p>I still love o365 and the concept.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the follow up.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Aron</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 and co-authoring</h2>
                    <p>VERY FRUSTRATING</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a workbook. I shared it with my coworker through the share (little person symbol and+) at the top. It's saved in OneDrive. It works perfectly with word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't work with excel. We can't edit at the same time. We are working in 2 different worksheets so there's no data loss issue. I really need this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We keep getting the "locked for editing" alert. I made sure he has permissions and I went to the Shared (legacy) bit and checked allow changes by more than one user at a time. It says [Shared]. I don't know what I'm doing wrong to get this stupid thing working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have the same computer, the same office versions, the same everything. I made sure he's opening the same file. We work for a big corporation, but it works perfectly in word so why would there be a problem in excel?</p>

<p>Hi MrA'sMrs,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know where are you trying to edit or work with Excel? Are you and your colleagues use the Outlook desktop or Outlook online app? Do you have a subscription under Office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You and your colleagues can only edit the Excel workbook using the Excel Online app where you can collaborate real time. Once you have opened the file in a desktop version it will give you a message prompt "<strong>The file is locked for editing by (the
 name of who is currently working with the file)</strong>" see the image below for reference. This might be the one that you also see when working with the shared Excel file.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/683ef271-7756-440f-a8f5-84fa75923d92?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/683ef271-7756-440f-a8f5-84fa75923d92?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Take note that selecting <strong>Save and edit a copy of the file</strong> will only appear on your end or on the end of whom create changes using the Outlook desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, co-authoring is available in certain versions of Excel where you need to have a subscription under Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following articles can help you know more about how a shared workbook works:</p>

    <title>EXCEL 2019 crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelpiasecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            EXCEL 2019 crashes</h2>
                    <p>Recently EXCEL started to crash on scroll, window expansion, using data import (txt files), and also during highlighting cell blocks for copying etc. I have tried
</p>
<p>
</p><p>starting EXCEL in safe mode =&gt; no change</p>
<p>unclicking EXCEL addins =&gt; no change</p>
<p>unclicking COM addins =&gt; no change</p>
<p>dble checked latest upgrades =&gt; no change</p>
<p>tried to repair Office =&gt; no fix</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem did not exist with 2016 up to a point when the problem started occurring albeit (lightly). I uninstalled Office, re-installed no fix of the problem. I then upgraded to 2019 in the hope it would fix it, no change. The problem got aggravated after
 the last Windows 10 update (yesterday) which basically incapacitates EXCEL, not WORD though or POWERPOINT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions beyond the steps outlined above (most of which I got from other threads and blogs)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>M&nbsp;</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.

<p>thanks for the response. Tried ... did not do anything for me. I open a 3.2MB EXCEL file, try to resize window, blitz ... gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 32KB EXCEL file seems to work better, I can resize, scroll, change worksheets. However, when I use the data load wizard to load a comma separated .txt file (very small), and then try to manipulate the new worksheet/data file just by resizing or zooming
 ... blitz and EXCEL closes. I am not working with a lot of data here, actually very little (I monitor the memory usage also, plenty left, i.e. &gt;50%).</p>

    <title>Need Fixed Line in Middle of Document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fixed line - mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Fixed Line in Middle of Document</h2>
                    
<p>I want to create a template that separates my page document into 2 halves (a top and a bottom half) when in portrait format.&nbsp; I would like a line to be fixed half way so I can quickly type problems in the top half and then copy them in the bottom half, as
 well as have the line there for easy cutting purposes.</p>
<p>I have already tried to put the line behind the text and every other option possible in the formatting toolbox, yet every time I go to insert text and then press "return" to go to the next line, the actual line in the middle also moves down a line.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>Hi Mac</p>
<p>The key with this is the fact that a graphic in Word that has "text flow" is anchored to a paragraph on the same page. And the graphic can be formatted to "Move with text" (up and down the page as the paragraph to which it is anchored moves) - or not. By
 default, this option is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you don't provide any information about which version of Word you're using, which means it's difficult for us to give you the exact path to this option...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try right-clicking, then choose Format AutoShape (or something similar - near the bottom of the context menu). Go to the Layout tab, click Advanced (or whatever the button is labelled). In the Picture Position tab, look for the checkbox - it will be near
 the bottom of the dialog box. Remove the check mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I would probably insert a table with one column and two rows, then set the row heights to an "exact" measurement and apply a border only to the inner line between the two rows. This has a number of advantages, not least that you'll have to independent
 paragraph marks. With the approach you're trying, you're not going to be able to copy/paste easily, as Word will need to "type" paragraph marks until the text goes past the position of the line before you can paste. Using a table would also avoid the problem
 you're having currently.</p>

<p>If I understand what you are trying to do, it would be much simpler to use the "2 pages per sheet" selection under "Multiple pages" on the
<strong>Margins </strong>tab of <strong>Page Setup</strong>. With portrait orientation, you get two landscape halves printing on the same sheet. You don't actually have to duplicate the problems top and bottom, as you can just print pages 1,1 to print the same
 page twice.</p>

            What build/version? did you just upgrade? what is your system CPU 32bit or 64bit Home or Pro, I've notice on a few system when it does an upgrade you may need to check the display settings, one other thing that works sometimes is to do a hard reset if
 a PC hold the power button down until it shuts off and reboot, if a laptop remove battery do the hard shut down when it has shut down remove the AC power adapter then hold the power button down for 10-15 sec's plug AC power back in and reboot with out the
 battery check system after it comes back up and has stabilized if ok re-install the battery

            Huh...The windows key,the search next to it and taskbar in general does nothing at the moment.I've seen some other posts saying you need to type some commands in powershell but that had a lot of errors to me and did nothing.

<h2>            SharePoint Online - Disable Outlook notifications across tenant</h2>
                    <p>Our SharePoint site is slow. After reviewing network activity on each request, we found that one of the biggest performance hits we get is from all the scripts surrounding Outlook notifications. This is not desired in our implementation, and I was curious
 if this could be disabled across the entire tenant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the situation and help you, we'd like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Regarding the "Outlook notification" you mentioned, is it the Desktop Alert described in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-new-message-alert-pop-up-on-or-off-9940c70e-b306-442e-a856-d94b20318481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Could you please share a related screenshot about the notification? (To protect your privacy, note to mask the private message in the screenshot.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>This is the browser notification that exists in SharePoint Online, not the desktop notification. I'm analyzing the browser's network traffic on a each page request in our solution, and most of the activity is from outlook and office365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware of how to disable this alert on an individual computer, but I'm trying to improve the performance for 15,000+ people, and would like to disable this across the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb91e086-b8fc-4187-8281-b7c94091ef00?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb91e086-b8fc-4187-8281-b7c94091ef00?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to Outlook notifications, there are several unnecessary tracking services (CEIP, footprint, telemetry) that collect our usage data on each request which I can't seem to disable. The biggest complaint I constantly hear about SharePoint is how
 slow it is. Turning these services off would improve the experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the "Outlook notifications" you mentioned, we'd like to confirm more detailed information so that we can troubleshoot and check if they can be turn off across tenant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Where do you see the notifications? In the upper-right corner in
<a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 portal</a> or in the upper-right corner in Outlook on the web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.We can set email notifications for certain situation in SharePoint online.
</p>
<p>So could you please share with us some examples about the exact activities which trigger the notifications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.You mentioned that you are aware of how to disable the alert on an individual computer, could you please let us know you steps about it? It would be helpful for us to know about the notification
 you want to turn off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your time and effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Isn't that the same service? The notification that I'm referring to appears in the browser window when using SharePoint Online. I'm assuming that this includes the Office 365 portal as well as OWA, we don't use OWA. I'm concerned with it being active
 on SharePoint. Our users already receive notifications though their desktop version of Outlook, so if they are on our intranet when they receive an email, they get two "dings". But more importantly, the service is slowing down our SharePoint Online experience
 due to the amount of scripts that are run on every page request.</p>

</p><p>From a performance standpoint, we are trying to limit the amount of scripts that are run in order to speed up the page load time. These are the unnecessary outlook-related scripts that are running on EVERY SINGLE page request in our SharePoint system.
 Almost none of the are cached, and many are downloaded and executed quite a few times:</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the detailed information with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly we'd like to explain that it is not available to turn off all notifications across the whole tenant. Different notifications for Office 365, Outlook and SharePoint need to be turned on individually.
 The incoming emails notification you mentioned can be created based on different conditions. For example, the email notification for the changes of SharePoint documents or items, we need to cancel the alert manually in SharePoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand what you want is to troubleshoot the cause for SharePoint performance issue(site running slow, page loading slow), we will try our best to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, we suggest you try following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.find a page in SharePoint online which load slowly, you can find one which has the biggest performance issue.</p>
<p>2.follow the steps as I shared with you in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">private message</a> to collect the fiddler logs. We need the fiddler log to check the details and it is helpful for our troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.When a page contains a lot of web part, it will slow down the speed when loading it.
</p>
<p>We suggest you open a problematic page in SharePoint, in the address bar, add
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59bff2b6-0331-4b2c-a664-2b7a8c66bfd7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59bff2b6-0331-4b2c-a664-2b7a8c66bfd7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you check all web part you have added, see if there is any web part you don’t use now, if you are willing, you can delete it, then check if there is any improvement when you load the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Moreover, we suggest you refer to the suggestions in the articles and try troubleshooting the performance issue and increasing SharePoint performance:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/using-content-search-web-part-instead-of-content-query-web-part-to-improve-perfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Using Content Search Web Part instead of Content Query
 Web Part to improve performance in SharePoint Online</a></p>

<p>Tina</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback. We have web parts that affect the speed of the page. I am aware of the performance hit that the client-side web part model presents. It makes zero sense to move the procedural code of constructing a web page into the browser.
 Moving traditional server side operations into the browser, along with all queries and data manipulation that go along with that is a major contributor to the slow response times and the poor feedback that we get from our SharePoint users. We have to live
 with that.<br />
</p>
<p>What I struggle to contend with are the myriad of services that offer no discernible value to the end user, and was hoping that there was a way to disable these features.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>In my previous post I shared a list of the offending files directly from the debugging tool in my browser. These are the files you would see in a fiddler dump. I will send that to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to find out if there is a way to prevent any of these scripts from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in the SharePoint on-premise platform, we were able to turn off the WsaUpload.ashx call (the Customer Experience Improvement Program, which uploads our usage data 5 times on each request and adds about 1 second to each page load), but apparently
 we cannot disable this feature in SharePoint Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

                    <p>Hey, on some websites like this one <a href="http://forum.bioware.com/topic/241434-mass-effect-1-updatedimproved-textures-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forum.bioware.com/topic/241434-mass-effect-1-updatedimproved-textures-mod/</a>&nbsp;that have a static background, the backgrounds starts spazzing out when I scroll using the mouse wheel, as if the background is trying to move when in fact it shouldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to fix that (apart from turning smooth scroll off)?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums. Let me assist you with your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We checked the link which you have provided. In fact we faced the similar behavior which you described. This behavior is default when you enable smooth scroll. You can disable this behavior only by turning off “Use smooth scroll” from Internet explorer,
 Advance option. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p>Smoothscroll combined with the speed of IE is main reason why I use IE and it's a shame to see bugs like this.</p>

            It works OK if you use the scroll bar instead of the mouse wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Try&nbsp;grabbing the scroll bar with the left mouse button, hold down the button, and drag your pointer into the text.)&nbsp; Otherwise, you can &nbsp;play with your mouse sensitivity settings in the
 Control Panel.

    <title>Can&#39;t send and recieve emails on my microsoft account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markjehlicka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t send and recieve emails on my microsoft account.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other week I added a new email address <strong>(a yahoo.com one)</strong> as an account alias for my Microsoft account. I then changed the primary alias from my original email address<strong> (a Hotmail.com one)</strong> too the yahoo.com one. After
 I did this I wasn't thinking and deleted my original Hotmail alias <em>from the list of aliases</em> and now I can't send or receive emails. I wasn't really worried about it because my understanding of the account alias setting was that changing your primary
 email address for your Microsoft account only changed the email address <em>you would use to login</em> to said account. I was under the impression that when I removed my original Hotmail alias that I made the account with the email address that other people
 sending emails to me type into their "send to" boxes would still be the same; the original Hotmail.com alias that I signed up for when I made the account on day one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can login just fine (using my yahoo.com alias as the login email address) . I can go through all my previous emails, contacts etc, but when I sign into another email account and send emails from&nbsp; that one too my original Hotmail address I get a "the Delivery
 to the following recipient failed permanently:" error message. when I login to my Hotmail account (using the yahoo alias) and try too send something to the other email address I don't even get an error. But I don't receive anything in the other email address
 either. So this is how I know that the email address does not send and receive emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I just delete my email address when I removed it from my account aliases? Why would it just let me do that without prompting me a "are you sure you want to do this" message? I have to type in a captcha too respond to an ad on kijiji but completely deleting
 an email address doesn't even prompt a warning? What bugs me is that this morning I decided to try and login too my Hotmail account using the original alias (the Hotmail.com alias I had removed from the list of aliases). But when I did that it said that "The
 email address does not exist." I then tried to make a NEW Microsoft account and typed in the old alias, pixel for pixel exactly, and it said that "This email address is already in use." What the sh*t Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please. This is a business account, and too get a new one would be an absolute hassle. I just want too send and receive emails with my original Microsoft alias that I signed up for with the account. I will do anything. I will donate my an organ if it comes
 down too it. PLEASE help me.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your understanding is incorrect. By removing the Hotmail/Outlook.com address you have eliminated that address as a mail destination. It can no longer receive mail. Your primary address now is a Yahoo
 address and the only place messages go when addressed to a Yahoo address is a Yahoo server. While your old address still exists in the Microsoft database and will for a period of time, it is no longer available for use and probably cannot be recovered.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What I would do is create a brand new Outlook.com alias for the same account so you can get mail again on the Microsoft server. Then, I'd set up the Yahoo address as a send/receive account in the Outlook.com
 account so you can get and send Yahoo mail from the Microsoft server, if that's what you want. (An aside: I wouldn't do that. I can't see the point. My opinion is that you should use the server associated with the address when sending/receiving mail to that
 address. It's the most efficient.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
You might try contacting Microsoft at&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/id-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/id-support/</a>. &nbsp;This will allow you to open a service call with technicians
 who can actually touch the Microsoft servers. No one here can do that. Most of us are volunteers who don't work for Microsoft.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
One final comment: Outlook.com is not a business-oriented mail service and, in my opinion, should never be used for business email. There are plenty of paid services for that and those services include real support. Even Microsoft has its Office 365 Business
 subscription service.</span></p>

            <p>Brian, my situation is similar in that I too lost my primary address as a result of bad information from a MS tech during the removal of Win10 from my daughter's computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; My daughter's email address is now my alias and I cannot add my Hotmail address
 back as primary.&nbsp; When trying to do that, an error message returns with "..that email is part of a reserved domain ..."&nbsp; Hours of phone calls to MS last week has done nothing more than create more frustration for me.&nbsp; I have submitted the online support form
 for help and have been told that I <strong>a support rep would contact me within 24 hours.&nbsp; It has been
 ms online help form?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The really sad part of this problem is that it was caused by the MS support tech who was helping me remove windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Seriously, I have been jerked around for weeks now with MIcrosoft's support. I have wasted over 30 hours posting on forums, sending emails to Microsoft and wasting time online chat and phone support. Every time the EXACT same thing happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spend an hour on the phone speaking to someone with a basic understanding of English to try and explain my problem, and when they finally understand what I am saying, they tell me that they "don't have the tools" to help me and that I should call X department.
 I call X department and they tell me to call Y department. I call Y department and they tell me to post on this forum. I post on this forum getting a response to email Z people. I email Z people and they don't respond back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am fed up with Microsoft's support. Everyone reads a script and the wait times too get to a support rep were over 20 mins. Granted I was calling a week after windows 10 release but still! And this problem we are having isn't complicated. It is silly and
 I am having trouble understanding HOW there isn't a simple fix to it. I can't believe that this hasn't happened to more people.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shirdot, if you get a solution to this problem we are both having <strong>PLEASE</strong> get back too me.

<h2>            problem with new LCD of nokia 5230</h2>
                    
<p>I have nokia 5230. &nbsp;2 days back I replaced its LCD screen on nokia care because it wasn't working after a little damage to it. &nbsp;After replacing, the new screen was working but its display color was too dull and greyish. I changed the the theme color but
 it was still looking dull and grey. so I talked to the nokia guy again and he said that new LCD screens of nokia are of this way only and we can't do anything about it. I don't know what should I do now. Plesase suggest me some solution.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58; Transfering multiple email accounts to a new computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to move my current .pst files to a new Outlook setup, I have 4 pop accounts and 3 IMAP.
</p>
<p>"outlook files" folder is available in "My Documents" , it contains one .pst file per email address as well as one generic outlook file and 2 archive files (why?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to create new accounts in Outlook in a new computer, how do I insure that each account gets its "inbox" and "sent" mail, I have a feling that the large generic Outlook date file is of importance but I do not know how to link it. In some cases I have
 accumulated years of emails (archive + sent) and wouldl like to restore these in the new set up.</p>
<p>I could use some help...</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I could use some help...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify a few things</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - The data files that are of utmost importance are the ones currently in use in your Outlook profile (or the ones being used in any given profile if you use more than one profile). The definitive way to determine that is by going to&nbsp;</p>
<p>File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab</p>
<p>- that shows what data stores (.ost/.pst files are currently active along with their location</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - For simplicity - .ost files are of no value since these automatically get re-created any time the applicable email account gets configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - In terms of &lt;Imap&gt; accounts in OL'2010 or earlier - the data store for the email folders related to a given Imap account also gets automatically re-created when the account gets configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - POP accounts can all use the same PST file or each can have their own - that can easily be determined when looking at the accounts under the Account Settings --&gt; Email tab and checking the destination file at the bottom of that window for each POP account
 highlighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 - What's of prime importance is the "default data file" which contains the default contact/calendar folders for the profile which can be either one of the pst files for a POP account or a stand-alone PST file. If it's a stand-alone file and you don't
 copy it over - you will be missing your contacts/calendar data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#6 - You can have a 100 different files in your &lt;Outlook files&gt; folder - irrelevant since it doesn't mean that they are being used. All kinds of reasons for how those could have been created. As for your &lt;archive&gt; files - whether those are important or not
 depends on whether or not you are actively "archiving" your data. At a minimum, all that multiple &lt;archive&gt; files in the folder means is that at some point, the option was set and the file was created. Only you know your archiving history and the file(s) currently
 configured depends on your global and folder specific archive settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#7 - When moving to a new computer using OL'2010 - you should make sure that you use the existing PST file for that account instead of letting Outlook create a new one. If the default data file in the original Outlook configuration was stand-alone then add
 it to your profile manually and make sure it is set to be the "default" again in the new configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#8 - Lastly, also important to remember how and what Outlook creates in terms of data files depends on the "sequence" in which the accounts are configured. Makes a difference if a POP account is configured before an IMAP account (or vice versa) in terms
 of what data file is automatically set as the 'default" for the profile. Also, what gets created automatically differs for OL'2013/'2016 versus OL'2010 or earlier.</p>

            <p>It would be preferable to have the application assign the correct extension to the file.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, the registry change described in the MSKB article should work in Excel 2010 too if you use</p>

<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Excel\Security</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14.0 is the internal version number of Office 2010, while 12.0 is the internal version number of Office 2007.</p>
<p>I can't find an MSKB article specific to Excel 2010 though.</p>

<p>i've been playing around with this and found that it's the 'sharepointenterprise' entry that is causing the trouble. &nbsp;if i run the command with just that option it fails. if i run the command with just the exchange option it succeeds. however it looks to
 be spelled correctly, when i run this command:</p>
<p><strong>$serviceplans = get-msolaccountsku;$accountservicestatus = $serviceplans.servicestatus; $accountservicestatus.serviceplan</strong></p>
<p><strong>i get this output (plus the other licenses)</strong></p>

<p>We tested this process using an older “mpam-fe” file and it does execute. It complains of the file being out of date and does not scan. It then asks for an updated file.</p>

<p>Hum, I'm running a lot of windows 10 machines, and not seeing this issue (and we also using SQL server).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you turned off the computer from sleeping?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You as noted&nbsp; turned off the power management for the network card:</p>
<p>eg this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eac06680-5a36-4f6b-b058-307da7feee0e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eac06680-5a36-4f6b-b058-307da7feee0e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing to check is if you have more then one work group or domain (if you have more then one, then win 10 can sometimes try to switch to the other network and thus you lose your connection. Same goes if you are using some type of VPN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, we assume this is not wi-fi? (again, they can often go to sleep, or disconnect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of "domain" and DNS resolution? Try linking to the SQL server using the IP address as opposed to the server name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in place of say:</p>
<p>SRV-PRODUCTION\SQLSERVER</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try linking the tables with this:</p>
<p>192.168.0.50\SQLSERVER&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(of course change the example IP here to the server ID).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are "super" confident the network card is not going to sleep, then the multiple network connections (such as VPN, cloud, your work-group, your work domain) etc. can cause the network stack to flip between such DSN resolutions with multiple networks,
 and thus you lose the name resolution to the server. By using the IP address to link the tables, you can thus often eliminate this issue from your troubleshooting efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>This also means turning off wi-fi if on the given computer - as once again, the flip from one network to the other can occur - again messing with "name" resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Pastelink special from excel into word not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathyfnd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pastelink special from excel into word not working</h2>
                    <p>We just updated to 365 office 2016 and my paste link special is not working correctly.&nbsp; I link in an excel spreadsheet into my word document using paste link special, it all looks fine and prints okay but after I save and close and then reopen it asks to
 update link, I click yes and the size of the link changes (not much but it changes) and that in turn messes with all my underlines and also in the word document it will change my paragraphs and may even move the link to next page.&nbsp; I have done this in the
 past with my old version of office and never had a problem.&nbsp; I have tried inserting a picture and it still has issues.&nbsp; Only way I can get it linked is to revert all my documents back to the old version and link my spreadsheets. Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my test steps, please have a look:</p>
<p>1. Create a table in a new workbook.</p>
<p>2. Create a new Word document and paste the table in step 1 into the document and choose paste special&gt;Link&gt;Microsoft Excel Workbook Project.</p>
<p>3. Save all files. Reopen both file and click Yes to update links.</p>
<p>4. Change contents in Workbook and the data change in Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, link size keep the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this issue is related to your document, please create a new document to check if you can reproduce this issue. If this issue persists, please launch your Office in
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please also share with me more info as below to let me have a better understanding of your scenario:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;The detailed version number of your OS(Click Win+R&gt;type CMD&gt;OK) and Office(File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information e.g. 180x build xxx).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The file format of the old file that link size not changes.</p>
<p>3. Does this issue happen to all workbooks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo</p>

<p>Thank you for your help,&nbsp; I tried to do as you said but the linked information would not even show up in the new word document.&nbsp; It only shows the bottom line of the table.&nbsp; I have never had that issue before.&nbsp; I did not start in safe mode as I wasn't sure
 I wanted to after the notice it gave me that I needed to accept an agreement and I did not have time to read it.&nbsp; The product information is version 1803(Build 9126.2315 Click button)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is 97 - 2003 Word Document (*.docm)&nbsp; That Is the only way it will work for me.&nbsp; And yes, this does happen to all my workbooks I have tried so far.</p>

<p>See above reply as this is in addition to that one.,</p>
<p>I did try to link on another computer in our office and I was able make it work with new documents but after the first save and opening of the file the link changes size and the lines and font are distorted.&nbsp; It does not change again after the initial change
 but the initial change messes up the whole link that it doesn't look right.&nbsp; &nbsp;I use this daily and am very frustrated I can't get it to look good.&nbsp; I appreciate your help!&nbsp; Kathy</p>
