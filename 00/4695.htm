<h2>            Ethernet Network &#39;Limited&#39; after installing Windows 10 9926</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, I cannot connect to internet after updating win 10 technical preview b 9926.</p>
<p>The connection is limited.</p>
<p>I am connected directly by ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i open the properties of the ethernet, it says:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IPv6 DNS Servers: fec0:0:0:ffff::1%1</p>
<p>fec0:0:0:ffff::1%2</p>
<p>fec0:0:0:ffff::1%3</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ipconfig gives me an empty default gateway, and an empty Conntction-specific DNS Suffix.</p>
<p><br />
What additional info is required?</p>

            There may be a compatibility issue with your drivers and UWP Apps like Skype for Windows 10 or with Skype in general. If it functions with AMCap, it may function fine with desktop applications. Have your tried the latest
<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Windows Desktop</a>? Alternatively you may want to update your Windows 10 to the latest release build (1809) to see if that changes anything in regards to compatibility. Especially if you are using the UVC drivers supplied with the OS.

<h2>            HTC HD7 STORAGE CARD NOT WORKING</h2>
                    Hi all, I have had my HTC HD7 for just about two months and am being frustrated by the phone. The phone restarts every now and then and brings this message:
<div>STORAGE CARD NOT WORKING - &nbsp;Your memory card has changed is damaged or is non-compatible. &nbsp;To fix this, turn your phone off and either remove the memory card or replace it with a new compatible card. Then reset your phone to the original factory settings.
 &nbsp;To learn how to reset your phone, refer to the owners manual. &nbsp;</div>
<div>The phone came with an inbuilt storage card , therefore i cannot remove it as suggested in the message. Please i would appreciate any help from you guys because as it stands now, am not able to use the phone. Some times it goes off for days and even when
 it comes up it only last for few minutes and then goes off again with the same message.</div>
                </div>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting Query in Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
HTC HD7 HAS hidden card. For replacement instructions read here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/android/how-to-upgrade-htc-hd7-sd-card-to-32gb.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thetechjournal.com/electronics/android/how-to-upgrade-htc-hd7-sd-card-to-32gb.xhtml</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Generally WP7 does not have user accessible SD card slot (Except Samsung Focus)&nbsp;however device manufacturers can use SD cards to expand device memory.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/sd-cards-and-my-phone.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/basics/sd-cards-and-my-phone.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you are using the device where there is no SD card slot or you did not installed&nbsp;SD&nbsp;card into Samsung Focus - there might be a HW issue with your phone internal memory. I would recommend contacting your mobile operator or manufacturer for service repair.</p>

    <title>Junction Table or composite key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roachabuggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Junction Table or composite key</h2>
                    I need help with this database design.&nbsp; I have the following tables set-up with a junction table.<br />
<br />
System Table&nbsp; Many Systems at 1 location<br />
System Index PK Autonumber<br />
System Name, ...<br />
<br />
Unit Table Many Units (Equipment) in many systems at 1 location<br />
Unit Index PK Autonumber<br />
Unit name, ...<br />
<br />
System Units Table Junction Table<br />
SU Index PK Autonumber<br />
Sys ID FK to System Table <br />
Unit ID FK to Unit Table<br />
<br />
The junction table has a multi-field index on SysID and UnitID as unique.&nbsp; <br />
I have other tables that fall under different groups/categories with some of the same info in each, i.e., make, model, s/n.&nbsp; However, these tables also have information specific to each group, therefore the reason for the other tables.&nbsp; I would like for the
 group tables to refer back to the SystemUnits PK.<br />
<br />
For instance<br />
Evaps Table<br />
EVIndex PK Autonumber<br />
EVID FK to System Units PK<br />
I'm pretty sure this is possible, but how would I go about data entry?&nbsp; Also how could I add the information from an Excel spreadsheet into the group tables without autonumbers to match the parent table SystemUnits?&nbsp; I believe the information would need to
 be added to the System and Unit tables first, so I would have difficulty adding the group tables into the database.<br />
<br />
There will be 10 different groups that will refer back to the System Units junction table.&nbsp; I also have another set of groups that will refer to the group tables, but that is another question that I may save for later.
<br />
<br />
Another possibility would be to create 2 fields in each group table that refer back to the Systems and Units tables with an index PK set as autonumber which would eliminate the junction table.&nbsp; Which method would be the best way to go? Thanks<br />

<br />
In modelling terms what you appear to be describing here is a type with a number of sub-types. This is represented by having one table to model the type and a set of tables to model each sub-type.&nbsp; Each sub-type table is related one-to-one to the (super) type
 table by virtue of the primary key of the subtype also being a foreign key referencing the primary key of the (super) type.<br />
<br />
A sub-type is characterized by sharing all attributes of its (super) type, but not those of other sub-types.&nbsp; Date gives the example of type Programmers with sub-types System Programmers and Application Programmers.&nbsp; Programmers would be a sub-type of Employees
 of course.<br />
<br />
So with your 'groups/categories'&nbsp; the table modelling the (super) type would have a primary key column, e.g. CategoryID and columns for the attributes common to all sub-types i.e. make, model and s/n.&nbsp; Each table modelling a sub-type would have a primary key
 column which is also a foreign key referencing the primary key CategoryID of the table modelling the (super) type.<br />
<br />
Where you include a foreign key column to reference the primary key of the SystemUnits table is dependent on whether it is the type, and consequently via it each of the sub-types, which have this attribute or whether each of the sub-types need to reference
 the SystemUnits table independently.&nbsp; If the former the foreign key column would be in the table modelling the (super) type; if the latter it would be in each of those tables modelling the sub-type which need to reference SystemUnits.&nbsp; As you have a surrogate
 key in SystemUnits&nbsp; you can reference that by a single column foreign key, though the relational model would have no bar to the use of a composite foreign key referencing the composite candidate key of SystemUnits.&nbsp; If you do the latter, however, you might
 as well remove the surrogate key from SystemUnits and make the candidate key a composite primary key.&nbsp; There would be no real advantage in using a composite key however, other than that it does make the semantics of the model a little clearer.<br />
<br />
As regards importing data from Excel the rule of thumb is that rows must be inserted into a referenced table before rows can be inserted into referencing tables.&nbsp; You'll find an example of this as DecomposerDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912%21169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
This file illustrates how non-normalized data from an Excel worksheet can be imported, first into a 'master' table and then decomposed into a set of correctly normalized tables by means of a series of 'append' queries, executing each in the correct sequence
 so that the referenced tables are populated before the referencing tables.<br />

<h3> emerald77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data type conversion problem when nulls are encountered in ADO query</h2>
                    <p>I have the following ADO query that reads data from an Excel file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT [Sheet1$].[Project_ID]<br />
FROM [Sheet1$]<br />
WHERE ((([Sheet1$].[Active_Indicator])=1));</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this query causes a "Run-time error 6: Overflow" because the value of Active_Indicator can be either 0, 1, or null, and the ACE engine appears to have a problem&nbsp;determining the correct data type (I assume due to the null values).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried adding the IIf and IsNull functions to the WHERE clause, but I still get the Overflow error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone kindly tell me how to modify my query to avoid the Overflow problem?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** UPDATE ***</p>
<p>After doing some more research, I discovered that if I modify my query as follows:</p>
<p>

            Thank you for your suggestion. &nbsp;Yes, I could do that, but the primary reason I'm using ADO to access and read the Excel file is because it contains over 800,000 rows, and it resides on a network share.&nbsp; So rather than downloading the entire file, my query
 reads only a subset of the file, thereby minimizing network traffic.

<h2>            Recent Document on another computer not showing in OneDrive</h2>
                    Last night I spent around 3-4 hours typing a lab report. When I was done I saved the file into my school onedrive account. I know it saved because when I hit the X button at the top, word did not prompt me to save. Upon reaching the school and logging
 on to the library computer, I checked my one drive and the file is no longer there. This document is very important and it is the fault of the program that it is not showing up. If someone could help me find the file that would be amazing.

<p>Hi Jakob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you try the following steps to check if the file is stored on OneDrive:</p>
<p>1. Sign into <a href="https://www.office.com/?auth=2&amp;home=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Portal</a>.</p>
<p>2. Click OneDrive.</p>
<p>3. Check if the file is stored on OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</p>
<p>1. The steps about how to store the file into OneDrive.</p>
<p>2. Check if the file is on the recent list. (Open Word on the computer which created the file&gt;click File&gt;select Open&gt;click recent)
</p>
<p>3. Check if you can store a new file into OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Qing </p>

<p>In the future, after saving, you may check your OneDrive library in a browser to make sure the file is synced up (see Qing's first reply).

<h2>            Software rendering problem</h2>
                    <p>I am using IE9 on Windows 7 32-Bit version. I selected the option to render in software mode. After restarting the explorer, i found a problem.&nbsp;Images of any kind&nbsp;do not load. Only text is visible. I do not get the red X mark either.
</p>
<p>But when i deselected the above option, i was able to view the images properly. Hardware accelerated mode shows images while the software rendering mode doesnt. Any possible fix?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue can occur if Internet Explorer 9is running in Software Rendering mode.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
By default, Internet Explorer 9 uses GPU Rendering mode. However, some outdated video cards and video drivers do not support GPU hardware acceleration. If Internet Explorer 9 determines that your current video card or video driver does not support GPU hardware
 acceleration, Internet Explorer 9 uses Software Rendering mode. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Method 1: To determine whether Internet Explorer 9 is using Software Rendering mode, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start Internet Explorer 9.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong> on the
<strong><span>Tools</span></strong> menu.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong> tab, locate the
<strong><span>Accelerated graphics</span></strong> section.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Verify that the
<strong><span>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</span></strong> check box is selected.</span></p>
<p><span>If this option is selected, Internet Explorer 9 is running in Software Rendering mode. If the option is grayed out, your current video card or video driver does not support
 GPU hardware acceleration.</span></p>
<p><span>For reference:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>I would also suggest you to try resetting the Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings
 that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Try the above steps and get back to us
 for further assistance. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>I have a compatible graphics card. I am not saying that i am unable to enable hardware acceleration. I am saying that when i select software rendering, web images like Bing or bing logo do not load. On the other hand, if i&nbsp;use hardware acceleration, the
 web images do load. Its not really a problem but if its a bug, a fix should be made i reckon.
</p>
<p>I just want to low down the load my graphics card faces while running IE in hardware acceleration mode.

</p><p>TWow:</p>
<p>Office 2016 appears to have this problem for many people, and I have yet to find (even after hours of searching) a satisfactory fix.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you discover a workaround, I'd love to hear about it - this is incredibly frustrating behaviour on Office's part.</p>

<h2>            Can not import dbx files from outlook express into outlook 2003 after installing windows 7 64 bit</h2>
                    I tried to import my dbx file after getting a full version of window 7 64 bit on Friday and it will not import and neither will my address book wab which I saved on my second hard drive before the full version of windows 7 was installed.

            Indeed, Windows 7 no longer contains the email client necessary to import the .DBX files, then export the contents to Outlook.&nbsp; You can<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-mail?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp; download and install Windows Live Mail</a> to do this.&nbsp;
 Once imported, you can then export to Outlook 2003.

<h2>            Remote lock &#38;amp&#59; Memory card corrupted issue</h2>
                    

<p>Remote lock &amp; Memory card corrupted issue</p>
<p>Hi Dear Friends,</p>
<p>You might have experienced the "Memory card corrupted issue."</p>
<p>Don't panic! The solution is here!</p>
<p>Your memory card is just 'locked', it isn't 'corrupted'!</p>
<p>For sure, this post would be of great help to you, if:</p>
<p>• You have enabled the "Remote lock" feature of your Nokia device.</p>
<p>• You have sent the remote lock message to your device and locked it remotely.</p>
<p>Finding the solution really took me a lot of time. I was inspired by various posts on the Discussion, and decided to find the official notes on the issue. So would like to thank those who shared their tips, and helped us solve this problem.</p>
<p>I'm using E66, (you might use something else), and would refer to E51's and E65's User guide so often.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not going to explain the instructions, and recommend you to refer to your user guides when needed.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I'm going to explain what may not be mentioned in your user guides.</p>
<p>Let’s Begin</p>
<p>What Has Happened:</p>
<p>In short, you attempted to test the feature, your phone was locked, you keyed in the lock code, code was accepted, you used the phone for a while, switched it off, powered it on, you were prompted the Lock code, you keyed in the lock code, code was accepted,
 you attempted to view some stuff that was on your memory card, you didn't find it, you tried to run a program that was installed on your memory card, the program icon didn't open, you put the memory card in the card reader and connected it to PC, it was not
 detected, you went to Menu&gt; Tools&gt; Memory card&gt; You saw "Memory card corrupted"!</p>
<p>Don't, don't select the Yes selection key if you got the caution message, "Memory Card corrupted, reformat it?" because your memory card isn't corrupted, it's simply being locked!</p>
<p>But you can't find the unlock memory card command in Menu&gt; Tools&gt; Memory card&gt; Options.</p>
<p>So? What to DO?</p>
<p>1. (This step is optional) Disable the Remote lock feature.</p>
<p>(Refer to your user guides) and change Allow Remote Lock&gt; to no.</p>
<p>Then, while the unit is on,</p>
<p>2. Press the power key briefly, and select Remove memory card.</p>
<p>3. Remove the memory card from the slot.</p>
<p>4. Press OK if prompted.</p>
<p>5. Reinsert the memory card in the slot.</p>
<p>6. Reopen Menu&gt; Tools&gt; Memory card.</p>
<p>Is your memory card detected? If yes!</p>
<p>7. Follow tips number 2 &amp; 3 of What to Know section below.</p>
<p>Did you get "Password removed" message?</p>
<p>If no, be careful of the case of the first character.</p>
<p>If you had changed the Remote lock message many times, use the one that was practically sent to the device via text message.</p>
<p>. In case you had set a password on your memory card before, you may also attempt to unlock the locked memory using your own password, not the first eight characters of the remote lock message.</p>
<p>Step seven would make the memory card detectable to the connected card reader to the PC too.</p>
<p>8. The memory card is detected temporarily, but it is locked and the "memory card corrupted" issue reappears every time you switch off/on the phone, unless you successfully complete step seven.</p>
<p>What to Know?</p>
<p>Official User guide Tips:</p>
<p>1. Remote locking also locks your memory card. (E51 page100)</p>
<p>. Yes, the one mobile phone that sends your device the predefined remote locking message, receives the confirmation message in response, indicating, "Mobile telephone and memory card are locked". But it isn't written in E66's and E65's.</p>
<p>2. To unlock the memory card, select Menu&gt; Tools&gt; Memory&gt; Options&gt; Remove password, and "enter the remote locking message as the password". (E51 page100)</p>
<p>. Yes, quite clear, but the quoted part ("enter the remote locking message as the password") isn't written on my E66's User guide, and there's a vague precaution on E65's, (refer to number 4).</p>
<p>3. If the message is longer than 8 characters, the first 8 characters are used as the memory card password. (E51 page100)</p>
<p>. Yes, quite clear good E51, but I don't own you; I have E66 your little sister. I owe my memory card's survival to nice users on the Discussion.</p>
<p>4. The maximum number of characters allowed is 8. Using more than 8 characters could prevent unlocking the memory card and require reformatting it. If reformatting the memory card is required, all information on the card will be lost. (E65 page28)</p>
<p>. Quite interesting, but it contradicts what good E51 says in number three¡!</p>
<p>. And it contradicts my own experience of the issue (and some other users' on the Discussion) too, since my E66's memory card accepted the 'first eight characters' of the 'ten-character long’ remote lock message that I had previously used to remote lock
 it.</p>
<p>. The first three tips are quite important and shouldn't have been excluded from E66's and E65's user guides. I don't have the time to download and review all the user guides that support this feature, but at least I read some user manuals and also got the
 impression (from the posts on the discussion) that there had been not enough information on E66's, E65's, E71's, N96's, and some others.</p>
<p>You may like to do a simple search on Google:</p>
<p>"The first 8 characters are used as the memory card password" site:nokia.com</p>
<p>Since the content of the user guides on the server seem not be searchable for any reason, you won't find any official support result except those of the good users on the Discussions. And the 'Nokia Site Search" brings no result too. (At least on the date
 of this post).</p>
<p>¡ Terribly sorry for those who have selected Yes to the Reformat caution message. It wasn't your fault. But there's an idiom that says, sleep on it! "Think about it for a while before coming up with a decision".</p>
<p>But now that you have tested the feature and know its solution, don't be afraid, and enable the Remote lock feature again! God forbid, but it may be needed one day!</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Warm thanks to you soh7, your post helped me a lot. I gave up hope to get my memory card as intact. I was going to format it. But I thought there must be a way for solving this critical problem. The next day I search a lot in the internet and luckily I got
 your so helpful post "Remote lock &amp; Memory card corrupted issue" and I followed your instructions and able to recover my memory card. I feel happy now. I have no words to thank you. Keep on this great work. And again many many thanks to you.</p>

            Dear, I guess, / This article doesn't suit your case. / • You have not enabled the "Remote lock" feature of your Nokia device. / • You have not locked your device remotely. / Because you don't know where the remote lock is and haven't played with its settings.
 / You need to explain what has happened. / The only thing we get is that your memory card doesn't open. / 1. your phone model, e.g., 5130. / 2. What did you do recently that might have caused this issue? / 3. What methods did you try to unlock it? / Use some
 of the tips provided above. (except number 1). / Yours

<h2>            Cannot Change Password for any email account in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Under Outlook 2016 , If I select "Change" after selecting&nbsp; any email account ( IMAP or POP ) under Settings&gt;Email&nbsp; there is no option provided to change the password setting. I used to be able to do this. It now shows one screen where attributes like "Your

and "Account Name " etc can be set , a "Reset Mail Setting" option, and a "Next" button. When I choose "Next", it displays a screen with a message of "...Successfully Updated"</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Make sure you follow this article.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-or-update-your-email-password-58b62e89-6a9b-467b-8865-d5633fcacc3f#bkmk_outlookpwd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still cannot do it, i would suggest to check Office updates.
<br />
<br />An office repair as a last resource is not a bad idea.

<br />Two ways to get to the same place of the old settings UI

</p><p>You wait, they will bring back the feature later on, probably label it as a new feature too!

<h2>            How do I reverse to Windows 10 from Insider Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I tried Reset this PC option, but it still left my computer on an insider preview. I updated my laptop online from Windows 7 to Windows 10 PRO ages ago, so I don't have any Windows 10 installation files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Thank you, that really helped, but now I reversed to the completely first Windows that had trouble coming out of sleep (every time I put it into sleep I cannot wake my laptop up) and every time I restart the computer the numeric keyboard is off. I remember
 that this kept happening when I first got the Windows 10 Pro, but then there was some birthday edition or something that fixed these problems (I don't really mind the numeric keyboard, but I use the sleep option daily) but I can't seem to figure out what it
 is, windows update says this is the current edition...

<p>Fast Start in Control Panel can cause the Num Pad to be off when you Boot so you can try turning it off to see if it helps.</p>
<p>On my System I have to turn it off every time we get a new Build because of the way it effects my Dual Boot and also it made my Num Pad turn off at Boot time and made signing in an extra key press when using a Pin Number.</p>

<p>Hi Veronica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not uncommon for bugs to make a recurrence. It has to do with all sorts of technical reasons. It's probably best posted in the Feedback Hub. Expect it to be fixed before too long. As a workaround, you might try turning off 'Fast Startup' and see if
 Sleep works then. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Fast startup</strong> setting is under <strong>Control Panel-&gt;Hardware and Sound-&gt;Power options.-&gt;What Power Buttons do</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            You are amazing, thank you very much, I unchecked it and tried to put my laptop back to sleep and it worked, I wish I asked earlier, would have saved me countless headaches. Finally everything is working as it's supposed to. Really thank you :) Hope you

<h2>            Audio problem with Skype</h2>
                    When I start to speak on Skype, the other party hears the first few words of the sentence then they hear nothing...and then it comes back on again. I have ckecked the microphone works through the skype call service and all appears/sound well. What could
 be the problem? Neb=ver had any problems before Microsoft took over Skype.

            Hi Digby
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience you are experiencing. 
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype.
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.36.0.52.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved. 
<br />
<br />If the above does not work...
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

    <title>N8 and some kind of debug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superg---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 and some kind of debug</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i was trying to reboot my phone because it was not responding. After using some times the lock/unlock button at the phone side i tried to keep hold the upper button for some seconds, the phone has done some vibration and nothing it seemed to be happened.
 When i rebooted the phone i seen some new blu number in the upper right corner of the phone. I think to have activated some kind of debug and now i'm not able to disable it, how can i remove these numbers from the display? In the attachment a picture where
 is possible to see these blu numbers, i've made a red circle around them.</p>

    <title>Power maps limit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashley perry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power maps limit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've imported a dataset of 29 million rows and 3 columns (lat, long, date) through Power Pivot. 3D power maps picks up the columns but when I try to generate the map I get an error "3D maps encountered an error and could not complete the last action".<br />
<br />
I don't get this error on smaller data sets of approximately 300,000 rows. Is there a limit to the amount of rows 3D maps can plot?</p>

<p>Hi Ashley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using 3D Maps, we can map data and plot more than a million rows of data visually on Bing maps in 3-D format from an Excel table or Data Model in Excel.<br />
<br />
The error "3D maps encountered an error and could not complete the last action" is caused by the immense amount of data you were trying to generate the map from.<br />
<br />
To answer your question if there is a limit to the amount of rows 3D maps can plot, we suggest posting it to our
 for users to send us suggestions, ideas, questions and feedback on how to improve.<br />
<br />
If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

<h2>            Ovi Store Lost Transaction and no way to contact customer support</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an app this morning from Ovi Store. Although money was deducted from my phone and a confiirmation Sms with a transaction ID was received, the downloadi tself&nbsp; never started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transaction does not show up in my purchase history, and the app is not available under my apps for reloading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried to contact customer support for OVI Store. But every time I try to use the web-based contact formula, it resets itself, wihout sending any message - I've tried this from Linux and Windows, using Firefox and IE. After failing a message is displayed
 advising me to contact customer support at</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; support_english@nokia,.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However this email address is no longer valid. So now I'm completely stuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone from Ovi or Nokia help?</p>

<p>For the past few days I've tried to check these support discussion, but have constantly received errors, "this page is redirecting in a way which will never complete". Only today could I get back to this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "purchasing" experience with Ovi Store is really abysmal. The transaction was charged nearly instantaneously from my phone, and I have received nothing in return other than aggravation.</p>

    <title>Pinned Documents in Word, Excel and Access disappear - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pinned Documents in Word, Excel and Access disappear</h2>
                    
<p>I have a user who has an intermittent issue with pinned documents disappearing from the open recent&nbsp;documents window in Word, Excel and Access.&nbsp; These are the main programs this user uses.&nbsp; They will stay for a few days and then disappear from the pinned
 list. When the items disappear the user states there is no reasoning to the list and that the documents shown on there are hers but she hasn't worked on in some time.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>how to copy and paste after finding a word in excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to copy and paste after finding a word in excel</h2>
                    <p>hey there everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one excel document that has ~100K rows, and goes until AD. I need to search the document for rows containing a certain word, and then copy and paste that entire row into a new document. Is there any way to do this all at once, instead of going one
 by one and manually highlighting the whole row?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks a lot!</p>

            <p>If the words you are looking for are all sitting on the same column, what Gord suggested should be effective.</p>
<p>However, if the words you are looking for spread across different columns... then&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following <strong>on a copy</strong> of your file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming there is no hidden rows in your worksheet, and suppose you are searching for "ABC"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ctrl F to open Find dialogue Box</p>
<ol>
<li>Find what: ABC</li><li>Find All</li><li>Select any one result found in the lower part of the Find dialogue box</li><li>Press Select A</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now all the cells containing ABC should be selected.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Home tab --&gt; Cell Group --&gt; Format --&gt; Hide Rows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Now all the rows with cells containing "ABC" are hidden.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the visible range, say A1: AD100000 (Press Ctrl+* to select the range)</li><li>Press Alt+; to select visible cells</li><li>Press Ctrl+- to delete cells selected. &nbsp;(either shift cells up or left; base on your needs)</li><li>Unhide all the hidden rows</li></ol>
<p>What is left should be what you need.<br />

    <title>&#34;live&#34; URL links in Mac Word 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tlh&#35;5  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;live&#34; URL links in Mac Word 2011</h2>
                    <p>PubMed URLs to MS Word:<br />
<br />
If I put a PubMed article URL or the BioSketch bibliography URL into Word on a Macintosh, Word 2011, I cannot open it and get this message:<br />
"Unable to open https://...(the&nbsp; URL). Cannot locate the Internet server or proxy server. MS Word"<br />
<br />
so, eg: here is a link to an article citation in pubmed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?cmd=historysearch&amp;querykey=2<br />
Copy and pasting into Word and I can’t click on it.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on why? This is happening to a lot of researchers with BioSketches – the links won’t open. It also affects all journal clubs posting links to the articles in PubMed.</p>

            <p>Hi TLH#5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't clear whether you have solved your problem by providing a URL that does exist, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do that, I see exactly the same problem in Word 2011. Here, Word 2011 cannot even open the link&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</a>&nbsp;to let you enter your query manually,
 nor even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</a>&nbsp;. That's because (as I understand it) when Word 2011 tries to access those URLs, the website sends responses that Word 2011 does not process correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</a>&nbsp;or
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=neem+oil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=neem+oil</a>&nbsp;from your copy of Word 2011, but cannot use
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?cmd=historysearch&amp;querykey=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?cmd=historysearch&amp;querykey=2</a>&nbsp;, I would guess it is for the reason I suggested, i.e. that Word creates a new session which has no search history, so the website cannot find that URL. But if you can construct the search
 URL you need, and that works in Word 2011 for you, that's fine.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?cmd=historysearch&amp;querykey=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Word 2016 seems to much better at this. It's pretty evident that Microsoft was never going to fix Word 2011.</p>
