            <p>The first issue to address is that your installation of Office 2011 is more than 4 years behind on updates. Version 14.1.4 was published in December of 2011... The current version is 14.5.9, which is an absolute necessity since you've opted to upgrade to
 an operating system 5 generations newer than the one for which that version of Office was designed. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that you aren't running into other performance issues, as well :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Help&gt; Check for Updates in the main menu of any of the Office 2011 programs. You should need only the most recent [14.5.9] in order to catch up, but you also may need the update to the Microsoft AutoUpdate [MAU2.0} app, itself. If so, accept that as
 well. Restart your Mac after updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have a problem there may be font issues to be resolved. Reply here if the updates don't do the job.</p>

<h2>            How to reset printer margins</h2>
                    After spending what seems like hours creating a postcard using a template from MS Works Task Launcher, I am told that some of the picture is outside the printer margins.&nbsp; Even when the entire picture is inside the template margins.&nbsp; There is always some
 part of the pic that doesn't get printed.&nbsp; When I try to fix it the end result is a lop-sided product and wasted space.&nbsp; How do I fix this?

    <title>Is McAfee fundamentally incompatible with Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurencegalian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is McAfee fundamentally incompatible with Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had a history of problems with Skype since I bought an HP&nbsp;Pavilion 20-c005la new computer about 10 months ago. I made one Skype audio call about six months ago from the Americas to Europe, and the sound quality was excellent. However, the next day
 and ever since, the sound has been completely unintelligible on both ends, extremely distorted, and full of static.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling various friends and repeatedly called&nbsp;<span>Skype "Echo / Sound Test Service", but the sound quality remained awful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10. I have the latest version of Skype and my computer has more than sufficient memory, speed, and specifications to run Skype properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone on this forum suggested I run&nbsp;<span>dxdiag.exe and post the results. After this person viewed the results, he said that McAfee was habitually crashing, and he told me to remove all traces of McAfee from my computer.
 He also told me to remove all effects from my recording and playback, which I did.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I contacted McAfee and told them that McAfee was routinely crashing and possibly interfering with Skype. The technician took control of my computer. He immediately turned off the Firewall and asked me to open Skype
 and make a Skype "Echo / Sound Test Service" call. The Skype test call was very good on both ends (not perfect) but I thought the technician resolved the problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, he then asked me to close Skype, he enabled the Firewall, and asked me to make a 2nd test call. I made the call and the sound quality was again very good. The technician
 was very rude and impolite and demanded I show him proof of McAfee crashing. I showed him the text files I saved after running&nbsp;</span><span>dxdiag.exe. He completely ignored the files and just kept repeating that McAfee was
 not crashing.</span></p>
<p><span>Before writing this question to the community, I made another Skype test call. The sound quality was adequate.</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, my question to the community is:&nbsp;</span>Is McAfee fundamentally incompatible with Skype? Could disabling my Firewall fix my problems with Skype? I have an extremely
 important business call I need to make using Skype, and if Skype does not function correctly this could adversely impact my career. Therefore, I want to be 100% certain that my call is going to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If McAfee is a big problem for Skype, please can you recommend an antivirus software program that does not interfere with Skype calls?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>Thank you kindly, but this has not worked. I updated the audio drivers directly from the device manufacturer's website. I made
<em>one </em>successful Skype test call, but after that, all the rest were absolutely unintelligible. Why is Skype behaving so strangely?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Do you think I should lower my Firewall?</li><li>Could the problem be with the specific version of Windows 10?</li><li>Could the problem be with the Mother Board or other hardware in my HP desktop Pavilion computer?</li></ol>
<p>I really need to know if I need to download Windows 10 again, or even replace the whole computer before my warranty runs out in 2 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I cannot stress this strongly enough: my ability to support my family rests firmly on my ability to Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            how do you do relative referencing for a cell from previous work sheet on a new one&#63;</h2>
                    how do you do relative referencing for a cell from previous work sheet on to a new one?&nbsp;So that when you copy the information from one work sheet onto another, it automatically references it to the information in the cell from previous worksheet? I am
 working on an excel file where I have a different work sheets with the title of different campaigns. Each campaign has information regarding sales revenue and costs and so on. Then I have a cell where I calculate progressive revenue, this cell is a sum of
 the revenue from the current campaign, and the previous (up-to-date) revenue from all previous campaigns. This up-to-date revenue is in a cell on previous worksheet. Right now I calculate this sum of progressive revenue by simply summing the revenue on the
 current campaign and by manually entering the revenue of previous up-to-date&nbsp;campaigns. I hope this makes sense. I just want to know if there is a formula that will do relative referencing of a cell from previous worksheet (pr

            <p>This UDF can help with that. <br />
</p>
<p>Copy/paste this UDF to a general module in your workbook. <br />
</p>
<p>Function <b>PrevSheet</b>(rg As Range)
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; n = Application.Caller.Parent.Index <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If n = 1 Then <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>PrevSheet</b> = CVErr(xlErrRef)
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ElseIf TypeName(Sheets(n - 1)) = "Chart" Then <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>PrevSheet</b> = CVErr(xlErrNA)
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Else <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>PrevSheet</b> = Sheets(n - 1).Range(rg.Address).Value
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If <br />
End Function <br />
</p>
<p>Example of usage................... <br />
</p>
<p>Say you have 31 sheets, &nbsp;sheet1 through shee31...........sheet names don't <br />
matter. <br />
</p>
<p>In sheet1 you have a formula in A10 &nbsp;=SUM(A1:A9) <br />
</p>
<p>Select second sheet and SHIFT + Click last sheet <br />
</p>
<p>In active sheet A10 enter =SUM(<b>PrevSheet</b>(A10),A1:A9)
<br />
</p>
<p>Ungroup the sheets. <br />
</p>
<p>Each A10 will have the sum of the previous sheet's A10 plus the sum of the <br />
current sheet's A1:A9 <br />

    <title>Sporadically not printing certain parts of sentences throughout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackrhino6c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sporadically not printing certain parts of sentences throughout document...</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason when i try to print out any letter that i write it sporadically takes out parts of sentences randomly throughout the document. These are documents that i have printed before so i don't understand why it all of a sudden started doing this.</p>
<p>I have resumes that it prints find and biographies and other types of documents but the minute i try to type out a new letter or open a old saved one it will not print it properly.</p>
<p>The following is what was typed:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I Eva R Bonner <strong>am submitting my letter of resignation to SL Start. My husband is employed now and</strong>I will be needed at home. After Friday February 25th I will no longer be able to provide availability for SL Start. Thank you for your employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Eva R Bonner</p>
<p>When it prints, it leaves out the bold letter( they are not bold when i type it, i only made them bold to show you what it wasn't printing)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<p>&lt;!-- [if gte mso 10]&gt; &lt;mce:style&gt; </p>
<p>Dear DMV Vehicle Registration,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>My husband is a Marine and is stationed at Camp Pendleton California. We purchased our</strong>Mazda CX9 January xx, 2010. The Mazda CX9<strong> is titled, insured, and registered in Idaho. The only reason</strong>our
 Mazda C9 is registered in <strong>California was because we were told by the dealership that according to California Law a used car needed to be registered before it can be taken off the lot.</strong>We received notice
<strong>that our California registration would be suspended if we did not show proof of</strong> insurance. We called the<strong>DMV in California and they told us everything would be fine if we sent this copy of our Idaho registration. The California license
 plate number for our Mazda CX9 is<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">6Axxxx6</span>
</strong>. Our contact numbers are 208-659-xxxx or 208-691-xxxx.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Eva Bonner</p>
<p>The bold is what it does not print out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first document is one that i just typed out this morning. the second document was adocument we had previously saved and had printed out a while back and in order to test what was going on i printed it out too, only to find out it was screwing up that
 document as well.</p>
<p>whenever i print out a different document that is not in a "letter" type format it prints fine. but the minute i have an "Dear So and So" type letter it does this. i cannot figure out what is going on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<p>Hi Celia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to find the Zoom under Format Text tab. If you still cannot find it, you can try to search it. For your reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you still cannot find the zoom, could you please provide followings?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nerradsemloh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, we think your requirement is to cancel the Office 365 subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If so and your Office 365 trial subscription has not yet expired, you may try the steps below to cancel the subscription:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to your Office 365 Admin center.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Billing</strong>&gt;<strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>More actions </strong>and choose <strong>Cancel subscription</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 21pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c9902e-9650-4ef2-8d10-3e734b401273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c9902e-9650-4ef2-8d10-3e734b401273" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If above is not your scenario, could you specify your requirement?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note, the expired state lasts for 30 days for most subscriptions and users have normal access the Office 365 portal, Office applications and services in this state.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some articles for your references:</span></p>

    <title>Change image&#47;picture size with macro in Ppt 2007. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrie m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change image&#47;picture size with macro in Ppt 2007.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to change the size of .jpg/.png pictures that are being automatically inserted into my presentations.&nbsp; The images are of various starting sizes and I would like to set the Height to a prescribed measurement and let the width adjust to scale.&nbsp;
 So far I've run into trouble using the VBA Help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this syntax I'm not getting a proportionate change:</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3).Height = 100</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this syntax I'm getting a compile error about expecting an "=", though I haven't found any examples that include one:</p>
<p>ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(3).ScaleHeight (100,msoTrue,msoScaleFromMiddle)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like this idea of "scale from middle" since that sounds like by picture would still look more centered on the page.&nbsp; However, I don't know how to get past the error message.&nbsp; And, I don't know how to make the height a precise measurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also looked at commands such as Adjustments and PictureFormat incase I'm just not getting into the correct menu.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp;
</p>

You need to post the code used to insert the pics because this is probably where your problem really&nbsp; lies.<br />

If you use scalewidth you need to remove the brackets ( )<br />

on our site here</a><br />
<br />
If the macro doesn't bring in the image what does " that are being automatically inserted into my presentations. " mean?<br />
<br />
also 100 isn't&nbsp; a likely setting for scale height , 1 is = 100%<br />
<br />
opic.ScaleHeight 1,True<br />
opic.ScaleWidth 1,True<br />
&nbsp;is original size<br />

            PowerPoint doesn't use inches internally, only points.
<div><br />
<div>72 points to the inch, so it just takes a bit of math.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or a function:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Function Points(sngInches as Single) as Single</div>
<div>&nbsp; Points = sngInches * 72</div>
<div>End Function</div>
<div><br />
<div>usage:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Shape.Height = Points(10) &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now as to maintaining proportions, you can either do the calculations yourself based on the proportions of the thing originally or you can let PPT do the work for you. &nbsp;If you set .LockAspectRatio to true, PPT will keep the shape proportional as you change
 either height or width.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Dim lLockAspect As Long</div>
<div>With oSh</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ' save its current Lock Aspect Ratio setting</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; lLockAspect = .LockAspectRatio</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ' but not both</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; .Height = 144</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; ' and reset lock aspect</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been playing around with the above but still don't find the right soluition. My intention would be to define a macro that quickly set a picture to its right shape. Either I must enter a width or a hight, the lock ratio should be adjust, further I want
 to set left and top in cm. this is what I already found but neither the lockratio or the cm2points seems to work.&nbsp; Can anybody help me with this please ?</p>

            Did you include the function cm2points??<br />
<br />
Also you should remove the opic (probably) and the .ScaleHeight line is probably redundant<br />
<br />
Try:<br />
<br />
Sub Size()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Left = cm2Points(3)<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Width = cm2Points(5)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Function cm2Points(inVal As Single) As Single<br />
cm2Points = inVal * 28.346<br />
End Function<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This maybe due to a software, hardware component or network operator concern. First, check the signal strength on the phone screen, and try moving to an area to get better reception. If you continuously experience low signal strength in a certain area, the
 mobile network coverage may be insufficient there. If not, try removing any accessory covers from the phone temporarily to see if those affect the signal strength and make sure that your SIM card is fully inserted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, try your SIM card in another phone and/or try another SIM card on your phone to verity if you experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you may also download the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/b2x-smartapp/9nblggh43np6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">B2X-SMARTAPP</a></strong> from the Store to check the software and hardware of your Lumia 640.</p>

            Thanks for your reply, I have low signal no matter where I am and I did remove the phone cover as well. It has been so frustrating because it's all of a sudden, never an issue before. Maybe I will download the app you suggested and I should call my carrier
 AT&amp;T. My phone hasn't been the same since I upgraded to Windows 10 a few months ago. I'll keep you posted.

            I downloaded the app and ran a diagnostic check on network, it was not able to do 6or7 of the tests because a " mobile data connection could not be established". So it couldn't tell me anything on my network signal and other things. Now I do not have a
 data package on my phone, I use my home wifi or connect to a wifi hotspot if needed. Is that why a data connection couldn't be established? I don't know. Is there an antenna or something diy I could do to get a better signal? I'm very close to a cell tower...lol.
 I'm desperate.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the update. Trying your SIM to another phone or using another SIM card on your phone can help us isolate your concern. Since you're very close to a cell tower, this can also be the reason why you're getting a poor signal. We also request that
 you contact your service provider to check if there's any outage or service maintenance in your area.</p>

            I did contact AT&amp;T and they refreshed my SIM and reset my network connection. That didn't really do anything but I did appreciate the effort, their customer service is great. I don't think I'll be using this phone for long. I have been unhappy with this
 Windows phone and have started looking around. I will stay close to the window when making calls for now. I appreciate your help and thank you.

<h2>            How do I get Word 2003 and Office 2010 to coexist&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For a lawyer, Word 2007 and following are all but unuseable, and Windows 8.1 is totally and unconditionally unuseable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally gave up on Windows 8.1, and relegated the Windows 8.1 laptop to use as a doorstop.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I bought a Windows XP desktop.&nbsp; Word
 2003 is not working reliably, and I think the problem is the presence of Word 2010 on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From 2009 to early 2014, on Windows XP, I had Word 2003 co-installed with Office 2007.&nbsp; So I know that works.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am puzzling over Word 2010 plus 2003.</p>

</p><p>Here's my configuration.&nbsp; A Dell Optiplex 745 with Windows XP, Office 2010, both installed by the OEM, and Word 2003 installed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Office 2010 is installed in the default folder, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * I installed Word 2003 into a separate folder, C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office2003</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost everything works, but there are occasional weird failures.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the weird failures is that when I edit a file using Word 2010, when it's time to save, Word 201 thinks the file is locked, so I have to "Save As" a new file name (I have five and
 eight versions for a single day).&nbsp; Lots of other little weirdnesses.</p>
<p>
Quesiton 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am assuming that there's a registry key collision between Word 2003 and Word 2010?&nbsp; Is there a way to find all registry keys associated with Word 2003 and with Word 2010, and run down any collisions?
</p><p>
</p><p>Question 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this plan sound feasible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * Uninstall Office 2010 and Word 2003</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * reinstall Office 2010, less Word 2010</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * install Word 2003</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; * create one user account, and install Word 2010 for only that account (some utility applications need a newer version of Word in order to run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>You can get Word 2010 and 2003 to co-exist, but you need to ensure that they don't share resources that don't need to be shared and they handle those that must be shared peacefully. See
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</a>&nbsp; which covers all the required settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is usually recommended to install 2003 first, and then do a custom installation of 2010, though you may get away with fixing what you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only have one version of Outlook installed, and that should be 2010, as it is far better than the 2003 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot agree with your premise that 2007 or 2010 are unsuited to the legal profession. I have a number of clients in the legal profession who use both of them, without problem.</p>

<p>Steve, software is normally backwards compatible; that means 2010 should run 2007 files.</p>
<p>Any software house will tell you that the new version will behave the same as the old one (plus any known differences of which they should be aware and make you aware).</p>
<p>However, as with any software, the user should always test, thoroughly, before implementing it, that what the software house claim, can be verified independently.</p>
<p>User testing is an essential and vital part of the implementation process.</p>
<p>If you are to be happy that what MS claim is correct then test it; without doing that you can never be sure that their claims are true.</p>
<p>Ask yourself a question: have I tested what MS claim is true?</p>
<p>If my comments have helped please Vote As Helpful.</p>

<p>Hello trip_to-tokyo</p>
<p>What you are suguesting is that I need to obtain "Word 2010" in order to do as you suguest, What I'm hoping for is that taking in mind what you have said, I need someone that already has "word 2010" and have they experieced any known issues.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking timeout.</p>

            Steve, the only other thought that I had was that because somebody's else's macros work on the later version doesn't necessarily mean that yours will; the only way that you can be certain that yours will run correctly (on the later version) is by running
 through the upgrade process and then making sure that they run in the way that you want them to.

            Yes, I downloaded the latest version and that's what's causing the continued warnings. &nbsp;I'll try to touch base with the folks at Avast next week and see what I can find out. &nbsp;If I learn anything worthwhile, I'll post it here.

            <p>Just some suggestions and a probable solution to this problem ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Avast Premier 2015 and noticed the&nbsp;Avast Antivirus program kept giving malware alerts</p>
<p>just about&nbsp; every time I executed either Windows Update or&nbsp;tried to install the&nbsp;latest Build ( 9879 ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To overcome these problems just temporarily disable the Avast Antivirus program for a brief time to allow the update to install and then Avast will allow the Updates to be installed without the Installation Failed message and/or Malware warning messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This step will also help insure the New Builds will be updated without Avast Antivirus blocking the</p>
<p>Installation or&nbsp;the Windows Update&nbsp;files.</p>

            <p>Connect both Outlook 2010 and your Android device to the same mailbox and you should see the same messages arrive in the Inbox. Since you say you use a POP account for Outlook 2010, make sure you configure the account to leave messages on the server so that
 the Android device can see them. That setting is on the Advanced tab of the account properties for POP accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your mail provider offers IMAP, changing to IMAP in Outlook 2010 will allow both devices to see the complete folder set and the data in those folders, including sent items and allow changes on one to be reflected on the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that neither IMAP nor POP can handle anything by mail messages. No contacts or calendar events. If you want hose to sync, you need to use a mail service that allows either Exchange or Exchange ActiveSync.</p>

                    Hello. &nbsp;I am having problems launching Power Map on my desktop. (Not RDP)&nbsp;
<div>As soon as I press on the Insert Map button, I get the following MsgBox:</div>

<div>GeoFlow can collect information about the error and create an email which you will be able to &nbsp;send to Microsoft and help us fix this problem. Do you want do this?</div>

<div>Yes &nbsp; No &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>---------------------------</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Followed by Excel crashing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then it creates an email for me with the following information:</div>

    <title>How can I delete my Skype account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kurtstolle  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I delete my Skype account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently started a subscription to Office365 Business. I want to keep using this account for my freelance writing service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an old Skype account. This account uses a rather silly username because it was set up for personal use. I want to delete this old Skype account so I can then start a new Skype account with a more professional username for business use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found this link which looks like it's Microsoft's method for closing accounts: https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx. However, from what I've read on these community forums, if I delete my Microsoft account it will terminate both my Skype and
 Office365 services—which I don't want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the options in my Skype account page and I cannot find any way to delete the account. Can someone please help me with this? Or provide me with a link to contact Microsoft's Skype support team, an important piece of info that seemingly does
 not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. - Kurt</p>

<h2>            transfering of onenote book ownership</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a onenote book that I no longer need but I shared it with someone. I would like them to take over ownership and for me to be able to close that notebook on my profile. This is a VERY important notebook so I do not want her to lose any data by me
 giving up ownership. The instructions I found online did not help. </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The option to transfer the ownership of a notebook is currently not available. However, there's a workaround that we can do to prevent losing the notebook you've shared. Since the notebook has been shared, it's automatically saved to your
<strong>OneDrive</strong>. That being said, we advise not deleting the file from your
<strong>OneDrive </strong>and just close it from your <strong>OneNote 2013</strong>. From there, you'll no longer have a visibility on the shared notebook when you use your
<strong>OneNote 2013</strong>. Just an added information, if you will delete the said notebook from your
<strong>OneDrive</strong>, that's the time they'll no longer have access to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the workaround doesn't work for you, we highly suggest that you post this concern to our
<strong><a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote UserVoice</a></strong>, and suggest to have a feature that can transfer ownership. Actually, this is a good suggestion since it'll help other users who have the same concern.
 We appreciate any suggestions or feedback since it will help us improve our products and services. In addition, if some users have already posted the same concern, you can also
<strong>upvote </strong>those posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. In case you need further assistance, don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>One possible procedure if the sharer has write access and OneNote 2016:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sharer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Export the notebook (open in OneNote 2016) as Package</li><li>Close the notebook</li><li>Open the Package (double click in explorer)</li><li>Is new owner now (of a local notebook)</li><li>If wanted: Share the notebook to&nbsp;his own OneDrive </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You after the sharer took ownership:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close the notebook</li><li>Delete it on OneDrive</li></ol>

<p>Hello, </p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I will do your suggestion. I also just want to make sure that she will still have full editing privileges and this won't affect her syncing or any other features???</p>
<p>I will definitely voice my opinion on OneNote User voice. Being able to transfer ownership is very valuable for us. We work in a school and we have turn over in secretaries and academic advisors and using onenote was amazing to keep up with turn over but
 we would like to transfer&nbsp;ownership when need be. Thanks again for your time! </p>

            FYI: I took your suggestion and I saw someone already suggested it and it has 50 votes already! Maybe one day soon it will be a feature!

<p>Doing the workaround will not remove her from being able to edit the file as well as no effect when she wants to sync it. Just don't delete it from
<strong>OneDrive </strong>to avoid losing the file.</p>
