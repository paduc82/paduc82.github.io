<h2>            Column height&#47;width</h2>
                    <p>I am taking an excel class. The homework asks me to make the cell 19.80. However, my excel doesn't give me that option. I have 19.71 or 19.86 as an option. Even if I manually type in the measurement, it will change to either 19.71 or 19.86. I'm sure this
 is something in the settings. I've already went into settings and changed the measurement from default to millimeters and centimeters. With no luck. I also messed around with my screen settings and didn't see a change when I changed my pixel resolution. Can
 anyone lead me to the correct place to change these measurements? I don't want to get an F on my assignment because I can't get the measurements they ask for!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA! </p>

            <p>Row height - in points - depends on your screen resolution. Excel can only set row heights in terms of full pixels, and how many points a pixel is depends on your screen settings and physical specifications of the actual monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you should be able to successfully argue that your monitor did not support a row height of 19.80 points, and that the experts in the user forums explained why you could not get that row height. &nbsp;Your instructor should know that row height can only be
 specified in full pixels - if he doesn't, point him to this post.</p>

            I do not think that the printer is the problem because the file is causing the same problem on two different computers, one using version 2010, the other using 2013. When you suggest changing the graphics, do you mean the size or format used. Most graphics
 are jpg, some png. Some of the pages have been compiled on version 2013, others with 2010. Could this be causing the problem? Some of the graphics have also been taken with permission from other websites. So my question is, should we remove all graphics and
 convert them to the same file type? Most of the graphics have been taken with our ipad, could the apple, PC compatibility be an issue as well?
<div><br />
<div>We are so grateful for your help with this matter, it has been driving us crazy. Thanks for your time.</div>

            I did as you suggested and removed all graphics, problem still exists even with just the template pages and no graphics. Could it be the 2010 - 2013 different page designs being added together in the one document? There is two of us working on this project,
 we are using different versions.<br />
I have even re-compiled the newsletter from scratch, problem begins after about 10 pages.
<br />
Cannot understand why this problem has occurred because our first 2 newsletters were compiled in exactly the same way, same number of pages (30), same graphic file formats, same template pages. I can still open and edit them without a problem. Please help,
 we are on a deadline!!!!<br />

            <p>OK... I dug through all these answers and none of them helped in the slightest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the fix, or at least a fix that noticeably reduces the time spent in (Not Responding).</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISABLE THE PAGE NAVIGATION PANE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do NOT simply collapse it, or the pages inside it. &nbsp;That will not help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISABLE THE PAGE NAVIGATION PANE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't solve it completely but it will cut the clocking time significantly.</p>

<h2>            Downloading flash for the firefox browser</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to view pages that require flash and firefox is directing me to the adobe site to download the right file.</p>
<p>There are three choices.</p>
<p>YUM for Linux</p>
<p>.tar.gzfor Linux</p>
<p>.rpm for Linux</p>
<p>I have downloaded all three but when I go to file manager/n900/documents to retrieve the file it gives me three more options to install.</p>
<p>app manager</p>
<p>as_demon</p>
<p>backup.</p>
<p>I choose app manager, click 'agree' to terms and conditions and it tells me every time it's unable to install because installation file is corrupted.</p>
<p>This happens with all the linux choices.</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong and how I get flash for firefox?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It isn't officially supported.. and you certainly can't download it from adobe.. From the release notes for mobile firefox:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Firefox on my phone support plugins? Support for plugins in Firefox for Maemo has been disabled. On most Web pages that use the Adobe Flash plugin, the performance of the plugin didn't meet our standards, and the interactivity and performance of the
 entire Web page was negatively impacted. This was especially felt on pages with multiple instances of the plugin. Advanced users can enable plugins for experimentation and testing purposes only. We plan to provide a browser add-on that will enable you to selectively
 enable plugins on certain sites, because some sites, like YouTube, work well.</p>
<p><br />
You can try these instructions, but don't expect it to be great:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No need to download anything to get flash working in Firefox, it will use the same flash software that's already installed for MicroB.&nbsp; You just need to enable it like this (also covered in cpitchford's link):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to URL "about:config"<br />
2. Set filter "plugin"<br />
3. Set "plugin.default_plugin_diabled" and "plugin.disabled" to false</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, I've found flash works as well with Firefox as it does with MicroB - which is to say not real good.&nbsp; It seems to help a little to double the default cache memory in the 'about:config' settings from 1024 to 2048.</p>

<p>I am using onenote 2016.</p>
<p>I wantwd to come across from Evernote. I really like the ability to tag within a doc in onenote. However when a document is placed, from web or pdf journal article, it is rendered as an image and not text. So therefore you cannot copy and paste sections
 of text, nor can you see the undeelining text of a tagged highlighted line of text.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>I'm getting a ton of spam in my Outlook where its from&nbsp;email addresses that I know is spam and that you guys should know its spam as well for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;"&lt;?&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;?&gt;"&gt;</li><li>&lt;"&lt;?&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;?&gt;"&gt; </li><li>&lt;"&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"@--&gt; </li><li>&lt;"&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"@--&gt; </li></ul>
<p>It hard to set rules for stuff like this because it seems like the addresses are changing.</p>
<p>Also the email isn't even addresses to me. I'm assuming its BBC</p>
<p>So my question is how to I get this junk out of my inbox? and what are you guys doing to eliminate this type of junk mail?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Incoming messages are unruly, unless we manage them, and put some restrictions on which goes to our Inbox. You may use the available features to strictly filter your incoming messages by setting rules to automatically delete spam e-mails from your inbox.
 To learn how, click <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Inbox-rules-in-Outlook-edea3d17-00c9-434b-b9b7-26ee8d9f5622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to block the person that you don't want to receive an e-mail at all. Once the system detected an incoming e-mail from the person that you blocked, it will be automatically sent to your Junk folder. Now, to set your Junk settings, check this

<p>Hi Snomed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype is indeed compatible with your phone. The easiest way to get Skype on your Nokia E71 is to download it from
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/20924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Store</a>, either on your phone or via
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a>. There are other ways of getting the application on your phone as well, please refer to the instructions on the Skype mobile

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

    <title>What happens when I delete Outlook.com app from phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moray cp webmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happens when I delete Outlook.com app from phone</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have an Android phone running the outlook.com app, and also use IE10 to use Outlook.com webmail. As deleting an e-mail on my phone also deletes it from webmail, I am trying to find out what will happen to all my e-mails if I simply delete the app from my
 phone. I am changing phones to one of the dreaded iPhones, so want to keep all my webmail on Outlook.com.<br />
<br />
I did think of simply unchecking the synch option for the Inbox, but can't do that, and then thought of setting the synch to manual only, and then deleting the app, but I am really concerned about losing all my e-mails.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please give me some advice about what to do here in order to ensure I don't lose any e-mails.<br />
<br />
Many thanks<br />
<br />
Iain<br />

            <p>Hi Iain,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum. We understand your concern on whether your emails would also be deleted if you uninstall the Outlook.com app from your phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that when you uninstall the Outlook.com app from your mobile device, it would not affect the emails that have synced with it. Only the Outlook.com&nbsp;client components would be then removed from phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have further questions, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

            If you made yourself an ISO of Build 10240, you could probably upgrade from Windows 7 or 8 with it by running setup.exe from within Windows 7 or 8. &nbsp;I tried this and it worked from both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. &nbsp;The OS has to be Authentic and Activated
 in order for Build 10240 to be Activated.

</p><p>As much as I'd like to do this, I'm afraid of simply upgrading from Windows 8.1 (even though it's authentic) because there's been no word from Microsoft that says we can consider this the final build, and that Insiders can upgrade 10 days before the official
 launch date.</p>

            <p>Tip.&nbsp; You already know what version you have but if you didn't, to get the computer to show you what build you have you type "winver" into the search&nbsp; box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to upgrade the 8.1 installation.&nbsp; Just wait for July 29th.&nbsp; It is inadvisable to upgrade your 8.1 if it is your primary computer until Microsoft notifies you that your free upgrade is ready to install.</p>

            The software is the same as the RTM, but don't confuse that with the Insiders build number.&nbsp; That will change, probably to 10600, if past Gold releases are any indication.&nbsp; The Insider build numbers will need to change as MS releases new Insider builds
 in order to continue to test the delivery system.&nbsp; The software doesn't have to change to trigger Windows Update, just the build number.

This enables the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Talking caller ID for phone calls.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>When you get a call, your phone will announce the name or number of the caller.</li><li><span>Speed dialing.</span><span>&nbsp;</span>To assign a speed dial number, say "Save speed dial" and then follow the instructions.

    <title>How can i get Excel to automatically convert multiple unit types to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrimpossible  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i get Excel to automatically convert multiple unit types to lbs&#63;</h2>
                    I need a column within a table to convert all measurements to lbs. &nbsp;Measurements are given in lbs oz and grams, so i want to find a way to have a column normalize all inputs into lbs and still be able to sum the results. &nbsp;Ex. 256g would become 0.56 and
 256oz would become 16. &nbsp;I'm assuming that this will have to be done in VBA and my experience with VBA is extremely limited. &nbsp;Thanks in advance for any help you can render.&nbsp;

            <p>If you have entries in, say, cells A2:A4 like </p>
<p>256g</p>
<p>256oz</p>
<p>256lb</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Using formulas - use this formula in a cell in row 2:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>=IF(RIGHT(A2,1)="g",VALUE(LEFT(A2,LEN(A2)-1))/453.59,IF(RIGHT(A2,2)="oz",VALUE(LEFT(A2,LEN(A2)-2))/16,IF(RIGHT(A2,2)="lb",VALUE(LEFT(A2,LEN(A2)-2)),"")))</p>
<p>
</p><p>and copy down to match your data cells. &nbsp;Then you can copy the formulas, and paste formats and values over the original values, and delete your formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use this macro - select a single cell in the column with the values, and run this macro:</p>
<p>
Sub Convert2Pounds()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim rngC As Range<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each rngC In Intersect(ActiveCell.EntireColumn, ActiveSheet.UsedRange)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rngC.NumberFormat = "0.00"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If LCase(Right(rngC.Value, 1)) = "g" Then rngC.Value = Val(Replace(LCase(rngC.Value), "g", "")) / 453.59<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If LCase(Right(rngC.Value, 2)) = "oz" Then rngC.Value = Val(Replace(LCase(rngC.Value), "oz", "")) / 16<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If LCase(Right(rngC.Value, 2)) = "lb" Then rngC.Value = Val(Replace(LCase(rngC.Value), "lb", ""))<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next rngC<br />

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security reasons, Office has blocked activation of Silverlight controls including Power View in Excel. That's why the Power View is not available. You can unlock this control by downloading a small package of registry keys or manually editing the registry
 yourself. See this:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/flash-silverlight-and-shockwave-controls-blocked-in-microsoft-office-55738f12-a01d-420e-a533-7cef1ff6aeb1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Flash, Silverlight, and Shockwave controls blocked

    <title>Table of contents with appendix figures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digitig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Table of contents with appendix figures</h2>
                    <p>I've set up appendices following <a href="https://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numberingappendixes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Shauna Kelly's instructions</a>, but I also need my document to contain a list of figures. I have figures in my document body and in my appendices. Obviously for the body figures I can just add a table of figures, but that doesn't include the "Figure_apx" enties
 I'm using in appendices. I don't seem to be able to create another table of figures - if I put the insertion point outside the existing table of figures, the "Table of figures" tab is disabled in the custom table of contents tab, and if I put it inside the
 existing table of figures Word wants to replace that table. So how can I get a table / tables of contents showing both sets of figures? (I'll need to do the same with appendix tables, too, but I assume the answer will be basically the same.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            It is quite possible to have multiple Tables of Figures/Tables/Equations. These are all variations on the TOC field using the \c or Caption switch. Here is the Microsoft help page on the field.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-codes-toc-table-of-contents-field-1f538bc4-60e6-4854-9f64-67754d78d05c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-...</a>
<br />
<br />BTW, I am taking a two-pronged approach in trying to help you. The first was to ask you for a sample document so that we would be on the same page. The second is to provide you with resources that can help you do it yourself if we can't work on a common document. I apologize if it seems a bit disjointed.
<br />
<br />On that second prong, do you have different Caption labels for the things you want in different tables of figures?
<br />
<br />You can also use the \b switch to restrict a TOF to certain bookmarked parts of your document even using the same labels.
<br />
<br />Here is my go-to article on nuances of the TOC field which is used to create a TOF.

I have tried installing as an administrator and lots of other things but I always get the same problem.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Deleted emails won&#39;t stay deleted</h2>
                    <p>I have been using outlook 365 for over a year, managing 4 different email accounts.&nbsp; Yesterday, my msn account started re-populating all my deleted emails.&nbsp; I delete the email and it is back in my inbox in a minute or two.&nbsp; This only happens to the msn/
 hotmail account and not the gmail or outlook accounts... any ideas how to fix this?&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; when I sign in directly to hotmail the emails are showing deleted and are not re-populating.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your situation, I first would like to confirm whether the issue also occur in the MSN &amp; Hotmail web mail app. Can you successfully delete the emails in web mail without any problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this issue only occur to the MSN &amp; Hotmail account in Outlook client, I suggest you try to re-add your account and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you’re an Office 365 for business user, you can also try using the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4055050/how-to-scan-your-outlook-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365</a> which can help you automatically diagnose and fix a range of Outlook problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can also try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair your Outlook client</a> and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I’d like to collect some detailed information as below for further investigation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>How did you configure the account in Outlook? (Exchange/POP/IMAP)</li><li>What’s the version of your Outlook? (File &gt; Office Account &gt; About Outlook)</li><li>Can you see the deleted emails in the deleted items folder in Outlook?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

                    cannot Edit or add a phone # to any of my contact's profiles. I also am not able to just add a phone number to call. ALL the above was possible with the earlier version of Skype. Could you help show me how to fix this issue, or do you recommend that i
 revert to an older Skype Desktop version?&nbsp;

<p>Jason: Please explain in detail how you did this. I have searched, played with, and tried every possible combination of clicks in the Profile and there is NO WAY to add a new phone number.&nbsp; The Profile subsection (if there is one) in the Profile window shows
 the Skype Name (if the contact has one), Mobile number (if the contact was created with one), Location, Birthday, Add to Favorites, and Delete Chat. The image below shows a new profile without most of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did you click on to add a new phone number? If you click on Mobile, a sub-window opens that shows the Mobile number and Copy, but there is no option to add a new phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Skype for Windows 10, version 8.29.0.50, on Windows 10, on a Dell Laptop.</p>

<p>This is exactly what did NOT work. I have Windows 10/ Skype desktop version. I hope you test the steps before you declare they are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind that you cannot add a "phone number" to any contact including if you were to add a phone number for a person who does not use Skype for the sake of placing a paid call to them.</p>
<p>If you know how to make it work, i would really appreciate your help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 are doing. I attached a screen shot in my original post to show that there is no link to add a new phone number to an existing contact. You say you can do it. Please show us.</p>

<p>Larry is correct, the contacts handling in Win10 app of Skype is appalling ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason may also be correct IF he's using the 'local address book', and possibly linked to a hotmail account in Win10 email app. If so, then it is true that after clicking on the contact you get the option to 'Edit local address book details'. But this is
 very cranky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you both may be right. Conclusion: it is rubbish the way contacts have been (not) implemented in Spyke app, AND the local address book thingy does NOT always work well...</p>

 they sync or if I type into the ipaq they also sync. I've tried many things while trying to fix this - reinstalling outlook, repairing outlook, repairing the .pst file. Deleting the partnership, rebooting, switching off firewall and antivirus, many reboots.
 I've transferred (via csv) all the contact info mapping it to outlook and I've also tried it with just the fields mentioned on the microsoft site. At each stage the contacts look just fine in Outlook. I've tried updating an Outlook contact - it still doesnt
 transfer. <br />
Am I missing something obvious or can someone point me in the right direction, if I can't transfer my contacts this machine isnt much use to me......<br />

<p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I have a new IPAQ Classic 111.&nbsp; I previously had an older IPAQ and an older version of ActiveSync and Microsoft Outlook 2003/ XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded to ActiveSync 4.5, came with the new IPAQ, but kept Outlook 2003.&nbsp; All of my calendar and tanks synced.&nbsp; The ActiveSync Box told me the contacts were syncing as well, but they didn't move.&nbsp; Now when I sync the contacts don't even
 show on the PC screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reinstalled Activesync&nbsp; and reconfirmed items to be sycned...&nbsp; But nothing has changed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also have a lot of contacts that I would like to move to my new PDA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>There have been other reports of issues with imported contacts.&nbsp; Try exporting the contacts from Outlook, delete them&nbsp;and then re-import them.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Thank you v. much for the suggestions.<br />
<br />
I've followed them carefully....and took the steps<br />
a) delete contacts on outlook <br />
b) repair of outlook<br />
c) import contacts <br />
d) export contacts<br />
e) delete contacts<br />
f) reimport contacts (csv file, windows option)<br />
g) delete partnership<br />
h) reboot pc<br />
i) softboot ipaq<br />
j) sync all except for contacts<br />
k) added contacts<br />
l) sync<br />
<br />
But still no contacts. Have checked I can manually add contacts to both pc and pocket pc and they sync.<br />
<br />
Are there any other steps I could try ? <br />

<p>Same problem here. XP, Outlook 2003, active synch 4.5. Contacts will not synch despite performing all of the above. Including getting a new phone! Still not synching contacts in either direction despite synching the rest. When you go into the activesynch/menu/options
 list contacts is greyed out. Personally I think the problem is Outlook 2003 as on another thread 2003 was replaced with 2007 and things worked fine. (Check it out on the omnia thread)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't&nbsp;get the trial version&nbsp;of Outlook 2007 working, 2003 refused to die, probably as it's part of the standard office package 2003.&nbsp;So it'll have to be a new office package it seems. Hmm.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 and Excel 2016 - Customize the File &#62; Open menu</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>How can I customize the&nbsp;File &gt; Open menu in Word 2016 and Excel 2016, please?</p>
<p>Add a Place works only for the cloud.</p>
<p>As for This PC, it shows me a list of folders I am not interested in, and that apparently I cannot remove.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, I'd like to add different folders, which are not even in the C drive but on a D drive.</p>
<p>The only customization I found is in Options &gt; Advanced &gt; File Locations, in there I changed the location for Documents to my D drive, but it does not affect the File &gt; Open menu at all.</p>
<p>And in Excel 2016, this command is not even there under Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Marco</p>

            You can bypass this entirely by checking the box for "Don't show the Backstage when opening or saving files" at
<strong>File | Options | Save</strong>. You can then use <strong>Ctrl+O</strong> or an
<strong>Open</strong> button on the Quick Access Toolbar to go directly to the classic
<strong>Open</strong> dialog, which is an Explorer window in which you can add Favorites to the Navigation pane. When you start Word, the
<strong>Open</strong> dialog will default to the folder you have specified as the default location for your documents; if you open a file from a subfolder, it will become the default for the next open operation.

            When you "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">add Favorites to the Navigation pane</span>" (renamed as Quick Access in Windows 10) and pin them there, they show up in the Open and Save dialogs of Office programs. That is equivalent to
 pinning them on the File &gt; Open page of the Backstage, the thing that has been (unfortunately) removed. That's one of the reasons to avoid the Backstage as Suzanne suggested.

            <p>It sounds like your database is looking for a sharepoint publishing link that is either not there or the link is wrong.</p>
<p><br />
You should fix the&nbsp;if you're using&nbsp;sharepoint.&nbsp; Or if you're not using sharepoint,&nbsp;there are a number of ways round this but (by far) the simplest is just to ignore sharepoint all together and make a new (blank) database then import the objects from the old
 DB into the new one.<br />

            <p><span>I gave the answer about sharepoint as this happened to me years ago when I tested the sharepoint functionality – I think after the test that sharepoint was just a waste of time so I deleted the whole
 thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are so many better ways to everything sharepoint does.<br />
<br />
<br />
But as you say you are not using an uploaded database I’m at a loss.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have looked at the documentation and it seems that the warning "save changes to your server" is a standard Microsoft warning that is used by the MS Office Center.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Maybe someone else can jump in here with some advice.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One last think you shouldn’t have lost formatting when you import objects (forms, etc) into a new DB.<br />

    <title>Connecting laptop &#40;XP&#41; to Yoigo with 6310i &#40;open&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lemain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting laptop &#40;XP&#41; to Yoigo with 6310i &#40;open&#41;</h2>
                    From a Bluetooth DUN icon I can get the phone to start to access the network. In 'Navegador' mode (wap browsing, I think, this is a Spanish service) it works fine, so I have money on the SIM card and can connect via my phone without Bluetooth. So Bluetooth
 works, and we can access the network.<br />
<br />
I believe that I have to set the phone to Internet to work with the laptop, which is what I am doing.<br />
When I try to connect the phone says:-<br />
<br />
Connecting...pause....Connect with Laptop?<br />
<br />
I then 'Accept'<br />
<br />
Phone - "Connected to Laptop" for 2 seconds then "Creating GPRS connection" then "Subscribe to GPRS first" at which the connection drops out and I get an error messge on the Laptop "Error 734: The PPP Link control protocol was terminated"<br />
<br />
I thought that I must be subscribed to GPRS given that I can browse happily on the phone (In Navegadoe mode, not in Internet mode) and see the news, etc., with G on the display signifying GPRS.<br />
<br />
What could be meant by "Subscribe to GPRS first"?<br />
<br />
So near, but yet so far?<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your help :)

            I've found the answer so for the benefit of those who follow....<br />
<br />
In the Nokia 6310i there are TWO places where the GPRS modem needs to be specified. Under "Settings" and under "Services" All of the internet and data stuff is carried out under Services and the modem was correctly specified in there but on the off-chance I
 re-typed the designated name under Settings &gt; GPRS modem settings &gt; Edit acess point and I changed the name for Access Point 5 (an arbitrary one) to 'internet' which was the correct designation for the Yoigo service. Then the thing worked perfectly.
