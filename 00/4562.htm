            Hello notheastham ! im glad to hear that someone else has this problem. I think this is new since im replying to this 2 days after you posted it. I have had this account for about a year and a half now and this hasn't happened to me until now ! I typed
 in my number as well as some other family member's and it is not working! it is very frustrating because im thinking about applying for an IB school (if you know what im talking about) and i have a link for a very important file to help me practice ! unfortunately
 i dont have an answer to this problem. good luck anyways !

<p>Hello MS Support Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same problem with SMS Verification. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am administrating domain vietan-enviro.com on live.com. Today I added two 2 new email address, they are&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;and&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 After creating the account in the admin panel (https://domains.live.com), one by one, I logged in and verify by entering captcha, I could successfully access the inbox. When I attemp to send email, outlook.com said that I need to verify my account and then
 turn me to SMS verification page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this page, I chose to verify via my number (090****512) in Vietnam (Voice service: Mobifone), but I could not receive the code at the first time, so I click "Send it again" button, then I could receive an SMS from telling me the code, but when I enter
 that code to SMS Verification Website, it seems to have no affect, the verification form loaded again without saying successful or failed result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me in making my accounts work.</p>
<p>Thanks so much</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tony</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just imported all my Google Contacts to outlook.com's People address book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I load https://people.live.com I see all my contacts and they all have a photo (avatar) setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I load my People contacts in Outlook 2013 Address Book I don't get the pictures/avatars showing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same happens when I load my People Contacts on my iOS devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am am I missing something? Only contacts who are also friends with me on Facebook get a photo/avatar. (From Facebook)</p>
<p>When I was using Google Contacts on my iOS devices I would see all my contacts picture/avatar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>MS Project - Create Macro for Lookup Table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandygee  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project - Create Macro for Lookup Table</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>Currently working on large project on stand alone machine (company I am assisting dont have server version of MS Project). &nbsp;Anyway I have created the report based with columns which have lookup table assosciated with them and graphic indicators.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process has worked well however when I send the file to other planners for future use the lookup table has disappeared and I need to go to each user and set up the lookup table again. &nbsp;If the indicator is there then they can view - just cant update.
 &nbsp;Below is a sample of what I have created. &nbsp;<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/423c2b47-2436-4ea7-8e21-5affffc58a98" /><br />
Is there any way I can create a macro for users to update the list or if anyone is aware of a workaround that means not having to recreate the lookup table each time saved or sent then I would be greatful.<br />
</p>
                </div>

            <p>SandyGee,</p>
<p>There is some information that is missing. What version of Project are you using? Is it fully updated with the latest updates? What versions are other planners using? Are their versions fully updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since custom fields are saved with the file, lookup tables and graphical indicators should be fully functional when a file is shared with other users. To verify this, I did a quick test with a sample file on a virtual machine running Project 2010 on Windows
 7, fully updated with the October 2015 Public update. I set up a custom field (Text1) with a lookup table and graphical indicators similar to what you show. I then transferred that file to another virtual machine running Project 2010 on Windows XP, updated
 only to SP2. That should emulate sending a Project file from one user to another. When I opened the file on the second virtual machine, both the lookup table and graphical indicators for the Text1 field were active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why it doesn't work for you? It's possible the file is corrupt or something else is not operating properly. To fix a corrupt file, the method that normally works is to save the file as XML and then re-open in Project. Note, you will lose custom formatting
 using this process.</p>

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. The company is using Microsoft Project Professional 2010 Version 14.0.7159.5000 (32 bit). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my end the only Graphic Indicators that are saving across are those with the answers Yes/No. &nbsp;I will try and fix the file in the first instance to see if that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to rectify the issue now for over a week and I have tried all the fixes I can think of. Apologies for the queries as I am more of a Primavera consultant then MPP and it has been a number of years since I have used the Project.</p>

            <p>SandyGee,</p>
<p>Okay, 14.0.7159.5000 is the Office version, not the Project version. To see the Project version, go to File/Help and click on "additional version and copyright information" under the About Microsoft Project in the middle of the right hand side of the screen.
 At the top of the the About Microsoft Window you will see a version number that looks like:</p>
<p>Microsoft Project 2010 (14.0.7160.5000) SP2 MSO (14.0.7159.5000). The first number is the version of Project, the second number is the version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible for you to send me a sample file of what you have set up. That will test two things. First, since the problem is manifest in sending the file to others, I'll be able to see first hand. Second, I will be able to see exactly how you set
 up the custom fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My e-mail address is below. I will ask some questions. If you do send it, make sure it is no larger than 1M when zipped.</p>

            <p>To those who may be following this thread,</p>
<p>Sandy sent me a sample file. I opened it under two different update levels of Project 2010, (latest update and SP2 only), and also under Project 2007 SP3 after saving in Project 2007 format from Project 2010. All custom field lookup values and graphical
 indicators worked as expected, so basically I could not replicate any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is not corrupt as I was able to open and use it. It's possible the other user's have a problem with their Global file or perhaps some corruption in Project itself. I suggest a repair of Project through the Control Panel and/or a repair of their
 Global file.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Clipper Will Not Sign In</h2>
                    <p>OneNote Clipper for Chrome and Firefox will both not complete Sign In.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens, for both browsers -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the OneNote Extension (Chome) or the OneNote Bookmarklet (Firefox) for the first time, and a dialogue pops up - "Please Sign In to Clip to OneNote".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click the Sign In button on the dialogue, and a new window opens. If I have my pop-up blocker enabled, the window closes immediately without allowing me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have my pop-up blocker disabled, the window allows me to enter my information, and then closes when I click Login. Now, whenever I click the Extension or Bookmarklet I get the "Please Sign In to Clip to OneNote" dialogue first, then when I click Sign
 In the window immediately closes without allowing me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I am completely unable to use the OneNote Clipper functionality for Chrome and Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs if have my normal Extensions / Plugins enabled, and also occurs if I have all Extensions / Plugins disabled.</p>

            Enabling 3rd party cookies solves this problem in Chrome. &nbsp;The Evernote Clipper had the same problem. &nbsp;

<h2>            Sharing Office365 Home and Sharing Files &#40;for Newbies&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I have an Office365 Home subscription.</p>
<p>My husband has just bought a Surface Pro.</p>
<p>I want to share my subscription with him<br />
BUT</p>
<p>we want to be able to access the same documents &amp; folders, most of the time.</p>
<p>How do we best achieve this?</p>
<p>(We are both rather new to Office365, OneDrive and the SurfacPro).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Macro pour copie automatique des donn&#233;es</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour à tous,</p>
<p>
</p><p>J’ai <span>&nbsp;</span>un tableau qui récupère des données d’un autre tableau dont les structures sont identiques .</p>
<p>on faisant un copier coller à&nbsp; chaque fois.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Le tableau source est sur une feuille d’un fichier créé chaque semaine on lui affectant&nbsp; comme nom le numéro de la nouvelle semaine
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Le dossier contenant les fichiers Excel se présente ainsi</p>
<p>S1</p>
<p>S2</p>
<p>S3</p>
<p>S4 <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>etc…jusqu’à la semaine en cours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pour info</p>
<p>-il arrive que les données&nbsp; en cours soient modifiées</p>
<p>-la création de la nouvelle semaine se fait généralement&nbsp; Vendredi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actuellement pour récupérer les données à jour de la dernière semaine inscrite( dernier fichier du dossier), je fais un copier-coller du tableau où se situent mes données.</p>
<p>Je dois aussi faire une sauvegarde (généralement Vendredi ou des qu il ya création d une nouvelle semaine ) de la semaine qui s’achève (l'avant dernier fichier du dossier) sur une autre feuille nommée S-1 toujours en faisant un copier-coller
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-Est-il possible d’utiliser une macro qui va me chercher automatiquement la dernière mise à jour de la dernière semaine inscrite ? et une copie automatique de la semaine qui s’achève (l'avant dernière&nbsp;semaine inscrite)?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Merci .</p>

<p>Hi Yolvi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if you could explain where it states in the article that you can share Office 365&nbsp;with another person (father) at another&nbsp; address.&nbsp; It is not all that clear but it does say the 'same household'.&nbsp; I take that to mean using the same internet connection.

Share your Office 365 Home subscription with up to four people</a>&nbsp; I would be very happy to be corrected!</p>

            Unfortunately, no such options are available in the Skype app itself. But you could try going into iOS Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Large text 
<br />
<br />Use the slider to increase the text size. 
<br />
<br />Toggle on Larger Accessibility Sizes for even larger text sizes.

            Well, it seemed to work on the fly here on my iPad.
<br />
<br />Is Skype updated on your device?
<br />
<br />There might be limitations here.

<p>Yes I just updated Skype as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I change the accessibility setting to "Large" and make it very big, the chat font is still very small :-( ... (ie, no change from before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ipad&nbsp;is being used be an elderly person, so the font size is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if it worked for you...maybe i'm just doing something wrong? ...</p>

            <p>This is a new operating system.&nbsp; It has been released to eligible phones and the 630 is not one of them.</p>
<p>If this is your daily phone I would not recommend using the preview on you phone. To many problems.</p>
<p>It is a new interface and some things you would expect to work as on 8.1 do not work on 10</p>

<h3> babo&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows Defender error code 0x800106ba</h2>
                    last scan performed 27-10-2015. OS Windows 10 Pro. No other antivirus installed. Every time I try to run a scan Defender starts and later stops and is turned off, before the scan is completed. The issue started after Defender had problems in updating files.
 Any solution? Thanks.

<h3> jeffcnick  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make a different First Page&#63;</h2>
                    Ok - this should be easy.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am using Word for Mac 2011<br />
<br />
I want to print a header on the first page only.&nbsp;&nbsp; In previous versions of Work there was a dialogue box where you checked "Different First Page".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Easy huh?<br />
<br />
However, I can't seem to find a dialogue box or any way to make the first page different.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; <br />

            Are you sure you mean 'bold' and not upper case? The default is to capitalize the first letter of all sentences, as sentences should begin with a capital letter (at least in English). You can turn this off from File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Spelling and Autocorrect
 &gt; Autocorrect options. I cannot think of a mechanism whereby the first letters of sentences would be in 'bold' typeface.<br />

    <title>Need Help Displaying Access Attachments.FileName on Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e.j. gun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help Displaying Access Attachments.FileName on Form</h2>
                    
<p>I have a form that has as one of its fields "Attachments.FileName".&nbsp; I added some dummy data to the table behind this form (a JPG and a PDF).&nbsp; When I open the form, the JPG displays as an image in the Attachment control, and the PDF shows up as an icon.&nbsp;
 In both cases, the filename shows up in the Attachments.Filename field.</p>
<p>Now take this form and make is a sub-form to another form.&nbsp; The attachments still show up normally, but suddenly the Attachments.FileName field only displays #Name?&nbsp; Why this change of behavior simply because I made the form a sub-form on another form?&nbsp;
 Does anyone have a suggestion for fixing this so the filenames display correctly?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Eric</p>

            Sounds like it might be the way the new form and original subform are linked together.&nbsp; Check the values on the original main form against what you have now.

<p>Not sure what you mean by linked together.&nbsp; I have the sub-form's "Link Master Fields" set to an field called "Closure ID".&nbsp; I have the "Link Child Fields" set to a field called "Parent ID".&nbsp; This is done so that the records displayed by the sub-form correspond
 to the record being displayed by the form (designated by "Closure ID").&nbsp; This is a many-to-one relationship.</p>
<p>As I said, the attachements themselves show up just fine.&nbsp; It's just the Attachments.FileName that isn't working.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>That is exactly what I was talking about...&nbsp; Are you saying the your are using the Link Master/Link Child on both main form to subform?</p>
<p>I am assuming they are both in the same database?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Here is a more exact description of what I have.&nbsp; It's an action tracking system.&nbsp; There are three forms involved.&nbsp; The first, frmActionItemList, is the main form.&nbsp; It collects all the action items from a particular meeting.&nbsp; The second, frmClosureCriteria,
 shows a set of closure criteria that must be worked for each action item.&nbsp; One action item can have multiple closure criteria.&nbsp; The third, frmResponses, collects responses from people who are working each closure criterion.&nbsp; One closure criterion can have
 multiple responses.&nbsp; The forms look like this:</p>
<p>frmActionItemList<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - key ID = "Log Number" (autonumbered)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frmClosureCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - key ID = "Criterion ID" (autonumbered)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - link ID = "Parent ID" &lt;-- points to the correct "Log Number"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - sub-form to frmActionItemList<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Link Master Field = "Log Number"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Link Chilld Field = "Parent ID"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frmResponses<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - key ID = "Response ID" (autonumbered)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - link ID = "Parent ID" &lt;-- points to the correct "Criterion ID"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - sub-form to frmClosureCriteria<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Link Master Field = "Criterion ID"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Link Child Field = "Parent ID"</p>
<p>frmResponses includes a field name "Attachments", which, of course, has all the attachments that form the response.&nbsp; One response can have multiple attachments (evidence) to support the response.&nbsp; When I drag the Attachments field onto frmResponses and show
 the main form (frmActionItemList), the Attachments field shows up correctly - either an image or an icon shows up, depending on the file type.&nbsp; When I click on the Attachments field I can navigate through the attachments if there is more than one for a response,
 and I can open/save/etc the attachments.</p>
<p>When I drag the "Attachments.FileName" field onto frmResponses, all I get is the #Name? error.&nbsp; I would like to be able to show the attachment file names along side the Attachments field, so that as I navigate from one attachment to the next, the filename
 changes.</p>
<p>Clear as mud?</p>

Arthur Durand</a>. Do the duplicate apps only appear under Settings&gt;notifications+actions, or even when you go to App list? Are the phone system apps up to date? Go to Settings&gt;applications&gt;store&gt;...&gt;check for updates. Also, see if you have the latest software
 version available on the phone by going to Settings&gt;check for updates. We look forward to your reply. ^_^

<p>Recycled the Application Pool MSExchangeAutodiscoverAppPool in IIS </p>

            I'm also in Australia and to the best of my knowledge it can't be changed. Maybe Microsoft will eventually do something for us, although they recently sold their share of MSN&nbsp; in Australia so they are probably not in a hurry to do so.

            <p>Not sure if you have been able to fix this problem yet. But in case you haven't, try this (for Google Chrome but probably similar whichever browser you are using):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Chrome settings &gt; show advanced settings &gt; content settings (under privacy) &gt; All cookies and site data (under cookies).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type msn in the search box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all msn cookies that appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time you log out of outlook, it should ask you which msn site you want, choose the Australian one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Hello EdwinaRyan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that every time you sign out from your Microsoft account, you are being brought to MSN U.K. instead of MSN Australia where you are currently located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that this is fixed with accordance to the location where you created the account. Meaning, if you created this account in U.K., and even when you move to other countries, you will still be brought to MSN U.K. every time you sign
 out of&nbsp;your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions or any clarifications regarding this, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and take care!</p>
<p />

            That's simply not true. I created my account in the UK and when I sign out it goes to the Portuguese MSN. Figure that one. Trying to fix now.

<p>Hi Indra,</p>

<p>Researcher, by design, uses Bing to pull in the appropriate content from the web search and provide credible information. We have yet to include the option to change the search engine that Researcher is using.</p>
