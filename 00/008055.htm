Hello Paul,</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
The steps provided did not work. &nbsp;Once again, I have used IE8 and Google Chrome, as well as firefox. &nbsp;All of the browsers give the same problem with attachments with my hotmail Outlook account. &nbsp;I cannot download any attachments, but I can send attachments.
 &nbsp;I can view an attachment with online view, but I cannot later print or download.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
This is really inconvenient, and the only way I can open an attachment now is to forward the email to another email account that is not hotmail outlook. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Once again, I can open the attachment if I look from my iphone.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Kind regards,</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Robert</div>

            <p>Hi Robert, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I undertand that you cannot download attachments on your account and we apologize for the inconveniences that this had caused you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recently had a server maintenance that affected attachments on the email accounts of our users as a result, they could not open nor download it using a web browser. This issue has been indetified and is already fixed. Kindly try to sign out then sign
 back in to your account and see if you we're able to download the attachment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any confirmation regarding this issue is highly appreciated so that we can make the necessary action if in case the issue persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello. &nbsp;Yep, just tried and it finally works. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I have spent a couple of days trying everything, reloading IE and Google Chrome, restoring my computer to an earlier date....and I have lost some of my information in doing so. &nbsp;

<div>In any case, good to know it was not a hacker as the message suggested was the most probable cause.</div>

<p>I understand that you cannot seem to save the attachment on your email. Let me help you with your concern.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that what I have posted above was when we had a server maintenance that affected our users on how the download attachment on their emails and this issue is already resolved. We do not have any server maintenace as of this writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say you have tried all the suggested fix, did you mean that you have already tried downloading&nbsp;or saving&nbsp;the attachment using a different browser or PC? If not yet, I would suggest that you try to do so in order for us to determine the root cause
 of the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what is the file type of the email that you are trying to save? Did you encounter any error messages? Kindly provide us these information for our investigation on your issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

    <title>How to re-link default email acct folders to default Outlook Data File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rda1959  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to re-link default email acct folders to default Outlook Data File folders&#63;</h2>
                    I recently reinstalled Outlook 2010 (Win 7, 64-bit) &amp; have, for the most part, successfully reconfigured my 2 IMAP email accounts. The default email account had always been linked to my default Outlook Data File, so that any new mail would show up in both
 inboxes. Can someone please help me to re-synch these 2 accounts/folders? Also, I'm "missing" all my emails from my default account, as well as my calendar; my contacts were successfully imported. In addition to 2 Outlook folders in my "Documents" containing
 3 .pst files (5.10 MB, 761 KB, &amp; 265 KB) &amp; 1 .csv file, I also found 2 .adr files (DOS &amp; Windows), an .srs file, an .xml file, &amp; possibly an .ics file (currently can't access). Ironically, after this newest reinstall, my very first batch of emails, thought
 gone for good, showed up again! Any advice/recommendations on these issues would be greatly appreciated.

            If they're IMAP folder sets, every time you delete the account from Outlook, the PST associated with that account should be deleted and every time you add an IMAP account back in a new PST will be created.&nbsp; Sometimes, the PST doesn't get properly deleted
 when the account is removed.&nbsp; Remove all IMAP accounts from Outlook, close Outlook, then delete the IMAP PSTs (don't delete the PST you're using as the default data file, though).&nbsp; Either re-add the IMAP accounts using the Mail applet in Control Panel or by
 starting Outlook and adding them there.

            16208 was put to bed Thursday so there has been enough days, but the holiday weekend probably delayed testing and evaluation by a significant part of the team.&nbsp; If there isn't a flight on Tuesday then 16208 could well be the one.&nbsp; However, Brandon LeBlanc,
 who is a senior program manager on the team did tweet last week that it would be 16203 this week. &nbsp;Bottom line?&nbsp; Who knows?

                    <p>When users sign into the OneDrive NGSC for the first time, it automatically adds their personal OneDrive for Business folder to sync. We would like all of our users to sync a common SharePoint Online Document library, as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way for us to administratively configure this so each users doesn't have to manually log into SharePoint Online and hit the "sync" button from the Library?</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After we sign into NGSC with work/school account, it will automatically sync users’ OneDrive for Business libraries. Based on my search, there is no official article about settings that let end user automatically sync a specific SharePoint Online library
 after signing in with work/school account. Users need to click Sync button to sync SharePoint Online libraries. Admins can configure settings mentioned in the article below for end users.
</p>

<p>
</p><p>We understand admins may have the requirement to configure some settings which let user sync specific SharePoint Online library after signing. It is suggested you submit your feedback via

                    I have microsoft office home and student 2010 installed back in Sep 2010. I had to reactivate Windows xp after I get the message from the computer as : One to fthe files containing the systems registry data had to be recovered by use of a log or alternate
 copy. The recovery was successful." After trying to open an Excel 2010 , it gave the message ; cannot verify the license of this product. I went to the control panel and allowed me to repair the program however after it restarted it displayed the same message
 : cannot verify the license of this product. Should I uninstall and reinstall office 2010?

            Most Product Key Cards (PKC) come with a 27 character PIN that has to be entered on a website to "activate" it and retrieve the 25 character "Product Key".&nbsp; Product Key retrieval using the PIN is a one-time process so you have to keep track of the retrieved
 Product Key. <br />
<br />
Apparently, some PKC come with a 25 character Product Key on them already.<br />
<br />
The 25 character product key has to be entered in one of the Office applications to "activate" the Office installation.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 minimized folder pane - where is the &#34;all folders&#34; button &#40;as in Outlook 2013&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2013, when minimizing the folder pane, there is a button "all folders" appear which allow us easier to show all folders as a peek; however, in Outlook 2016, when minimizing the folder pane, such "all folders" button is disappeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway can bring such "All folders" button back in Outlook 2016~? Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2013:</p>

            The Folders button is under the three dots icon at the bottom. You can choose the Navigation Options to move the Folders button to the top so it's available for you in Compact view.

                    <p>I currently have Office professional 2007 which includes Outlook, Publisher and Access. I want to upgrade to 2016 Office Home but it does not inlcude these. If I upgrade will I lose the 2007 versions of Outlook etc. That is, will 2016 completely replace
 all my 2007 applications? I want to keep them.</p>

<p>Many thanks Palcouk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I then ask - can I keep my 2007 professional installed as well as that includes Access, Publisher and Outlook. I understand they would be old versions but I am trying to save a bit of $ (instead of buying a whole new Pro version as I am a pretty basic
 user).</p>

<p>Office 2007 went out of support in Oct 2017 and some users with win10 have reported unresolved problems that occurred after a win10 update</p>
<p>If you buy/install 2016 Home &amp; Student you can retain the other 2007 products.</p>
<p>If you use your 2007 cd and you modify the installation to say make Word unavailable from PC it will remove Word 2007</p>

<h2>            How do I get an OLDER version of PC suite &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a Mac user - OS X 10.6. My Nokia is 3500 classic. I have 5000 SMS messages in it that I need to download to some safer&nbsp;location and I cannot access either the Inbox or Sent Messages with my Mac - only images and music folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an old laptop running Windows XP (with no internet connection) so I downloaded the latest PC suite to my Mac and</p>
<p>transported it to the XP laptop via memory stik.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest &nbsp;version of PC suite refuses to install on the XP laptop saying that the OS version is not supported. It is XP 5.1</p>
<p>service pack 1. I do not wish to upgrade the junk laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you please tell me where I can download a version of PC suite that will run on XP service pack 1. Or something that will access my sms via my Mac. All I want to do is archive my sms messages. Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One way to get links to older versions of Nokia PC suite from Nokia's web site is to pick an older phone model.&nbsp; They sometimes point to older PC Suite versions -- version 6.x would suit you fine for XP SP1.&nbsp; Pick a phone model from like 53 years ago and
 you may get lucky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/PC_suite/Nokia_PC_Suite_Eng.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC Suite 6.83.20.1</a> pick Nokia 1006</p>
<p>For <a href="http://nds2.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_PC_Suite_58_en.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PC Suite 5.8</a> (Win98 and WinME support) pick Nokia 6100</p>
<p>For PC Suite 4.81 pick Nokia 6210&nbsp;</p>
<p>For PC Suite 3 pick Nokia 3650</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these are device specific so they may or may not work for you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>I found a total of 3 older PC version numbers available, none of which support my 3500classic. I was hoping that someone might have a fairly recent version that does not require XP service pack 2 and would be willing to share with me.</p>
<p>Suggestions of any other method of archiving my SMS would also be appreciated. I downloaded syncfony but it doesn't support Nokia 3500 yet either.</p>

            Ah I didn't bother to check how new your phone was...released in June 2007, so it has to be a version of PC Suite released after that date, which may means you may just have to upgrade to XP SP2 atleast.&nbsp; It's not that bad!

                    Does Outlook have an encrypted feature for website user names and passwords? Lotus Organizer had this function almost 20 years ago and it was great having everything in the same contact manager.

<br />
the 8800 and 8801 are explicitly supported by isync, the 8600 is not.<br />
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/</a><br />
<br />
sorry.<br />
<br />
in your shoes i think there are 3 options:<br />
<br />
1. wait. it's the least pleasant option, because you might wait forever, but maybe nokia will release an isync plugin<br />
2. be proactive: there are 3rd party plugins you can try like:<br />
<a href="http://www.james-lloyd.com/scripts/nokia-series-40-isync-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.james-lloyd.com/scripts/nokia-series-40-isync-plugin/</a><br />
but the link i gave you sates there are 'problems' with the plugin. but its free and maybe it will get fixed, perhaps just another waiting game.<br />
3. hack: you'd be surprised how little you need to know to get started in trying to turn a different plugin into the one you want. personally, this is where i'd be - download the plugin above, dont expect it to work, start tearing into it to see if i can find
 out why it fails.<br />
<br />
sadly, i think the only other 2 options are likely "off the table" already:<br />
4. don't sync.<br />
5. use a different operating system (windows, bleh)<br />
<br />
wish i had better news for you,<br />

<p>Yes , fix it by resetting the photo library to default and pointing the place where the library gathers it's photos to a folder with just a couple of pictures in it. Once the app loads, let it analyze, It will take a while, It had all the photos in a caches,
 Once those are no longer displayed, and you only see the three you just pointed the library toward, the photo app will start working properly, May take a couple reboots.</p>

            <blockquote>thanks but a question, how do I reset the photo library when the app doesn't start up?
</blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION 1</p>
<p>Use file explorer. Goto the photo library, Manage Library tab and manage, reset
</p>
<p>Then make sure you have 5-10 photos (jpg) showing up in the library. To many and you might have problems, corrupted files or unsupported codec can also cause problems. DON'T INCLUDE other locations in the library.... YET! Try adding them later once the app
 launches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SOLUTION 2</p>

<blockquote>thanks but a question, how do I reset the photo library when the app doesn't start up?
</blockquote>
<p>SOLUTION 1</p>
<p>Use file explorer. Goto the photo library, Manage Library tab and manage, reset
</p>
<p>Then make sure you have 5-10 photos (jpg) showing up in the library. To many and you might have problems, corrupted files or unsupported codec can also cause problems. DON'T INCLUDE other locations in the library.... YET! Try adding them later once the app
 launches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SOLUTION 2</p>
<p>Try starting the photo app from the "All APPS" view on the start screen, rather than the photo tile. For some reason the tile will cause the photo app to crash if the tile is not working (IE Display a photo or recient photos)</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi Bob</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried solution 2 and it worked on my virtual box at work. I'll see if I can do the same at my home virtual box and Surface Pro 3. For now, I'll keep checking my work box</p>

    <title>Is Excel now throttling password guesses to break worksheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed hansberry 365  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Excel now throttling password guesses to break worksheet protection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using this classic VBA code for over a decade to break workbook and worksheet protection (not workbook passwords when opening) and it usually works in under 1-2 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have it running on two different machines (Excel 1901 insider and 1812 monthly targeted) on two different files and it has been running on both for over an hour. It is working as I changed it to update the status bar periodically, but not sure if MS
 is throttling the ActiveSheet.Unprotect code, or if it now requires it to find the exact password and no longer breaks it on something simple like AAABAABAACACCA as it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine about 3-4 months ago as I recall, the last time I needed it.</p>

    <title>cannot archive or export pst file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allana15  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot archive or export pst file</h2>
                    Archive fails: thinks I am using 97-2002 pst file, when it is 2007 file.<br />
Also, exporting to pst fails with a messaging error.<br />
Have tried uninstall and reinstall, with no change.<br />
Any thoughts?<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>You've provided absolutely no information - specifically in regards to what errors were encountered. What exactly was the "messaging error" - exactly and entirely as displayed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you archive to a new PST file - does that portion of the problem still exist. PST formats don't change from Unicode to Ansi (97-2002) on their own. A 97-2002 PST file can be used in any version of Outlook but do have a much lower size limit so it may
 be possible that you have reached that limit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling would have absolutely no impact on either of these problems.</p>

            Sorry. <br />
Started with Outlook 2007, so don't know how it gives a 97-2002 pst message.<br />
On export try, no specific error message given: just that a messaging error occurred.<br />
Not sure what other info is needed...?<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>#1 - Re: 97-2002 - can't comment beyond what already have written but have never heard of a PST file suddenly changing formats (but there's always a first time for everything). Leaving the question of the PST file's size (also assuming that the message is
 coming from the archive file and not the source PST file)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 - Re "No specific error message given" - are you saying that the sum total of the message displayed was "message error occurred" with nothing else included?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of item #2 - would run ScanPST on your PST file to eliminate any potential underlying problems. Actually would do the same thing on the Archive PST file since it's unclear where these messages are stemming from</p>

The archiving error says "you are attempting to archive your data to a Microsoft Outlook 97-2002 Personal Folders File (.pst) which is a non-Unicode file. To preserve multilingual data, you must choose a Unicode data file, such as&nbsp; the Microsoft Outlook Personal
 Folders File (.pst). See help for more information." <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any way to convert the pst file to Unicode? Any other fixes available?<br />
<br />
The exporting error says "The messaging interface has returned an unknown error. If the problem persists, restart Outlook."<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, restarts did not help...<br />
<br />
Multiple runs of scanpst did not help either. I tried Kernel pst recovery software, too. Set up a new profile after it ran, and the performance sluggishness disappeared, but the archive/export problem persisted.<br />
<br />
Sigh...<br />

            Last suggestion that can be made in terms of the archiving problem is to archive to a different file. That said, the export error you are encountering indicates a problem with the PST file so last set of questions in that regard is "What is the format
 and size of the source file". &nbsp;

            Tried archiving to a different name with no success...<br />
<br />
Size of pst is just over 4 gig; how can I determine its format?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

            Different ways - don't have '2007 handy but if memory serves correctly&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>From menu --&gt; Tools --&gt; Account Settings --Data File tab --&gt; highlight the PST file --&gt; Settings</div>
<div><br />
<div>Format will either be</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Outlook Data File (97-2002) &nbsp;- old Ansi format</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Outlook Data File &nbsp;- current unicode format</div>
<div><br />
<div>Alternative way --&gt; right click on Root of PST file in Navigation pane --&gt; (Data File) Properties --&gt;<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Advanced --&gt; format (see above)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this file is being recognized as a 97-2002 file - then the size is definitely going to be a problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For lack of any better suggestions - would create a new PST file, copy all the folders from the original file and then make it the new default PST file for the account (or accounts depending on what your configuration involves). If that doesn't resolve
 the problems, hopefully someone else has some better things to try.</div>
