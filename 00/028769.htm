    <title>Why do Android built-in mail apps not support modern - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do Android built-in mail apps not support modern authentication&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We are close to disabling basic authentication in our environment which will cause all native android email clients to break, and forcing users to the Outlook mobile app or other 3rd party ADAL supported email apps (e.g NINE).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why Android does not integrate modern authentication support into their built-in mail apps? Even with version 9.0 Pie there is still no support for modern authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forcing our android users to transition from their native email app (which has work and personal calendar integration) will be a HUGE pain for our employees. Can anyone tell provide some feedback on this? Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge, Modern Authentication (MA) is a combination of authentication and authorization method between clients and servers. Currently Microsoft brings it to almost all Microsoft Office applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your concerns, as you know, Android is developed by Google instead of Microsoft. Meanwhile, different mobile phone manufacturers have different built-in mail apps. So this is out of our support boundary since both Android system and Android built-in
 apps are not Microsoft productions. Of course, it would be great if more and more operating systems and applications support MA. You can also feedback to Google or the mobile phone manufacturers to suggest the MA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While based on the situation of your organization, if there's a large number of users who are unwilling to use Outlook for Android, it's feasible to keep basic authentication enabled for them. Of course, if it's determined to disable
 basic authentication, we recommend you gradually move users to Outlook app. Although Outlook mobile app is not perfect, our development team is&nbsp;constantly striving to improve product performance and user experience. We sincerely appreciate for your time and
 understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<h2>            Ringtones playing in amongst music files - Nokia 5800</h2>
                    
<p>Got a bit of a problem, no biggie but if I could find a solution would be good. When I am listing to music mp3 files on shuffles every now and again I will get the mp3's that are associated with ringtones and text messages and alarms which are also mp3 and
 they are "talking tones", so imagine I am listening to Beyonce and the next song to play is "you have an incoming call!" - so any way to stop or hide them talking mp3 ringtones from when I just want to listen to mp3 music files? Thanks, Andy.</p>

<p>thanks, no I didn't mean someone rings and the ringtones go off I meant that in amongst the mp3 music are the mp3 ringtones and they play like a song whereas I only just want to listen to the mp3 music tracks, not mp3 ringtones.</p>

            I know what you mean, its pretty annoying i must say but unfortunately there's no way to tell music player not to add those "ring tones" to music library. best thing to do is create playlist including all your music tracks (excluding ring tones), however
 in this case there's a bit of extra work to do (adding new files to that playlist) every time you add new tracks.<br />
<br />
I found this workaround, its not an ideal solution but worth trying if you have a limited number of those ring tones.<br />

<p>oh right i see, thats what i will have to do then make playlists, you are right it is a pain and fiddly, shame when they made this phone they didnt do it so that you could put all your ringtones in a "ringtone" folder on the memory card or phone memory and
 then your mp3 music into a "music" folder and then just be able to shuffle all the songs from the music folder. Thanks for the advice will give that a go tomorrow.</p>

            I would suggest to make your playlists through Ovi Suite. Its much easier.

<h2>            Windows 10 RTM&#47;Final &#40;10240&#41; - Collective BUGS and Feedback Thread V1</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is Final.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter if Microsoft doesn't call it RTM, Final, or not. Build 10240 is the Final/Release version of Windows 10, and it is proved to be provided not only to all Insiders, but the same identical version was sent to OEM for preinstalling their new PCs with
 Build 10240.</p>
<p>On 29th, users will receive 10240 + Patches on top of it, while who already upgraded to 10240, will receive only the Patches (cause they already upgraded to the final version).</p>
<p><br />
That said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just managed to successfully upgrade my Surface Pro 3 with Windows 8.1 (NO Insider Prewiew member. I just obtained the official ESD of my version/language, and converted to ISO) to Windows 10 RTM Build 10240. And it permanently activated as the free upgrade
 offer stated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I used Rufus to create an USB Bootable Drive from that ISO, and Clean Installed 10240 from scratch (erased all partition, and formatted the drive), and like I imagined: I preserved my Activation without inserting any product key (the first upgrade
 registered my hardware to MS server, I just logged-in with my Microsoft Account and kept my Internet connectio on), and that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the cleanest install method to avoid most bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I would like to report all the issues and limitations I found anyway so far for MS to fix them as soon as possible (many of those hopefully before 29th of July).</p>

Very Windows 7-Style and annoying, never seen something like that in 8/8.1;</strong></li><li><strong
<p>Plus:</p>

</p><ul>
<li>Full Screen/Immersive Edge is missing (auto-hiding and animated menu bar / address / favourites&nbsp;bar while scrolling + Swipe Back/Forward like Metro.IE11);</li><li>Official support of TPLs (Tracking Protection Lists) inside Edge settings pane (manual hack doesn't work anymore);</li><li>Better Multi-Display support (Tablet Mode on one display, Desktop on another for example);</li><li>3+ Snappable Apps in Tablet mode.</li></ul>
<p>Plus:</p>

<ul>
<li>8.1 Start Screen will not transfer over to Windows 10. Not only does 10 make no effort to import my Start Screen, it no longer supports key features of it:&nbsp;<br />
* Tile sets are limited to 1 large and 1 medium tile wide. Some of my groups are 3 large tiles wide<br />
* Web site live tiles no longer show live RSS content consistently - some sites work, others don't<br />
* Start backgrounds are no longer supported<br />
* Start colors are not customizable -- they follow the accent color</li><li>In tablet mode, opening a new app when two others are snapped erases the snap relationship requiring the user to re-snap apps (i.e. the app opens full screen instead of asking for a target pane like in 8.1).</li><li>Resizable snap is only available in Tablet mode, and Tablet mode is not available when using multiple monitors</li><li>Resizable snap and resizable desktop windows are now mutually exclusive. Allow option to resize desktop apps in tablet mode.</li><li>8.1 allowed snapping from the task list but the task view that replaces it does not allow snapping. Snapping is also impossible from the task bar.</li><li>In Tablet mode, snap is limited to two panes per monitor -- down from four in 8.1</li></ul>

            With some of the earlier builds I was able to resize the start menu after removing apps or putting into two columns. However with Build 10240 I cannot resize the start menu after removing some apps or moving into two columns instead of three. &nbsp;I did send
 feedback to Microsoft on this behavior.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few of us on windows insider are having a problem, on update/settings, as you know, the following options were present until recently,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>defer upgrades box unchecked,</p>
<p>
</p><p>there was an option of slow or fast, now gone, instead there is a Fix me box,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you click on update, popup flashes, windows insider needs attention, click on fix me, it say stop builds confirm/ cancel I always cancel it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is a recent issue, tried setting up local account, ok for a while, then reverted back to fix me, quite a few users like myself have tried with the registry, that to reverts back, HK&nbsp;Local machine, Software, Microsoft, WindowsSelfHost, Applicability,
 could it be to do with 10240 being the RTM build, if this makes sense.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 - what a fiasco, after all, Microsoft abandon us.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Nokia 1020 at the time, a high end mobile after reading the following promise from Microsoft - that no device would go without support. &nbsp;This phone cost a small fortune, back here in Brazil.</p>
<p>Well, I am an insider and had the Win 10 preview first hand, a nicer and more effective version of Windows, which caused problems only to my camera, making it too slow or blurred, but the OS was compensating all the trouble anyway, new apps and good integration
 with social networks. &nbsp;One year later, I reseted my phone and Microsoft denied the Win 10 for my mobile, and now I'm having all sorts of trouble with this **** piece of expensive tech. &nbsp;My Instagram crashes, my phone is not recognized by my PC and the troubles
 goes on and on... &nbsp;...I sincerely will not stop bothering MS, basically because they own us some explanation - I was not feeding the Insider program with feedback only to be punished later on, I was sending those info in order for those M***F***** to FIX the
 damn issues !!! &nbsp;So, I felt betrayed and now I have a mobile that I wish I never had bought in first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS did exactly the thing that Nokia did in the past, and left us with an older OS with no support whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I had bought an Android device, at least, a Nexus would have received the latest OS upgrade until now, If I have bought the one I intended. &nbsp; Our phones, at least here in Brazil, are the most expensive ones in the world (yes, we pay double price than
 US at least) and we take this issue very seriously, this phone cost me 5% of the price of my car !! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, If anyone feel as disappointed as I am now, please, let them know about it. &nbsp;Cheers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you had bought a Nexus at the same time as the 1020 (the nexus 5?), chances are you wouldn't be getting any more updates either.</p>

            <p>I own also an 1020 and I hate to say it, but a 950 or 950XL are the better camera phones in direct comparision with the (old)1020.</p>
<p>The 1020 has old hardware, it's been arround for many years now. I got mine&nbsp; in&nbsp; early june 2013 before the official release date in july the same year</p>
<p>The 950 and 950XL have better hardware. but that not strange, they could evolve and modify and improve the hardware.</p>
<p>And even with only 20 MP the picture and video quality is better with the 950 range.</p>
<p>And I'm still lucky in a way (not totaly)that I got my 1020 still running the TH1 build 10.586.545. This build is/was the final build that got released for this phone in the insider program, just before the insider program changed</p>
<p>But It runs better with windows phone 8.1. Windows 10 mobile is not as snappy and fun to use on a daily base with an 1020. (dredded loading.... screen pops up a lot)
</p>
<p>It's just not a happy phone with windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>I fully understand that Microsoft excluded some phones. Those phones are not happy with Windows 10 mobile</p>

    <title>Problem changing the primary alias. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> himanshuprasad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem changing the primary alias.</h2>
                    I actually thought a live support might work better for this problem, but the "Microsoft account" link in the live help section doesn't work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well, here's the story. MS launched a service named CoolHotmail around 2007 or so. It provided many domain names to choose from for your email. I registered an account using the domain "iamcrazy.in". So, I have got an account &lt;nickname&gt;@iamcrazy.in. I
 thought it was cool, as a kid, but I don't like it so much anymore. You guys recently launched Outlook, and I upgraded my account. I was able to get &lt;first name&gt;@outlook.in. The problem now is that I can't use it as my primary alias. Earlier, I simply used
 to get a message that "The primary alias associated with this Microsoft account can't be changed". But, I recently read that you guys fixed it so that everyone can rename their primary alias. But now, I get this message, "Your organization's policies prevent
 you from changing your primary alias." But there is no organization, it was a private mail. I guess the weird domain is causing the problems. Can you guys fix it your end? I will be very grateful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, please don't suggest that I can log in using any alias now, because I already know that and that's what I used on my Windows Phone. But, not logging in with your primary alias causes problems, like I wasn't able to use FB chat in the Messaging application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. : I don't wanna provide the emails here, just contact me privately.</div>

    <title>a &#34;skypex&#34; from windows phone skype is showing up as an online - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayw09  say:</h3>
<h2>            a &#34;skypex&#34; from windows phone skype is showing up as an online endpoint</h2>
                    When using the /showplaces command, I see the 2 devices I know I am logged in on, and a "skypex" (Windows Phone Skype) which I am unsure of what it is and why it is showing up. This is a new Skype account with a completely new password (my old one had
 some people on my contact list who I did NOT add somehow). I am also running on a fresh install of windows 10, so I know there is no harmful programs going that could have gotten a hold of my password. I am thinking maybe it has something to do with maybe
 the website logging Skype in, or possibly the newest update for the Skype mobile app showing a 2nd online endpoint aside from its actual device? I have changed my password again and even attempted to use /remotelogout but it seems to still remain. I have looked
 around and have had no luck of finding any other thread or discussion of someone having a similar issue so I'm hoping someone here can give me some insight and help me here. Thank you in advanced for any assistance!

<p>Let me know how things go for you! You can try this trick to get into advanced Startup!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC isnâ€™t loading Windows 10 and you donâ€™t have the operating system installation files, you can use the following trick.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer and follow the POST, when Windows should begin loading, press the power button to shutdown your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat the previous step twice, and in the third restart the operating system should enter into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), where a number of diagnostics will be performed to try fix any booting issues, but you will also get an option
 to access the Windows Startup Settings</p>
</li></ol>

<h2>            SharePoint files stuck in upload centre</h2>
                    <p>We have a number of users who regularly have issues with files being apparently stuck in the upload centre.&nbsp; Is there a known issue/way to resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get the need to sign in error, sometimes just the file failed to upload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is generally on Windows 10. At least on 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive should not be a part of the picture as the user is unable to sync the libraries involved (something we force).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that on my computer at least, I have the O2013 upload centre and the O2016 one. I have not found a way to remove the O2013 version of the product without removing the Office product that is installed (which I don't want to do).</p>

<p><span>Hi Tanya,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your description, it seems that you donâ€™t use the OneDrive sync client to sync files and you have Office 2013 and Office 2016 installed in your environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If yes, first I suggest you check if there are some antivirus software and third-party software when you upload the files. If yes, close them and do a test again to see the result. Meanwhile, you can also try the steps in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/microsoft-office-upload-center-f08161d9-ab64-4486-af69-7cd30b34df71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a> to clear document cache to see the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, to clarify the environment you are in and the reproducing steps of the issue you are experiencing, Iâ€™d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. How do you upload the files to SharePoint Online if you donâ€™t use the OneDrive sync client? What files do you update, Office 2013 files and Office 2016 files? What Upload Center are affected by the issue? Could you list the detailed reproducing
 steps?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Upload screenshots of the Account pages in the Office 2013 applications and the Office 2016 applications you have installed.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Remove any private information before uploading the screenshots.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have OneDrive installed and running, but we don't allow users to synchronise these particular libraries. The only antivirus software we use is the Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues we are having are only with Office 2016 documents (Word and Excel). We either open files directly from SharePoint and then save them when we are done. If we aren't doing that, we open the file from the recent files list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for which upload centre - I cannot tell which one I am running as the UI looks the same whichever version I click on. I haven't been able to find a way to see the version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, I have been unable to pin down an exact sequence of events that guarantees the outcome - I'm still working on this.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ec23ed-08b7-47f7-93aa-305211715a3d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ec23ed-08b7-47f7-93aa-305211715a3d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image is from my version. I have asked another user to also provide this information and they won't be on the Targeted channel. I see that I have updates to run this morning, so I will do that now also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the other users having issues has 16.0.8431.2270 as version for Word.</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Tanya,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you donâ€™t allow users to sync the libraries with the new OneDrive sync client, does the issue only happen when you open the files from the libraries in SharePoint Online with the
 Office 2016 applications and save them? </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify the reproducing steps of the issue in your environment, Iâ€™d like you to record a video showing the issue in
</span><span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, please confirm whether you have installed other versions of the Office applications on your computer. If yes, I suggest you remove them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>So we still don't have a video showing the issue, but we do have a series of images that capture inconsistencies in the data today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file ending in 2018007 was copied from the file 20180410 yesterday and saved as this new name. This image shows explorer view of it - where the modification date is incorrect.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/682ae293-b632-4655-a942-a7c810b89f1f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/682ae293-b632-4655-a942-a7c810b89f1f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This image is the view of the file as far as SharePoint is concerned...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ffc3a3b-a31d-4cee-ba99-cc0de5974646?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ffc3a3b-a31d-4cee-ba99-cc0de5974646?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This file is not in the Upload cache</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0a4c975-4a65-4711-aeef-b95620e59415?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0a4c975-4a65-4711-aeef-b95620e59415?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The upload Centre is configured to remove cached files after 7 days and to delete cached files when the file is closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why there is an inconsistency in the data, but it did make the user think that the file had not been saved correctly to SharePoint and he redid the work again.</p>

<p><span>As two files can</span><span>â€™</span><span>t
 be synced successfully in your environment, could you manually clear the cache in the Upload Center, remove the two affected files from the OneDrive sync folder and then re-add them to it to see if the issue goes away?</span></p>

<p>So i have followed the following post to update the hidden multi line of text field this will intern update the taxonomy field.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aerieconsulting.com/blog/update-using-rest-to-update-a-multi-value-taxonomy-field-in-sharepoint?success=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.aerieconsulting.com/blog/update-using-rest-to-update-a-multi-value-taxonomy-field-in-sharepoint?success=true</a></p>

    <title>Format Painter &#38; Styles in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robg..  say:</h3>
<h2>            Format Painter &#38; Styles in Word 2013</h2>
                    Format Painter &amp; Styles have gone wonky. Anybody know why it does not simply copy &amp; apply formatting anymore? Example: original text is Calibri 11pt blue underline, but when I select text (whether single letter or whole word), hit Format Painter and select
 target text, it applies Times New Roman 22pt Bold blue underline. &nbsp;Checked Style, which is something completely different. &nbsp;Tried selecting original text and updating a style, and it actually changed the selected text instead of updating the Style. &nbsp;Tried
 creating new Style and it A) did not capture all elements (left out blue and underline) and applied different elements (still bold). &nbsp;Tried modifying an existing Style - and it still applied Bold even though that's not in the style. &nbsp;Apparently, I'm doing
 something wrong, but what?

            <p>If the paragraph whose formatting you are trying to copy has a lot of direct formatting applied to it, the result when pasting formatting may be difficult to predict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you are modifying a style, if you do so via the Modify Style dialog box, you can then revert the text paragraph to the formatting of the style: Press Ctrl+Q to clear paragraph level formatting not in style, and press Ctrl+SpaceBar to clear font
 formatting not in style.</p>

<h3> electrojim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inconsistent Word table borders - can&#39;t set a &#39;global&#39; line width.</h2>
                    <p>This problem pertains to Word for Office 2007 running under Windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a table that's about the size of a letter sheet.&nbsp; There are six rows and two primary columns, but I have split some columns to create a total of about 18 cells.&nbsp; The outside border is continuous.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to apply a 3/4-point weight to the inside and outside borders (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A</span>ll Borders), not all of them change.&nbsp; Some go to 3/4-point, but others remain at what looks like the 1/2-point default value.&nbsp; Even
 if I go into one section of the table and specify, say, a horizontal inside border line, and try to make it 3/4-point, it will not go to 3/4-point.&nbsp; Print Preview and actual printing-out confirm what I see on the screen.&nbsp; The only thing I am able to do is
 to give the entire table a 1/2-point border weight to be consistent, but I really want them all to be bolder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can easily invoke No Border, and that works.&nbsp; It's just trying to go to a border point size other than 1/2-point that doesn't function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've worked with tables for years and have never had this problem before.</p>

            <p>I am not sure that I can tell the difference between 3/4 point and 1/2 point, but using a 6pt border here to test, I find that if I apply such a border to the table before splitting any cells, when I do later split cells, the border that result from the
 split automatically inherits the border that was applied to the whole table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I would suggest that if you want uniform borders, you should apply the required width of border before splitting the cells.</p>

</p><p>Those cells are full of text now, of course, all meticulously positioned and justified, with graphics , etc., etc.&nbsp; However, I may be able to create an empty table along the lines of the one I have and simply paste my work in there.&nbsp; Wish me luck.</p>

            Well, well.&nbsp; On a whim, I put my .docx on a flash drive and plugged it into my wife's Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; I was able to highlight the entire table and set the line width to 3/4 point.&nbsp; Looks fine now on my Vista machine.&nbsp; Perhaps an unadvertised bug fix
 between Office 2007 and Office 2010?&nbsp; I'm happy.<br />

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Try opening word in safe mode.
<br />
<br />Windows + R, then type winword /safe
<br />
<br />Disable the addins
<br />

<br />
<br />And try opening word in normal mode again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work perform an Office repair

            Your description suggests that <strong>Save</strong> is the default action for double-clicking Word icons; normally, the default should be
<strong>Open</strong>. See if repairing Office fixes the problem (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</a>).

<p>The Office Compatibility pack was released for older versions; it is no longer needed in Office 2007 or later, so you can safely uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An online repair often results in Office being uninstalled. If it doesn't reinstall automatically, you will have to do so manually. The exact steps depend on the specific version of Office that you have installed. For Office 365 Home, make use of your account

<p>I resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, an update to Office 365 changed the default format of the documents to .rtf from .docx, this meant that when I double clicked a .docx, there was some issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set the default action of opening a .docx to open with Office 365 and now it works</p>

            Which option did you change, specifically? The default save format (which you can specify at File | Options | Save) does not affect how Word handles double-clicking *.docx files.<br />

<h2>            Problems running Office 2013 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've used Office 2013 for the past two years. I was a little afraid after Office 2007, but learned to enjoy 2013. Even though 98 is my fav!!!! Then, comes along WINDOWS 10. You open a WORD project and you can't use it! Its all messed up so you wouldn't want
 to use it anyway. Now my EXCEL seems fine, SEEMS the key word!!!! But I am really miffed about my WORD programs. I use them for different things in my life. Everything from writing to friends, to doing my re-orders for my ****, to copying word search puzzles
 for my mother. And now I can't do anything!!!!! ****!!!!! I don't want my stuff up in the cloud. I want it on my Desktop. I don't even know how to use the cloud or want to use the&nbsp;cloud!!! I don't know what you people did to Office &nbsp;2013, but you ruined it.
 REALLY WELL! Is there a fix? Do I need to remove WINDOWS 10 and go back to 8.1? WHAT??????????????</p>
<p>

</p><p>OK, you are Miffed. Not unreasonable ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for a little more information please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly which Office 2013 bundle do you have?&nbsp; One of the common Office 365 bundles, or one of the uncommon Office 2013 bundles<br />
</p>
<p>When you open a Word document, what "<strong>it</strong>" is messed up?&nbsp; Is there something wrong with the way Word looks, or is there something wrong with the document?&nbsp; Please describe the problem in more detail.&nbsp; What is "wrong"?&nbsp; Is the problem with
 all documents, or only some?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you say excell SEEMS to be OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use the cloud, you don't have to.&nbsp; MS has things set up to default to it, but you can change that relatively easily.</p>

<strong>Disabling access to Microsoft SkyDrive</strong>
<p>As you probably know by now, Office 2013 is tightly integrated with <a href="http://searchconsumerization.techtarget.com/news/2240111518/Microsoft-SkyDrive-changes-target-Dropbox-Google-News-in-brief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft SkyDrive</a>. In fact, selecting <code><span>File &gt; Save As</span></code> in any Office 2013 application shows SkyDrive as the first entry in its list of file locations, even before â€œComputer.â€ Because users log in to Office
 with a Microsoft account, the related SkyDrive is always available, too, as long as an Internet connection is available.</p>
<p>But some shops donâ€™t want files saved outside of the safe perimeter of in-house servers and storage, so you can untether Office 2013 from SkyDrive partially or totally.</p>
<p>To simply make SkyDrive less prominent, select <code><span>File &gt; Options
</span></code>and click <code><span>Save</span></code> in the left pane. There are three options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t show the Backstage view when opening or saving files.</strong> Checking this option doesnâ€™t actually prevent Backstage from appearing, which is where the SkyDrive location appears. Instead, after selecting this option, the Save As dialog box
 appears after a user presses Ctrl+S, selects <code><span>File &gt; Save</span></code>, or clicks the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar to save a new document. The same principle applies with the
<code><span>Open</span></code> command.</li><li><strong>Show additional places for saving, even if sign-in may be required. </strong>
Uncheck this option.</li><li><strong>Save to Computer by default.</strong> Check this option if you want users to save to the local computer by default.</li><li><strong>"Default File Location"</strong>.&nbsp; Set it to your "desktop" or "my documents".&nbsp; Personally, I would avoid using the desktop for everything, but that is your choice.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When you change these settings in one Office 2013 application, those changes apply to all Office 2013 products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable access to SkyDrive, one method is to edit the Windows Registry. Be sure to back up the Registry first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Registry Editor (enter <code><span>regedit</span></code> in the Run dialog box). In the editor, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\SignIn key. Right-click a blank area in the main pane on
 the right, select New &gt; DWORD, and name it SignInOptions. Then, double-click the SignInOptions entry and set its value to 3.</p>

<p>
</p><p>*********************</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rolling back from Windows 10 is certainly an option if nothing else works for you.&nbsp; MS will continue to support Win 8.1 for several more years.&nbsp; For people who have severe problems running applications after the switch (I won't call it an upgrade) to Win
 10, the ultimate fix may be to back out of Win 10.&nbsp; At least until MS has had time to experiment with fixes on other peoples computers and Win 10 becomes more 'stable'.</p>

<p>The changes should reflect if you are using the Outlook.com calendar. The Lotus Notes is a third-party app and there might be some feature in it that might cause the syncing issue if you reprogram the shared calendar in Lotus Notes.<br />

<p>We would like to clarify if you have tried to check the link provided in our previous post. You will know more information in that article and how shared calendar works on Outlook for Android.</p>

<h2>            Updating a legacy calendar invite &#40;from someone else&#41; to change the recurrence info for me only</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2010 x32&nbsp;on Win7x64</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have some recurring meetings that were sent out by someone who left the company. I'd like to remove it from my calendar going forward, but retain the history (the meetings that actually did occur) for audit purposes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I didn't create the meeting invite, there isn't a user-friendly way for me to edit just my copy of the meeting, and end the recurrences
</p>
<p>as of that person's departure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are&nbsp;there any&nbsp;arcane tricks that would allow me to remove the future recurrences? This meeting&nbsp;does not appear to have an end date, so I'm hoping for a better answer than "just go delete all the individual instances one at a time".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mbew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender will re-enable itself, only&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span> you have uninstalled McAfee. And you&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should</span> run McAfee's removal tool&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span>
 uninstalling McAfee. The removal tool cleans up remnants missed when uninstalling the program. Failure to do this may cause problems with Windows Defender. You can download the removal tool (MCPR) at the following location.&nbsp;
