    <title>Please, FOR HEAVEN&#39;S SAKE, provide music equalizer for Lumia 800 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Please, FOR HEAVEN&#39;S SAKE, provide music equalizer for Lumia 800</h2>
                    
<p>This is an issue regarding the 'Nokia Music' application. I just got my Windows 7.5 phone updated to Windows 7.8 at a Nokia Care center. But I realized that even now there is no option for equalizer in Nokia Music. This is highly disappointing. Since the
 Windows 7.8 update isn't officially out yet, is there any chance that when it is officially released, the Nokia Music application is updated to include an equalizer? Without equalizer, the music sounds pathetic. There have been loads of requests on the Nokia
 forums to include an equalizer in the Nokia Music application for Lumia phones since the time Lumia 800 was released. People higly anticipated an equalizer in the 7.8 update, but it was never included. This shows that Nokia isn't bothered about even very basic
 customer requirements such as an equalizer. An equalizer for music playback is a very basic feature which even 5 year old phones have. Even other vendors provide their own equalizer application for use on their Windows phones. Its not at all difficult to include
 an equalizer in your 'Nokia Music' app. I mainly use my phone for music playback, and the lack of an equalizer on my Lumia 800 is VERY VERY disappointing due to poor quality of music playback. I'm sorry to say this, but I will NEVER recommend a Windows based
 Nokia phone to anyone due to very poor music quality, which is a direct result of an equalizer not being included. I agree that you're including an equalizer for Windows Phone 8, but it doesn't mean you have to abandon your Windows 7 users who have been waiting
 for a simple feature such as an equalizer since more than 18 months. I have used EXCLUSIVELY Nokia products since 10 years because of the faith I had in Nokia. But I'm sorry to say that this Lumia 800 will surely be the last Nokia product I would have purchased.
 You have lost a long time and sincere customer. No wonder Nokia's sales and revenue have plummeted over the past year. If you people can't provide even a basic feature such as a music equalizer in your phones, people are not going to buy your products. And
 you are not at all bothered about the feedback which people have been giving since more than a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sincere request - PLEASE, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, include an equalizer for Windows Phone 7.8 in your next update for the Nokia Music application. Or else, please recommend me any third party application or music player which supports equalizer. If this is
 not possible, at least provide some app for increasing the bass output. Don't say that I have poor quality headphones. I have high end headphones which produces excellent bass when connected to my PC or my old Nokia X6 phone. I don't mind paying for that application.
 This will surely restore my faith in Nokia as a brand. Please take this as constructive critisism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>

            @jimmyireland I very well know that its included in Windows Phone 8. I'm requesting it to be provided for Windows Phone 7.8, because its a very basic feature. You're saying its unknown if this will be included in 7.8 update, but I already have the answer
 to that. Its NOT been included, which is a huge disappointment.

<p>@ funkyzoom,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Are you sure that the poor audio quality isn't more to do with the quality of the music files you are listening to rather than the phone's audio quality? Properly ripped music tracks from original CDs etc ought to sound perfectly fine without the need to
 artificially enhace the audio using an equalizer.</p>

<p>@ rayhipkiss and jimmyireland I<br />
ts not the question of quality of music tracks. The same tracks sound perfect on my PC and also my old Nokia X6. In any case there is no excuse for not including a very basic feature such as an equalizer, even after almost 18 months of the first Lumia phone
 being released especially since Lumia phones are mid to high end. Now my Lumia 800 might be considered a 'low-end' phone, but at the time of release it was indeed a premium phone with premium pricing. It is taken for granted that phones in that price bracket
 ought to include an equalizer for music playback.</p>

<p>Frankly I don't think a graphic equalizer will solve your problem of lack of bass. Check out GSMArena review for Lumia 800 frequency response chart and you can see a deep valley where the bass should be. The graphic equalizer is to fine tune music to your
 taste, not put back bass where there isn't any.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest update. I think Nokia has addressed the bass issue on one of the updates.</p>

<p>I find no issue with (deep) bass reproduction on my Lumia 800. Using a pair of everyday but a bit more expensive Sony earbuds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As indicated several times using high impendance headsets will influence sound quality for obvious reasons including frequency response.</p>

            @KennyKB and paulheu<br />
I do have the latest update. I realized that the bass is reproduced only for mp3 songs with very high bit rate of 320kbps or slightly lower. Considering that this phone doesn't have the option of extending the memory, it makes no sense to store only very high
 bit rate mp3s because it occupies too much space. And yeah, I do have excellent quality JBL headphones. The headset provided with the phone (WH-902) produces ZERO bass even for 320kbps mps files. No use. It was my mistake that I bought this phone without doing
 much research, since I use my phone more for music than calls. Windows Phone 8 is greatly improved, but I'm not in a position to afford another phone for the next 2 years. So I'm stuck with this piece of **bleep**. My only option now is to use this stupid
 phone for everything else except music, and use my old Nokia X6 only for listening to music, because it offers excellent music output even for 128kbps music files.

<h2>            Document hyperlinks not working properly in MS Excel for Mac 15.19.1</h2>
                    <p>Having happily created document hyperlinks within earlier versions of Excel (on a number of different platforms), I'm now having problems getting a simple link to either a PDF or Word document to work as it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having created and clicked the hyperlink, Excel returns the error message "Alert. Cannot open the specified file" "Grant file access. Whilst granting the required access to a Word document subsequently validates and activates the link to work on subsequent
 clicks (albeit in a slow and clumsy fashion), granting access to a linked PDF forces me to choose between "Convert file from.. " any number of irrelevant document formats, including Unicode, Text only, RTF, etc. i.e., there is no PDF option shown at all at
 this point. To complicate matters further, Excel seems to issue occasional messages to say "Office is still updating linked or embedded objects for this workbook. OK"
<br />
<br />
Question#1. When did it get so complicated to create a simple document link to PDF or Word?
<br />
Question#2. If anyone could post a workaround for this, I'd be most grateful. Thx.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Mac Version of Office has never worked like it&nbsp;should with Acrobat (PDF). In recent years, Acrobat has improved somewhat URL recognition. URLs created by the Auto-correct system in Office does work if you use the Adobe PDF engine installed, by the installation
 of Reader or Acrobat. But if you used the URL Manager where you select a word then use the URL manager to create a URL. It still doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            OneDrive Known Folder Move creates folders in non-english language</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to use KFM for a few customers. The feature work perfect.</p>
<p>Now I have a Swedish customer with an office in France. All the users in France get the swedish names for the folder desktop, documents and pictures.</p>
<p>Everything on the PC is english, Windows and Office but still it uses the swedish folder names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really need to use english standard names, and have the explorer use localized folder names just like explorer does using desktop.ini.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to force english names?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Olof</p>

</p><p>Here is the screenshot. You can see in the left part, the Swedish names. Bilder = Pictures, Dokument = Documents and Skrivbordet = Desktop.</p>
<p>To the right, the OneDrive KFM is protecting these folders.</p>
<p>I do not know the settings for the tenant or my user account, but I want to force the use of English folder names.</p>

            <p>The agent was trying to get you to uncheck which option?</p>
<p>If you could archive, yes it would relieve the "pressure" on your mailbox.&nbsp; Outlook's archive function doesn't work with IMAP however.</p>
<p>You have a couple of choices.&nbsp; Since an&nbsp;IMAP data file cannot be the default data file, you will already have a local data file containing your Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, and other default folders.&nbsp; You can copy your Charter data to that data file
 or you can create a new one specifically for the purpose of containing the older Charter messages.</p>
<p>To make the new data file, click New Items&gt;More Items&gt;Outlook Data File.&nbsp; You can allow the new data file to reside in the folder where Outlook creates data files by default (Documents\Outlook Files) or you can change its location to any folder you want.&nbsp;
 I'd use the default folder.&nbsp; You can accept the file name Outlook wants to choose or you can pick another.&nbsp; I'd pick one that reflects the purpose of the data file, like "Charter Archive.pst".&nbsp; Click OK and the data file will be added to your Navigation Pane.</p>
<p>Now, whether you want to use your existing non-IMAP data file or the new one, in that data file, create a folder whose name matches the name of one of your folders that also appears in your Charter folder tree.&nbsp; RIght-click the root of the data file and
 choose New Folder.&nbsp; Specify the name that matches the IMAP folder you want to save and press Enter.&nbsp; Now, click the IMAP folder you want to save so that it opens and you see all the messages it contains.&nbsp; Select the messages that you want to move off the server.&nbsp;
 Ctrl+A will select them all.&nbsp; Now, drag that selection to the corresponding folder you created in the data file and release the mouse button.&nbsp; Outlook will copy the selected messages from the IMAP server to that folder and then delete them from the server.&nbsp;
 If you wish, hold Ctrl while you drag the selection to make it a copy instead of a move so you can verify all of the messages have been copied prior to deleting the messages from the server.</p>
<p>Continue in this fashion until you've moved all of the messages you wish to keep but clear from the server.&nbsp; You'll have your messages, but they won't take up space on the server.&nbsp; You'll be able to see them only in Outlook and not if you log into the mailbox
 using a web browser.&nbsp; Since you're running out of space, this is what you want anyway.</p>
<p>An alternative to all of this is to create yourself a Google Mail IMAP or Hotmail account using the Outlook Hotmail Connector.&nbsp; Then, instead of moving your messages to a local data file, you can store them in the cloud in either Hotmail or Google Mail.&nbsp;
 The transfer process is nearly the same.</p>

            <p>You'll need to reregister Word 2010 explicitly, using the full file path. By default (for 32-bit Office 2010), this will be C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\OFFICE14\WINWORD.EXE. To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> to open the Run box.</li><li>In the box, paste the full path to the Office 14 version of Winword.exe (as above).</li><li>Type quotes around the path and add the /r switch, resulting in<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\OFFICE14\WINWORD.EXE" /r</li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>. You'll get a message that Windows is reconfiguring.</li></ol>

            <p>Reregistering Word should have no effect on Excel. You can reregister Excel similarly, however; in that case the command is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\OFFICE14\EXCEL.EXE" /regserver.</p>
<p>

                    I am helping a neighbor set up a new laptop, (Toshiba Satellite S855) Windows 8 OS. Toshiba provided Norton with the unit, but we are not keen on using that.&nbsp; I have a Vista laptop and Windows Defender seemed like good software.&nbsp; Then is Windows 7 Microsoft
 Security Essentials came along and I am using it now, on my desktop, but in Windows 8 it looks like Windows Defender is back again and WSE is not being touted so much.&nbsp; What do you guys think?--I'm very confused.

I'd use Windows Defender which is part of the W8 operating System.<br />
<br />
<div><a href="http://securitygarden.blogspot.com/2012/04/understanding-microsoft-anti-malware.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://securitygarden.blogspot.com/2012/04/understanding-microsoft-anti-malware.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>You cannot use Windows Defender <strong>and</strong> a third party antimalware program such as Norton on Win 8.&nbsp; Windows Defender (which is&nbsp;part of the Windows 8 operating system) will be&nbsp;disabled while Norton is installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>If you wish to use Windows Defender you need to turn off Norton and uninstall Norton from Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then run the Norton Removal Tool: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home</span></span></a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Once Norton is completely removed you should be able to access Windows Defender and confirm that Windows Defender has been enabled.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards...</div>

<p>See dates displayed in above filter. There are 75,000 rows in the source worksheet and I have confirmed that "Month" field is formatted as date (Alt-D-E - Delimited and Date) and formatted number as date. Any ideas on why not all of the Months are displayed?</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for your kind response. I don't take much time to read those information in detail. There are Nokia APPs available, that is the "Nokia Storyteller Beta". I found it can list those pictures without duplication. The only problem is it can't
 &nbsp;collect those pictures such as snapshot photos from my phone's screen. So I wish it could solve the issue soon. Some suggestion and wish.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>

<p>I strongly suggest those who have the same problem mentioned before to upgrade their phone's software to Windows* Phone 8.1 (as attached for reference). Because the "getting duplicate pictures in camera roll and in other albums"s problem has been fixed.</p>

            Yes, upgrading to wp 8.1 would solve the issue... I too had this problem in Lumia 720 with wp 8.

Libre Office</a>...</p>

<h2>            Light box buttons not working in IE11, for me</h2>
                    <p>I have two forms on our website that have Lightbox buttons. I cannot get them to work on my PC using IE-11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others using IE-11 don't have the same problem. I have reset, check script setting is enabled and still no luck.</p>
<p>All my other browsers work fine, what am I missing? It works fine on MS Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the urls: Click on <strong>form</strong> button to see lightbox form.</p>

<p>One thing is weird which is you already reset browser and doing so would back setting to default and it should&nbsp;turn off tracking protection.</p>

    <title>Paste into list without formatting for MS Word for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanboling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paste into list without formatting for MS Word for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I have to paste text from emails and website into Word documents dozens of times per day. I recently discovered how to set a keyboard shortcut on my Mac to paste and match formatting. It works, but now whenever I try to paste something into a numbered list
 (which is pretty much all that I do), it messes up the list. I'm not trying to start a new item, just paste text within that item. I undid all the keyboard shortcuts thinking that messed something up, but it still doesn't work. So, now my job is HARDER than
 it was before. I did figure out that I can use Paste special and it works fine. However, this is still many more clicks and then I have to select plain text. Is there a way to make this easier? It seems like a simple thing but I'm getting incredibly frustrated
 at how hard it seems to be. I literally do this one thing dozens and dozen of times per day and it's making my work so much harder.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Still Having Outlook Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yok33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Still Having Outlook Problems</h2>
                    <p>I am still having major Outlook 2016 problems.&nbsp; Now, all of a sudden today, I am not receiving any emails.&nbsp; When I activate the "Send/Receive" button in the upper left corner, Outlook starts the process.&nbsp; However, after quite a while it has not finished
 or done anything.&nbsp; So when I click on the "Send/Receive" progress button, it shows a few of the exact same email "processing", but none of them ever finish.&nbsp; Her is a pic of the details screen and what I am talking about.&nbsp; I have also included some other snapshots
 of settings and such for my email account.&nbsp; Please someone let me know ASAP if they have a solution to this dilemma so that I can get my emails.&nbsp; Also, the very last image below shows exactly what version I am using.</p>

<p>Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp; I believe I have narrowed down the problem but do not have the expertise to solve the problem.&nbsp; I was able to finally get access to Hotmail.com using Firefox -- I received all incoming messages but the format is entirely different
 from what I was receiving using IE.&nbsp; Now I see in the upper right of the list four small icons to trash, mail, pin, etc.&nbsp; Getting to this link is difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Office Professional Plus 2016 and I believe Windows 10.&nbsp; Miscrosoft was doing its automatic upgrade when this change occurred.&nbsp; For a bit of time a dashboard came on the screen showing the speed of Explorer, Edge and Chrome -- Edge was clearly a step
 up in speed but after a try it disappeared -- and I do not know how to install Edge over Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Thanks for you advise.</p>

            Yes, since it only happens on Edge, then it's likely to be fixed by following the above steps to refresh your browser.

    <title>&#39;Default Sharepoint List&#39; group policy not working in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameshoward2769  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Default Sharepoint List&#39; group policy not working in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone offer any suggestion as to why the publishing of an stssync URL through the above group policy setting doesn't seem to work with Outlook 2016? I previously deployed a calendar to staff last year, which worked with no issue. Since last year, the
 only thing I think that has changed, is an Office upgrade, from 2013 to 2016. Cannot get the calendar to deploy to Outlook at all. Group Policy permissions are all correct, and the stssync URL itself is good - I can place the URL in a shortcut, and the prompt
 to add the calendar is displayed in Outlook. However, I need to deploy the calendar without user interaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions welcomed.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            transferring windows live mail contacts to microsoft outlook</h2>
                    I had had several times where I had to transfer contacts to Windows Live Mail to Microsoft Office.&nbsp; All I could do is create CSV files and import them into Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; Is there a way to copy them into the address book?&nbsp; So that when someone send
 out an email the to: goes into the contacts.&nbsp; Am I correct that WLM is no longer supported.&nbsp; Maybe I missed a step.&nbsp; Seems like both WLM and Outlook are both Microsoft.&nbsp; Maybe I'm doing it wrong, if so tell me the correct way.

<p>Maybe I wasn't clear about my issue.&nbsp; The cvs file was imported into the outlook, but for some reason, it never went into the contact folder.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.&nbsp; The contacts do show up, however when I sent out an email, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what would correct this.&nbsp; I copied the csv file to the desktop.&nbsp; I could print out the csv file and add the contacts manually.&nbsp; However if there is a faster way, I want to do it.</p>

            I just want to update my question.&nbsp; I redid the csv file and reimported into outlook 2013.&nbsp; The problem was that it was searching from other columns instead of name.&nbsp; That was an easy fix.

<h2>            Lenovo crashes while installing when OS &#62; 9926</h2>
                    <p>The W520 crashes during the install so there is no dump. The crash implies that it has found a device and cannot find a driver for it which is understable because a complex laptop has lot of devices like a smart card reader(??) and a power management system.
 I cannot disconnect the devices. It's not unlike this:</p>

</p><p>I'm not going to refresh my PC and reinstall all my applications. &nbsp;This is a profile problem, not a system problem. &nbsp;The boffins at Microsoft should have an answer for this. &nbsp;It's happened to too many people with this build so far while modifying the Start

            It's more than a profile issue. More likely permissions or cache corruption with the modern apps somewhere. I tried creating a new local admin account and it still had the problem.

<p>The auto start feature appears to be gone, however the biggie is that you cannot set the ringer to work from separate from the output device as you could previously on the desktop software</p>
