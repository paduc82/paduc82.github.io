<h2>            OneNote not working without internet connection</h2>
                    <p>I am usually able to use OneNote App on my Surface Pro 3 without an internet connection.&nbsp; Sometimes (like today!!) it will not let me open OneNote.&nbsp; The box on the screen says There was a problem signing you in.&nbsp; Check your connection and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most times however I am able to have it work without an internet connection.&nbsp; Why does this happen sometimes and what can I do about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi Dennis,<br />
<br />
Let's isolate the issue by connecting your Surface device to Internet and try to login using your Microsoft account when prompted. Once your online, go to
<strong>File menu</strong>, select <strong>Sync</strong>, and then click <strong>
Work Offline</strong>.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>No, that's really not an acceptable solution - in fact, it's a huge step backwards from what we've been told is possible and what we've been encouraged to do.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 4 with docking stations - I just undock and go, and re-dock when I arrive
 at my destination.&nbsp; I do this many times a day.&nbsp; Setting OneNote to Work Offline (and then online again, later) everytime I move is completely unacceptable.&nbsp; Heck, for that matter, if I've got to do that, I'd rather just turn off automatic syncing and do it
 manually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, at least half the problems I have with syncing are due to OneNote fighting with itself and corrupting things - I'm talking about the fact that the OneNote app (which is far more pen/touch friendly than the desktop version, but still lightyears behind
 the old Win8 version's interface) obviously* uses a completely different database than the OneNote 2016 app (which is still required because there are things you can't do with the app!)&nbsp; Almost all of my sync errors are due to the two simply not being able
 to get along.&nbsp; *I say it's obvious because far too frequently, things get in a state where one version of OneNote shows a demonstrably different state than the other version.&nbsp; Sometimes it is simply not possibe to really fix this - I recently lost several
 hours worth of clipped documentation work this way, and getting it back was a real PITA because I had to sort through weeks of history for nearly 400 tabs to try to find all the pages I had clipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to pick a version of OneNote and stick with it.&nbsp; (Ideally, make the UWP app version the master, incorporating all capabilities - this seems more reasonable, given the need for touch/pen integration.) Failing that, at least make them use the
 same DB, so the two can't corrupt each other.</p>

            Hi Dennis,<br />
<br />
Let's further isolate this issue by resetting the OneNote application. Since OneNote is preinstalled, we recommend resetting the device, but keeping the files. Kindly refer to this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-or-reset-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#shouldW10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">
link</a> for the steps.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, you can seek assistance from our Answer Desk.<br />

Let us know the results.<br />

            <p>I'd like a further answer to this question. This answer is not relevant to the OneNote for Windows 10 app (which the original asker is referencing) considering there is no "File" menu, nor is there a "Work Offline" option within the new app. This answer
 refers to OneNote 2016 and is thus not directly relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the OneNote app, is the only answer to turn off syncing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a great answer. If a sync is attempted while you're not connected to the Internet, the notebook should just stay unsynced. Is this bug going to be addressed in an update in the near future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it makes the app unuseable and requires that I use a different note taking application, though I'd prefer to keep using OneNote if I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Like you said DennisFoerster, this issue only started recently. Mine started after a recent update of the app although the wi-fi connection at my workplace is temperamental at the moment. I've got both versions of OneNote installed so, for now, I'm going
 to turn off sync for the OS version and keep it on for the desktop version. I only use the built-in app for written notes in place of scrap paper so I'm not really that bothered whether I keep the notes or not (although it would be handy!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with your response to Romel, once you get to that screen, you can't do anything but just keep tapping on the 'Try Again' button. If you're offline, you're going to get that prompt again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to ensure that there's a "I can't connect right now" button, so it turns off sync (or at least suspends it for say an hour or so) and then attempts to sync again. By that time, maybe users will have resolved their network woes and can at least
 take some notes - otherwise the app is pretty much useless offline.</p>

            <p>What part of "you've broken something that has worked fine up until now" is so difficult to understand? The users here have posted very accurate descriptions of the current behaviour of the app. Just try turning off your internet connection and opening the
 app. You cannot even open a note to read it! The app is broken, and unusable in its current state. A notes app that can't work offline has only one place, and that is in the bin!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Really?&nbsp; The only way to deal with a bug introduced through the utter carelessness/thoughtlessnes/cluelessness (not sure which) of Microsoft's OneNote dev team is to spend a couple of days blowing away our PCs (Reset) and reinstalling all of our apps and
 restoring all our settings and data?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; You really think this is an answer to anything, ever, short of extreme system corruption??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Grief!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if you ever get your act together to the point that we can once again take notes when we're out of the office and don't have Net access, then reworking things so that the OneNote App and OneNote 2016 share a common database would be a really good idea,
 so that there just two things instead of three things to try to keep sync'ed up (the UWP app, the desktop app, and the cloud via OneDrive).&nbsp; Just sayin'...&nbsp; (Until this cluster foxtrot, most of my sync problems were between the app and desktop (2016) versions.)</p>

                    Do you guys realize that it's troublesome to log in to answers with windows phone 7? I can't imagine that people who work on this site don't have a WP to try it out with. Anyways, I'll spare you the details because I'm sure all the site/forum coders have
 windows phones and should know about this issue and I'm just repeating it for you guys.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It is ridiculous that an iphone can easily log in to microsoft answers just fine but IE9 on windows phone CAN'T (without extra effort).

I'd laugh if it didn't affect me...<br />

<div><br />
<div>iphone handles the new window like a tab and goes thru the whole login process flawlessly. an android tablet handles the login with a new tab also and logs you in but you &nbsp;still have to refresh the original page.</div>
<div><br />
<div>both of these platforms access the answers forums more easily than precisely the people who use them most!</div>
<div><br />
<div>the lack of attention to me is striking. when you look at the little bugs that exist in wp software together with this, one wonders if ms hasnt simply lost the ability to produce a polished experience.</div>

<p>Hi Joshua,<br />
<br />
Assume the notebook is stored in your OneDrive for Business library, to stop sharing it with some you sent a link to, you can right click the notebook in the library &gt; "Details" &gt; click the link icon &gt; "Disable link" &gt; "Remove link".
</p>
<p>After doing this, the shared users won't be able to access the notebook via the previous link and will get an error saying "The link has been removed".</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lesley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that someone set up a Facebook account using your email address that's why you're getting the notifications. If you don't want to get these type of messages, Outlook lets you block unwanted emails.
<br />
<br />
If you're managing your emails using the <strong>Outlook website</strong>, you follow the steps enumerated on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support page</a></strong></em> to block sender from
 sending you emails. For Outlook desktop app, check this <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Block-a-mail-sender-b29fd867-cac9-40d8-aed1-659e06a706e4#ID0EAACAAA=2016,_2013,_2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, you may also check at the bottom of the email and look for <strong>Unsubscribe</strong> option. Most email notifications from social media accounts have this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    <p>I have windows 10 Technical Preview build 10041, and sometimes when i shutdown my laptop it doesn't shutdown properly, it closes everything and turns off the screen but my light indicators for power and hard drive and still on and i can still hear my fan
 going and i have to keep holding power button to shutdown which keeps getting annoying since i lost some data last time i did this, i also might be wrong but it only happens while i have my laptop on power saving mode not on balanced or high performance. So
 any help?</p>

No, my issue has not been resolved, &amp; yes, any suggestions you may have on the matter will be deeply appreciated. I looked through the Community Q&amp;A's &amp; was unable to find anything on this problem. I would love to be able to send emails on nice stationary sometimes
 but it just won't display on the recipients end.<br />

            <p>If each pair of rows has a specific value in one column, different from the following pair, you can use Excel's Data &gt; Subtotal command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not the case, you could create an additional column containing such values (assuming the first row is a header and the data starts at row 2) by entering this formula:</p>
<p>=INT(ROW()/2), and filling down, </p>
<p>Then copy the column and paste special values [because otherwise the formula will recalculate while subtotal rows are being added!].</p>
<p>Then you could use Data &gt; Subtotal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You could then clear the additional column if you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A macro could be written that would do this for you, but I would encourage the use of Excel's feature first.</p>

            <p>This workaround, did the trick for me!<br />
As always, ensure you have a backup of your data.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Go to calendar.live.com </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Create a New Calendar.<br />
From with in options, select the calendar you created as the Primary calendar.<br />
You now have a working calendar(empty).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I needed to do the following(depends what you have).<br />
Close Outlook, and reopen Outlook<br />
Restart Windows Phone(s)<br />
Restart Windows 8(s)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This part you will need Outlook for, to move your appointments(needed ones, not everything) to the new calendar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So in Outlook:<br />
Select the old calendar in list view, select previous appointment(just the needed ones) and all future appointments.&nbsp; Then Copy the selection( Ctrl+C ).<br />
Select the new calendar and Paste( Ctrl+V ) them.&nbsp; Repeat the copy/paste as required, until you've got the appointment you need in the new calendar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have Windows Phone(or another type phone that was syncronised with the old calendar).&nbsp; Any appointment entered since the problem occured, will be ophaned.&nbsp; Those appointments will need to be re-entered.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You'll have the old calendar for history.&nbsp; Just ensure that the new calendar is the new default/primary calendar on you devices.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finger crossed this helps out.<br />

<h2>            How to collapse 2nd layer page&#8217;s subpage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask a question on subpage collapse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OneNote 2010 3 layers of subpages are allowed, and I found that only the
<span>first layer</span> of page (those without any parent page) have the button “collapse subpage” to click on, while for 2 layer page there is no such option.</p>
<span>first layer</span> of page (those without any parent page) have the button “collapse subpage” to click on, while for 2 layer page there is no such option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to also collapse 2 layer page’s subpages. Is there any way to enable this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are running a 32bit version of Office 2010, you may download and install the Microsoft Mathematics Add-In (32bit) and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</p>

<div>I tried with a few links, for example this&nbsp;<a href="https://bay163.mail.live.com/mail/HttpsLogin.aspx?rru=inbox&amp;mc=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://bay163.mail.live.com/mail/HttpsLogin.aspx?rru=inbox&amp;mc=4</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But there I dont have option to disable it, on every link I click I am forwarded to an error page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the other side I followed a guide :</div>
<div>================</div>
<div>
<p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Login</a>&nbsp;to Hotmail.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Go to your Inbox.</p>
<p>3. In the upper right corner of the page, select&nbsp;<b>Options</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>More options…</b></p>
<p>4. Under the&nbsp;<i>Customizing Hotmail</i>&nbsp;section select&nbsp;<b>Advanced privacy settings</b>.</p>
<p>5. Under the&nbsp;<i>Using HTTPS for Extra Security</i>&nbsp;section select&nbsp;<b>Go to HTTPS settings</b>.</p>
<p>===================</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BUT my issue is that, in ADVANCED PRIVACY SETTINGS, I DO NOT HAVE THE HTTPS OPTION.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that Outlook.com defaults to HTTPS, and as mentioned by ZigZag3143., the option to disable it is unfortunately unavailable. The primary function of HTTPS is for extra security especially if you often use public computers or unsecure wireless
 connections.</p>

            <p>Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Outlook 2010 installed on a HP Pavillion dm4 with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use outlook for work, I keep there all my work accounts and it works fine. I added my personal hotmail account to look everything in the same place (with different inboxes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything went well for 2 years, until 1 day after an update (I don't remember which one) around February 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting this notification errors:</p>

            <p>Hi...my mail works however I had problems deleting emails...they would not delete and had to close the app and re-open a few times to get it done...my Settings app crashed twice so far and got a BSOD right after which forced me to shut down the PC...</p>
<p>Say How did you 'Un-install' the mail app?...the un-install option is always greyed out...did you use the PowerShell commands?...thanks.</p>
<p>I may have to re-install this 14291 build if it keeps crashing the 'Settings'.*john&nbsp;

    <title>Office 2010 reverting to trial version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertolsson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 reverting to trial version</h2>
                    Some months ago I installed office 2010 home and student on windows xp professional (sp3) and activated successfully. I just noticed that all the programs are now showing as 'trial version' and need the product key to continue working. I have re-entered
 the product key through the help screens in word, excel &amp; outlook, and also through the anytime upgrade, and also through control panel/add remove programs/microsoft office/change/enter product key. Each time setup validates the key successfully, configures
 office after i click continue, and reverts back to the trial version. I get no error messages of any type, no validation or activation errors, just keeps reverting to trial version. This is the second install off a family pack 3 install version so there shouldn't
 be any issue with the key. Any ideas before I uninstall and start from scratch?<br />

            Actually, I found my own answer. After checking Rohns suggestions, I went ahead and uninstalled, rebooted, and reinstalled. During the reinstall, I noticed a check box which would also install a trial of office 2010 professional. My supposition, unverified
 at this point, is that the professional trial version expired, which I can understand, but that process also took down the home and student programs and reverted those to trial versions as well, instead of just the extras from professional. Not sure why it
 refused my product key (if it were the difference between versions I should have gotten an invalid key error.) After the reinstall (without the professional trial), I activated successfully and office looks to be fully functional. Will just have to see over
 time if the problem recurs.<br />

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Focused </strong><strong>Inbox</strong> for Outlook helps you <em>focus</em> on the emails that matter to you most. It will automatically sort your inbox into two tabs:
<em><strong>FOCUSED</strong></em> and <em><strong>OTHER. </strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25e14ae2-ce18-4c58-82cb-44dcf4efa882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25e14ae2-ce18-4c58-82cb-44dcf4efa882" height="264" width="338" /></a></p>
<p>You probably need to set up your display settings to see, send, and delete any of your emails. You can do that by going into your Outlook.com
<strong>Display Settings</strong>, and choose how your Inbox should be organized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out this support article for more information:</p>

                    <p>The browser starts OK with the default MSN page I can navigate the MSN page before it crashes ( a couple of clicks). Also every time I try to enter a new URL, the browser crashes. It crashes while I try to type the URL. I really would like to try it. Is
 there any work around.</p>

            i discovered that you need to enable ms firewall service before launching spartan. once it is open disable it and see if spartan works.

    <title>Copying edited material with track changes into a new document. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonhhunt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying edited material with track changes into a new document.</h2>
                    My wife is editing a book. Due to power outages and things that go bump in the night she had several versions. She wants to consolidate these into one version to send to the author. She has track changes turned on so that the author can see her recommended
 edits. When she selects a group of paragraphs to copy into another document when she pastes those they show up as if everything in the paragraphs has been edited. All paragraphs show up in orange, for example. Is there way to select, copy and paste those paragraphs
 while still showing the changes made? We're using Word for Mac version 15.27. Thanks for any assistance

            <p>Confusing as it may seem, you should turn <strong>off</strong> the tracking in both the source and target documents before pasting the content. Have you tried that?</p>
