    <title>VirtualBox uninstaller damaged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techfreak1500  say:</h3>
<h2>            VirtualBox uninstaller damaged</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; Hi Microsoft. I'm sick of having to report problems, but, well, looks like my laptop hates me. Firstly, I decided to uninstall VMware Player in favor of VirtualBox. Dumbest move ever. VirtualBox was horrible, so I attempted to uninstall. Now, the MSIEXEC.exe
 program that is Windows Installer hangs with no response. When I click "Cancel", it totally freezes. The only way I can terminate the program is to load cmd.exe, and type Taskkill /f /im msiexec.exe. Then, it says something like "Windows installer might not
 be properly installed." Windows Installer does work however, as the 7-zip MSI installer loads instantly. So, I left VirtualBox there, and reinstalled VMware. After installing Windows 7 on it, once it reaches the desktop (because it's using Easy Installer,
 it skips OOBE) it just freezes. Any cursor response glitches the screen.</p>

            Thank you for your information, Karthik. VirtualBox has been unexpectedly uninstalled. I believe this is associated to Windows asking me to uninstall the application 10-15 minutes later. All that's left is a security file. And i fixed the issue by unplugging
 the External USB Mouse device! Yay!&nbsp;

            <p>Well, it was helpful in so far that it pointed me in the right direction in order that I might determine the reason for the messages which was that Windows Firewall and McAfee Firewall were corrupting each other even though one of them was off??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The messages stopped once I removed McAfee from my system and went strictly with Windows.</p>

            <p>Dear Niranjan Manjhi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I tried using the instructions in the link you provided "Fix a corrupted user profile," which specifically say that the profile includes settings for "desktop backgrounds, screen savers, pointer preferences, sound settings, and other features" would be
 transferred to my new profile if I followed the directions.&nbsp; However, none of my desktop settings imported into the new profile, such as the desktop background, the items on my desktop, and the changes to my start menu.&nbsp; Therefore, I tried a different approach
 (documented below) before totally trying to rebuild my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the end, I found the problem was **not** a corrupted user profile. The problem was a setting in Control Panel / Region and Languages / Keyboards and Languages.&nbsp; (I went to this setting because a general internet search revealed that the gaming community
 had some issues with the tilde/grave key.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the "Change Keyboard" button, I did the following.</p>
<p>a) Per the gaming community's suggestion, under "General," removed "US - International" keyboard, leaving only "Keyboard = US" and "Other = Ink Correction" (the latter I learned is for my tablet input).&nbsp; This change did not fix my problem itself, even after
 a reboot.&nbsp; But I left it that way. Then, next...</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Under "Advanced Key Settings" for "To English," I used "Change Key Sequence" to uncheck "Enable Key Sequence, which had been set to "Ctrl-Shift" + "Grave."&nbsp; However, neither did this change fix my problem itself, even after a reboot.&nbsp; Then I tried next
 ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) Under "Advanced Key Settings" for "Between input languages," I used "Change Key Sequence" to change the "Switch Keyboard Layout" from "Grave Accent (`) to "Not Assigned."&nbsp; [I left "Switch Input Language" to "Left Alt + Shift."]&nbsp; THIS CHANGE FIXED MY PROBLEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to mention that the keyboard manufacturer for my unified wireless keyboard and mouse was kind enough to send me an entirely new set, hoping that it would fix my problem, even though it was not a hardware issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 digital license activation on a new PC.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i got a free upgrade to Windows 10 on my laptop when Microsoft first announced it. That was a few years ago.&nbsp; I got a new PC last year and the shop i got it from had already Windows pre-installed on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i discovered, it was a pirated license. It started giving me an error code: 0x8007232B.&nbsp; So i thought no matter, i can still use my own Windows license from my old laptop. It seems just being logged into my Microsoft account isn't doing a trick. Also
 i can't format nor uninstall my product key from my old laptop since it is collecting dust for a year atleast, and its hard drive is broken and it doesn't boot up and i already tossed away the charger aswell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what i've read, i'm entitled to a one-time transfer? If that's the case that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day,</p>
<p>Siim</p>

            No way of telling i think, but i can tell i got that license when Microsoft had their first campaign for a free upgrade to Windows 10, if that tells anything.

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each networking product like modems, routers, wireless range extenders, hotspot devices, etc have their own Graphical User Interface (GUI). It depends on the model, brand, and manufacturer on how you can access this interface and adjust the device to minimize
 any wireless interference and channel conflict. With this, you may need to contact your Internet Service Provider, or the Manufacturer of the network device you are using.</p>

 I have sent multiple error reports via the little automated error reporting box but nothing has happened.</p>

    <title>can&#39;t access programs on second harddrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dropbear1959  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t access programs on second harddrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone, I hope someone can help me,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a computer with a 1TB&nbsp;HDD and a 128GB SSD,&nbsp;unfortunately the OS was installed on the 1 TB HDD. I then&nbsp;bought a program that migrated the OS (W7) onto the SSD and eventually was successful in doing this. I re-booted the computer and as recommended
 adjusted the bios so as the SSD was the first to boot however after I did this I can only access those programs that were migrated onto the SSD. The programs on the 1TB drive do not appear on the "All Programs" menu and the desk top icons do not&nbsp;work "file
 path C/xxxx/xxx does not exist" comes up. Now when I go back into the bios and change the boot order back to the &nbsp;original HDD the computer starts up (slower than normal) but all the desktop icons work and all the programs appear after clicking the "All Programs"
 tab. Obviously I haven't deleted the W7 OS off the original HDD yet. How can I get my SSD to "see" and operate all the programs on the 1TB HDD and then delete the OS on the original 1TB HDD?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm not sure what is more important for you, but the following freeware application will allow you to migrate your OS from the HDD to your SSD:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would do the following steps, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup all data and programs to an external drive for safekeeping.</li><li>Delete / wipe the SSD of all files (a reformat would be a good way to do this).</li><li>Migrate the OS from the HDD to the SSD following all&nbsp;the instructions in the AOMEI Partitioning program.</li><li>Delete the Win 7 installation from the HDD (again, reformatting the drive is the best way)</li><li>Change the BIOS settings as needed / instructed (if you haven't already done so if instructed to).</li><li>Restore the backed-up data and programs to the HDD.</li><li>Test the system.</li></ol>
<p>Let me know if this helps you out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Skype App - changing language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lech_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Skype App - changing language</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>The standard procedure for changing language is to go to the menu -&gt; tools -&gt; change language :</p>
<p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA73/how-do-i-change-the-language-used-by-skype-for-windows-desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that there is no menu (at the top left of the window) at all in my Win10 Skype App -&gt; therefore I cannot make any changes.</p>
<p>Settings do not offer any option for changing language neither.</p>
<p>I am based in the UK - but would like to operate different language than default English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help will be very appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Lech</p>

    <title>Kundendienst eine Zumutung - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> singhaaaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kundendienst eine Zumutung</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>

<p>ich hatte Samstag ein nettes Telefonat mit dem XBOX Kundendienst, da meine XBOX ONE Kinect regelmäßig die Verbindung zur XBOX ONE verliert. Die erste Ernüchterung erlebte ich beim gebuchten Rückruf des Kundendienstes. Der Anruf kam zwar an, jedoch blieb
 die Leitung stumm. Ebenso beim 2ten Rückruf. Beim Anruf der angegebenen Support-Nummer (auf der Webseite), erklärte mir ein Tonband, dass diese Nummer nicht aus dem Mobilfunknetz erreichbar ist. Einen weiteren gebuchten Anruf des Kundendienstes später, landete
 ich wirklich bei einem Suppormitarbeiter.</p>
<p>Die Dame war sehr höflich, aber unter Kundendienst stelle ich mir etwas anderes vor. Leider konnte mir nicht genannt werden, wieviel ein Instant Replacement meiner defekten Kinect kosten würde (zumindest nicht ohne im Internet nachzusehen). Nachdem dieses
 Problem aus der Welt geschafft wurde, nahm das System meine Adresse nicht an. Nach rund 30 Minuten am Telefon, zahlreichem parkens in der Warteschlange und tausenden Entschuldigungen wurde mir angeboten, mich Sonntags zurückzurufen und es dann nocheinmal zu
 probieren. Leider meldete sich niemand.</p>
<p>Heute nahm ich die Sache selbst in die Hand und versuchte einen Austausch meiner Kinect via Homepage zu managen. Dort habe ich Samstag übrigens probiert meine XBOX zu registrieren. Immer mit der Fehlermeldung "Es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten, bitte versuchen
 sie es erneut". Meine XBOX schien dort auch wirklich auf (ebenso wie Kinect), dank des Helpdesks. Nur leider ist diese Seite der letzte Dreck!!! Zahlreiche Fehlermeldungen wie "Es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten" sind dort anscheinend Standard. Bindestriche ("-")
 werden WEDER in meinem Namen NOCH in der Adresse akzeptiert!!!! Mit den Problemen auf der Webseite bin ich übrigens nicht allein. 2 meiner Kollegen versuchten ebenfalls ihre XBOX zu registrieren, mit demselben Erfolg -&gt; "Es ist ein Fehler aufgetreten..."</p>
<p>Service am Kunden sieht anders aus.</p>
<p>Ich bin jedenfalls schwer von Microsoft enttäuscht.</p>

            Hi TikTak.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you move the User folders from their Properties box Location tab, but instead of creating the new folder for them in the destination dumped them instead into the D drive itself?
<br />
<br />What to do for this is to first Restore Default using button in each User folders Properties box Location tab.  But when prompted if you want to copy the files back DO NOT copy the files since they are all mixed together now.  
<br />
<br />Once you have the folders restored to default location, open the D drive and using the checkboxes available from View &gt; Options &gt; Folder &amp; Search Options &gt; View &gt; User Checkboxes, sort the various files back into their User folders.  First tick all the boxes for Documents files, then right click to Copy, go to User Documents folder to Paste them there.  Then do that for each other folder. 
<br />
<br />Then follow the correct procedure here to move User folders:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>.
<br />
<br />In severe cases if User folders are ever lost during the process, here is how to restore them no matter  what:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Wireless Mobile Mouse 1000 middle button click in Chrome slow with Mouse and Keyboard Center</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I'm running Windows 8 Pro with Wireless Mobile Mouse 1000 as I did with Windows 7 (upgraded with clean install option) but when I use the newest Keyboard and Mouse Center (which is now the default driver and software companion to this mouse) the middle
 button click takes numerous seconds to execute which is mostly visible in Chrome where I used it to open new tabs. However when I install the latest IntelliPoint 8.20.468 I used some time ago everything works fine and smooth.</div>
<div>So I thought I'd share and voice my concern (with some others, I see) that there is something wrong with this new software.</div>
<div>Or if I might be doing something wrong, then please offer some suggestions as how to make it work with the newest software.</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,</div>
<div>Chris</div>
                </div>
