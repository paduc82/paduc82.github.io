<h2>            How often does Outlook.com update email information&#63;</h2>
                    I ask the question since I had received no emails for a day or two.&nbsp; I have a Virgin email address and can see emails, around 16 of them, on the Virgin site directly dating back to the 26th Dec which have not been forwarded yet.&nbsp; Its now 8.30am on the
 28th Dec.&nbsp; Is this normal?&nbsp; I had the same problem with Hotmail, so I "updated" to Outlook but this seems also to be so slow.&nbsp; Can I take my diary entries from Outlook and paste them into Windows Live Mail, which seems to work much more quickly.&nbsp; By the way,
 emails go out from Outlook almost instantaneously.&nbsp; Help, waiting 2 days for an email is too long!&nbsp; Colin<br />
PS&nbsp; Just received some emails delayed by 5 to 8 hours, BUT there are 12 to 14 emails from 23rd to 27th Dec that have not been picked up by Outllook yet, so 5 days and counting.&nbsp; I'm wandering if these will ever appear in Outlook?&nbsp; Is this unusual or have I
 just been unlucky?&nbsp; Is Windows Live Mail any better?<br />

            <p>Hi ColinOverton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the auto-refresh of Outlook.com to update email information only takes 10 seconds. It still depends on the speed of the connection of the sender, the traffic gateway in the World Wide Web and the speed of the receiver's connection.
</p>

<br />
<br />#1 - First place to start is indicating what type of email account this involves (POP3, Imap etc)
<br />
<br />#2 - Next, clarify what you mean by "have not been able to import Outlook contacts"
<br />
<br />#3 - Re: address book not being populated with incoming email addresses
<br />
<br />What you are referring to is the auto-complete cache which is totally separate and distinct from the Outlook AddressBook. The AB is a specialized view of the contact folders set to be a member of the AB. The auto-complete cache has never populated the AB. Also the auto-complte cache does not contain "incoming email addresses" but rather the recipients of all email messages that you have sent.

<p>Honestly, can you just make it so it works? &nbsp; How about this;&nbsp; I receive an email from Joe Smith and I create a new contact with his name, email, phone etc. and I save it.&nbsp; Then when I compose a new email, I can enter Joe's name in the addressee box and
 his contact info is available to me.&nbsp; Or, when i want to share a calendar with Joe, I can find his name in AT LEAST ONE of the address books available to search from. &nbsp; That seems logical - to be able to access a contact after you create and save it.&nbsp; Not
 much point otherwise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is, I create a new contact after receiving an email and it is in my 'contacts' list shown when I click the contacts icon in Outlook, but the new contact DOES NOT SHOW UP when I'm trying to enter recipients for a new email.&nbsp; Opening the address address
 books from the new email window, I can't find any contact lists hat contain the new contacts.&nbsp; Where do they go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if the list you save new contacts to doesn't interact with the rest of he application - at all.&nbsp; They are just there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new and extremely frustrating development in Windows 365.&nbsp; Obviously it isn't something a person wants to run through a gauntlet of work-arounds and troubleshooting to resolve. &nbsp; It should work.&nbsp;&nbsp; New contacts should save, by default to the active
 address book.&nbsp; At the very least, the address book containing these new contacts should be able to found - somehow, while composing and addressing an email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the snark, but I've been fighting this for quite a while and trying every trick I can find and most simply don't apply.&nbsp;&nbsp; The box to check is already checked and there is no option to not check it, etc.</p>

<p>I found a partial fix for my problem, finally:</p>
<p>In the top toolbar in Outlook, (Mail Tab, not 'Contacts') select 'Address Book' (just to the right of center).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>With the address book open, click on 'Tools' in the upper left, then click 'Options"
</p>
<p>On the bottom of this dialogue box will be a drop-down option list under the heading "When opening the address book, show this address list first:"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Click the down arrow and at the bottom of the list I found "Outlook Address Book" and under that was "Contacts"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I selected that and now can find saved/created contacts while composing an email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The down side, is that autocomplete doesn't work for most of them, so you have to click 'to' on the email window to select recipients - they don't pop-up automatically.&nbsp;

If the issue still persists, then I suggest that you try restoring the Computer to a date when it was working fine. Refer to the below mentioned article to perform a System Restore in the Windows 7 Computer:</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Important Notice: </strong>That System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files on your computer. Thus, any recently installed programs,
 updates, or changes to configuration will be lost if you use System Restore. However, make note that System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file.</p>

<p><span>I have a small problem(at least I think that is small) with my phone Nokia C6-00. When I'm on internet with the browser(I noticed first on Facebook and now it started on every page) after 2 minutes on internet no matter if I'm connected wireless or
 from my mobile provider first it requires some certificates and I press always allow and after that it says no internet. When I'm resetting the browser,the phone it self restarts. It also happens with games and apps that need internet. It uses Symbian and
 I don't know what to do. My friends tell me to get Samsung or LG but I want to keep up with this phone because I will never find a phone like this with qwerty keyboard on slide and most of all... I love your phones. My first phone was 3110 and now I'm with
 c6-00...</span><br />

Only delete that one because it is going to be in conflict with the new version you install in step 4. All other (expired) authorities can stay because they are expired and not considered anyway.<br />

Some certificate authorities (CA) might be present in your phone already, some might not install. Anyway, try&nbsp;<strong>all</strong> because this list of 50 CAs covers more than 90% of the Internet nowadays. With older firmware, you have to install those via

    <title>WORD toolbar defaut tab in Office 365 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joekirchoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            WORD toolbar defaut tab in Office 365 Home</h2>
                    <p>When I open WORD the tool bar tab at the top of the page defaults to the "File" tab.&nbsp; Until now it has always defaulted to the "Home" tab that shows the toolbar commands used in Word documents.&nbsp; If I click on "Home" to perform a command, it performs the
 command and then the tab goes back to "File" instead of staying on the "Home" tab.&nbsp; How can I make the "Home" tab the default when opening WORD?&nbsp; And also, how do I get it too remain on the tab I select until I manually change to a different tab?</p>

            <p>The File tab only looks like it's selected because it's dark -- but it's always dark. If it was really selected, you would see the big stripe down the left side with Info, New, Open, etc. instead of seeing your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you're seeing is that the ribbon is minimized. When you single-click a tab such as the Home tab, the ribbon temporarily opens until you click a button on it, then it minimizes again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it stay visible, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">double-click</span> any of the tabs. (Accidentally double-clicking a tab is how you got it minimized -- it toggles back and forth.) Other ways include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click any tab and check/uncheck "Collapse the ribbon" on the menu.</li><li>Press Ctrl and F1 together.</li><li>Click the little up-arrow at the right end of the ribbon while it's visible (this only collapses the ribbon; there isn't any arrow to expand it).</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb9e69a2-cba9-4965-b306-7f0edb129f51" />&nbsp;icon in the top right corner of the Word window, next to the minimize and maximize icons, and choose the Show

    <title>Sort order changed in form in MS Access 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyc_777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sort order changed in form in MS Access 2013</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>My Brother in law's Access program that Was originally built in '97 version of Access. &nbsp;It went through conversions in 2007 and now 2013. &nbsp;Not a glitch going from 97 to 2007. &nbsp;With going to 2013 three strange things have happened the last of which has me
 scratching for answers. &nbsp;Just last week after using this program to run his business since 2000 he clicked on a form made from a query using 4 tables. The SQL for this form is below. &nbsp;The form has always sorted the information in this form in "Descending Order".
 &nbsp;You can see from the end of the code it now sorts in ascending order. &nbsp;. For years the sort order has been descending. &nbsp;I went into the query and changed the sort order back to descending. &nbsp;After saving the query and looking at the SQL and the SQL clearly
 showed that statement how was set back to descending. &nbsp;The form still opened in ascending order even though both the query and SQL showed it should be ordered by DESC; &nbsp;What could cause this? I looked at three PopUp forms leading up to this forms for date
 perimeters. &nbsp;I found no code that would disallow this sort order. &nbsp;Can any of you see a problem with the code below? It is not all that complex! &nbsp;What else could make this sort order stick regardless of what the saved code says?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SELECT tblCostAcct.JobCompletionDate, tblCostAcct.[JCAW#], [JobName] &amp; "-#" &amp; [Inv#] AS JN, tblCostAcct.JobSupervisor, Sum(qryGW.GWTotal) AS SumOfGWTotal, qryES.ES, Sum(qryGW.RegHrs) AS SumOfRegHrs, Sum(qryGW.OTHrs) AS SumOfOTHrs, Sum(qryGW.BPHHrs) AS SumOfBPHHrs,
 Sum(([RegHrs])+([OTHrs])+([BPHHrs])) AS TotalHrs, tblCostAcct.EstHrs, tblCostAcct.GrossRev, tblCostAcct.JobID, tblCostAcct.Allocated FROM ((tblCostAcct LEFT JOIN tblJobs ON tblCostAcct.JobID = tblJobs.JobID) LEFT JOIN qryGW ON tblCostAcct.[JCAW#] = qryGW.[JCAW#])
 LEFT JOIN qryES ON tblCostAcct.[JCAW#] = qryES.[JCAW#] GROUP BY tblCostAcct.JobCompletionDate, tblCostAcct.[JCAW#], [JobName] &amp; "-#" &amp; [Inv#], tblCostAcct.JobSupervisor, qryES.ES, tblCostAcct.EstHrs, tblCostAcct.GrossRev, tblCostAcct.JobID, tblCostAcct.Allocated
 HAVING (((tblCostAcct.JobCompletionDate) Between [Forms]![frmReportsJCA]![Date1] And [Forms]![frmReportsJCA]![Date2])) ORDER BY tblCostAcct.JobCompletionDate; &nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">'&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; After I set the sort order back to Descending the code now reads .....etionDate DESC;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">But stills sorts A-Z.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>See help file for what they do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best practice for reports is to NOT sort the query, but use the "Group &amp; Sort" feature to apply a sort. With newer versions this may be more and more a requirement, not just a good suggestion.</p>

            <p>The OrderBy property sets the order for the form and will override and sort in the Recordsource. The OrderbyOnLoad, simply says to apply what is in the OrderBy when the form loads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would put my sort on the form instead of relying on the query. This could be a change in 2013 that, like reports, you have to set your sort on the Form itself.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue that you're having, you may perform a <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft
 reset</a></strong> on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't work, we advise you perform a hard reset on your phone using the hardware buttons by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />and

<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until you see a large exclamation mark.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:
<span><strong>volume up</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f6bd43a94-9d17-4c2d-8124-ac977d0da8b5%2fhardware-icon-volumeUP-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Resetting your phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the phone will be restored to its factory settings. If backup is turned on under
<strong>Settings</strong>, you can restore your apps and settings if you use the same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>There are some cases we've seen, where phone numbers put in non-standard fields in the account structures (such as 'Car' from Outlook) are not transferred, since there is no equivalent field on the phone.</p>

<p>Here is a screen shot of what we can see when we follow the steps you suggested. A fix for this soon would be appreciated. My PC keeps prompting me to enforce security policies (which are already enforced), was hoping to reset policies and try again.</p>

            If Flash Lite 3.1 is available, you can probably only find it on Adobe's developer site, until it actually is preinstalled on an actual device.<br />
<br />
And Nokia has not been in the habit of pre-announcing when firmware updates come, and what's in them.

<p>Hi Saltpro</p>
<p>If this is a *.doc or *.dot file then you can't use this feature. It inserts a 2007 content control linked to a particular property. Content Controls are only supported in the new file format (docx, docm, dotx, dotm).</p>

<h2>            Why does my Minecraft pocket edition keep on crashing and returning me to my start screen upon every opening</h2>
                    I've recently installed Minecraft pocket edition on my Microsoft Lumia phone but every time I tried opening it, it would take me to the mojang logo then just return me to the start screen. I've tried uninstalling then re installing the app but nothing
 changed, please help me with this as it cost me nearly 6 pounds.<br />
Thanks

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
This issue about the Minecraft: Pocket Edition video game crashing on your Lumia may be related to software synchronization. To resolve this, we suggest performing a
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d?auth=1">soft reset</a></strong>. This method will
 not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
We're just here if you have further questions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<p>I've followed the normal steps to add a new account however,&nbsp;I repeatedly keep getting the "Windows Security dialogue box" with my Outlook.com username displayed (details are correct) requesting my password.

<p>Doesn't matter how many times I enter the password&nbsp;the dialogue box keeps popping up and I'm not able to connect to&nbsp;Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>Non of the other additional accounts I've placed in Outlook 2016 have been a problem, they work fine!</p>
<p>It's Outlook.com that causing me to go grey. </p>
<p>Any suggestions, other than, "if you pay me $119(US)&nbsp; I can fix it for you" would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt response. The details you provided will help us identify if two-step verification affected your login capabilities. To further address your concern, we advise getting an app password. To do so, refer to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">App
 passwords and two-step verification</a>. Enter the generated app password&nbsp;in the dialog box instead of your default password. Verify if you will encounter the same difficulty after performing this step. This normally resolves sign-in issues when configuring
 an account using Outlook 2016 app given that two-step verification is enabled.</p>

<h2>            Synching AT&#38;T Tilt with Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    I just bought a new Tilt, and when I try to synch it to my Vista PC, the relationship that is set up is only with the media player. I tried ti install Active Synch 4.5, but received a message that it would not run under Vista. I had an old Dell Axim 30
 that synch just fine with the Mobile Device Center. I hope someone can help...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>What does this add-on do for ‘Outlook Mail’? Also, when switching to ‘Outlook Calendar’ the same pop-up appears at the bottom of the page. When selecting the ‘X’ at the far right of the pop-up closes it and will not appear again until signing out of ‘Outlook’
 then signing back into ‘Outlook’ again. Then the pop-up appears at the bottom of the web page asking to run the same following add-on ‘MSXML 3.0’from ‘Microsoft Corporation’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The functionality of ‘Outlook Mail’ and ‘Outlook Calendar’ seem to work well, but not as quick when first upgraded from ‘Windows Live’ e-mail. It takes more time than before to fully load the advertising side banner located on the right hand side of the
 web page. This behavior has might be resolved by allowing the web page to run ‘MSXML 3.0 SP10’ from ‘Microsoft Corporation’ even if it is not listed in the browser add-on’s or ‘Control Panel’&gt;‘Programs’&gt;‘Programs and Features’.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘Windows Dev Center - Desktop’ at ‘MSDN.Microsoft.com’ provides some explanation’(s) to ’What’s New in MSXML’. Specifically, ‘What’s New in MSXML 4.0’ this mentions something called ‘Side-by-Side Functionality’ stating that ‘MSXML 4.0’ supports ‘Windows
 Side-by-Side (SxS)’ installation under ‘Windows Vista’ and more. What that means is when ‘MSXML 4.0’ is installed under qualified versions of ‘Microsoft Windows’ gives ‘side-by-side’ access to other versions of ‘MSXML’.
