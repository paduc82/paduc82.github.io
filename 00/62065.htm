    <title>LifeCam Cinema shows no video in lower resolutions or in Skype - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LifeCam Cinema shows no video in lower resolutions or in Skype</h2>
                    I just purchased a LifeCamCinema and installed the software on a fresh load of Wondows XP, now at SP3. When I run the Microsoft LifeCam app it comes up fine and displays video at 640x360. If I select a lower resolution like 424x240 (or any other lower
 resolution) it is accepted but there is no picture, no error message or any indication of a problem, but the video window is black. When I run Skype, the same thing happens. It accepts the video camera selection but the window is always a black rectangle.
 Later we will get into the fact that the audio doesn't work if the video is running but that is a whole other issue.

            Since no one could come up with and answer, I did. I returned the more expensive Microsoft camera, bought a less expensive Philips that had better specs. It works great, both high and low resolution. Setup was easy and fast. We are getting comments from
 everyone on how great our image looks. Problem solved.

            Hi Gaumaugher, I figured out why you could not get any video to display in lower resolution then 640x360. I myself had the same problem on the stickam.com website, I surfed about 10 different forums reading threads where people have had a similar problem
 on everything from video chatting or conference sites to video software programs. The culprit ended up being the "Clear Frame Settings" option. For some reason if "Clear Frame Settings" is set to "Automatic" or "On" when you select any resolution lower then
 640x360 all you'll get is a black screen. This will also cause a no video condition in Stickam live rooms and Stickam in general. So setting the "Clear Frame Settings" to "Off" will display the video feed in the Microsoft&nbsp; LifeCam Cinema Software video display
 window when you select a low resolution aaand it will allow your video to come up on Stickam. Should work for Skype but I have yet to try it myself. I know you already got rid of the cam and got another one so I write this for your peace of mind and to help
 whoever needs to know how to solve the same issue. <br />
<br />
What's funny is that all the threads I read had me thinking the LifeCam Cinema was defective and from the clarity of the visible resolution settings I really liked the cam, I felt pretty bummed when I drove home excited to try it out and when I had everything
 installed and ready to go, it wasn't coming up on certain chat sites or messenger programs :/.&nbsp; After all the reading, I figured that Microsoft wouldn't put out a cam like this without testing it, so the likely hood that it had some huge oversight in the programming
 cause a no video condition was unlikely; so I literally just started clicking things on and off and through trial and error and using process of elimination I stumbled on the one setting that was causing the issue.

<h3> warmastercain55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection to live</h2>
                    
<p>It was working fine a couple days ago but this morning, it wouldn't connect.&nbsp; I haven't done any port alterations and I wasn't prompted to change anything and it was ready to go.</p>
<p>But this morning...nada.&nbsp; When I tried to go into network settings to check connections, all I got was 'please make sure the ethernet cable is connected etc etc etc...'
</p>
<p>It is connected and the cable itself works fine after testing it on another device.&nbsp; I had called comcast (my isp) to see if anything was wrong with my ubee d3.0 modem as I seem to have only one blue light when there is supposed to be two but they said it
 should be fine.&nbsp; I did all the troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>I did follow the steps to open the ports but it didn't do anything and from what it looks like, it seems that it is a connection problem.&nbsp; My router sees it when the system is turned on but now when the xbox is turned on, it doesn't see the xbox&nbsp; In fact,
 now that I think about it, the very last thing I did before shutting it down for the night until today was try and get the Noble pack map for reach but I had to stop it but it was running fine.</p>
<p>So I don't know if there's something more specific I need to do with the router or what but I could use some help.</p>

<p>So your router sees when your computer is turned on but not your xbox? almost sounds like the cat5 port went up on your xbox.</p>
<p>is there any error number it gives with your error message? Have you tried connecting your xbox directly to your modem leaving out your router&gt;?</p>

<p>Yeah the computer works fine and all, stable connection.</p>
<p>Back when it was working, the connection would open up when i turn on the console and it would be fine.

                    I got a pop-up saying that my memory was low, so I ran the memory tool thing and found nothing. Can it be because of one specific program for instance? I have something installed that's similar to Second Life, called IMVU, and have heard that those programs
 "eat memory like chocolate"...&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;.&lt; &nbsp;

<h2>            Apple Mac like toolbar on desktop</h2>
                    When I first started using my Dell studio 17 laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium,&nbsp;a "toolbar" (like on the Apple) appreared at the top of screen with all GUIs or icons on it by category. When cursor went into that area it appeared. That has stopped
 working. What is it called? and how do I turn it back on?

            It's called the Dell Dock. Look in your Start Menu and there should be an entry for it. If you need to reinstall it, you can download the Dell Dock from Dell's tech support website.

<h2>            Unable to conect to internet with my nokia phone</h2>
                    Hello friends ! I am using windows 8 pro, in that I was unable to connect to internet through latest version of Nokia suite or Nokia PC using my phone Nokia C5-03. Nokia suite was installed properly and I had connect to internet using my phone in windows
 7 but not in windows 8. When I open device manager I found that no modem driver was installed an their were two CDC Comms Interface devices in unknown devices. When i try to update them them it found driver but was unable to install them and gives error "The
 extended attributes are inconsistent." All other functions of nokia suite works perfecty like updating my phone, viewing my contacts, messages, gallery etc but not connecting to internet.<br />

            <p>Hello Abu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try installing <strong><a href="http://www.nokia.com/in-en/support/product/nokia-c5-03/softwareupdate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia PC Suite?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the troubleshooting steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Windows "Control Panel" go to "Programs and Features" (Win7) and search there "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver". Then highlight that and execute "Change" activity.
</li><li>When the Application starts select there "Repair".</li><li>After repair reboot the PC (may be slightly over reacting but won't hurt) and connect your device with USB cable with your PC. Now it will reinstall your device drivers again.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how the process succeed.</p>

<h2>            Entered prepaid card, and tried to download</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a prepaid card today, and put the funds into my account. &nbsp;So I tried 3-4 times to download Mass Effect 3 Citadel pack part one, and selected the added funds from the prepaid card, and there is an error message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It gave the error "code" as this: &nbsp;<span>15A5B118F8D1AF7 &nbsp;It just said code next to the number.</span></p>
<p><span>I took a&nbsp;</span>screen shot, but can not post it in this message.</p>
<p><span>it does not look like my account is charged, but this is annoying.</span></p>
<p><span>I used my new debit card last time. &nbsp;and it was pretty much error free. &nbsp;The only error was downloading my Fallout New Vegas content, but I figured it out.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>windows 7 backup keeps overwriting previous backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shirahab  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 backup keeps overwriting previous backup</h2>
                    I set up the backup schedule to backup once a day and chose the option to automatically let windows manage space. It only retains the latest backup and keeps&nbsp;overwriting&nbsp;prior backup and prior system image. Likewise with the system image. The size of my
 backup is 44 GB and image is 70 GB. I have 400 GB of empty space on my external hard drive so don't understand why it keeps&nbsp;overwriting.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows automatically saves as many system images as it has space for without taking up more than 30 percent of space on the backup disk. Once the disk
 starts running out of room, Windows deletes older system images. You can set Windows to retain as many system images as it has space for on the backup disk or to only keep the most recent system image. You should always keep the most recent system image. If
 you are saving your system image on a network location, you can only keep the most recent system image.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to:”What backup settings should I use to maximize my disk space”:

            <p>I am amazed on the how bad windows 10 is revealing itself to be. While on the desktop side I find it quite good, everything related to the start menu and store apps is a complete nightmare. The amount of issues related to the app store, and other core apps,
 that suddenly stop working is amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had it several times now on different computers, the last resort has always to be backup user files, delete user account, create again the account, reconfigure everything again (!) and restore files. I am an IT guy and this **** me off greatly, I can imagine
 how other non-IT guys must be feeling right now! I also had issues where the search suddently stops finding the settings and any indexer related solutions does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After soo many times with this my conclusion is that multi-users on the same PC have severe issues where one (non-administrative user) user runs store updates that, somehow, corrupt the other users apps (including corrupting the apps of the local administrator
 account!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From all the pseudo-guru solutions I have seen, none has proved to be a definitive one, some even provided solutions that only applied to the pre-release and that damaged all the accounts, the
<strong>only solution </strong>I found out that really solves these start menu/apps issues was to
<strong>recreate </strong>the affected <strong>accounts</strong>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are now 9 months after the release of windows 10 for PCs and there is not a trouble shooter program delivered by Microsoft that, for the current account, deletes and re-installs the main core apps -- it is better to lose the settings of a few apps than
 to have to backup files, recreate an account and have to reconfigure everything again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have users asking for alternatives to windows 10, some asking for open source alternatives! I am now strongly advising to
<strong>not upgrade to windows 10</strong>, not only personal PCs but, for sure, enterprise ones: just imagine the number of calls to the local service desk because of these issues happening all the time for no reason, having to recreate the domain accounts
 on the affected PCs!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a&nbsp;DVD in the drive it is if the drive is not functioning. Task manager gives me a double dose of "not responding".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If I try to access "my Computer" it locks up. XP</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers, maybe I reinstalled the incorrect driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The bottom line is I cannot write to a blank DVD-R.</p>

            Test by swapping out the drive for a known-working one. If that one is fine, discard the original drive since it has failed.

<h2>            I cannot open email in Windows Live Mail 2012 - getting message &#34;A problem has occurred while trying to open this message&#34;.</h2>
                    I have tried to repair, uninstall and reinstall the product, but no luck with either. I have been having trouble with this product for a while, it started with an error message when receiving messages (don't have a note of this), then I had an issue with
 the Windows platform not responding, now this. Any help would be appreciated. I have even tried a clean removal prior to reinstalling. Still no luck.

            <p>Hi tinygal73,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue you are encountering is usually an indication of a corrupt <span>Mail.MsMessageStore file. We can try to repair the file to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span><span>1. Restart the computer. (this is to ensure that Live Mail is fully shut down, and that none of
<span>it's</span> components are in use when the computer starts)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click Start, type CMD but do not press enter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. You will see cmd.exe in the search results, right click on it and select Run as Administrator - type your admin password if asked, and if UAC pops up asking
<span>premission</span>, allow it</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. You should now see the command prompt, with the following displayed:</span></span></span></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</span></span></span></i></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</span></span></span></i></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt; </span></span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Copy the following (<span>Ctrl+C</span>)</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><b><span><span><span>esentutl.exe -d "%<span>userprofile</span>%\<span>AppData</span>\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\<span>Mail.MSMessageStore</span>"</span></span></span></b></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: the "" are necessary</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6. Right click in the command prompt Window, and select Paste, so you now see the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</span></span></span></i></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</span></span></span></i></p>
<p><i><span><span><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;esentutl.exe -d "%<span>userprofile</span>%\<span>AppData</span>\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\<span>Mail.MSMessageStore</span>"</span></span></span></i></p>
<p><span><span><span>7. Press enter. <span>esentutl</span> will now defragment the Live Mail database file</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8. Once done, you can close the command prompt, and restart the PC again</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know if this works or not or whether you have already tried the steps so we can assist further if needed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>I have completed the steps above and but WLM will not launch&nbsp;now. The error message is "</p>

<p>If you have no issues synchronizing your newly created account with your Windows Live Mail, it is possible that your old account&nbsp;has not been properly configured to your mail client. Please try to reconfigure your account to your mail client then let us
 know if issue still persists.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another update. I have created a new user on my laptop, and transferred all my email into Windows Live Mail. It worked for a while, however now, email I have in the Storage folders no longer opening with ("An error has occurred while opening this message")
 and I have attempted to move some email from the inbox into Storage folders and when I try to open the message in the storage folder, the message is unrelated to the title of email. For example, I tried to open an email relating to an order from Amazon and
 the message behind it was a personal message from a friend. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise as this has been going on for weeks and I cannot go on indefinitely without software to manage my email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to uninstall and reinstall Windows Essentials 2012 and am still having issues. I created a new account as advised and loaded all my current and archived emails into the new user setup. Everything was working fine, then the emails in the
 storage folders stopped opening (A problem has occurred......), the header on some emails are different to the detail ie could have an email from Amazon, when I open it, it has detail from a personal email. I tried to move some emails into my archived folders,
 they would not open, I moved them back into the inbox and now the&nbsp;detail has disappeared. This has been going on for weeks and I'm at the end of my tether. There is something going with the messages, not to mention WLM will still not open in my original user
 account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>Regards</p>

    <title>Mouse Cursor stuck at medium size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juanal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Cursor stuck at medium size</h2>
                    <p>Ok, first a little bit of info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a desktop PC and an Asus Zenbook 303LN, both with Win10 (64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mouse is a Logitech Ultrathin Touch - eventhough I doubt that's relevant, since the driver/software that comes with it doesn't offer any options regarding my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what happened:<br />
I played around with the Win10 settings and ended up in the "Ease access"-settings (non-english native here, forgive any bad translations).</p>
<p>On the "Mouse"-tag I just checked out the different sizes and colours.</p>
<p>When I wanted to return to regular settings (small / white), the <strong>cursor was stuck at medium.</strong></p>
<p>Changing the colour also changed the size, so when I selected "black", the size went to normal (=smallest in my case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can not revert the cursor to it's standard settings, not even from within system settings -&gt; Mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried "<strong>synching</strong>" the settings from my Desktop to the Laptop, which...well, "kinda" worked.</p>
<p>The cursor on the Desktop is working fine now, the Laptop one is <strong>seriously tiny now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p />

            I am having the same problem as described. Is there a solution? Please tell us if there is a solution rather than simply offer no response? Your above recommendation does not work. I have a new Surface 3.

<p>As I said, above solutions did not work for me either, and I really can't tell what I did to revert the settings.</p>
<p>Probably it was due to some update, but I really can't tell.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else around here has a "proper" solution...</p>

            <p>I know you've already resolved the issue, but for anyone that still has this problem, what I did was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Navigate to the "Mouse" properties menu (Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Mouse or hit the windows key and search "Mouse," just be sure to select the one with the mouse icon, not the new gear wheel for the new settings panel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Click the "Pointers" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Under "Scheme," select "Windows Default (system scheme)" under the drop down menu. At the time I was experiencing the issue, "(None)" was selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did it for me. I saw that you also went to system settings -&gt; Mouse, but not sure if you did what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an i7/8GB/256 Surface Pro 4 (Windows 10). Interestingly, I also have the Logitech Ultrathin Touch Mouse T630, but I uninstalled setpoint because it didn't play well with the precision trackpad. Works fine otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

            I had this and drove me insane, if you're using mouse without boarders check you're using the right mouse.

            <p>I found the solution!!!! What happens is the scheme for the normal mouse gets overwritten by the medium scheme so you have to manually set up the normal mouse as it one was. To do this go to Settings - Personalize - Themes - Mouse pointer settings. You'll
 notice the scheme selected is none but all the icons are big. Double click on each one and select the pointers you want as your default. Then click apply. You are welcome, I had to find this out on my own. I hope the overwriting gets fixed soon.</p>
