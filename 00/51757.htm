                    <p>Spun off from this thread:<br />

<p>I have an error message on my OneDrive icon that files weren't uploaded to OneDrive. All are .Ink files i.e. they relate to my desktop shortcuts and this is the message against each one:</p>
<p>[Switched from&nbsp;Edge to IE11 so I can insert the images.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0198ad14-fabf-4b85-898b-64f03c98ea39?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0198ad14-fabf-4b85-898b-64f03c98ea39?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This message appears against each one</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled several of the files shown using Revo free and a later search shows they have gone but still the 'no access permissions' messages are shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that despite the error messages I can get to and open&nbsp;the files with no problem so there is no practical effect on what I can do. But I've been told many times by many experts in this Community that if something appears to broken when
 it shouldn't be I should come here for help as it might be a symptom of hidden problems so can anyone help please?
<strong>Is </strong>it a sync problem?</p>

            Hi Taffy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I think is happening there is that OneDrive is protecting your Desktop shortcuts against Files On Demand being chosen to download them only on demand, when they must be available on the desktop at all times.  
<br />
<br />See here for more about Files on Demand:  
<br /><a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />Check the Settings to see if you have files only downloaded on demand because if so all it will place in Explorer is a symlink which is not the actual file itself until you download it.  This would make desktop shortcuts inoperable.  For this reason those files may be excluded entirely and not just when On Demand.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Xbox 360 Slim Wi-Fi problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eligibletrash65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim Wi-Fi problems</h2>
                    
<p>Over the past year the wireless capability of my Xbox has become near useless. I am able to connect to Xbox Live in most cases, however it can take many minutes to launch the Dashboard and display online features. Trying to update games is also near impossible
 as files as small as 2mb exceed my patience - taking 25 minutes or more before giving me an error message. Everything works flawlessly over a wired connection and all other wireless devices in the house function normally. I should also add that I now have
 a Halo 4 Edition Xbox which also experiences the same issues, along with a new router. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<div>
<p>A weak wireless signal can cause poor Xbox LIVE performance. Check your wireless signal strength. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<strong>Guide</strong>&nbsp;button on your controller, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and select&nbsp;<strong>System Settings</strong>.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Network Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select your wireless network name if you are prompted to do so. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Test Xbox LIVE Connection</strong>. </li><li>Do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>If your wireless signal strength is one or two bars, try improving your signal strength using the tips below.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<div>

<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnxeassets.xbox.com%2fshaxam%2f0201%2f9b%2f03%2f9b034756-3342-4896-8b0e-d4831beb40b7.JPG%3fv%3d1%23networkredboxed-m-m.JPG" /></div>
</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<div>
<p><strong>How to improve your wireless signal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Move your router or gateway</strong>&nbsp;off the floor and away from walls and metal objects (such as metal file cabinets).
</li><li><strong>Move your Xbox console</strong>&nbsp;off the floor and away from walls and metal objects. Remove your console from an enclosed entertainment center, bookshelf, or TV stand.
</li><li><strong>Minimize obstructions</strong>&nbsp;along a straight-line path between your console and your wireless router or gateway. Possible obstructions include TVs, cabinets, appliances, other electronics, and furniture.
</li><li><strong>Shorten the distance</strong>&nbsp;between your console and your wireless router or gateway. Ideally, your network hardware should be near the center of your home.
</li><li><strong>Change the position of the antenna</strong>&nbsp;on your Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter (external adapter only).
</li><li><strong>Turn off wireless devices</strong>. If your router uses the 2.4 GHz band, try turning off wireless devices, such as 2.4 GHz cordless telephones, Bluetooth devices, and baby monitors. If you are using a wireless headset with a base station such as
 the Turtle Beach wireless headset, try moving the transmitter away from your Xbox 360 console, or temporarily turn it off to see if your wireless network signal improves.
</li><li><strong>Try changing your wireless channel</strong>. Wireless routers and gateways can broadcast on different channels, and one channel might be clearer than another. For example, try channels 1 or 11. See your hardware documentation for help with changing
 wireless channels. </li><li><strong>Add a wireless repeater</strong>&nbsp;to extend your wireless network range. You can boost your signal strength by placing a wireless repeater halfway between your router or gateway and your console.
</li><li><strong>Add an Xbox 360 Wireless N Networking Adapter</strong>. If your wireless router is not near the console, an Xbox 360 Wireless N Networking Adapter might improve the signal strength. When you connect a wireless networking adapter to an Xbox 360 S
 console, the console will automatically use the wireless adapter instead of the internal Wi-Fi.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/wireless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Learn how to connect a wireless adapter</a>.
</li><li><strong>Switch wireless signal bands</strong>. If you have a dual-band router and an external wireless adapter, try switching the router to a wireless protocol that transmits on the 5 GHz band (wireless protocol A or N). Note that the Xbox 360 S console
 uses the 2.5 GHz band only. Also, higher-frequency wireless signals have a shorter range. See your hardware documentation for help with changing the wireless protocol.

</p><p><span><span>Hi Rafael,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected.<br />
I'd be glad to help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let’s try few methods to fix this issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: </span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<span>SFC Scan:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check, if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption .The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted,
 changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>Please click on the below link and follow the procedure to run SFC Scan.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Clean boot: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The issue could be due to some third party programs. I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot and install the updates. Clean boot will eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello charliedoodle,</p>
<p>Since the application is trying to reach a website through your company's VPN, you would need to check with your corparate IT staff.<br />
They may have a problem on the server or may have set a new Group Policy. We would not be able to assist with this issue.<br />
<br />
However, you might look at the following KB article that deals with the error message you are receiving.<br />
Click on the KB article number to review the article. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Halo MCC split screen Multiplayer broken</h2>
                    <p>After not playing it for almost a year I turned on MCC and tried&nbsp;to play multiplayer split screen with a friend&nbsp;and matchmaking keeps crashing back to game type selection screen. When I log off the guest acct,&nbsp;single player works just&nbsp;fine. Is there a fix for this as I feel like the latest Xbox update has broken this game even more.</p>

            <p>this is how you work around it.</p><p>1. Press the xbox button on your control.</p><p>2. Scroll all the way left and click "Add New".&nbsp; DO NOT CLICK ADD GUEST.</p><p>3. In order to play any multiplayer matchmaking on MCC all players must have a Microsoft account (This does NOT&nbsp;mean that everyone needs Xbox gold account).</p><p>4. If your guest does not have a Microsoft account, simply create one (it's completely free).</p><p>5. Sign in with this newly created account.</p><p>6. When you start a matchmaking game with this newly created account your still gonna have that stupid "family settings" message pop up. Ignore it, your Xbox live matchmaking game will work.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yes this is really stupid of Microsoft to do...it just makes things complicated but it is the only way around it...</p>

    <title>Remote Desktop Gateway connections fail after Windows 10 Pro is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter henderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Gateway connections fail after Windows 10 Pro is updated to Build 1607 &#40;Anniversary Build&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After an update to my&nbsp; home machine on Windows 10 Pro which changed the Build number from 1511 to 1607, I cannot use Remote Desktop Gateway connections to my workplace. Local network&nbsp;connections on my home network will succeed, but any connection through
 a Remote Desktop Gateway to an outside Terminal Server fail. The error is 'Your computer can't connect to the Remote Desktop Gateway server.'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I 'Recover' my computer back to Build 1511, all my Remote Desktop Gateway connections work correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I work in a school environment and&nbsp;staff use Remote Desktop Gateway connections to log in from outside the school, I am unable to stop users from updating Windows 10 to Build 1607 and some of them are already phoning me to complain they can't work from
 home any more. </p>
<p>
</p><p>While in Build 1607,&nbsp;I can recover&nbsp;back to Build 1511. In the process of doing this&nbsp;I am prompted to&nbsp;first try an auto-search for updates which may fix the issue. However, no updates are found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help to resolve this issue. </p>

            <p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started this post so I will update you all on what is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I updated my Windows 10 Pro PC from Version 10586 to Version 14393.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work as a network engineer in a number of schools in London UK and school staff use Remote Desktop Gateway connections supplied by our ISP (Atomwide) to logon on to internal systems from outside the school to do lesson plans etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update to Windows 10 Pro Version 14393.187, my staff users all report their Remote Desktop Gateway connections to their particular school don't work. The error message is "Your computer can't connect to the Remote Desktop Gateway server".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get my users to 'Recover' back to Windows 10 Version 10586, these connections start working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have approached Atomwide who are the ISP for all of the schools that I support and they report they &nbsp;have made no changes security or otherwise to their Remote Desktop Gateway servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While working in Version 14393, I have tried getting 'Updates' from within Windows 10 Pro Microsoft but these updates make no difference to the Remote Desktop Gateway connections which continue to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am waiting for Microsoft to provide an answer please as I am unable to stop my users from updating on their home computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>I started this post and can't say I am pleased with the outcome. No one has given a resolution that I can use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help my teachers I am using 'recovery' on Windows 10 Version 14393 machines and hoping they have less than ten days since the update. After ten days, Microsoft does not allow 'recovery' to a previous build. So far, I have been able to 'recover' back to
 the previous version but soon I won't be able to to that if more than ten days have elapsed since the update. Frustrating... &nbsp;</p>

            <p>MS is fully aware of this and seem to be uninterested, something is changing with remote access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Win10 Remote Desktop app and it will connect with ease! Problem is you cannot have multiple remote access gateways (or so it seems) right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caveat: BE CAREFUL with the Win10 RD App it allows a user to save their username and password, so with a SINGLE click you can connect to a remote PC,
<strong>and so can ANYONE that has access to&nbsp;that/your PC!!!</strong></p>

            <p>Hello Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. It seems that you're having issues on the color of your photos when trying to print them using Photo Gallery and Photo Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that Photo Gallery and Photo Viewer does not have an option on its end to change the colors of your photos when trying to print them. What they do have is a link on
<strong>Color Management</strong> in your computer. In Photo Gallery, once you hit
<strong>Alt+F</strong>, <strong>P</strong> then choose <strong>Print</strong>, on the lower right side of the screen, you'll see
<strong>Options..</strong>. When you click it, another window will show up and you'll find
<strong>Color Management</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're in Color Management, you'll have the option to go to <strong>Advanced</strong>. We can only provide you the steps to find Color Management at this point and on choosing Advanced. At this point, we suggest that you consult our Windows Support

            The response tells me how to get into Color Management and Advanced for more technically minded colour users but this does not help me. &nbsp;My problem is that photos display fine when opened in Photo Gallery but go to a negative looking colour image in the
 Print window and actually print that way. &nbsp;Photo Gallery worked fine a month ago. &nbsp;Something has changed and I don't know what it is. &nbsp;That is why I wanted to revert to the default settings for the program. &nbsp;I was hoping to avoid having to re-install Windows
 or going to some other program and provider. &nbsp;Any ideas that will solve my problem? &nbsp;See the image below of the picture in proper colours behind with the negative image in the print screen.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd29a78f-dc4f-47ef-8d4f-b132d6b9f792" />

<h2>            KB3124263 - .Net Applications no longer work after installing Windows 10 update</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I tried re-installing .NET and the Visual C++ &nbsp;libraries, but when I run the installer it says that I already have the latest version.</p>

<p>
</p><p>.NET was already installed on my machine and working prior to this update. I only tried to re-install it because the update broke applications that require it. It is enabled under the Windows features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All applications that leverage the .Net framework ( TurboTax 2015, for example) crash after applying the KB3124263 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution that I have found so far is to uninstall the upgrade and hide it so it will not auto-update.</p>

<h2>            Ethernet loses connectivity after sleep mode - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I know that this subject has probably been beat to death, but I was wondering if anyone has found anything that has worked for them to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an Intel(R) Ethernet(2) I219-LM cable into my desktop. So, when I put the computer to sleep and wake it back up, it tells me that it has no internet. I ran the troubleshooter and got the message "Ethernet doesn't have a valid IP configuration."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to solve this problem is to restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have tried unchecking all of the boxes under the "Power Management" tab. I have tried setting the computer's power setting to "High Performance." I have also tried disabling the Wifi adapter. I have tried updating the network adapter driver. But
 it seems like none of these changes have had an effect as the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other methods I've missed? Or is this just something I'll have to deal with till the next update comes out?</p>

            Hello Brian,<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing that you can perform to resolve this is running troubleshooters. To do that, type in
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search bar, press <strong>Enter</strong>, then click on
<strong>View all</strong>. From here, run both the <strong>Power</strong> and <strong>
Network Adapter</strong> troubleshooters.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists, try performing a clean boot to see if there are conflicting programs that are causing the issue. For instructions, you may refer to the link below:<br />

<p><span><span>Hi ronreyna,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp; ----&gt; How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows
 7</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check with the Step 1 (Perform a clean boot):- if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that
 some third party services are causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<strong>Note</strong>: After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a
 higher version of the program and also remember to put the computer back to normal startup)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The
<strong>SFC utility</strong> allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the
 correct versions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can always run a sfc scan on the windows vista computer. To run a sfc scan follow the steps below:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area
 and then click on run as administrator. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. At the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the best!</span></span></p>

<p><span>In control panel Resolution shows 1366 x 768. Directly underneath a yellow triangle with a ! in it, and it says that your resolution is lower than 1200 x 900. I rung acer support today and
 they sent me an email with a link to download windows 10 update driver for intel graphics. I've done that, installed it but it is still the same. When I try to play a game I get a notification, it says my resolution is to low. What else can be done, I'm ready

            Okay so I figured out my problem!!! I right clicked on the desktop and selected the first option that says "AMD catalyst control center" at least that's what my option was. when you open it click on the "desktops and displays" button then you can click
 on "my digital flat panels" then click on "properties for digital flat panel" and then I clicked on "scaling options" and if you play with the arrow above the computer image it will adjust the screen size so you can actually see everything. As far as the gaming
 issue....there is a gaming option under the AMD catalyst control center too! I am not a gamer but it has an option for gaming performance..maybe try that or just play around with it. The wait time for a Microsoft call back is four hours, I just figured it
 out on my own..some how!! I'm not a big techie but this worked for me?? Hope it helps y'all! Jen.

<p>I do know that for many of you this problem has been solved by the other person who submitted a answer but for my solution I found that all I needed to do was update my drivers for my graphics card. Look up in the search bar, Geforce or Intel depending on
 which graphics card you have installed, that's what helped for me!</p>

            I have been using Windows 10 for quite some time. A few weeks ago, when I booted up, my screen resolution changed. I cannot get it to reset to what it was before. Now the highest I can set it to is 1280 X 1024. That is the highest that shows on my control
 panel for screen resolution. Did my computer lose the Windows 10 program?

            Make sure Windows and your drivers are all up-to-date. Also open task manager and check if there are unknown or 3rd party programs running/enabled in startup. Switch them off. Consider running a virus scan too, as malwares can considerably slow down your
 PC.

<div>Bonjour, une tentative d'infection par un mail, bloquée par Windows Defender et mis en quarantaine. redémarrage demandé et fait, mais apparemment un fichier n'est pas retiré et il est signalé avec son chemin,il s'agit de "Mondial-Relay-Suivi-Colis.vbs.
 Divers logiciels de traitement des virus (dont le virus scanner de Microsoft et USBfix et ZHPcleaner et ZHPdiag3) ne supprime pas ce fichier, le message est toujours là, comme j'ai le chemin et que je n'ai pas envie de garder un fichier en .vbs, je l'ai supprimer
 manuellement et j'ai vidé la corbeille, mais maintenant j'ai un message de Windows Script Host qui cherche le fichier que j'ai supprimé. Que dois-je faire ?<br />
Merci de votre aide </div>

            Salut Claude,
<br />
<br />Ceci est causé par les restes d'une infection par un logiciel malveillant qui reste sur votre système, vous devriez exécuter un scan avec la version gratuite de MalwareBytes
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Une fois cette analyse terminée, redémarrez votre PC

            Windows Defender est intégré. Lorsque vous ouvrez Démarrer, tapez: defender apparaît-il dans les résultats de la recherche?
<br />
<br />Avez-vous un utilitaire antivirus tiers installé?
<br />
<br />Vous devrez peut-être effectuer une mise à niveau de réparation:

<br />
<br />Windows Defender is built in. When you open Start, then type: defender does it appear in the search results?
<br />
<br />Do you have a third party Antivirus utility installed?
<br />
<br />You might need to perform a repair upgrade:

<p>J'utilise un logiciel de montage vidéo Pinnacle Studio et au bout d’environ 1 heure, le logiciel se plante et il est impossible de le relancer.</p>
<p>J'arrête le PC, je le redémarre et j'arrive à relancer Studio et je ne travaille plus avec le PC ayant d'autres activités</p>
<p>En fin d'après-midi j je travaille avec Sdtudio et là surprise, le message d'erreur ne se manifeste plus et Studio fonctionne normalement !</p>
