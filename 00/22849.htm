    <title>Closing Xbox Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captainblackbeard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Closing Xbox Account</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys hoping some one can help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was younger I set up an Xbox 360 account (account 1) on my main email. (email 1) Being young I didn't have any dollar for this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later I set up a new account (account 2) on another email. (email 2) This xbox account went on to be my main account for the next 8 years and likely the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to close the first account (account 1) so that I can move the email (email 1) over to my now main xbox account (account 2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically account 2 will have email 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is when I was going through the closing down process it mentioned that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You will lose access to Outlook.com, Hotmail, and OneDrive.</strong><br />
<span>You'll
<span>You'll
 no longer have access to any mail, documents, or photos you've stored using these Microsoft services.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I
 assume this means I'm only loosing mail etc that is saved to these devices and not losing the entire hotmail account itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So
 to sum up:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.
 Does closing my xbox account cause me to lose my hotmail account?</span></p>
<p><span>2.
 Will it be possible to move my account to my main hotmail account once I've closed it?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Cheers
 to whoever helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>There is a very good chance that you are seeing the effects of a hijackware infection.</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>

    <title>Excel file won&#39;t open and&#47;or reverts to previous version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel file won&#39;t open and&#47;or reverts to previous version</h2>
                    So, I've googled and searched to no avail.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on a macbook pro, using Excel 2011.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an excel file that I work on at least 3 times a week and save every time. It is a multi-sheet document (a personal budget with each tab representing a month of the year). The file was originally created on 2004 or 2008, I'm not sure. But i've had
 zero problems with the file ever, until now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last week I went to open this file, and it somehow had the past 4 months of data missing. It was as if nothing was touched since June. Let me be clear, I save this file EVERY day as I'm updating data constantly. There are no recovered versions anywhere.
 When I search for the file in excel under "recent items" the file name shows up 4-5 times.Yes, you read that right.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Three files seem to have no changes since June. I click to open it and I get "THE FOLLOWING DATA MAY HAVE BEEN LOST: TABLE"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One file has the page formatting (colored cells, etc but no data) through October.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;One file is a blank icon that says "user/username/trash.hd" (I definitely did not trash anything).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The file that I keep in my dock just won't even open. the message "EXCEL CANNOT OPEN THIS FILE. THE FILE FORMAT OR FILE EXTENSION IS NOT VALID. VERIFY THAT THE FILE HAS NOT BEEN CORRUPTED AND THAT THE FILE EXTENSION MATCHES THE FORMAT OF THE FILE)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suffice it to say, I am stumped. I save this file every time, I didn't trash it, or alter it. There are various versions appearing both in excel recent docs AND spotlight. I can't find a recovered version, and every tip/trick I've read doesn't work:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've renamed the files, changed from xlsx to xls, made copies, emailed copies, tried making a zip file, a pdf file, a word file...I've tried recovery trial software, disk repair, searching every forum I could find. I've googled the prompts listed above,
 I've tried searching by date, searching for data I knew was in newer versions of the file. &nbsp;you name it--I've tried it. It's as if the past 4 months of data never existed. I have no idea why spotlight even recognizes multiple versions of the file rather than
 just one, or why some have different information. they are ALL the same file name, there are no variances. (actually 3 are xls and the other xlsx. and the 5th is the xlsx that won't open. even when I've changed it to .xls)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am STUMPED. Help? Anyone?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I greatly appreciate any advice or input. I can't seem to find this exact scenario anywhere and losing 4 months of data is kind of a HUGE loss for me. I can't get any of the information back. Thank you so much in advance!!!</div>
</div>

<h2>            Outlook is an unoptimized piece of garbage</h2>
                    You have updated outlook to the point to where it runs slow, good job Microsoft.&nbsp; The people totally need 83 million themes to choose from and all of these fancy functions like focused mail to make checking emails rocket science.&nbsp; An email platform should
 never slow down a web browser but congratulations - you've done just that.&nbsp; Hotmail was by far the greatest platform for e-mail that I have ever used and beats even the competition in 2018 regardless of being 5 years old.

    <title>Date picker value - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nalani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date picker value</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a date picker (DTPicker1) on a user form.&nbsp; In the document I have a docvariable ("DateEnd").&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The starting value of the date picker (in properties) is 10/12/2012</p>
<p>In the userform code this runs when command button is clicked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Variables("DateEnd").Value = Format(DTPicker1.Value, "mmmm dd, yyyy")</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Range.Fields.Update</p>
<p>The docvariable populates with December 31, 1899 no matter what date I put in the picker box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I run this code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ufrmMain.DTPicker1.Value</p>
<p>it returns:&nbsp; 12:00:00 AM</p>
<p>I have other docvariables that are text which populate correctly from text boxes.</p>
<p>If I don't have the format code and populate with the value it returns 12:00:00 AM</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong with the date picker - how do I get the date?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;EDIT: The format of the date picker is set to short date.</p>
<p>EDIT - naturally I found the solution right after I posted.&nbsp; I need to add the format switch to my docvariable field:&nbsp; \@ "MMMM dd, yyyy"</p>

                    <p>I am being continually bugged by the script error message box even though the advanced settings tab</p>
<p>shows this as being turned off (un-checked).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Is my IE program corrupted?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have never had this happen before IE 9.&nbsp; What could be causing this?</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>check (not uncheck)</p>
<p>"disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)" and "disable script debugging (other)"</p>
<p>but uncheck "display notification about every script error"</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Just press the Reset Advanced settings button on the advanced tab of Internet Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If still no joy, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running in no-Addons mode.</p>
<p>Start&gt;Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;System tools&gt;Internet Explorer(no addons)</p>

<p>I'll try your 2 suggestions of using the reset tab and running without addons and go from there.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know of a toolbar called Spyswat that is known for turning on the IE debug options without user consent. Uninstall it if installed .... the dubious protection it proclaims to offer is no longer needed in IE9 with smart screen filtering.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            here maps on W10 mobile</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am still using my Lumia 830 on W 8.1. and I have a option to update software to W10. The main thing I am concerned of is can I still use Here maps on W10. That is an important segment why I still use windows phone. I heard that Here maps are no longer
 available on W10. Is it true? On W8.1. I still get updates of the maps. How are the other things on W10 for Lumia 830, battery life, gmail, Whatsapp and usual, most used apps?</p>

If Office 365 on Mac doesn't have this feature, this is such a pity. If it does, please show me where to find it or how I can enable it.</p>

<h2>            Allow public&#47;guest users to upload content using SharePoint&#47;OneDrive</h2>
                    
<p>I just signed up for a Small Business Office 365 trial and I'm playing around with OneDrive and SharePoint. Previously, I have used sites like JotForm.com to create forms and allow people to upload content to me. I run a printing business for artists and
 I'd like an easy way for them to send me high-res art files of up to 500 MB.</p>
<p>Obviously my 1 TB of site space would be perfect for this. I just don't see how to create a form that anyone can access and upload content with.</p>
<p>Is this possible with SharePoint? I would want them to not only upload content but to also put in a title, description, and other form fields to tie to the submission.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible. You may create a SharePoint list and add other required columns for description and other form fields. The attach file feature is by default an available feature when creating items. Eventually, share the list with your customers so
 that they can sign in to create items(upload art files and fill in description) in it.<br />

<p>3 . Uninstall the following present installations of Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Restart the computer and log back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Download the latest .NET Framework installer here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653</a> and get the earlier version if you have programs

<p>Any chance that you have Webroot SpySweeper installed? What Anti-virus / Anti-malware you have on your Windows? Maybe you can try disabling all existing Anti-virus / Anti-malware software that you have on your PC, then try to install Nokia Suite again.</p>

    <title>Caller ID Incorrect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pherix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caller ID Incorrect</h2>
                    <p>Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with the name associated with my Caller ID being incorrect.&nbsp; I have a Skype provided number, and choose to use that as my Caller ID.&nbsp; However, the name associated with that number is incorrect.&nbsp; This just recently changed today, and
 no changes have been made to my account.&nbsp; Additionally, I do not see where I can change the actual NAME on the Caller ID.&nbsp; I have worked in VOIP before, and understand how the Caller ID name works, and that it takes time to populate among the databases.&nbsp; Once
 again, please READ:&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not about me changing the Caller ID NUMBER - I know how to do that.&nbsp; I have also tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>â€¢&nbsp; Disabling the Caller ID and then re-enabling it.&nbsp; (Does not solve the issue).</p>
<p>â€¢&nbsp; Adding an additional number, such as a cell phone for the Caller ID.&nbsp; (This works, but is not a solution.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution I am looking for is to have my Skype "Dial In" number that I pay for to show up as my name, when I call land lines.&nbsp; In looking up the number, I see that the registrant for my number is Bandwidth.com, but as I am not a direct customer of theirs,
 they refused to help me, and advised that I go through Skype technical support to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>â€¢&nbsp; The Caller ID NUMBER is showing correctly, the Caller ID NAME is not.</p>
<p>â€¢&nbsp; This is with calls to a US based number, no international calls.</p>
<p>â€¢&nbsp; This is happening to calling multiple contacts, and not just limited to one recipient.</p>
<p>â€¢&nbsp; This just started happening TODAY (9/30/2018), and calls to the same number last night showed my CID NAME correctly.</p>
<p>â€¢&nbsp; All of my information within my Skype / Microsoft account is correct, and has not been updated to cause any change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, but please ensure you read the post as to not post information that is not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

 do not know how Caller ID works through SIP trunking, so please refrain from answering this question any further.</p>

<h3> noskosteve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing Quarantined Threat Files &#38; Recommended Actions</h2>
                    <p>I had all the "Recommended&nbsp;action" settings&nbsp;selected (Settings&gt;Default Actions) and on today's scan some items marked as Severe Threats were only Quarantined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears from other answers that the Remove Button on the History page only removes the History Log Entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; I changed my settings to remove Severe Threats, but how do I retroactively remove the Quarantined items?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Shouldn't I remove these quarantined items?&nbsp; I'd feel better if I could... (;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;If it matters, they are all Java/CVE-2012-1723.xxx</p>
<p>I also have the "[x] Apply recommended actions" box checked and don't fully understand its function vs. the selected entries above it.&nbsp; It does not change the above selections to "recommended", so what is its function on vs. off?</p>
<p>Otherwise MSE appears to be working fine.</p>

            <p>Thanks Ahaap,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I read that page before posting and it recommends to&nbsp;REMOVE &nbsp;Severe Threats, yet the Setting page Recommended Action has Quarantined these.&nbsp; What is the advantage of leaving this malicious code on the computer?&nbsp; It just takes up hard drive space needlessly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also had set the Remove Quaranteed items in one day. That is the shortest choice, so I'll have to stick with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2:</p>
<p>What about the "[x] Apply recommended actions" check box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't fully understand its function vs. the selected entries above it.&nbsp;One interpretation is that it sets all the above settings to "recommended, but it&nbsp;does not change the above selections to all "recommended".</p>
<p>So, what is its function on vs. off?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span>So you are saying that *I* should be checking the quarantined filenames&nbsp;to see if they look like something I need.&nbsp; This is virtually impossible because there are all kinds
 of things that have names that are valid files, but make no sense to users like me (even though I am a more advanced user).&nbsp; With&nbsp;things like&nbsp;Java scripting being loaded on computers from remote web sites, there are all kinds of cryptic short filenames possible.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been assuming that MSE looks at the contents of the files and verifies the malware code as a known type.&nbsp; I was unaware that quarantining was to allow users to get
 involved and provide final screening.</span></p>

<p><span>RE:</span></p>
<p><span>" Unchecking the recommended actions is not recommended.&nbsp; You want MSE to act on and malware findings, whether you take the default recommended actions or set your own recommended
 actions."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This still does not tell me what that check box actually does.&nbsp; The words do no justice to the underlying function.</span></p>
<p><span>1 - Does it override my choices above and perform, instead the MSE "Recommended Action" which is to Quarantine Severe Threats?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it did this I would expect either: my choices to be grayed out and unchangeable, or all of them would change to â€œRecommended Actionâ€.</span></p>

            <p>Not sure what the issue is. You can build a form using Access that was designed for the 8" tablet. The issue is that trying to enter data on an 8" tablet with an onscreen keyboard is different from entering data on a larger tablet which is different from
 entering data on a laptop or with a full external keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is true of an iPad or Android or Win 8 tablet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I assume that your issue is that the document is opening in Protected View. &nbsp;If you do not want that to happen, right click on the document in the File Explorer and then click on Properties and check the "Unblock" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is there to protect you, you can disable that feature by going to File tab in Word and then to Options&gt;Trust Center&gt;Trust Center Settings&gt;Protected View and uncheck the desired boxes. &nbsp;If you do that, you should be sure that you can trust the source
 of the documents that you are downloading.</p>

<p>Mr. Sourav, for how many times should we have to tell you that the official Windows 10 Mobile upgrade is not going to release for Lumia 1320? You've been told several times by this community that this is never going to happen! Now you've created a new account
 for Microsoft Community and still writing the same thing... Are you out of mind?</p>

<p>I tend to use Copy Style and Paste Style instead of the Format Painter. To copy the object style, press Ctrl + Shift + C. To paste the object style, press Ctrl + Shift + V.</p>
<p>If you like these commands and prefer to click a button you can add them to your Quick Access Toolbar:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Quick Access Toolbar and then click <strong>Customize Quick Access Toolbar</strong>
</li><li>From the <strong>Choose commands from</strong> drop down, select <strong>Commands not in the Ribbon</strong>
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Apply Style</strong> and then click <strong>Add</strong> to add it to your Quick Access Toolbar.
</li><li>Do the same for <strong>Pick up Style</strong> </li></ol>
<p>Also note you need to make sure the object is selected and that the text isn't active in order to copy/paste the shape formats.</p>

    <title>All contacts lost&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laureen ferchaud  say:</h3>
<h2>            All contacts lost&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I logged with the new Microsoft account, there was no contacts in my profile. I tried on both the Skype App (Windows 10), and on the Web app. Still no contacts. I logged with my old profile (ID created long ago that was impossible to change): still
 no contacts! I now just merged both accounts as it was offered by Microsoft that detected both accounts Under the same email address. Merge seemed to work fine, however, I still have no more contacts in my profile!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can help please??? This is worrying and handicapping! Thanks in advance for any help relocate my contacts book and possibly discussion history. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5eb98ee9-4137-4ef5-af0e-3b278d808f53" title="Laureen Ferchaud">
<p>
</p><p>Please be&nbsp;guided that newly created Microsoft account does not acquire any information like contacts from a Skype account. All contacts are tied to an account and be visible&nbsp;as long as you are using the correct credential upon signing in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, since you are signed in to the new account&nbsp;and sign in again using the old Skype account after, the system still detected the new account and redirect the page to it. That is the possible reason why the contacts are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are certain&nbsp;to be the correct account, you may have been affected by the on-going issue that we have, it was identified that contacts are missing after merging accounts (Skype and Microsoft account). Rest assured that your contacts are still on your
 account and our&nbsp;team is rapidly working on a fix and you will receive updates on this

<p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still having this issue?</p>
<p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern regarding the RSS Feed folder, we'd like to ask some information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When did the issue start?</p>
<p>2. Did you create any rules before on your account?</p>
<p>3. Is it only specific senders that are filtered to go to the RSS folder or random emails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>
