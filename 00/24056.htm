<h2>            Firmware Updates in the UK - Campaign for Equality</h2>
                    
<p>The purpose of this post is to gather together all of the UK Nokia owners that are tired of waiting for firmware updates. The problem isn't new but one that has been happening for at least the last two years.&nbsp; Delays in updates being released in the UK have
 ranged from two weeks to two months lately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am asking for is not special treatment but that the UK is given the same treatment as many other countries. Surely things cannot be so different in the UK that we have to wait so long each time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like many people here I pay extra to get sim free phones because I do not like waiting for networks to approve firmware.&nbsp; Because of these delays it's now almost as bad as buying the network branded versions!&nbsp; We pay our money so we really should be entitled
 to updates as soon as they are released in other countries. Also it would be nice to have access to FOTA updates but they seem to be rarely available in the UK, a great system is being wasted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spoken to various people in Nokia Care UK about this and they are totally in the dark as to why this happens.&nbsp; I have also had no end of excuses and not one of them can answer this simple question:
<strong><em>What makes the UK so different from the other countries that get firmware quickly?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not looking for excuses from Nokia just a change to make things better for all UK users.&nbsp; I have noticed many people have commented about the situation over the years yet it still goes on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please nokia can you sort out this situation in the UK once and for all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UK owners please feel free to support this thread. The more of us that post on this thread the more likely it will reach someone that can make a difference.</strong></p>

            I'm with you on this one.<br />
<br />
Like you, I'm getting thoroughly cheesed off with the wait, especially as there are several network-branded variants even that have had the update long since. For the life of me I can't see what makes the UK CV so special.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if someone were to push a button somewhere and allow the update for the 5800XM with PC 0575581, but will that cure the problem? I doubt it. With the N97's V20 about to be released next month, I'm seriously wondering if the UK will even have
 V12 by then.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I think the future is to buy unbranded handsets in continental Europe and have them shipped over. At least we'll get Euro code handsets, which seem to be several weeks ahead of the UK variants, and the warranty is valid throughout the E.U.

            I'll add my voice to this. The official "Nokia Software Update News" RSS feed and website tell me that firmware 12 is available for my device, but neither NSU or the FOTA on the device allow me to download it. Contacted Nokia asking about this and still
 waiting for the usual reply.

<p>Here's another voice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am even more unlucky as I have a Vodafone branded N97 Black (PC 0585262) so I have to wait a little longer after the UK Sim free version of the FW (PC 0585162) releases. I was hopeful after v11 was available for my product code reasonably quickly after
 it's initial generic release date. v12 appears to be a whole different matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If v12 imporves performance as many have said accross the world, why can't we get these improvements in the UK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My worry now is that I won't get v20 'til some time next year at this rate. If you ship out a partially defective device into the market the least you can do is make imprvements available to those who support your brand when they become available and not
 after the fact. If there is a reason the UK version is delayed, tell us. At least a degree of transparency would be better than the brick wall policy presently being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The present UK policy means that users will either leave Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rant complete for now.</p>

<p>My Girlfriend has had version 30 on her 5800 since mid July. Nearly 2 months on and still no sign of it for my UK Variant. Both devices Came from the same Store in the UK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same with the N97. Almost a month since v12 was released and still no sign of it over here.</p>
<p>by the time we get v12, v20 will be here requiring us to wait another couple of months</p>

<p>Most if not all of my hardware that can recieve a firmware update is not tied down by a restriction on the country i reside in . Odd that the firmware gets rolled out on an individual basis rather than being put up on the servers for all even if one continent
 gets rolled out a week later than another .</p>
<p>Question i ask is what damage is it going to do to UK phones this&nbsp; must be the reason its witheld .</p>

<p>You have my support as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had every Series 60 based Nokia since the 7650 (&amp; i do mean every device!) &amp; i remember how much of a pain it was having to go to a service point to get the critical updates (especially as i live 42 miles from the nearest one!) When Nokia released
 the NSU &amp; FOTA updates i was overjoyed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately i have now come to realise that although these services are great, we here in the U.K are often&nbsp;treated as "Second Class" &amp; have to wait forever to get these updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;work in The Carphone&nbsp;Warehouse (probably Nokia U.K's biggest retail partner) &amp; i'm finding it increasingly difficult to recommend the latest N-Series handsets when i know they are riddled with bugs that we have to wait months for Nokia to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still remain loyal to Nokia &amp; the Series 60 platform (I'm also a moderator on the AAS Forums) but i'm starting to feel like that loyalty is misplaced. Come&nbsp;Nokia, Treat us as equals or you may find more of us turning to the dark side (3GS)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            E-Mail address rewrite</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a Exchange /office 365 hybrid setup. Mx is pointed to Office 365 so all the incoming mails first come to Office 365. I am getting a mail from outside which is "<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>". Can i change this e-mail address to something
 else like "<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>" before it reach to users via a transport rule or any other method?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Account was accessed by someone else - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phantoplasm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account was accessed by someone else</h2>
                    <p>Earlier in the morning I received a text from Microsoft (a number from which I have used to get verification codes from before) that my account may have been accessed by someone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the link to account.live.com and sure enough, I was asked for verification once again and after doing so, it was confirmed somehow that my account had been accessed by someone else and that I should change my password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some concerns. Why wasn't my account locked down or blocked from whoever it was that accessed my account? It doesn't seem like security is very efficient here if all I received in the wake of being hacked was an unsure message that I had been hacked,
 with no extra precautions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My emails have since all been deleted, strangely enough. I checked my recent activity and saw that someone from Russia did a security verification for my account once at 4 am my time, then at 7 am, three hours again later, even though I did not receive a
 verification code AT ALL. At this time, however, I received the text from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am extremely weary of the fact that someone was able to access my account because this same account is linked to my OneDrive, which contains all of my personal photos synced straight from my phone. I still do not understand why they were not blocked from
 accessing, and how this possibly happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already changed my password and so on, but what can I do once someone has already been in my account? Why didn't Microsoft do anything beyond notifying me, and not locking the hacker out?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Access 2010&#58; Entering survey data where question and question order are randomized</h2>
                    Access Version: 2010
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background:&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are entering survey data for potentially 8000 survey respondents. &nbsp; We have a question bank (for one section of the survey) of 30 questions, but each respondent sees only 17 questions in a random order. &nbsp;I have a completed table (Question Table) comprised
 of Survey ID numbers (rows) and questions each respondent saw (17 columns); this table is informational only. &nbsp;I have an empty table (Response Table) consisting of Survey ID numbers (rows) and all possible questions (30 columns); this is the table where actual
 responses are stored. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem:</div>
<div>I created a form that will pull up appropriate survey ID# (record#) using a combo box and have entered data entry fields for all data. &nbsp;I would like the form to show only the 17 questions each respondent saw along with a data entry field that will store
 response in correct column in the Response Table. &nbsp;I can do each of things separately- but can't figure out how to map from what the responder saw to our data entry table. &nbsp;Is there a way to accomplish this? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Right now I have simply listed all 30 questions alphabetically which display on EVERY record in the form and we have to pick the appropriate field to enter each question response. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for any help!</div>

            First, you are using a denormalized structure. Your table is like a spreadsheet not a database. You should NOT have fields for each question.
<div><br />
<div>A survey database requires a specific structure. Something like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblQuestion</div>
<div>QuestionID (Primary Key Autonumber)</div>
<div>Question</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblRespondent</div>
<div>RespondentID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>FirstName</div>
<div>Lastname</div>
<div>Other respondent info</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblResponse</div>
<div>ResponseID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>RespondentID (Foreign Key)</div>
<div>ResponseDate</div>
<div><br />
<div>tblAnswer</div>
<div>AnswerID (PK Autonumber)</div>
<div>ResponseID (FK)</div>
<div>QuestionID (FK)</div>
<div>Answer</div>
<div><br />
<div>You enter the data by first entering your 30 questions into tblQuestion. Next you enter your 8000 respondents into tblRespondent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally you have a main/sub form combo to enter the answers. The main form is bound to tblResponse and the subform to tblAnswer and linked on ResponseID. In the main form, you select the Respondent from a combobox and enter the date. In the subform you
 select the questions they answered from a combo and enter the Answer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you already have a table that lists what questions the respondent saw, then you can use that to constrain the Question combo on the subform.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />

            Scott, Thank you for your response. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It took me a couple of read throughs of your response to begin to understand a normalized (?) structure. &nbsp;Are you saying that, for tblQuestion, each question is a row and not a column? &nbsp;We have ~180 questions - so I would have 180 rows in the tblQuestion?
 &nbsp; How would this work in the tblAnswer? I'm having trouble visualizing how the tblAnswer works. &nbsp;Would each question have to have its own tblAnswer? &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm guessing that, in order to "constrain the question combo on the subform," I would need to create a normalized structure. ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, all my tables are like spreadsheets w/each row being a SurveyID# (respondent#). &nbsp; Each survey has ~180 questions so I broke my &nbsp;tblQuestions into 5 tables (e.g. demographics, psych, experiment, background,...) &nbsp; Then I have my tblRespondent and tblSurveyStatus.
 &nbsp;SurveyID is the primary key for each table and how we are going to identify responses when we export the data into a statistical software package. &nbsp;The database is working ok, but the randomized sections feel like slogging thru mud as we have to select correct
 questions from the question pool all of which appear on the form.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again.</div>

            Whenever designing a relational database, you should think vertically, not horizontally. So yes, tblQuestion is just a table of all your questions and an unique identifier. In tblAnswer each survey response is identified by the respondent and the question.
 So if John Doe was asked how much on a scale of 1-10 he likes chocolate, and he answers 8, then you have a record that identifies the respondent (John Doe), the question (How much do you like chocolate) and the answer (8).
<div><br />
<div>While this doesn't actually make data entry that much easier (though in your case, since each respondent may have a different set of questions, it may), it WILL make tabulation and analysis of your data, way easier.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I have decided to construct a database similar to the format you describe here, but have a few questions. What are the relationships that need to be established? What data types are you using? I ask this because for some reason, I experience issues when
 querying my data, where it says "mismatch type error" or something like that. I'm kind of new to Access and so any advice you can give is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Split data into two new tabs based on column</h2>
                    <p>Disclaimer--I do use macros, but I am VBA challenged (I either just record my keystrokes or find a macro online to poach), so apologies up front if I've not explained this well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet with many rows and columns of data in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say the data under column D contains 5 different animal types: "Cat", "Dog", "Goat", "Cow" or "Horse".&nbsp; I want to create a macro that looks at the 5 different types and then creates 2
 new tabs: "House" and "Barn", and then copies all rows that contain "Cat" and "Dog" in column D into the newly created&nbsp;"House" tab, and copies all the rows that contain&nbsp;"Goat", "Cow" and "Horse" data into the newly created&nbsp;"Barn" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the macro below searching the web, and it's the closest thing I've found to what I want, but it creates one new tab for each type of animal and populates that tab with the rows that have that animal in column D.&nbsp; Can anyone modify this to&nbsp;separate
 them as described above&nbsp;(or if that's not practical, give me a different type of macro--I'm not married to this one...)</p>

            <p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer--I do use macros, but I am VBA challenged (I either just record my keystrokes or find a macro online to poach), so apologies up front if I've not explained this well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a spreadsheet with many rows and columns of data in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say the data under column D contains 5 different animal types: "Cat", "Dog", "Goat", "Cow" or "Horse".&nbsp; I want to create a macro that looks at the 5 different types and then creates 2
 new tabs: "House" and "Barn", and then copies all rows that contain "Cat" and "Dog" in column D into the newly created&nbsp;"House" tab, and copies all the rows that contain&nbsp;"Goat", "Cow" and "Horse" data into the newly created&nbsp;"Barn" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the macro below searching the web, and it's the closest thing I've found to what I want, but it creates one new tab for each type of animal and populates that tab with the rows that have that animal in column D.&nbsp; Can anyone modify this to&nbsp;separate
 them as described above&nbsp;(or if that's not practical, give me a different type of macro--I'm not married to this one...)</p>

<h2>            Calculating the Grade using the values entered form.  VB script help needed</h2>
                    <div>Dear Friends,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a form called Marksheet, in which there are fields like</div>
<div>Subject 1, which is a lookup wizard where the user ill have to select the any one subject from the list.</div>
<div>Next field is Mark 1, whose data type is Number.</div>
<div>In that field the user have to enter the mark for the selected subject.</div>
<div>Next field is Grade 1 which is a text box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I need to diplay the grade of the student as per the following condition.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 89.5 Grade A*</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 74.5 Grade A</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 64.5 Grade B</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 49.5 Grade C</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 39.5 Grade D</div>
<div>Mark 1 &gt;= 24.5 Grade E</div>
<div>Mark 1 &lt; &nbsp;24.5 Grade U</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I came to know that in the after update of Mark1, we have to enter a VB code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can some one please help in doing the code as I am poor in VB scripts in access.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>No VB code is needed at all (though that's certainly one option). You can instead use a table driven solution. Create a little table Grades with a number field Score&nbsp;and a text field Grade&nbsp;with exactly the values you show above (except with 0 for U):</p>
<p>Join this to the table containing Mark 1 with a "non equi join":</p>
<p>SELECT &lt;whatever fields from your table&gt;, Grades.Grade<br />
FROM yourtable INNER JOIN Grades<br />
ON yourtable.[Mark 1] &gt;= Grades.Score<br />
WHERE Grades.Score &lt; (SELECT Max(X.Score) FROM Grades AS X WHERE X.Score &gt; yourtable.[Mark 1]);</p>
<p>This won't be updateable; if that's needed, this is less efficient but will allow updating:</p>
<p>SELECT &lt;whatever fields from your table&gt;, DLookUp("[Grade]", "[Grades]", "[Score] = DMin("[Score[", "[Grades]", "[Score] &gt; " &amp; [Mark 1])) AS Grade FROM yourtable;</p>

            First, I agree with John and Van to use a table based solution. But my reason for responding is I'm bothered by the names of your fields. Having fields like Subject1 and Mark1 imply you have other fields like Subject2 and Mark2. This is denormalized design.
 You should have a separate table something like this:
<div><br />
<div>tblMarks</div>
<div>MarkID (Primary Key Autonumber)</div>
<div>StudentID (Foreign Key)</div>
<div>SubjectID (FK)</div>
<div>SessionID (FK)</div>
<div>Mark</div>
<div><br />
<div>The StudentID identifies&nbsp;which&nbsp;student the Mark is for. The SubjectID identifies what class (subject). The SessionID identifies when the class was taken (either date or semester etc.) And the Mark is the numercial mark. You then use the join as John suggests
 to supply the Letter grade.</div>

<p><strong><em>have to press reset or unplug power and boot again</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Others are using software only workarounds for this.&nbsp; Spare your hardware.&nbsp; E.g. try and start Narrator (press Win+Ctrl+Enter -- with your speakers turned on). &nbsp; Also, is it black or just blank?&nbsp; E.g. if you try waving your mouse around and see its pointer
 moving, it's blank.&nbsp; What you would try next would depend on your hypothesis about what the symptoms meant.&nbsp; E.g. if you are at the Lock screen you wouldn't be able to do much more than press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.&nbsp; There would be more to do at the Login screen,
 such as, in particular, try Win+P&nbsp; to hear what state the Project dialog was in.&nbsp; Then you could try switching it to a different state and that would cause a screen refresh which might help you see something else. &nbsp; Another thing to try is the new magic bullet&nbsp;
 Win+Ctrl+Shift+B.&nbsp; FWIW it usually takes at least two of those to put the screen back to the physically primary monitor. &nbsp; Sometimes I am lucky and the first one lets me stay on the Second Screen Only (e.g. attached HDMI monitor). &nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen is black for me. No cursor nothing. This infact happened when the system update yesterday and was booting up the first time. I kept the system running for an hour or so only to find the black screen. Will try to press the key combinations you
 mentioned and see if that helps.&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>The screen is black for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>There's a optimistic scenario possible for that one too.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if you check with Win-P it may say Second Screen Only already.&nbsp; Then the primary would be black.&nbsp; So the workaround would be&nbsp; Win-P, Home, Enter&nbsp; (to switch to PC Screen Only) and hopefully
 refresh the display that you are looking at.</p>

            This is with the account setup in Outlook desktop, not as a connected account in an Outlook.com account? 
<br />
<br />Do you get new mail in the folders if you select a folder (or change folders and come back)? 
<br />
<br />Go to Send/Receive tab, Send /Receive groups and select Define Send/receive groups from the menu. How often are you checking for new mail? It should be set no lower than 5 minutes.

<h2>            Nokia 6070 - Are there alternatives to PC Suite&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. My uncle wants to transfer his contacts and messages from his mobile to his PC. I know the 6070 supports PC Suite but he said that for some reason, PC Suite isn't working with it. He has tried another program called Mobile Media Browser which did
 work but he can only transfer ringtones and images, not contacts or messages. He has contacted the local Nokia retailer and they said that the only way to get it working with PC Suite is to wipe the memory off his phone so he wants to save his contacts and
 messages in a safe place before he does that.&nbsp; So I wanted to ask, would anyone know any alternative programs that may work instead of PC Suite? Thank you.</p>

<p>Try Nokia's Ovi Suite, instead of their PC Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then there's a program that has been around for a very long time: Oxygen Phone Manager (OPM):

                    I want to be able to share my Office 365 calendar to my Gmail account.&nbsp; I have shared it in Office 365 to my Gmail address and added it to the Google Calendar page via the ICS link (not clicking on the button in the share email, but copying the link and
 manually adding it to my Google Calendar).&nbsp; It shows up after a while, but when I make changes to my calendar in Outlook or on OWA, they do not show up in Google.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas on how to resolve this?&nbsp; I tried using published calendars too and I have
 the same problem there.

            Hi Levi, thank you so much.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am not using Outlook.com Web. or gmail or any other account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I have set up my samsung galaxy S4 with a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync account for &nbsp;my business account - I use microsoft 2010 - windows 2007 and we have Microsoft SBS servers.</div>
<div>I am not using any app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have deleted and re-installed the account several times and sync only works one way for contacts/calendars/tasks - ALTHOUGH emails sync both ways ????</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you if you have any idea</div>
        </p>

            <p>Hi <font color="#0072c6">Martine K.C.</font>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you for getting back to us. However, I still need you to confirm the following before I forward this to our support specialists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could you verify if the meeting or contact that you added from phone does not reflect both in the
<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People</a> and <a href="https://calendar.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Calendar</a> pages? </li><li>Were you able to sync them prior to this incident? If yes, what was the last&nbsp;thing you did that led to this?</li><li>Does issue persist when another Microsoft account is logged in to the Exchange ActiveSync of your phone?</li><li>How about setting up your account using another device, do you encounter the same problem?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, kindly provide the <u>affected email address</u> that Levi has initiated for you. We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi RLOS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask if you are using a Web browser or a Mail Client in accessing your account? And h<span>ave you tried to access your account using a different browser or computer?
 Does the same issue happen?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For the meantime,
<span>I recommend that you clear your browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that they are not causing your issue. This is often caused by a corrupted file&nbsp;in the
 browser.&nbsp;Please clear your browser's cookies by following the instructions on the link below:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the workaround above did not resolve the issue, may I have the impacted email address in the Private
 Message tab I have&nbsp;initiated for you for us to investigate the issue on our end.</span></span></p>

<h2>            cannot create PDF in Microsoft Word or when right click on a file</h2>
                    I used to be able to do this a week ago but now I cannot create a PDF (I have adobe acrobat 8 pro) in Microsoft Word when i click the "save as" option, PDF would be one of the options. This used to work for me. Also when I try to right click a document,
 there used to be an option to convert to PDF. This is now no longer there as well. As a last resort I tried to print the document and for the printer option select "Adobe PDF" but I it looks as if it starts to work but then I get an error message "Windows
 cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup" please help! Thanks
