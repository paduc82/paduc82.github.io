<p>Hello srrktt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we are to assist more directly we would require further information regarding your issue. What kind of connection is being used to connect to this external monitor, e.g. using multiple adapters, or if this is a wireless connection? And does the Surface
 recognize the external display but not show anything, or is there no recognition at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're just looking for some basic troubleshooting regarding external displays you may find it

<p>Hey.</p>
<p>I am using an external adapter. HDMI to mini display port. And the problem cant be with the adapter because it was working before the previous windows update. The TV shows a message when i connect: The resolution isnt supported or something like that. I
 tried to adapt the resolution in the laptop and didnt work, i tried to see if the intel drivers were updated and they were. I really dont understand what it happenned. But i just can relate the problem with the windows update.</p>
<p>I hope to hear from you soon,</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>In order for us to be&nbsp;of further assistance, it would really help for us to have the specific error you are getting.&nbsp; Going off of&nbsp;what you stated, it does seem that the laptop is trying to pass a&nbsp;resolution to your TV that your TV does not support.&nbsp; If
 you could also provide the model number of the TV, that would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try running our Software Diagnostics Toolkit which looks for issues, run some scans, and attempts to resolve a lot of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I would try re-installing your graphics drive.&nbsp; This can be done by typing Device Manager into the search/Cortana box and opening the Device Manager. Once there, locate and&nbsp;expand Display adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the graphics device listed
 and select uninstall.&nbsp; It will prompt for approval and there is a check box there to delete the driver, you can select the box if you wish and hit OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, reboot and the driver will re-install itself and you just need to try projecting to the TV again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, be aware that there&nbsp;are 2 modes, extend and duplicate.&nbsp; If you are trying to duplicate your Surface&nbsp;screen to the TV, it could be using a resolution far to high for most&nbsp;TVs unless you have a 4k TV, so that is worth checking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us&nbsp;know the outcome!&nbsp;</p>

<h3> fuzzytail69  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Home Xbox</h2>
                    <p>so I had&nbsp;placed my account on a friend's Xbox and set it to home because I lived with him at the time, and since I moved out (been over a year) I have purchased my own Xbox one and when I try to set that as my home Xbox it tells me it can only be changed 3 times a year. Which is odd because my account hasn't been set to an Xbox since I have moved out, I've looked up and down all through Xbox.com and Microsoft.com to see when I can change my home Xbox to my current one but I have not found anything, I know it has been over a year since I last set "my home xbox" and I am very displeased, this is my third Xbox account (last two you guys permalocked my accounts for your **** ups) and I'm honestly tired of dealing with problems occurring with my account(s)</p>

            If you can connect your cell phone to your PC, it should show up in Windows Explorer. There, you can copy the MP3s from the cell phone to your Music folder.

            <p>You can use PrntScrn but there's probably a better way and any way of&nbsp;emailing this info is risky.</p>
<p>PrntScrn - this sends an image of the screen to the Clipboard.&nbsp; You then need to open e.g. MS Paint, paste the image in and save it as a file.</p>
<p>If your online banking allows you to download the statement then it is likely to give you a better result.&nbsp; Any download facility is likely to be in a pdf format and decently laid out on the page.&nbsp; You can then email this file.</p>
<p>BUT BUT BUT</p>
<p>You have to assume that every email you send is intercepted &amp; copied by someone.&nbsp; A statement might be used to extract your account number &amp;&nbsp;address and then used to steal from you.</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to provide some information to help you better.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you facing this issue on a local account or the Microsoft account?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you facing this issue with the built in calculator or the calculator app?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to Sign out from the current user account, restart the pc and login to the Admin account or the MSA to test if that helps with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is a built in Calculator I would suggest you to check if you can open and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press Windows + R keys.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type calc and hit Enter and check the status if its opening.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to place the system in Clean Boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when
 you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />

<strong><span>Note: </span></strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to try creating a new user account and check if issue persists.</span></p>

            <p>I have also been having problems with the calculator app supplied on my surface pro, updated to Windows 10. I have read a little of what was posted below as possible solutions but not sure how much of it was relevant in my situation. I did the windows +
 r and typed in calculator and it wanted to open the store, which once in had update as the option. When I clicked on this however, it attempted to do this but had an error (0x80073CF6). I tried going into settings and searching for updates but it said I was
 up-to-date. I have just quickly checked my husbands log-in and it appears the calculator opens for him so just seems to be an issue under my log in. As I understand it we either both have admin accounts or mine is the main one as I am the one who mostly uses
 the computer, there is no separate admin account to log into that I am aware of. I'm also not sure how doing a clean boot will help so am reluctant to go through the process unless I definitely need to do this. I have read on another thread people talking
 about the app not being listed as a trusted app and having to delete their user account and re-create it but again I am reluctant to try this unless absolutely necessary. How do I get the calculator to work again?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VOB files on Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donebb  say:</h3>
<h2>            VOB files on Movie Maker</h2>
                    I have a new laptop that came with Windows 8.1. I downloaded Windows Essentials and Windows Movie Maker Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3508.0205) won't play the video from VOB files. The Audio does play. I had Windows 7 previously and the VOB files played just
 fine.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I copy the file from the DVD and store it on the computer before trying to play it. The file will play just fine in Windows Media Player, VLC Media Player
<i>and </i>Windows Photo Gallery. I tried selecting the file in Photo Gallery and then selecting Create, Movie and it opens the file in Movie Maker but will
<b>NOT </b>show the video. I did download the KLite Codec pack but that did not help.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did download FreeMake file converter to convert the file to WMV, however that is an extra step and now I end up with 2 large files instead of 1.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did run a repair on Windows Movie Maker through the Control Panel but that didn't fix it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? Thanks.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Regarding MPEG-2 files (such as DVD .vob files), support for those formats&nbsp;is only included through Windows 7.&nbsp; For Windows 8 (and 8.1), the required&nbsp;codecs are not licensed and&nbsp;included.&nbsp; This is alluded to in the bottom notes on the supported file types
 where it says, </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Support for using MPEG‑2 and Microsoft Recorded TV Show video files in your movie is available only if your computer is running one of the following editions of Windows: Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium, Windows&nbsp;7 Professional, Windows&nbsp;7 Enterprise, or Windows&nbsp;7
 Ultimate, Windows&nbsp;Vista Home Premium, or Windows&nbsp;Vista Ultimate."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I need to work with MPEG-2 (.vob) files, I too have used Freemake Video Converter.&nbsp; As with any freeware, you
<em>must</em> be careful when installing.&nbsp; <strong><em>Always </em></strong>choose the custom installation and
<em>uncheck <strong>all</strong></em> add-ons it offers to install.&nbsp; Then you'll just get the program without any browser add-ons, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used Adobe Premiere Elements&nbsp;and found it a&nbsp;lot more confusing compared to Movie Maker.&nbsp; I've also used Adobe Premiere Pro which I actually found easier to use compared to Elements -- go figure.&nbsp; But it has a higher cost for the additional pro level
 features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other options to consider:&nbsp; Pinnacle Studio and Nero Video 2014.&nbsp; They are lower end (i.e. less costly) but have additional features compared to Movie Maker.&nbsp; I know Nero Video has a 15-day trial so you may want to try that.&nbsp; If it meets your needs, there
 is an "upgrade" from the trial to the full for $24.99.&nbsp;</p>

            What makes you say your computer is too old for Windows 7? According to the model number you listed your computer will run it. I might add more ram if it still only has 1gb but, you can run it without any problems. I have run Windows 7 with 512mb ram several
 times. You will need to tweak it by disabling some start-up items. <br />
<br />
<span>The minimum requirements for Windows 7 processor speed is 1.0 GHz, that refers to a single core processor. You should be fine.
</span>You have a <span>Intel Core Duo T2300 / 1.66 GHz processor. <br />

            <p>&nbsp;I think a better idea would be to buy a new laptop.&nbsp; Assuming you've decided not to do that, I think I'd follow the philosophy of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".&nbsp; If you have a specific problem you need to solve, address that first.&nbsp; If XP is doing the
 job for you still, I'd leave well enough alone.&nbsp; A lot of folks get into trouble doing upgrades.&nbsp; Save that $100 or so you'd spend for the upgrade and keep saving 'till you can buy a new machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            How to disable High Contrast Mode in my Netbook running on Windows 8</h2>
                    I have successfully upgraded the OS in one of my netbooks from Windows 7 starter to Windows 8 Pro via product key. It was successfully done however, I can not disable the high contrast mode. When I go to the PC settings, I see this notification:<br />
<br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to change the theme to Aero as suggested in the MSDN forum but I don't see any option there:<br />
<br />

<div><br />
I also went over to the high contrast options page in the control panel and unchecked the option as shown below:<br />

</p><p>Now, coming to my problem. As the title of&nbsp;my post says,&nbsp;I've been getting BSOD (since the start of 2017). This month specially hasn't been to kind and I've got multiple BSODs in the last week itself. From the top of my head, as far as I remember, I've tried
 to Format my PC/HDD,&nbsp;tried doing&nbsp;a fresh install of Windows 7, updated all my drivers to their latest versions, run anti-virus scans.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before this (sometime last year)&nbsp;I tried Windows 10 too and it was a disaster. Let's not get started with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC configuration is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Edition: Windows 7 Professional SP1</li><li>System Type: 32-bit OS</li><li>Processor: Intel Core 2 Quad CPU Q6600 @ 2.4GHz</li><li>RAM: 3GB</li><li>Display Driver: NVIDIA GeForce GT 610</li><li>Anti-Virus s/w : Kaspersky Total Security</li></ul>
<p>I've used BlueScreenViewer to get some info from the minidump. Here is a link to the dumps:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsZrwKDnPCXMhSI2TrqKBOIvb7-4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I've missed out on any info. I would&nbsp;appreciate any kind of help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I'll give that a shot and get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you reckon that, this is the only culprit for all various kinds of BSOD errors? Or are you saying that this could be the reason for a handful of them?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Code 28 means the drivers are not installed. Check with the Speaker maker as this could be a known issue and<br />
work down through this troubleshooter starting at the top.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation. System maker is who made your computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound driver often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see if
<br />
the version you installed is there, if not repeat - reboot until it is. It can take several tries depending
<br />
on how many rollbacks it does.<br />
</strong><br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site (who made the actually audio device).<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and the on lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />
that box.<br />
<br />
In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.<br />

            I'm no expert, but if you can create a new project and copy the second part to this new project, you may be able to extract a separate video for each project, thus splitting your video to two splits.

<h2>            Surface dock update issue</h2>
                    <p>hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I bought surface pro 4 along with dock in 2015 December. I didn't update my dock station firmware till today. It was not charging properly at times, and also when I switch it off and on again I will get it working. I can't rely on the dock station for
 longer hours. Today at last after losing my patience, I tried to update my dock firmware, it is not updating beyond 33%. I don't know what to do. Any one who faced the similar issue can guide me if you have any solution.</p>

            Are you using the updater tool  Surface_Dock_Updater_v2.12.136.0.msi for the dock from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a> ? 
<br />
<br />Try a two button reset and run the updater after doing the reset -
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.
<br />
<br />If you are still stuck after doing this, I'm sorry to say that you need to exchange/replace your dock. If you are in the US, you should go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a> - outside the US, contact support <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>.

            Hi BOB332, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me then I will be here to help until this issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />It should always be on in Windows 10. (Some instructions for VM's and other programs still reference older Windows type settings.)
<br />
<br />Enable is just the reverse of Disable:

    <title>Weird sign in error - can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get past - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xnam360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Weird sign in error - can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get past &#38;quot&#59;save password&#38;quot&#59; screen</h2>
                    
<p>Help, I can't sign into Xbox Live!</p>
<p>But the weird thing is: it doesn't seem to be caused by a connection error - the network connection test shows my connection to Xbox Live working fine. Specifically, I can't get past the screen asking whether or not I want my password saved on the console.
</p>
<p>Every time I try to sign into Xbox Live, for some reason it asks for me to confirm my email and password (it never did that before). I don't know why it started doing that, but when I correctly enter my email and password, everything actually appears to
 work fine for a moment. The pop-up message at the bottom of the screen (complete with the pop-up sound effect) appears and says that I have signed in.</p>
<p>But here is where the error happens: The next screen asks if I want my password saved on the console. But on this screen I see the spinning loading circle as if something is still loading... However, it never stops loading! If I just leave it there, it remains
 stuck on that screen as if it's loading forever. </p>
<p>If I highlight the checkbox to save the password and press A, nothing happens. If I highlight the word "Next" and press A, nothing happens. At this point, I'm apparently already connected online, so if I can just get past this screen, then everything would
 be fine.</p>
<p>But at this point, the only button that works is the guide button, which once pressed, causes me to sign out of Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If I try to sign in again, the same thing happens again: It asks to confirm my email, then password, and then gets stuck when it asks whether I want my password saved.</p>
<p>This error just started occurring today.</p>

<p>I would recommend taking your HD out and putting it back in to make sure it is seated right, then i would clear system cache here is link:</p>

<p>I would also recommend deleting your profile, not profile and items just profile, then redownload, and that should fix your issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mike,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using Windows Vista Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>To import files the file name extensions which are supported by Windows Movie Maker are:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Video files: .asf, .avi, dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Audio files: .aif, .aifc, .aiff, .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Picture files: .bmp, .dib, .emf, .gif, .jfif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, and .wmf</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A DSMD file is simply a list file containing the instructions on how to create your DVD. It does not contain any video but only the references to your source file including
 the file path. This file type is not supported by Windows Movie Maker.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, if you want to import a file into Windows Movie Maker that has a different extension from the ones listed above, in the file type list, choose All Files. Windows
 Movie Maker can import most file types, but not all file types will work when you try to use them to make a movie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To import a file:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click File, and then click Import Media Items.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to the file you want to import, and then click Import.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Right click on desktop &#40;context menu&#41;  is slow</h2>
                    I finally have Windows 8 running really well. EXCEPT - if I am on the desktop or browsing files in Win&nbsp; mode, right click takes FOREVER to respond. Any ideas?
<br />
<br />
There are no viruses/malware<br />
I have run SVP<br />
It does it on all accounts<br />

            <p>Hi MarkBaumbach,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that right click on desktop is slow. I will try to help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe mode with Networking and check if the issue persists. Follow the article to start the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2: Perform a clean boot and check for the issue.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the provided link to return your computer
 to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Try to perform a system file checker (SFC) scan.</p>
<p>System File Checker Tool will try to help you in fixing all the corrupted files and folders in the computer.</p>
<p>a. Type “cmd” on the Start screen.</p>
<p>b. Right-click on it and select “Run as administrator”.</p>
<p>c. Type the following command and press Enter:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue
 resolved.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking this on!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been a problem for a while and I can't put an exact date on it. I have uninstalled and reinstalled all of my third party stuff (a long overdue clean up); to no avail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot has the same issue. So do all of the other accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SFC scan reports that it is clean. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the registry context menu entries and rebuilt my indexes. The Recycle Bin and system icons on the desktop right click just fine, all of the others taks 5 - 10 minutes to come up. There is nothing in the event viewer. If I try to do anything
 else on the computer, the explorer will crash and restart. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas other than starting fresh? </p>

            <p>GOT IT!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know what it is exactly yet, but I downloaded a thing called autoruns.exe and ran it (as admin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It showed me all of the context menu options out there. My problem was either Norton 360, WinZip or Corel Photo draw. After they were disabled, it worked GREAT.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I will re enable these one at a time and find the offender and get that software reloaded/updated or just junk it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This software also showed some of the old junk I was still running, like gadgets for WinZip, Groove and other stuff I haven't touched for years. I highly recommend a good clean up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE--- The verdict is IN! It was the context menu handler for my Seagate Replica drive. It is disabled and I am running GREAT again!

            I'm having the same exact issue on Windows 8.1.. Brand new computer too.. <br />

There is definitely an issue some place.

            <p>I went to <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/slowrightclick.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 menu as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">1. Make sure you backup the registry or at least the keys you are changing before you make any changes to the registry. I backed up
</span>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\background\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers (using Export from the registry editor) and saved it on my desktop. I then started deleting context handlers until the problem went away. I then restored all of the deleted registry keys
 and deleted just the one that was causing problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">2. Method 1 describes several different types of registry keys that may need to be deleted to handle different kinds of problems. Since my problem was with right clicking on the desktop, I deleted keys in
</span>HKCR\Directory\Background\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">3. I tried Method 2 first (it's easier). However, Method 2 simply failed. I disabled every shell extension in the system with no results. Later when I knew exactly what shell extension was causing the problem, I disabled just
 that one. Nothing happened. Sadly, ShellExView is an amazing tool, but didn't work in my case.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Note that the NirSoft WhatIsHang tool failed in this case as well. For whatever reason, it never detected any hanging applications or tools even when right click took 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps...</p>
