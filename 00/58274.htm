<h2>            How to determine which driver version is causing black screen after 8.1 update&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm having a terrible time with the 8.1 update and my HP pavilion dv7 notebook computer. Here is a full timeline and steps I've tried, including calls and remote assistance from Microsoft and HP support. Both support calls were escalated without a
 working solution.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Computer came from HP with Windows 7 Home, I attended a developer conference in late 2012 and received a trial copy of Windows 8 Pro. I did the discounted upgrade to the full version of Windows 8 Pro when it was officially launched. When the 8.1 update
 was released I installed it immediately without issue and we've been running it for a couple of months now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Last Thursday before bed I noticed some windows updates were available, including an optional graphics driver update ( I assume this was for the intel hd graphics card as I manage the GeForce drivers through GeForce experience and always keep it updated
 for gaming ) -- when the updates completed and the system restarted, the screen was completely black. I tried several key combinations with no luck. I looked for similar issues on the web, trying the master boot record fix some suggested with no luck. Eventually
 I became frustrated and chose to refresh windows 7 home from the factory image recovery partition.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had to call the answer desk to get my product key so I could re-download windows 8 from the website. I did this, made a DVD install disc of windows 8 for good measure and reinstalled windows 8 pro. I then proceeded to install hp support assistant to
 get all current drivers, installed all windows updates, and the latest GeForce driver for the GT 650M.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fully patched, I decided to give the 8.1 update a shot from the windows store. This only resulted in the same black screen, which I'm guessing indicates a driver conflict in the video card dept. After 4 unsuccessful tries installing, patching and updating
 to 8.1 from 8, I became frustrated and contacted Microsoft support for assistance. The tech remotely accessed my machine, disabled several services and drivers via msconfig, and basically walked through the update process again as I've already tried several
 times without luck. Same result. The install has been iffy, and each time it black screens I'm forced to hard reboot the machine, fix the MBR via recovery console, command prompt, and reboot to allow the install to restore the previous version of windows (8
 pro) -- a few of these times, I've not been able to force the restore and &nbsp;I've had to completely refresh the factory image and reinstall windows 8 to get back to trying another solution here.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today I spoke to HP support who after escalating me to their "paid" second level support ( for which I refused to pay $59 ) basically admitted that there aren't any windows 8.1 compatible drivers for this machine/model. Unbelievable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a scheduled follow up call with Microsoft escalated support techs next Monday, but until then, any suggestions on how to workaround this? It seems whatever windows update I installed last Thursday is the culprit, but I've tried reverting the gfx
 driver to the old version with the same result. The machine is now running a fully patched version of windows 8 pro and I expect it will remain this way until some drivers are coded. Scream! Any ideas? Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you plug in an external monitor ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a bit of a similar problem on a couple of occasions... one was a Windows Update I did after upgrading to 8 or 8.1.. Since I had a backup image that I could quickly reload I started over...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After upgrading again, I noticed the 2nd time around that the update that had caused a problem was no longer listed... It had either been removed from Windows Updates, or had been installed along with the upgrade... Regardless... no black screen this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another occasion I had a black screen problem with an update or upgrade, I don't remember which... This time for some reason I turned off my monitor. When I turned it back on, the display was working properly, and has ever since... like the install didn't
 complete properly until the monitor had been turned off...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know you can't easily do this on a laptop, which is the reason for the external monitor question...</p>
<p>If the external monitor works, perhaps you can use your settings to turn off the laptop display, reboot, and see what happens...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW... I have seen a lot of problems with NVidia and Win 8\8.1, but the problem could be with the Intel...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you use your switchable graphics feature to set your default desktop adapter, to whichever is NOT currently being used?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more thing since you have done so many reinstalls... Consider getting something like Acronis TrueImage that comes on a bootable CD...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install your Win 7, Upgrade to Win 8, do whatever updates you need, and make an image to a external HDD. If you have a problem with 8.1, you can get back to where you were in less than 1\2 hour, instead of HOURS reinstalling...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need all of the updates for Win 8 before upgrading to 8.1. Only KB2871389.</p>
<p>The other updates will install with 8.1, and you may even have better luck.</p>
        </p>

            Thanks for your response! I have tried connecting the display we normally use for viewing netflix and other videos via hdmi without any luck.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>On my last upgrade attempt, I did try forcing the nvidia adapter to default through nvidia control panel but still experienced the same result. Perhaps i'll give it another try with the onboard graphics as preferred adapter. I guess I could just completely
 disable the geforce adapter before updating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess I figured that nvidia would be on top of the 8.1 drivers given their exposure to the gaming world of early adopters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm interested in TrueImage. Is this a free product or paid? Thanks again for taking the time to offer some guidance. I certainly appreciate it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>cheers</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TrueImage is a paid product that is on sale a lot, at least in the US...</p>
<p>It can be installed for continuous backup and etc., but I prefer to use it as a bootable CD....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not tried any of the free Imaging programs, but one feature to look for is the ability to resize the image to fit a smaller or larger drive or partition... Especially if you are considering a SSD in the future..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also used Perfect Image 11, which is another paid program. It works well, but Acronis is noticeably faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NVidia isn't alone in having problems in Win 8 and 8.1... The Radeon Mobility processors seem to be having issues also..</p>

            This error is normally generated when there is a bcd error on your hard drive, it should not be generated when booting from Installation Media
<br />
<br />In your BIOS, is the installation media set to the top of the boot order?
<br />
<br />Sometimes, depending on the age of your system, UEFI will stop you booting from the installation media, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />1.	Insert the Bootable Media
<br />2.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />3.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />4.	If Available enable CSM
<br />5.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />6.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />7.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System
<br />
<br />Insert your Installation Media and boot from it
<br />Do not Install Windows 10, instead click 'Repair this Computer'
<br />The repair will fail, then click Advanced Options
<br />Open Comnand Prompt and run these commands one at a time:
<br />bootrec /FixMbr
<br />bootrec /FixBoot
<br />bootrec /ScanOs
<br />bootrec /RebuildBcd
<br />Then reboot your System to see if Windows will boot . . .

            There is a big problem booting from DVD's in Windows 10, I think your system is trying to boot from the DVD, failing and then booting from the Hard drive . . .
<br />
<br />I would go to a working computer and create bootable installation media on a USB flash Drive and boot from that
<br />
<br />Click this link:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br /> to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br /> 
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)

            OK thank you - let me try that. I had a major issue getting the Media Creation Tool running... But, I finally got it running. Will try booting with the USB and report back.

<p>Oh dear. OK, so I now boot off the USB created by the Media Creation Tool. And...I get the same
<span>"Error Code: 0x0000225" screen as when I boot from the DVD or hard drive. This is weird.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have also tried it when all the hard drives are unplugged, i.e. it cannot boot from anything else than the USB. To be clear it boots, but very quickly come up with the&nbsp;</span><span>"Error
 Code: 0x0000225" screen.</span></p>
<p>I have also removed any other cards (I had a PCI-to-serial card in). Further, I have switched off all the peripherals such as onboard sound etc. in case Win10 doesn't have a driver for any one of those. Nothing, still won't boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, the Motherboard has the latest ASUS firmware installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now going to remove the RAM and try booting it with only a single DIMM. But, really I think the problem is elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas at all will be welcome. I'm a little desperate as I'm trying to finish a thesis by the end of the year.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Haleluja! </p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so I <strong>loaded the BIOS defaults</strong> and then it boots the USB. But, it now also boots to the hard drive with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm I have not changed anything in the BIOS prior to the&nbsp;<span>"Error Code: 0x0000225" appearing. Loading the BIOS defaults did cause the problem to disappear.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Start Up app data Error Car Virtual .dll</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently under start up I receive a pop up "there was a problem&nbsp;c:users\blaine\appdata\local\car virtual\bin\carvirtural.dll&nbsp; the specified module could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked in the start up menu and do not see this as an auto start to uncheck, also when trying to uninstall / change the program "car virtual" the same message pops up,
<em>so I cannot remove the program</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says the program is from Kingdom Comp corp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone? Computer starts ok, but not sure how to stop this pop up, or even remove the pop up on start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Norton AV and it still pops up.</p>
<p>

            <p>Found a fix via this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the solution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st: Download&nbsp;Auto Runs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Here:</p>
<p><a href="http://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link basis:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2nd: Find the&nbsp;yellow highlighted Image Paths that ends&nbsp;with sysmenu.dll. Usually you can locate those image paths from Scheduled Task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd: Right click then delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4th: Try to find all yellow highlighted Image Paths that ends with sysmenu.dll from "Everything tabs, delete them.</p>
<p>NOTE: Carefully choose image paths that ends sysmenu.dll only, if you deleted paths that are not high lightened then it might cause some trouble booting your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5th: Reboot Computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6th: Wait&nbsp;at least&nbsp;5 minutes to confirm that the issue has been resolved. (sysmenu.dll usually appears within&nbsp;a minute from rebooting the computer. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps :)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried a soft factory reset to restore the console's operating system?
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">
<p>
</p><p>Also is it just the microphone that is not being detected or the entire headset? So no stereo audio either?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's just the microphone that can't be found then the issue may lie with the 3.5 mm audio port on the controller and cleaning it may help. If you have another controller to try that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tested your headsets with your phone for example to make sure the sound and mic works?</p>
<p>

            Yes tested headset with laptop, they work fine. It is the whole headset- can't hear through it but the 'we can't find a microphone for these people'is the error message displayed. Yes, done a soft factory reset. No luck 🙁

<p>Hi TS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us. To narrow where the issue is coming from, I think it's best to also see if you can get your hands on another controller to rule out your controller port as the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it also does not work on your Xbox with a different controller, then something with the software is causing this to happen. If that's the case then you may need to try the soft factory reset a few more times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest to report this issue using the Xbox Insider Hub app if you conclude there is something wrong with the Xbox software. This article will explain how to report an issue on the Xbox One:

                    Whenever I launch a program from the Start menu, the User Account Control box (that darkens the screen and pops up) appears at the left of the screen.

            If the program that caused the request for Admin rights was opened from the Start menu, the dialog will also show up at the bottom left of the screen. &nbsp;This is intentional -- it's trying to open where your mouse pointer already is, so you don't have to
 move as far.

This is very annoying for me because I want to see the Contributing Artist's name while i am listening to a compilation disc!!!</p>
<p>Not the compiler's one or 'various artists' &nbsp;for every song in the compilation!</p>

<h2>            PROBLEMA AL DESCARGAR JUEGOS DE &#38;quot&#59;GAMES WITH GOLD&#38;quot&#59; Y VER NETFLIX</h2>
                    


<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>***SI TE PARECE LARGO O TEDIOSO EL TEXTO, SOLO LEE EL RESUMEN Y LAS SOLUCIONES QUE YA INTENTE, QUE APARECEN AL FINAL. GRACIAS***</strong></span></span></p>



<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>RESUMEN:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Desde hace un mes no he podido ver videos en Netflix, fue desde que apareció la ultima actualización de la aplicación o de la consola, no recuerdo bien. Los videos cargan al 100% pero me aparece un mensaje que dice "estamos teniendo
 problemas para reproducir este titulo, intente de nuevo mas tarde o con otro titulo". Tiempo después me di cuenta que tampoco podía descargar los juegos de games with gold, Iron Brigade, y el reciente Gears of Wars. Cuando le doy descargar, inicia la descarga
 pero antes de llegar al 1% (uno por ciento) aparece por ejemplo: "no se descargo gears" y al mostrar detalles solo dice "No se puede descargar este titulo"</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>PROBLEMA:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Hola amigos, tratare de ser lo mas claro y detallista posible ya que por mas que trato, no logro encontrar solución al problema, espero puedan ayudarme.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Netflix</span></p>
<p>Verán, desde hace un mes no he podido ver Netflix. El problema inicio tiempo antes de la mas reciente actualización (octubre, 2013), la que hizo que la interfaz cambiara por completo. Cuando apareció la actualización, la descargue
 e intente abrir Netflix, pero al cargar en pantalla de inicio, se quedaba congelado y solo ponía "Netflix" en fondo rojo. Así quedo por una semana aproximadamente. Luego me sugirieron borrar la aplicación de Netflix completa y volverla a descargar. Lo realicé,
 y al cabo de volverse a instalar, Netflix se abrió normalmente (mi sorpresa fue enorme por que hasta este punto yo aun no sabia que la actualización había cambiado tanto la interfaz). Pensé que con esto ya se había solucionado e problema pero al intentar reproducir
 un video me aparecía "estamos teniendo problemas para reproducir este titulo, intente de nuevo mas tarde o con otro titulo". Lo intente con muchos títulos y en muchos tiempos diferentes y siempre apareció lo mismo, incluso hoy en día. Mi cuenta Netflix no
 tiene nada malo, ya que los videos los reproduce correctamente en mi laptop.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Juegos de Games with Gold</span></p>
<p>Pero eso no fue todo, cuando apareció el juego de Games with Gold luego de que me sucedió lo de Netflix(el 15 de noviembre, 2013) tuve otro problema. Lo descargue y cuando llego a 100% (creo) no aparecía en mis juegos. Lo busque
 en el marketplace y aparecía con la opción de volver a descargar. Lo descargue de nuevo, pero ahora apenas iniciaba la descargar y me decía que "este elemento no se pudo descargar",y no mas. No he podido solucionar ninguno de mis problemas y ahora con el nuevo
 juego de Games with Gold(1 de diciembre, 2013), pensé que podría cambiar en algo, pero el problema persiste. Lo intente descargar, paso un rato con 0% de completado, luego la descarga se detuvo. Me aparece "volver a descargar", lo selecciono e instantáneamente
 me aparece "No se pudo descargar este elemento"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me puse en contacto con el equipo técnico de Xbox vía telefónica y me recomendaron una serie de posibles resoluciones, las cuales las nombrare mas adelante, pero de todas estas la ultima que fue con la que finalizamos la llamada,
 fue que me pusiera en contacto con los de mi servicio de internet (AXTEL) y solicitara que me abrieran ciertos puertos. Esto lo sugirieron debido a que cuando le daba a probar conexión, me aparecía "estas conectado pero tienes ciertas limitaciones" y al mostrar
 los detalles ponía: "Error NAT", así que su sugerencia fue que los problemas tanto del juego &nbsp;como de Netflix, eran debido a esto. Lo de los puertos lo realice por mi mismo, y el error NAT dejo de aparecer, por lo que creo que si logre abrir la NAT, pero el
 problema del juego y de Netflix persistió.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Podría ser que el NAT, aunque esta abierto no esta correctamente configurado para que pueda descargar los juegos, pero lo raro es que mis problemas sucedieron repentinamente,. Anteriormente no tenia ningún problema de esta clase,
 y el NAT no afecto ninguna otra cosa por lo que dudo que pueda ser esto a pesar de ser lo mas probable debido a que fui yo mismo quien los abrió.</p>

<p><strong>MAS INFORMACIÓN</strong></p>
<p>Tengo la consola desde hace un año y medio y no tengo y nunca he tenido Chip ni eh intentado reproducir películas o juegos pirata.</p>
<p>Mi perfil apareció en cierto momento como "dañado", pero lo borre muchas veces y lo volví a descargar a la consola. No se si existe otra manera de reparar un perfil que no se solucione borrandolo y redescargando pero ya no me aparece
 como dañado aunque esto no me soluciono el problema. Es la 4ta vez que tengo problema con mi cuenta desde hace como 5 meses y la borraba y descargaba de nuevo</p>
<p>Tuve un problema similar al del juego como 2 meses atrás al inentar abrir otro juego (Super Meat Boy) que ya tenia desde mucho tiempo atrás, no me podía abrir el juego luego de aparecer una actualización. Tuve que borrar todo (juego
 y partida)desde el disco duro y volverlo a descargar. Con esto se soluciono el problema y el juego funciono bien.</p>
<p>Tuve un problema similar con el juego anterior de Games with Gold, "A world of kefflings". Cuando lo descargue la primera vez, no me aparecía en la consola y solo me aparecía volver a descargar. Lo descargue como 3 veces y cuando
 lo buscaba no me aparecía. Lo que hice fue descargar el demo, y cuando lo juge puse "comprar juego completo" desde e menú del juego, y así fue como se descargo correctamente. Ahora ya me aparece en mis juegos.</p>
<p>Estos datos extra los pongo por que no se si tengan relación con el problema, pero yo pensaría que si e incluso que se aprecia progresión de los fallos.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SOLUCIONE QUE YA INTENTE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Aquí citare las soluciones que ya eh intentado y que no me funcionaron.</p>

</li><li>Intente quitar la seguridad de la conexión (conexión abierta)
</li><li>Intente resetear el módem, borrado en nombre de SSID y la contraseña de la conexión y regresando a ser valores predeterminados
</li><li>Intente abrir los puertos que mencionan en la pagina oficial de Xbox (Con esto el problema de "Error NAT" se soluciono, pero solo eso
</li><li>Intente conectarme con una conexión distinta, y de otra compañía (Cablevisión de otra casa), donde el Error NAT también aparecía, y mi problema también aparecia

<h2>            Extract win 7 key from windows.old file</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a Lenovo laptop that came with windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Before a trip, I setup a password for Windows.&nbsp; When I returned, I tried the password I thought I used but it is not working.&nbsp; I tried all iterations I could think of.&nbsp; No
 luck.&nbsp; After reading the posts, I learned my only option was to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; I did a custom install to reinstall.&nbsp; I assumed the reinstall would grab the activation info but it is asking for the key. &nbsp; I have the disk but not the sleeve so I don't know
 the activation code.&nbsp; Is there a way to extract the key from the windows.old file?</span></p>

<p>The product key should be on a sticker attached to the bottom chassis of your laptop. Look there.</p>
<span>
<p>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</p>
<p>A) OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</p>
<p>B) COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</p>
<p>Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computer’s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key. The normal
 way to do this is to click the ‘Start’ button, right-click ‘Computer’, select ‘Properties’ and then click ‘Change Product Key’ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard.</p>

</p><p>This is on my old computer. There are a few files I would like to get off of it, however this screen comes up every time at startup. I would like to fix this laptop since my new computer is a desktop. It appears to be a problem with one of the drivers? But
 thats about as far as I can get, if thats even correct. Any help would be fantastic!</p>

            You could try an external enclosure. A solution that requires some expense, but not over much, is to purchase an external USB 2.5" sata enclosure. You remove the drive from the laptop and place the drive in the enclosure and connect to a USB port of a
 working computer. You need a 3.5" enclosure for a drive from a desktop.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting to another computer enables you to read, write to, and copy from the drive. You can scan the drive using the security software installed on the second computer. If the hard drive has failed then it does not work. You cannot boot the operating
 system installed on the drive in the enclosure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enclosures are reusable and can be used to provide additional external storage for any computer, where you have a discarded drive which worked, but was too small for further use in its existing location.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An illustration of an external enclosure is provided in the link below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a cheaper alternative:</p>

    <title>my computer is changing the date year spontaneously - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newliver  say:</h3>
<h2>            my computer is changing the date year spontaneously</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
Twice since early October my computer has reset the date to 2077 with no input from me. It was running both times and had been so for days. On 8 October it changed sometime between 08:00 and 09:00 and on 25 December it changed at about 22:30. This is fine,
 but the next thing that happened was that it started downloading something from the internet. Probably something to do with noticing that security certificates had all expired as had the anti-virus software. When I noticed it I tried an internet update by
 Windows. It said it worked, but the year had not changed. I tried the date command on the command prompt; it told me I had insufficient rights, even though I was signed in as an administrator. So I had to use the Windows resetting mechanism by leaning on the
 month reducing arrow for a long time.<br />
<br />
What could be causing this spontaneous date change and how do I fix it? The time, month and day are unchanged.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 with auto-update. The computer is a Dell Studio One 19, which was 26 months old in October.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer.<br />
<br />

            Thanks very much for your reply. <br />
<br />
I did as you suggest. Malwarebytes-free found 13 registry keys and 7 folders. 11 of the registry keys were for MyWebSearch; two were for Trojan.Vundo. All were quarantined and deleted. Three of the folders were "Program Files (x86)\FunWebProducts" and sub-folders
 and four were Program Files (x86)\MyWebSearch and sub-folders. I seem to remember deleting these folders before but they kept coming back. I can't have deleted the registry keys, perhaps.
<br />
<br />
The computer was 26 months old when this first happened and it still has its original CMOS battery.
<br />
<br />
I would have thought the CMOS battery shouldn't affect things while the computer is powered on and has been for days without a restart? Actually it runs most of the time as I monitor a weather station and upload the data with it.<br />
<br />
For the time being I'll disconnect from the 'net overnight. Data is costly in New Zealand. The interesting thing is that the uploads were small at the same time the downloads were occurring.<br />
<br />
 AppCrash and a few AppHang and NonCritical reports. No files have last modified dates on 16 October 2011.<br />
<br />
I didn't know about the October change until 1 December ( was away). I noticed the 25 December change on 27th.<br />

<p>In order to properly use your PayPal account, it must either have a valid credit card attached to it or a positive money balance. If you have an attached bank account and are still having trouble adding/using your PayPal method, try transferring some money
 from the bank account to PayPal so the PayPal account actually has a positive balance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please ensure that the account information on both your LIVE account and PayPal account is current and that it matches. For instance, if your PayPal account is under "John Smith" but your Xbox LIVE account is registered to "Master Chief", you may have issues
 linking the two accounts. This also goes for contact information, billing address, etc.</p>

<p>Het enige wat ik kan vertellen is waar heel streng naar gekeken word is dat op je bankpas/creditcard de naam exact moet zijn aan de naam van de paypal en van je xbox live account op deze pagina:
<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/Profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
commerce.microsoft.com/.../Profile</a>. Daarnaast zoals hier ook aangegeven staat een positief saldo op de paypal account en niet af te laten schrijven via je paypal account van je bank rekening af laten schrijven bij betalingen. Maar het is bij mij ook nog
 nooit gelukt om eerlijk te zijn. <br />
<br />
livecodes.nl is dat te gaat een goed alternatief om gewoon via iDeal te betalen.</p>

<p>Het is inderdaad een beetje gek dat er geen mogelijkheid is tot betalen via de website. Bij mij geeft het aan dat ik er een andere betaaloptie in moet voeren en dat ik alleen als mogelijkheid krijg om een creditcard in te voeren. Of dat is nog in ontwikkeling
 bij de web programmeurs aldaar, of ze zijn terug naar af gegaan. Ik denk het eerste maar dan hadden ze toch al mee klaar kunnen zijn alvorens ze de dash update doorzetten.<br />

Which product key do you have Windows </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">professional or Windows ultimate?<br />
<br />
If you are having Windows professional product key, then you can install only Windows professional and activate. If you have Windows professional product key and if you install Windows Ultimate, then you will get the message product key is invalid when you
 ender as Windows professional and Windows ultimate are different versions of Windows. You will be able to install Windows but you will not be able to activate.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>
