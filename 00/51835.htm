    <title>Battlestations&#58; Pacific boot crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pinco47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battlestations&#58; Pacific boot crash</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, <br />
just bought the Battlestations warfare pack (BS: Midway+BS: Pacific) as the the game is very cheap now.I finnished BS:Midway without any problems.</p>
<p>I am having a problem with&nbsp; Battlestation Pacific, It dont work, cant launch. <br />
The installation was succefull, without error, I made it with administrator rights.
<br />
After I make clik on the launcher (battlestationspacific.exe in the installation folder) came the logo from Eidos then come the login GFWL windows&nbsp; 2 or 3 seconds and then came back to desktop, and that´s all, no error messages, nothing,&nbsp; I am trying since
 already 3 weeks with everything I have found in internet forums and nothing.</p>
<p>I have Windows Xp sp3,&nbsp; Graphic Card: Nvidia 9800GT, Audio Card: Realtek with all drivers updated. And the funny thing is that with me, the demo runned very well in my computer, with all video settings maximal (thats why I think its not a problem of low
 power of my video or audio card ) but with the full version no way.I have no clue what is wrong. Every time I wanna launch the game happen this problem. Always I try with administrator rights, with and without (internet, firewall, antivirus), also I tryed
 installing the game with and without (internet, firewall, antivirus) Also I try to start the game making click directly on BSP.exe and nothing happen.
<br />
I tryed with almost all versions of GFWL, I tryed installing the GFWL version 2,&nbsp; that many people in forums say this was their solution but with me ....nothing.<br />
I have no idea what happen, I dont know what to do. Can anybody help me please? <br />
Since right now thanks in advance! would be VERY appreciatted any suggestion,</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0x80004002 when trying to update.</h2>
                    Okay so I was wondering if anyone knew the solution to fixing this issue with the error&nbsp;0x80004002 I've tried looking it up and followed many steps to what some say may fix the issue but without prevail it seems this has started to happen after an update
 happened which I believe was an update that had something to do with intel and crashing certain files etc.. Forgot to mention the update that I'm speaking of is the windows updates.

<p>Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
Open Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
<br />
Type each of the following then hit Enter<br />
<br />
taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />

net stop msiserver<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&nbsp;<br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore<br />

When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.</p>

    <title>Disappearing Toolbars on Taskbar - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turkeytrots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disappearing Toolbars on Taskbar - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have three Toolbars (aka folders) at the right side of the Taskbar which contain shortcuts to the most used programs. This scheme I have used in all previous versions of Windows without trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, the first build and the current (1511), these Toolbars randomly disappear. There is no set pattern to when: it can be on a restart, out of hibernation or when the computer is left on for a longish time (on a screensaver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is obviously not critical, but is very annoying. Anybody have any ideas to solve the mystery?</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />

<strong>run SFC scan </strong>on your computer.<br />

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for this late reply, but somehow I missed the prompt that there had been a reply to my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am familiar with <strong>sfc</strong>, but not <strong>dism</strong> so your reply was useful. I ran both (dism first) and no errors were reported by either commands. So dism did some good as sfc showed unresolved errors last time I ran it ( I was also
 unaware that it may be necesary to run it multiple times if errors are unresolved).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find annoying and puzzling over all these Windows 10 shenanigans is the way one update may run without problem, then the next does not as something is corrupt, then the next runs OK, then the next has problems......... How can these corruptions occur
 so readily? I have also similar, random, experience with my second PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the most puzzling - the Start Menu debacle in the early days of Windows 10 (mine is still not as I set it) and why is it necessary to
<p>
</p><p>This whole experience with Windows 10 has been very tedious, but nevertheless very educational. I just hope it settles down soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be some time until we know if your potential solutions solve my disappearing folder problem, but many thanks for your suggestions.</p>

                    <p>I have an Acer laptop that i upgraded to Windows 10 about a year ago and have been updating it on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago after it was used it asked the usual Shut Down and Install when turning it off which i said yes to. This time it took ages to shut down and stayed on 1% for ages so i left it over night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i tried turning it on the next day it wouldn't load windows and kept advising that the windows upgrade had got corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when i try and turn on the laptop it just has a black screen and i cant even open the bios screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So not only have likely lost all of the files on this laptop but also looks like i cant even access the bios to do a clean install, all thanks to the latest Update that i am forced to install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you let me know if you know of a way for me to access the Bios?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it possible to get Windows 10 on a disc so i can do a fresh install? Otherwise i will have to do a factory restore which will install windows 7 and then i will have loads of updates to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that a corrupted Windows update is the root cause of the problem. For the time being, you may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>, for troubleshooting black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this <strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></em></strong>, for performing a clean installation of Windows 10 using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the steps in "trouble shooting the black screen" link you sent but none of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to access the BIOS and am unable to get to the Windows Recovery screen. When I turn on the laptop, it is usually just a black screen. If I leave it for a while it remains a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the power button and restart I get the black screen again. After about 3 attempts, I then see the "Acer" logo and get the spinning circle dots. It starts off with a message about trying to restore the PC or something like that, then it changes
 to "Diagnosing your PC" with the spinning circles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it stays in this state continuously, and the laptop makes a funny noise every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn the power off it goes back to the black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you assist with how I can get to the recovery screen? I am unable to load up the BIOS (which I have read is an issue with Windows 10 as it loads up so quickly), and am therefore unable to try and do a clean install from the USB drive I have which
 contains the Windows 10 installation software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very frustrated that this has happened all because I was forced to download the latest Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>

<p>Is it pissible i could be sent a Windows 10 installation disc in the post i could try and restore the machine from? I followed the link to download this to a USB but my laptop won’t boot up from a USB and I cannot access the BIOS to configure it to do so.
 I cant burn the file to a disc as think it was over 8GB and only have a basic DVD writer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if that is possible as this laptop is my daughters and she is unable to do any homework whilst it is out of action?</p>
<p>

            We appreciate the update, Matt. Let's get your computer sorted by starting your PC in safe mode from the Windows recovery screen. After three failed boot attempts, Windows goes into recovery mode. It is a blue-colored screen with a title
<strong>Choose an Option</strong>. To start in safe mode, follow the steps below:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use the power button to restart your computer three times while Windows is loading. This will start Windows Recovery Environment.</li><li><span>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong>. </span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 5 or F5 for
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You can also select <strong>Startup Repair</strong> and <strong>System Restore</strong> in the
</span><span><strong>Advanced options </strong>screen to troubleshoot this issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you can start your computer in safe mode from the recovery screen, we suggest that you

<h2>            errors &#34;powrprof.exe&#34; and a &#34;windows explorer has stopped working and will restart&#34; help&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I'm not sure if this is the right area to post my question but I am new and frustrated at the moment. I have two problems occuring, not sure if they are the result of each other but you can be the judge of that. Some info on what I'm currently running;
 its a Compaq Presario Laptop. It came with Vista. On to my problems. When I boot up my computer and log in I'm met with an error having to do with "Powrprof.dll&nbsp; qpservice.exe" it also says something about a "powerread acvalue". So I press "ok" everything
 would be dandy but I'm also met with an error stating that "Windows Explorer has stopped working and will restart". Not "Internet Explorer". After it restarts a few times I lose my desktop and my toolbar. I've tried a registry tool but it didnt fix it (I didn't
 upgrade it since i want to be sure thats what will fix it or not). Thanks in advance for reading through my troubles and helping me out.

    <title>Computer died during an update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sapdodo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer died during an update</h2>
                    <p>Hello. My HP computer wanted to update windows 10 to the latest version, so before I went to bed I started the update. But I of course forgot to charge it while it was updating so it died during the update. When I woke up I tried to turn it on but it doesn't
 work. My computer is trying to restore the previous version of windows 10 that I had and boot itself up but it isn't working. Also when its trying to turn on a black screen shows up for one second. What should I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, sorry for my bad grammar.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sapdodo,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>
</p><p><span>If you could answer a few questions it would help us to resolve this issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span><span>When exactly do you get the error message/code?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Did you make any hardware/software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The 0xefffff08 error may be caused by windows system files damage. There can be many events which may have resulted in the system files errors. An incomplete installation, an incomplete uninstall, improper deletion of applications or hardware. It can also
 be caused if your computer is recovered from a virus or adware/spyware attack or by an improper shutdown of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Microsoft Safety Scanner and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Run the SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer to make sure system files are intact. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted system files and repairs them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files</strong></p>

            <p>Error Code 0xEFFFFF08 is an HP Error Code (not a Microsoft Error Code).&nbsp; It, simply, means that you have to use a different USB port on your computer!&nbsp; Using the Recovery Manager requires that you use a particular USB port on your computer.&nbsp; Try the different
 USB ports on your computer.&nbsp; HP recommends starting with a USB port on the LEFT SIDE!</p>

                    I know there are a million articles about this but I did the steps mentioned in this reply
, but I'm still unable to connect and I'm still getting the same error message. My computer says I am connected to my wireless router but it's telling me I have no internet access. I ran an ipconfig prompt and below is the result. If anyone can see what
 the problem might be it would be helpful. I've been trying to figure this out for weeks. I even hooked up a different router and got a new modem but I'm still having this same problem.&nbsp; I use an **** modem from optimum and a linksys wrt54g router. Right now
 I have an ethernet cable plugged from my router to my laptop because that's the only way it works since it's not picking up the wireless signal even though it says I'm connected.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<span>Have you made any software/hardware changes to your computer prior to the issue?</span>
<p><span>Follow the methods mentioned below</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode, starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes</span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode with Networking</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not exists in safe mode then start the computer in clean boot to check if any third party program is causing the issue. To configure your computer to clean boot refer the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Check your hard disk for errors</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/vi-VN/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/vi-VN/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Important</b>: While performing disk checking on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive then disk checking will try to repair those sectors, any data available on that might be lost</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash. The System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) scans for missing or corrupted
 system files and repairs them.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue is intermittent you will have put your computer in clean boot for three to four days and check the event viewer carefully if the logs for registry hive gets created.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform the clean boot is mentioned in the post above.</span></p>

</span>The Kernel-General event code 5 error from this morning is the only one so far today and in occurred at 2012-09-03 07:28:56. {Registry Hive Recovered} Registry hive (file): '\??\C:\Windows\System32\SMI\Store\Machine\SCHEMA.DAT' was corrupted and it has
 been recovered. Some data might have been lost.</span></p>
<p><span>I copied only the part of the CBS log that showed what “Failed”.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Then I copied the “ERROR”.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I copied what happened at 2012-09-03 07:28:56, the same time as the ERROR in the event viewer.</span></p>

            <p>Never mind.&nbsp; I'm not a computer engineer.&nbsp; I can't do the clean boot thing&nbsp;you keep telling me to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP is willing to help and I am sending it to them to check hardware and software.</p>
<p>Actually they think there may be a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Some forums on the web think it is not actually repairing itself and that is why it keeps loging the error every time any program tries to automatically update.&nbsp; Looks like it happens with MSE and Adobe.&nbsp; Maybe others.</p>

<p>Also HP replaced a defective motherboard which was causing the fan problem.&nbsp; No cost to me, computer still under warranty.&nbsp; Shipped on Monday and returned with new motherboard on Thursday.&nbsp; HP provided box and shipping labels too.&nbsp; Impressive.</p>

<p><span><span>they are two completely different operating systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>you can upgrade from xp to vista if you meet certain requirements</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>below microsoft link has the minimum&nbsp;vista&nbsp;system hardware requirements for you to investigate if you do&nbsp;have them</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 tiny lag spikes and audio glitch</h2>
                    <p>I used my PC yesterday, no problems. I use it today, it keeps having micro stutters that effect both video and audio output. There was one brief second where my screen became covered in static and audio continued normally. No settings have been changed,
 and no software has been installed. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I solved the problem by disabling the feature that allows your computer to update nearby computers.</p>

<p>My OS version is 1703 Build 15063.674</p>
<p>I can't pinpoint when the problem really began, so update history won't be that helpful. If it did come with an update, it must have happened some time in September. The problem seems to only start when I'm watching HBO Go, but it persists even if I close
 the program (Chrome). I've updated my video driver, but I'm not sure what my audio device is. There are four options under that drop down,</p>
<p>High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>Logitech USB microphone (definitely not that)</p>
<p>Nvidia High Definition Audio</p>
<p>Nvidia Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible) (WDM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked for updates to all four. There don't seem to be any Nvidia updates available, or any High Definition Audio Device updates, whatever that is.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this inquiry. I understand you'd like a bit more ability to edit you're game clips for future viewing. As it stands right now the trim option is the only available edit tool for the game clips. I recommend
 voicing this suggestions at <a href="http://xboxideas.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Ideas</a>&nbsp;in the appropriate Idea Drive that says "Accepting Suggestions". Give it a try and hope this helps!</p>

            Currently you can only trim videos but you can add multiple sections and trim the clip in multiple ways to mirror a splice.

<p>Yes, you will be able to upgrade from the Windows Insider Preview to the RTM build for free.</p>
<p>Company officials have noted though if you join the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso-update?os=win10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>When asked if there would be a cut off date for Insiders before Windows 10 reached RTM, Microsoft's Gabriel Aul stated that preview builds would continue being delivered up until the final release.

<h2>            &#40;Win 7&#41; Laptop suddenly can&#39;t connect to wifi</h2>
                    <p>Noticed yesterday that my laptop is saying "not connected - no connections available". I tried multiple times to reset the router and even restarted the computer a few times. I turned off the firewall per suggestion on another site, but still nothing. I
 have two smartphones, a surface tablet, and another laptop that can connect just fine. can still see the notification for the hardware switch, and it recognizes when I turn it on and off (notification, color of icon changes). What could have done this, and
 HOW DO I FIX IT? This is my main/work computer (the other laptop isn't mine), so it's important this gets fixed FAST.</p>

            <p>First try resetting your wireless facility by going to Device Manager and uninstalling, restart and let Windows re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I am seeing this a lot lately.&nbsp; I presume you are referring to an internal wireless facility in a laptop???</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My theory is that it is because so many people are keeping their laptops longer to keep Windows 7 and avoid 8 and 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I believe the wireless facilities are starting to fail and what you are experiencing is early signs of this failure.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have found that the simple and cheap($20) installation of a small USB wireless facility will replace it and work better than the internal one ever did.</span></p>
