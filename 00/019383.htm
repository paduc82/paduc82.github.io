            Take it to a Nokia care point. It might cost you a little, but you could ask about the price first.

    <title>Microsoft Project 2010 Formatting Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> te5s3rakt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Project 2010 Formatting Issues</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;work for a large&nbsp;company in a Project Management section, that's only just moving over to Microsoft Project to plan its Projects and due to my IT background (I'm employed as a Project Manager) it's been entrusted to me to establish some sort of template
 file to plan our projects and track hours spent on them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm slowly getting there in terms of the functionality and reporting that we require... but in order to make the transition for the older project managers easy I'm relying on customised cell formating (sometimes across rows or columns) to highlight areas
 of interest to monitor or cells that require attention as far as updating to track the project... This has gone well till I've found the limit of 64000 cell max per view custom formating limit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question I ask is, How do I get around this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The template I've developed is in a singlar file at the moment, and i've tried using a master file and linking in copies as "Subprojects" but my formating disappears, and running a single file each project copied under each other becomes not only large (not
 a major issue) but hits a point the formating drops away and becomes not so user friendly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done alittle research and notice people doing conditioning formating with Macros... Do these formats go against the total?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my perfect solution would be some sort of conditional formating that will apply it's to individual project files, as well as end of the projects when view as SubProjects in a master file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any direction...</p>

            <p>te5s3rakt,</p>
<p>I think Rod put it succinctly. Yes you could use VBA to do some formatting, but do you really want to do it? No, you don't. I've seen project plans that were virtual works of art with a profusion of font styles and colors. The problem is the amount of time
 to set up and maintain that dazzling plan is taking valuable time away from actually running the project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to color code the various phases of a plan, that's pretty simple and doesn't take a lot of effort but if you want to get down to special formatting for individual field cells, then I'd say you are going overboard. As I indicated before, I think
 a good set of views tailored for your users along with some well thought out grouping and filters is all that you really need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project is neither intuitive nor a quick study. You would do well to come up with a training program and set of ground rules for your users. It is time well spent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing, you mention using a linked structure (master and subprojects). I feel obligated to warn you that a linked structure in Project is prone to corruption, particularly if more than a single user is working with the files. As a minimum, users
 must never rename, overwrite or move any of the files in the structure. It is also a good idea to keep all files in a single folder on a local drive, not operate it over a network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking from experience, as does Rod.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint Online links opens partially scrolled down</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>If I scroll down a page a bit and then open a link to another page, the page that opens is also scrolled down a bit when it opens.</p>
<p>Is there a way to force Sharepoint pages to open at the top of the page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Sharepoint Online (O365) and I have Site Pages where there are links to other Site Pages quite far down the page. If I scroll down the page a bit and then click a link, the linked page opens up already scrolled down the same amount. This is quite
 annoying as I want the new page to open at the top of the page.</p>
<p>We have started building a Knowledge Base in Site Pages, so that I can put the front page in a Teams tab. The links on the pages will let me jump between the relevant pages while still staying inside the Teams client. I am seeing the same weird behavior
 as described above when clicking links to Site Pages inside the Teams client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is a way to make links that always open Site Pages scrolled up to the top of the page.</p>
<p>I don't have Sharepoint Designer.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I know if you want to show display the page at the top of the page? If so, I have tested it with my SharePoint Online, as steps shown below:</span></p>
<p><span>I clicked Add in the Home page &gt; selected Link and copied the link of page there. Then I clicked that page link, it shows the top of page.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Are the steps above consistent with yours? If not, could you provide the detailed steps about how you insert link of another page in the Home page?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At the same time, to better understand your situation, I want to confirm the information below with you:</span></p>

<div style="text-align: left">Hi</div>
<p>Adding a link to the top of the page would defeat the entire purpose of having link in the article. I have placed relevant links throughout the entire page to other articles with relevant content.</p>
<p>All sites with all pages have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My organization settings seems to prevent me from giving you a proper link that also gives you access to the page... The only available option for such a link seems to be for accounts within the same tenant. The IT department must have placed a restriction
 on those.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. I was on vacation for a week and was unable to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested with both adding links by adding a hyperlink Web Part like you suggested and also by adding Text Web Parts that contain hyperlinks. Both of them seem to behave exactly the same, so that is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I went on vacation, these links seemed to behave in the way I described (links far down the page opened a page that was also scrolled far down the page) in both Sharepoint in Browser and a Sharepoint page added as a Tab in Teams.</p>
<p>After I came back from vacation, there has been an update to O365 and I'm seeing slightly different behavior (and minor UI changes). When using Sharepoint Online in a browser, this behavior is now fixed for both Hyperlink Web Parts and Text Web Parts. However,
 when the same Sharepoint Site Page is added as a Tab in Teams, we see the old behavior of opening pages already scrolled down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Microsoft are working on this issue and I really hope they add the same functionality to Teams, since our users will mostly be reading these pages inside the Teams desktop client.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hello Christian WJ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your description, for further test analysis from our side, I need to collect below information from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Whether this hyperlink Web Part is happened with all page links or specific page links in Teams?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. For better understanding and test, Could you please provide us video link about "when the same Sharepoint Site Page is added as a Tab in Teams, we see the old behavior of opening pages already scrolled down"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide us above video link via private message link: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?Id=6f86a5fd-3d94-4f13-a349-a6c5ad19f143">

<h3> trabelus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delegates in Outlook 365 and Outlook 2016 on Mac</h2>
                    I have searched the internet for much longer than I should to find instructions on how to add a delegate to my account. It's amazing how inaccurate the instructions are. I followed the instructions to a T (click tools, choose the account, click advanced,
 choose delegates) and there IS NO OPTION FOR DELEGATES!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is a major option. How can this be overlooked? Very frustrating.&nbsp;

<p>I have similar battery problems</p>
<p>with the idol4s with windows 10 I can't seem to find out what the lifespan is on the battery.</p>
<p>My phone has about one and a half years use. I have to plug it in every 2 to 3 hours. If someone knows how long the lifespan on these batteries is could you let me know? I called Alcatel tech support and they don't seem to know. I am not a game&nbsp; player or
 heavy social user. But I keep the phone plugged in most of the time and have the Microsoft Docking station which I use occasionally and it gets hot but not that hot.</p>
<p>So if someone has an approximate time frame for the battery 🔋 please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Have you been able to do anything about the short battery use? If I put a new battery in would it do anything to extend battery time or is it just a problem with this phone?</p>
<p>My other problem is the receiver on the phone. I have to use the speaker phone. The reception on normal use is all choppy But perfect on speaker.</p>
<p>If you have any advice I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply @GingX.&nbsp; I haven't found anything to back up my claim that the battery drain is related to an OS update but that's when I noticed it. I also noticed that the time it takes to recharge also decreased.&nbsp; I wonder if maybe there could be
 a glitch in the battery monitoring feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has any info that will help determine if it is related to an update, I hope you will also respond.&nbsp; The more info we can find, the more likely we will be able to get @Microsoft to address the issue, if that's what is causing it.</p>

            Seeing as we seem to be having very similar issues that started around the same time, I am sure it has something to do with software. Last night, I just kept using my phone well after I got the critical low battery alert. It stayed at 6% the rest of the
 night without dying. Obviously, it is not reading the correct battery level. Hopefully, someone at Microsoft is checking these threads and does something about it.

<p>I have Internet Explorer 10 installed on my Windows 7. But it's unable to display/open Facebook.com or yahoomail.com, whether I add these sites in compatibility view or not. So I want to permanently disable the "Display internet sites in compatibility view"
 option under Compatibility View settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

is it someting related to your browser certification?<a href="http://www.pcandtablet.com/windows-7-browsers/81/i-cant-access-facebook-gmail-from-my-windows-7-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.pcandtablet.com/windows-7-browsers/81/i-cant-access-facebook-gmail-from-my-windows-7-pc.html</a><br />

<p>I checked the page, but it's not so helpful. Can you tell me how can I remove/change those certificates?</p>
<p>For you info. I can access gmail and hotmail, but can not open yahoomail and facebook.</p>

<p>Since I frequently use these two sites, so whenever I open these two sites, their content is not displaying at all. I don't know how to get rid of this problem.</p>

<p>Yes, time and date are up to date and clock is getting synchronized with time.windows.com server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I can successfully brows facebook and yahoomail using Firefox and chrome and there's no problem opening these sites using these browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only problem is that, I am habitual to IE and I always prefer working with IE only. Previously I had IE9 and it was unable to open these sites for last few months. So, I updated IE9 to IE10, and just thought that it will solve the problem. But it didn't
 and problem is still same :(</p>

            This could be due to improper settings or plugins of ie.. backup your favorites/bookmarks (if you want them) and reset ie to default values.
<br />
<br />

<p>I even tried to reset IE settings using Microsoft Fix It, but still the problem has not solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's only with a few websites like facebook,com and yahoomail.com and few more sites which I don't frequently access. I can successfully brows these sites from Firefox and Chrome, but when I open them using IE, nothing happens.</p>

    <title>Problems disconnecting Headers and Footers from earlier ones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyproctor1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems disconnecting Headers and Footers from earlier ones</h2>
                    <p>I need to ask some really basic questions about Word Headers and Footers. I am using Word 2007 and have got into a right mess with them, so clearly there's something I don't yet understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main body of my document has distinct Headers and Footers for even/odd pages, and the for the first pages of the numbered sections. This works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you might expect, earlier sections have pages numbered with Roman numerals. I cleared the even/odd/first options for these sections as they all follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The leading pages (e.g. half-title and title pages) then have nothing in the Headers and Footers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, nothing unusual here, but problems arose when I tried to disconnect the first page of my first numbered section from the previous ones. Question: are the even/odd/first layouts distinct Headers and Footers in their own right, or variations of a single
 Header/Footer layout that applies to those sections? The reason I ask is then when I de-selected the 'Link to Previous' option for either their first Header or Footer, the even/odd variants then popped up in the earlier sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I tried to remove them from the earlier sections but then they also disappeared from the later numbered sections, They still appear to be connected in some way and yet I have disconnected the Header/Footer of the first numbered page, and also the Footer
 of the earlier section that first shows Roman-numeral page numbers.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Recap_of_Header/Footer_settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to my <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Recap_of_Header/Footer_settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Header/FooterSettings Recap</a>. Some points from that recap:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Changing the <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Odd_and_Even" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Even/Odd setting</a> anywhere in a document will apply it throughout the document and it will apply to both headers and footers.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/sections2007.htm#Different_First_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Different first page</a> is a section setting. It also applies to both headers and footers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you looked at the underlying Word Object Model, it would seem as if even/odd is a section property as well, but that is not how it has ever worked, in Word.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Every section has three headers and three footers, even if none of them are seen or used. A single page can have multiple sections!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>They are: </p>
<ul>
<li>the Primary Header/Footer</li><li>the First Page Header/Footer</li><li>the Even Page Header/Footer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><em>These exist even if you never see them. </em>Although a page can have many sections, it can only have one header and one footer. If you switch on different even/odd, the primary becomes the odd-page h/f.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These three within a section are not linked or otherwise connected to each other within that section but may be linked to the previous section. Even if the one in your current section does not say it is linked to the previous, the corresponding header/footer
 in the next section may be linked to it. Each section after the first has<em> six settings</em> for "link to previous," one for each header and each footer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is seldom that a document needs to change the headers/footers between sections.</strong>
<em>That is a myth propounded by poor training and books.</em> Often the use of the three available and the
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/fields.htm#STYLEREF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
StyleRef Field</a>&nbsp; will mean that most or all headers and footers in a document can be linked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a header or footer is linked to the previous one, it means that Word treats this as a single header or footer regardless of how many sections use it. Changing it in one changes it in all to which it is linked.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 no sign in button available&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I recently got a new job which gave me a work laptop. I have outlook working with the laptop with no issues. I can send and receive emails. The problem came about when I tried to sign in to my normal Microsoft account so I could sync my Onenote notebooks.
 I signed out of the existing account (my work account) and when I did, the sign in button or any sort of indicator of a sign in button disappeared. I can use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and outlook without problems. I just can't use Onenote since there is no
 place for me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, the account tab in the file button shows this:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/043e04ca-af21-44b7-aeea-2ff2bb6a028b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>no sign in area, no button, no acknowledgement of a Microsoft account. This is across all Office programs. I'm really not sure what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Secure Message with message_v2.rpmsg attachment - unable to open</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About four weeks ago we started having difficulties opening emails sent from other O365 tenants where the sender is encrypting the message.&nbsp; We started receiving the messages with a message_v2.rpmsg file attached.&nbsp; In the body of the email there is a link
 to read the message but all that does is takes you to a version of the message in OWA that says "The message you tried to open is protected with information rights management and can only be opened by using Outlook.&nbsp; We are unable to open the messages in Outlook.&nbsp;
 We've tried downloading and installing AIP Viewer but Microsoft indicates in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/rms-client/client-view-use-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>that AIP does not work on the desktop but they provide no guidance on what to do to Outlook to get it to open these files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've submitted a support ticket to Microsoft but they were no help - said that the sender had to fix the issue.&nbsp; The sender submitted a support ticket and it's been several weeks and still no resolution from Microsoft.&nbsp; It appears that Microsoft broke something
 when they recently updated email encryption sending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots of what we see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the original email received inside of Outlook 2016.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0278e075-588b-4dd4-9570-0f098819ca12?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0278e075-588b-4dd4-9570-0f098819ca12?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the screen that is viewed in OWA after clicking "Read the message":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f210508-84a3-4fd8-986d-f4e8a7c610f3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f210508-84a3-4fd8-986d-f4e8a7c610f3?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Jandoze,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you can sign in OWA, I assume that you are also using Office 365 for Business account. For cannot open the encrypted message, firstly we should confirm if the issue is related to sender side or your side. So, let sender send a same encrypted message
 to another Office 365 tenant user and another user in your tenant to check if they can open the encrypted message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all others cannot open the encrypted message, the issue may be related the sender side, I suggest you to involve the Office 365 admin of sender here or open a new thread in our forum, and we can work the issue together with the sender admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If users in other Office 365 tenant can open the encrypted message, I would like to how sender set up the OME. Generally, when the sender set up OME via mail flow rules, when you open the encrypted message, Outlook will connect to your server to verify your
 credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if the issue just happens to you which means other users in your organization can open the same encrypted message, the issue may be related to your client. Try to sign in your account in another PC to check the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-messages-sent-with-restricted-permissions-in-outlook-for-windows-101c7fb6-fa0b-43ec-8393-3224d625ea3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-messages-sent-with-restricted-permissions-in-outlook-for-windows-101c7fb6-fa0b-43ec-8393-3224d625ea3c</a></p>

            We have noticed that this issue occurs for users who have an .msi installation of Office 2016 (Outlook). When that version is removed and replaced with the Click to Run version from the Office 365 portal, the messages can be read without any additional
 action.

<p>&nbsp;Hi</p>
<p>Can you ask the recipient tenant to set the <em>ClientAccessServerEnabled </em>
parameter in Set-IRMConfiguration to $true (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/encryption-and-certificates/set-irmconfiguration?view=exchange-ps)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should hopefully fix the issue in OWA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recipient has the right permissions &amp;&amp; if the recipient is on AAD/O365 &amp;&amp; if the recipient is using the latest version of Office - the mail should show up inline. What was the template/policy which was used to protect the mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we enabled the&nbsp;<em>ClientAccessServerEnabled&nbsp;</em><span>parameter in Set-IRMConfiguration to $true and are still not able to open the attachment&nbsp;in Microsoft Outlook 2016 or OWA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The template policy was Encrypt Only.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realized that 2 of the senders (different companies) are using IRM, but my company uses OME could that cause a conflict?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To your second response my company is using the C2R version of Office and I am on the Monthly Channel with Version 1809 installed.</span></p>

<p>Enabling this flag will only impact the behavior in OWA. It will not change OLK behavior. Making sure I understand the change:</p>
<p>1) You connected to EXO and set this flag to be $true (please make sure that you see the reflected value in Get-IRMConfiguration)</p>
<p>2) You clicked on "Read the message" on the previously sent mail</p>
<p>3) It redirects you to OWA (please make sure you restart your browsers in the machine after making the Set-IRMConfig change) and you see the same error you had pasted?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't click on the rpmsg attachment in OWA. OWA is the reader-app for the rpmsg attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couple of things:</p>
<p>1) for the Encrypt-only mail which was sent - can you log into portal.office.com and help me understand the experience when you try to consume that mail in OWA directly. Do you see the same error?</p>
<p>2) Can you please request your sender to resend a protected mail.. except, this time around, ask them to use the Do-Not-Forward policy. This should show up inline in OWA(through portal.office.com) and OLK. If this step works, ask them to resend the Encrypt-only
 mail.</p>

<p>Enabling the "<em>ClientAccessServerEnabled&nbsp;</em><span>to&nbsp;</span><span>$true" did resolved the problem.&nbsp;</span><span>I just tested this issue out with the senders IT Department directly from them
 to me. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We noticed the issue occurs&nbsp;when sending to a Shared Mailbox.
</span></p>
<p><span>(FYI: The reason why the email needs to be sent to a Shared Mailbox is because multiple users need to collective access these files and they have to encrypted)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you have any suggestions on how we can make this work with a Shared Mailbox?</span></p>

<p>Good to know that this is resolved to individual recipients/groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shared mailbox is a known gap and we are working on it, I don't have a firm ETA on it's availability but we are defn investigating a fix for the problem. On a related note, OME mails to O365 groups works as expected. That's the best workaround at this point
 in time.</p>

    <title>Nokia 6265i activation key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cbxo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6265i activation key</h2>
                    Lets give this a go and see if anyone can help me on this. I've searched through these forums and I havent really found anything on this.<br />
<br />
I put mp3's on to my phone but it wont let me use it as a tone. Says "Not Allowed by Activation key" (stupid thing). I was wondering if anyone can help me with this..how I can get rid of that...and so on. It would be awesome to get rid of this activation **bleep**.

            You can get those activation keys on your provider.Call them if you can download it over the air.

            The Activation Key for the Nokia 6265i is: 771378<br />
<br />
<br />
I called up my provider and tricked him into giving it to me. First you gotta type this into your phone...<br />
<br />
Star, pound, 639, pound ( * # 639 #)<br />
Is how you should get your activation for ring tones to work<br />
<br />
<br />
But now that I did that, I do not know how to continue through the options because i am afraid of what i might do to my phone. Can someone please tell me what those accrinyms mean when you first imput the code? because I too want to use my Mp3's as ringtones.
 thanks
