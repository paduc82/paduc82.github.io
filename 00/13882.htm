<h2>            I cant use the option &#34;older than&#34; in sorting rules</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Sorting messages rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Microsoft "improved" outlook.com all my sorting messages rules have vanished. So I have to recreate them all. This is not how you update an email service.</p>
<p>Now... I cant use the option "older than" in sorting rules, but I have a dumb filter with "received in a specific range date" but this applies to the older emails and not to future ones. There is the sweep option but I cant chose to delete emails after 30
 or 60 days. FOr example I was using a filter to delete specific emails after 60 days from specific address, except those marked as important. Now I can't do that.</p>
<p>I cant even create a rule to move some messages in a specific folder after a number of days, not upon receiving.</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp; had the best sorting messages rules, that's why I switch form gmail to hotmail, but now,&nbsp; you messed that up.</p>
<p>I'm so sad because you have broken something very good.</p>
<p>If anyone can explain how can I recreate those rules, please let me know</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Syed</p>
<p>Yes I am referring to Outlook Mail and I am using Mozilla Firefox as my default web browser. After reading your message I've tried Chrome, Opera and even Edge but the problem is still there. So I guess is not a browser query.
</p>
<p>About the rules, I don't see any errors, it's just some options, (like sorting emails after a number of days since receiving,) vanished. (This rules options were there before the update to the new outlook.com)</p>
<p>And the main problem is that all my previous rules, are vanished after the update.
</p>
<p>So everything it's a mess after the update it's like a new email address and I have to start customize it again, which sucks.</p>
<p>And there is one more problem, Now there is a huge lag when I'm browsing through my email. It's like I am using a dial up internet connection. And the problem is not my internet connection (which is very fast and works great on the old hotmail - I have another
 hotmail account which was not updated yet to the now outlook, and everything is smooth on that one). SO the new update it's a failure !!!</p>

            <p>I came across this post while trying to solve the same issue. Clearly, this is not a problem for a single individual only. I had set up quite a number of sorting rules before the sudden change and it's beyond frustrating not only to have to do them all over
 again but also not to have the same options as before. Yes, an altogether useless response. I notice that we can only mark a reply as Helpful but not Useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as "migrating state" I think it's more accurately referred to as "MS trying to work out bugs behind the scenes". Good luck, fellow Outlookers.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesita, </p>
<p>Your answer is not the answer that we were seek for, and it doesn't solve our problem.
</p>
<p>It seems you don't really understand our query.</p>
<p>We know how to create a rule within a specific date span. We were complaining about the lack of option&nbsp; to delete specific emails AFTER 30/60 days (it's not the same as Sweep which delete all the emails from the sender after 10 days).</p>
<p>So, I repeat:&nbsp; AFTER&nbsp; 20/30/60 days it's not the same with a specific date span.</p>
<p>Let me make it even clear: (On the good old times, before the update to outlook.com) I had a rule to delete the emails from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" after 60 days,
<strong>IF</strong> it's not marked as IMPORTANT and those marked as IMPORTANT will be moved to a specific folder, after 30 days.</p>
<p>So Jesita, AFTER it's not the same as SPECIFIC DATE SPAN.</p>
<p>I know all the Microsoft moderators, support engineers, etc. gives this kind of answers, like yours. But I know how to create rules with the actual provided options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering why did Microsoft, removed that options (DELETE AFTER a specific number of days).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you don't have the answer to that, please don't try to explain me once again how to create rules with specific date span, or Sweep option, or some other combinations that I have already try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your involving</p>
<p />

            <p>The ability to specify an absolute date range is useless in Outlook.com Rules.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone want a permanent rule that specified deleting messages from SENDERX received before 2016-10-01? &nbsp;Surely you'd delete them once, they'd be gone, and there would never again be anything to run the rule on.<br />
<br />
The date range option is really only useful when used with relative dates, BEFORE X DAYS AGO or AFTER X DAYS AGO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But sadly the new Outlook.com took that option away from us. &nbsp;How did the decision to take that away from us and leave with just a useless absolute date option get past quality control.<br />
<br />
Anyways, some things cannot be fixed by complaining in the forum.<br />
<br />
<strong>I've used the Outlook.com feedback option that can be accessed by clicking the question mark icon. &nbsp;I suggest who has the same problem do the same.</strong><br />
<br />
If even just 1% of the people who have this issue send Feedback by the proper formal means (by clicking the ? icon and typing in the Feedback or Suggestion box), MS would fix the problem within 6 months.<br />
<br />
Instead most people grumble to each other and grumble to forums.</p>

            it would be far better if windows 8.1 updated touch (i.e. navigation key vibration off) instead of upgrade on windows 10 in such low memory (Ram) phone because windows 10 in &nbsp;lumia 520 phone hanged many times in a day &nbsp;or windows releases lite version

<p>Windows 10 is not supported on the Lumia 520. You shouldn't be using the insider preview anymore.</p>

<h2>            MMS not working on Lumia 635 with Virgin Mobile</h2>
                    I just got the new Lumia 635 for Virgin Mobile. I have not been able to send MMS picture messages or group text. Data is turned on and working, but there is no access point or option under the Cellular + SIM, Sim Card settings to set up my MMS APN which
 was suggested for others. Is there any way to manually access this setting or any other suggestions?

            <p>Hi MaryBeth635,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those settings are delivered by your Mobile Operator, so please get in touch with your Service Provider and enquire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group text (in <span>Messaging </span>&gt;&nbsp; <span>
More </span>&gt; <span>Settings</span>) uses MMS to help keep replies in one Thread while you're texting with a group of people. This setting can vary by mobile operator and might not appear on your phone. Your mobile operator might charge extra
 for MMS messaging, and this service must be available with your current phone plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><li>If you can't send or receive MMS messages on your phone, you might need to manually enter a new MMS APN (access point name) in Messaging settings, based on your location and mobile operator. To learn how to do this, see the "Add MMS APN" section in;
<p>

<p>I'm having the exact same problem as you. &nbsp;Data turned on &amp; working. Text work, Web works, &amp; cell works. What I noticed was when I take remove the battery &amp; take out the micro Sim (Sprint 4G sim) it renders the phone into a 3G-only but able to send &amp; recieve
 pics. VM sent me a new micro sim (4G sim) and still had mms issues on Lumia 635 (LTE/4G Windows Phone). &nbsp;I also had no option to edit APN under "Celluar+Sim &gt; SiM Settings " settings.</p>

            <p>This did not work for me either. I called Virgin Mobile and they did not help at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get it working by fully resetting my phone. Luckily, everything was backed up, so almost all my apps and settings were saved! If you try this, make sure you back up and then go to Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Edit: To save a backup just go to Settings &gt; backup &gt; apps + settings &gt; back up now. I did lose some photos, so make sure you save those on your computer or somewhere safe. Once you've reset the phone, go back and make sure data is turned back on and you
 have it set to automatically download MMS as stated in above responses.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much Mary Beth! I will definitely try this when I get home. I also had no luck with virgin mobile. I took out the SIM card as suggested and it did fix the mms issue, but dropped me to 3g. So I am excited to try this out. Thanks again!!</p>

            <p>I was having the exact same problem. Virgin Mobile 635 would not send/receive MMS texts. &nbsp;E-maild Virgin support and they advised a "Hands Free Activation" which did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They next said there was a network problem here in the Chicago area - but I was skeptical - as three others in my family (with Virgin Mobile Samsungs) were having no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tired the Hard Reset recommended here - and that solved the problem! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I did a backup just prior to the reset. It did quite a good job restoring everything after the hard reset. &nbsp;But it took quite a while - the better part of an hour - to restore everything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth - I sent a reply to Virgin referencing this forum and telling them about the Hard Reset resolving the issue. &nbsp;Might help the next guy.</p>

<h2>            OneNote - Empty space keeps adding itself above my page of notes</h2>
                    <p><span><strong>The screenshot below clarifies the issue. Please note the box of notes that I am working on, and the size and location of the scroll bar on
 the right. All space outside the box is empty space: no content exists.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Within my page, I have the "box" that I am working on. I understand that I am able to drag to areas far outside of the box. However, the area above
 my "box", has about 2 pages worth of blank space that is accounted for by the scroll bar. The scroll bar is acting like I have actual text above that area. This is the case for many of my pages, both above and below, making the scroll bar on the right very
 inaccurate and telling where I am on the page or how long my section is. This space also actually increased, so I'd like to resolve it before it gets out of proportions...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Has anyone else had this issue, and are there any ways to fix it?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The only thing I've done to those pages are type, text highlight, hand highlight, and put other "boxes" on top of my original "box" (so I can put
 images side by side, or orient info in a certain way). However, I don't see how this should affect my page length (especially the length above my page). I apologize for the terminology.</span></p>

<p>It has been resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the insert space option before posting on the forum but that didn't work. The problem was the way I highlighted using the pen. I would select a standard highlighting color and thickness and tap the screen. Then, I would lasso my mark and drag
 it down, so that it begins to look like a completely straight, vertical line. This created a lot of (massive amounts) invisible space above and below for some reason, but everything returned to normal once I erased those lines.</p>

<h2>            Offset function stopped updating</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using excel 2016 and I'm using the offset function to have rolling charts. So I set my table up for a years worth of data and have a vba macro to delete the first row after the data reached a certain row in my table which didn't work so the data
 went beyond my chart. Now the charts will not update, I extended my table but nothing. I got the vba to work but when it deletes the first row I get a REF# in the cell reference of the offset function. I decided to do without the vba and will manually delete
 the data and reenter the cell reference of my offset function but I need my charts to display the current data. So after extending my table how do I get my offset set function to update so my charts will display the current date and data?

            Finally got to try the formula and it works great. I still have the problem of my charts not updating to the current date. It worked all of last year until some time in December. It's weird, it will update occasionally but is always a couple weeks behind
 when it does. The rows were not to start deleting until Febuary. Any ideas?

<h3> david smiley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidently created a child account for &#64;outlook.com email , how do i unlock it&#63; OCTOBER 2012</h2>
                    So upon hearing that microsoft had a new email service "outlook", and that hotmail was going to merge, i decided to change my email address. I created my @outlook.com email and accidentally set the year to 2012.&nbsp; This turned my username into a child account.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I read the forums and found that link "I am an Adult, Why am i seeing this?" is supposed to be present when i login into my child account.
<br />
<br />
ITS NOT THERE MODERATORS. The link is nowhere to be found as of October 27, 2012.<br />
<br />
I would like to unlock this account so that i can start using it but cant find anyway of doing so. Please fix this, a major issue for those that like a particular username and screw up this stupid birthday lockout.

    <title>Disable Family Features from Local Account in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Family Features from Local Account in Windows 10</h2>
                    Okay. So I'm only discovering the accounts feature in Windows 10. Anyway, I tried to activate an Microsoft account and screwed pretty much what was a good Local Account I had. I deleted all "Family" in my account, and signed out to supposedly the old Local
 Account I had. My problem now is everytime I try use Google Chrome, it won't let me. How can I disable the family feature in my Local Account without signing another Microsoft Account because I'd rather not do the whole thing and end up with countless accounts
 I do not need.

<p>Yes, I made two Microsoft accounts so I could do those you mentioned and after I took all of the users out, the restrictions were still there after a week of not using the computer. We ended up resetting the computer itself without deleting the files to
 restore what was done. Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was, after I switched the Microsoft account to a local one, for some reason there is no way I could sign in again in the Users settings. I'm not sure if that was a glitch or something. But like what I said above, we fixed it after resetting the
 computer.</p>

<p>Hi O-Jake-O,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for your message in this forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We’d give you the suggestions below and hope that will help you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>You can select the cells &gt; Home &gt; click Wrap Text, the text in the selected cell wraps to fit the column width. When you change the column width, text wrapping adjusts automatically.</span></li><li>
<span>You can reduce the font size to fit data in the cell, please select the cells &gt; Right-click and select Format Cells &gt; select the checkbox next to Shrink to fit.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>For more detailed message and more ways, you can refer to this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fix-data-that-is-cut-off-in-cells-E996E213-6514-49D8-B82A-2721CEF6144E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix data that is cut off in cells</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem persists, I want to confirm the information below with you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Could you provide the version of Excel? You can go to Excel File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information and provide the screenshot of it.(Please remove your email address)</span></li><li>
<span>Could you provide the screenshot of “the text gets cut off mid-sentence</span>”?</li><li>
<span>Do all the Excel files have the same problem? You can create a new one to check if the same problem will occur. If the problem only occurs on a specific file, you can create a new file, then you can copy the content of problematic
 file and paste it into new file to check if the same problem will occur.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Extending Qi's reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one cell in a column is "cut off" then there are likely more. The simplest fix is to select the whole column, THEN apply the Wrap feature so you don't waste time applying it one cell at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the column selected, go to the Page Layout tab &gt; Scale to Fit group.&nbsp; Make sure that both Width and Height are set to "Automatic".

<h2>            Office for mac 2011 wont install when clicked on get error image x18-08827.dmg Illegal seek</h2>
                    I downloaded Office 2011 fro Mac through Digital River. The program automatically started when I clicked the download button. It went into download file. After the download was complete (1.04gb) I clicked it to install it.
<br />
A box popped up saying the following; "The following disk images couldn't be opened, (below showed) x18-08827.dmg Illegal seek."
<br />
I tried copied it to desktop &amp; tried again with the same results. I downloaded again but with the same results.
<br />
Any ideas what I'm doing wrong or what the problem is? I'm new to Mac so some of its stuff is strange to do &amp; move around.<br />

            AFAIK the file size is correct, the Office 2011 setup file is approximately 900mb to 1Gb<br />
<br />
What i can suggest is to download it on different machine, copy/paste the file to flash drive and install it on Mac using the flash drive.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result.<br />

You can always call the Office Installation and Activation Support<br />

<p>
</p><p>When typing into one of my browsers, I find that input stops shortly after despite me still typing. [it stopped just now] The cursor disappears and no characters appear. Then after ten seconds, the cursor reappears but the missing characters don't. So it
 isn't some sort of lag as I've seen on other forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried typing into a notepad file to recreate this outside of a browser but it doesn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>16237 was a fresh install as I too have the upgrade problem most of this year. There are only a few essential apps installed [the error just appeared again] and nothing unusual. It happens in both browsers. It feels like a buffer or cache is playing up.</p>

<p>I gave up on 16237 and found the official 16232 ISO and did a total clean install. I noticed that until I'd updated the Nvidia drivers that a lot of odd things were happening but now seems fine. I always suspect graphic drivers - they seem especially troublesome.</p>

<p>I'm trying to keep a running list of how many hours I spend on a certain job each day.</p>
<p>One day it might be 56 minutes, 13 seconds but the next day it might be 1 hour, 10 minutes, 25 seconds.</p>
<p>When I try and enter these into a column it keeps changing to clock times. (1:15:51AM) but I only want to show the lengths.</p>
<p>Is there a special format I should use for this?</p>

            The problem with this is, in my application, I am working only with minutes and seconds. I don't want to have to deal with the hour column or with AM/PM. Even when I use the format [mm]:ss, then edit the cell, my entry of 8:03 still shows up as 12:08:03
 AM. I don't want that. I want it to just show up as 8:03, but still be able to calculate it as time. I only want hours to show up if my calculation of a series of minute/second durations adds up to more than an hour. It's very tedious when you want to enter
 8:03, but you have to use 00:08:03 to make sure the 08 isn't treated as hours and the 03 isn't treated as minutes.<br />

            I'm afraid Excel doesn't work that way. It interprets aa:bb as hours:minutes and not as minutes:seconds. If it would interpret aa:bb as minutes:seconds, lots of users would be frustrated that they couldn't enter clock time easily...

            I understand all this, and I will try the 8:03.0 method. My main point is this: why can't Microsoft improve Excel to include a cell format called "duration" (listed with: general, text, number, percentage, etc.), that is separate from the "time" cell format?
 Then they wouldn't have to change anything about the way clock time appears in the function bar, but the duration cells would just appear as lengths of time without AM or PM.<br />

            I agree 100%! I've had reason to use durations and add them together a few times lately and it's so messy. C'mon Microsoft (and Apple, for that matter, cause it happens in Numbers too) - surely this isn't rocket science for the techs?….

<h3> squareknees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Concatenate date and number just want to show the year</h2>
                    <p>I have a location that has the date 9/4/2015, this is to represent the day that the information in that row was created,&nbsp;E3,E4, and so on.</p>
<p>I have formatted the cell to read 15 (for the year)</p>
<p>Then I have&nbsp;a cells that&nbsp;are just numbering G3: 001, G4: 002 and so on, formatted to have 3 digits</p>
<p>I want the concatenated cells to read A3: 15001, A4: 15002 and so on</p>
<p>I would prefer if the date read 9/4/2015 yet have the concatenated cell have just the last 2 digits of the year.</p>
<p>Every time I attempt it I get a bizarre number that is not the date at all, and the formatting of the 3 digits is gone it just shows 1 digit (but luckily it is the right number).</p>
<p>I never seem to choose the easy formatting, or formulas. </p>
<p>Hopefully it isn't rocket science I'm not good at rocket science :)</p>
<p>Thanks for the help,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as you start concatenating like this you lose the date format and you get the number so you must reformat the date as you need it in the concatenate formula. So if E3 contains a date then this will return the year</p>
<p>
</p><p>=TEXT(E3,"YY")</p>
<p>
</p><p>we can then concatenate that with another cell</p>
<p>
</p><p>=TEXT(E3,"YY")&amp;G3</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may now have a problem with G3 because you said it was <strong>formatted</strong> to display as 3 digits and you'll lose that formatting too so we may need to put that back like this</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>=TEXT(E3,"YY")&amp;REPT("0",3-LEN(G3))&amp;G3</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can of course change the date format in this formula to be whatever you want.</p>

            Thanks for the feedback, but this is a suggestion for product&nbsp;improvement. Nothing in the "first view" of the&nbsp;Start Menu&nbsp;should be concealed when we click the Start Menu Button. Everything should be clearly&nbsp;visible as it&nbsp;is with Windows 7.

            <p><span>I noticed in build 10041 that in the Taskbar and Startup Menu Properties there is a button that say’s “to customize how links, icons and menu looks and behave in the Start Menu, click Customize”,
 well the Customize button is blank! Why have it there and tease us if it’s not going to work. Why is Microsoft going out of their way to make people hate windows 10? I am about to revert back to Windows 7 where I was happy. I am not a tablet person or windows
 phone person, I want my PC back.</span></p>

<p>Click Start Menu Button and half of Explore Windows (Get Started, Insiders Hub and Windows Feedback) is covered. All should be visible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Windows Feedback link for Build 10041 does not work, so I'm posting here.</p>

<p>When the start menu appears, if you look to the right of the tiles, there is a barely visible scroll bar that will allow you to scroll to the bottom of the tiles list.</p>

<h2>            Carbide.ui S40 Theme Edition 6.0</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been searching for this edition of Carbide.ui but I can't find it anywhere. Most download pages just link to the original Nokia Developer page, which has been discontinued. Others only have old versions or the S60 Edition, and I've found a number of
 Russian websites with a Russian version of this software.</p>
<p>Now I'm using the Russian version to make small changes to my theme, but I want to make a new theme, which is impossible without knowing Russian.</p>
<p>I'd be very grateful if anyone could upload the English version of Carbide.ui S40 Theme Edition 6.0, or point me to a working link.</p>

<h2>            New toolbar... &#34;Programs&#34; is unstable again.</h2>
                    I like using a folder tree start-point "Programs" by adding %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs as a New toolbar... which follows a right-clicking the Taskbar and selecting "Toolbars". &nbsp;I learned this technique while I was using Win 8.1.
 &nbsp;In that period, I had to repeat this placing operation once or twice a week because the "Programs" disappeared by itself. &nbsp;I was delightful when I upgraded to Win 10 and also to the Anniversary Update for their holding the "Programs" on. &nbsp;After upgrading
 to the Creators Update, I am experiencing the disappearing again. &nbsp;This degrading makes me somewhat sad. &nbsp;Brief resume of my desktop follows.<br />

    <title>Merging documents with edits from several reviewers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ammyko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging documents with edits from several reviewers</h2>
                    So, I am trying to merge about 15 different versions of 1 document. &nbsp;Person 1 edited Page 1, Person 2 edited Page 2, etc...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is that Word notes that if Person 1 deleted something from their page, but Person 2, 3, 4 (etc) do not have that change on their own documents then Word will insert a comment saying that "Person 1 inserted ____" "Person 2 inserted ______" ....
 and so on. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, as an example:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>If Person 1 deleted the word "The", from the first paragraph of the first page in their edit. &nbsp;That same page, without
 the deletion is in Person 2's copy ... so Word notes that and will note that Person 2 "inserted" the word "The" at the same place Person 1 deleted the word "The". &nbsp;So there is one "The" struck out, and a row of "thethethethethe" 'inserted' by the other editors
 - according to Word. &nbsp;How do I stop this from happening.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Hopefully y'all can help me out, thanks in advance!</span></div>

<p>
The third reviewer. I start with the first review, then combine the second, and that always turns out fine. &nbsp;I then save that merge, and then combine the third review with that saved merge - and that is when it starts "inserting" things that had been deleted
 by a previous reviewer.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the insertions and deletions in the track changes are set by the author?</b></p>
<p>
Sometimes they show up as being done by author, but sometimes they show up as being done by the reviewer who was just merged.</p>

            <p>As I stated in the heading, Windows claims to have repaired the files. So&nbsp;sfc /scannow&nbsp;should not find corrupt files the second time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,but your answer is only partially relevant at best.</p>
<p>This problem did not occur on proceeding from IE7to IE8. </p>
<p>Microsoft 's beta testing is woefully inadequate.</p>

                    Please consider this problem seriously which is the most strangest problem i ever faced in my emails and I really need help. I have three outlook (email accounts) each one have different password, last night I've been try to access (sign in) to my email
 and I surprised that I'm unable to access my email and the page telling me that the user name or password is not correct, however I decided to change my password while I'm sure that the entered password was %100 correct, anyway, when I did complete the process
 and receiving the security code via the telephone I faced the same problem I'm unable to access my email and the page telling me that the user name or password is not correct again!! so I thought to check my other email I faced the same problem even when I
 change the password and with third email as well..!!<br />
&nbsp;1.All the old password was very strong and the new one as well.<br />
&nbsp;2.I have powerful antivirus Norton Security up to date all the time and I scan my computer before and after this issue (there was no virus or any other threat at all.<br />
&nbsp;3.I tried to accesses my emails through my mobile I faced the same problem..<br />
&nbsp;4. No download or app in my browser (before or after).<br />
&nbsp;5. No unwanted or suspicious site entered or visit before or after.<br />
&nbsp;Seriously I need help please...
