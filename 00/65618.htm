<h2>            Submitted a case review, decision upheld with no explanation given</h2>
                    <p>So I was banned for harassment, abuse and threats for a very long period (15 days) and submitted a case review, because it is a very long period for a first time and I really do not recall doing any of that. Naturally I submitted a case review, and they just decided to upheld the decision with no explanation whatsoever. Pretty useful team, the Xbox Live Enforcement.</p>

            <p>Many years ago when the Enforcement Team had their own subsection of the forum, they actually would give out the reason people were banned.<br /><br />It was amazing to see how many people who had 'done nothing' or didn't recall doing anything wrong, had in fact been giving other people over Live quite a lot of abuse.<br /><br />Perhaps the best suggestion is to take a step back and look at how you interact with people over Live. What sort of language do you use when winning or losing, do you pick on the weaker players by voice and text?<br /><br />It is worth remembering that what you may consider abuse or harassment, may not be what others consider those to be. That is why it is best to follow the rules of Live and try to keep your interactions to E for Everyone levels.<br /><br />The Enforcement Team won't ban you for the occasional "oh ****" slip of the tongue.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear about that Mr. Ex-president. I was also suspended as well in the same manner as you yesterday. Hell, it was probably the same guy. As for Zen, you seem to be assuming an awful lot about a situation you don't know about. Everyone who plays a MOBA gets messages after every other match just as you described every other game. People giving up prematurely or after having their team let them die/spam in-game harassment. I have reported plenty of people for clear harassment towards myself and nothing comes of it most of the time. Why doesn't the Enforcement Team state the reasons or evidence anymore anyway? I was threatened by some guy in his late 20's years ago and they told me I was in the wrong as well for joking that he should kill himself before he finished 'tracing my connection to find my house and shooting it up' because it would be less inconvenient for him than being detained if he did show up. I was in the wrong for being harassed over killing a guy in a Team Deathmatch two or

 </blockquote> <p>You could fight it pretty easily to be honest.<br /><br />Make a request for the dashcam and vest camera (if the officer was wearing one) footage. The ticket information would also tell you where you were seen driving improperly, making a request of witnesses and possible CCTV footage also somewhat simple.<br /><br />I am I confess a little torn on this subject. I can understand why Microsoft don't give out details, it could help people work out ways around the system. On the other hand I don't believe that the Enforcement Team is infallible, and the current system lets them claim to be so.</p>

    <title>LifeCam Studio 1080p HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzielton  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeCam Studio 1080p HD</h2>
                    I am just starting to use this camera. When I turn it on to record a video, the image immediately turns pink. It goes from true color to pink and sometimes dark pink. When I play it back, it's pink...and the audio and video are not synchronized.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 Home Premium<br />
on an HP Pavilion p71154 PC<br />
<br />
Anybody have any idea what the pink is about or how to correct it?<br />
<br />
Or how to get the voice and video to synch?<br />

            Hi Arja_Ilona 
<br />
<br />Date Createed - the date the file was initially made
<br />Date Modfiied - the date the file was last changed and saved
<br />
<br />With regards to that Date field, the explanation seems to be:
<br />
<br />The 'Date' column takes the earlier of 'Date created' and 'Date modified', it ignores 'Date accessed', unless there is a 'special' date field added by for instance a camera, such as an Exif-header in a JPG, which will take precedence in that Date field
<br />
<br />The one problem I have with this explanation is - 'earlier of 'Date created' and 'Date modified' - how could the Data Modified possibly be earlier than the date created . . .       
        </p>

<p>On Lenovo its Fn+11 or you should have a recovery icon on your desktop and one install into the windows advanced recovery options Blue Block Lenovo recovery. I am not sure on your model HP. Try enter your BIOS and see if you&nbsp; can
 boot your into factory from there. What I understand its not a reset you looking for.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>PC Game Controller Calibration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mó¨æ§  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Game Controller Calibration</h2>
                    <p>...i've been gaming a looong time and have used many a game controller with many a version of the Windows operating system. i have also calibrated and NOT calibrated my game controllers and there doesn't seem to be any difference in controller performance
 (for me anyway) over these years. i will admit that i have stuck with mainstream controllers i.e. rumblepad, playstation, xbox in lieu of the many other 'off the beaten path' controllers that i have seen on the market. anyway, without blabbing away, as i am
 prone to do at times concerning pc gaming, which i love; i'm forced to wonder why the calibration? it's not a HOW TO calibrate it discussion, it's a WHY SHOULD I calibrate it in the first place discussion. i mean if your response is 'well it works better when
 you calibrate it' then save it. i am curious to find a detailed technically correct explanation as to WHY it works better (if in fact it does) should i calibrate it in the first place. as always i appreciate everyone's input (pun) and welcome new and refreshing
 explanations and ideas equally. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I HAVE noticed that calibrating game controllers for use with some of the olllder emulators (the newer ones seem fine without calibration) helps with the analog 'twitch' of the actual joystick while playing certain games. (supercastlevania IV running
 under zsnes comes to mind).</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway... thankx for reading and again... GAME ON! :)</p>

            <p><em>"if your response is 'well it works better when you calibrate it' then save it. i am curious to find a detailed technically correct explanation as to WHY it works better "</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe not exactly what you're after, but I go on anyway... So, hah ! .... <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7750fa3-308f-445c-845f-7a0e5f981305" /><br />
</p>
<p>First - It really comes down to the game in question.&nbsp; Why it works better ? Well with controllers</p>
<p>it may not, but with wheels and joysticks, oh yeah! (more later).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Games that do use analogue, such as Tomb Raider, and Hitman (at least the older ones I've played used analogue movement), where there is a fine point between walking and running would benefit to some degree if you find the walk run point difficult to adapt
 to, but you can still argue - 'just get used to it'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, whether calibrating makes a controller work better, or not, is largely a matter of personal perception.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I can also see the potential for having the 'twitch' right when using a controller with driving games. If a controller can be calibrated well enough it could make pushing, or wiggling the stick more of an option than flicking the stick (which is what I
 find I do in driving games regardless), </p>
<p>and this may suit some people more than flicking.<br />
</p>
<p>Wheels rule for racing though.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- For racing games I reckon calibrating the steering wheel is very important, and I have spent a fair<br />
</p>
<p>bit of time fine tuning my wheels. </p>
<p>Nuance would be the operative word when comparing using a well calibrated wheel to a controller.</p>
<p>Early on I tinkered with individual calibrations for different games.</p>
<p>Getting the drag, and spring right, and deciding whether to use full rotation, or not, are the main focus. Over time I've pretty much settled down to one profile, but I do still tweak the profile
</p>
<p>if a game desperately requires it.</p>
<p>In conjunction with a suitable wheel calibration, being able to calibrate the throttle and brake is a big help with controlling brake vs acceleration ratios, making for more controlled turns, whether trying to keep a line, or drifting. I always use a bit
 more dead space on the brake than the throttle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Calibrating a Joystick for flight sims to suit the 'pilots' style also benefits.<br />
</p>
<p>When learning both driving and flying calibration would be different from when one is
</p>
<p>experienced due to less over-steer from panic (The Jerk on the handle ;D ).&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, a bit more drag and maybe some extra dead space on the wheel, with a less sensitive brake and throttle should help a learner.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- I reckon both of these peripheral types are more suitable to calibrating than a controller due to them having a greater degree of movement in the axis ( maybe a joystick only has a greater perceived movement due to it's length and full hand grip).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>btw -&nbsp; I rarely use controllers these days, except when hoping in a car, as in the GTA series, BF or</p>
<p>Far Cry 2&amp;3, where I keep the controller handy, but I don't calibrate to suit the game.
</p>
<p>I just set-up the basic global calibration to make sure the sticks are centred properly.</p>
<p>- My main control option&nbsp; is a Logitech G13 keypad with mouse, and while the G13&nbsp; does have an analogue option for the thumb-stick I stopped trying to find out if games work with the analogue option (so few do) and just go with using&nbsp; WSAD on the thumb-stick.
</p>
<p>I don't think the G13 has a proper calibration option anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

            <p>a pleasure reading your post as always BD.. and yes, yes, yes ..and yes.. :laughs: of course all that you have stated here is true; about calibrating wheels (driving games) and with flight sims etc., although many of the games i play (using an analog controller)
 seem to work just fine without calibrating it. let me say first that i use keyboard and mouse to play any game that i can which allows for it but for retro gaming and sure.. some of the newer games out i try out with the controller just for fun. now without
 calibrating the analog controller i can spin on a dime in any of the bioshock series and most any pc game actually (nfs, dsf, etc.) both racing games work perfectly as well, as do just about all of the emulators i run for retro gaming BUT now and then i notice
 (older emus usually) that a game or two will react slightly erratic due to the analog stick being what? dirty? etc.. BUT if i calibrate it, it seems to tighten up that 'twitch' that you and i have spoken about. so i am guessing (ugh) that it may be related
 to the game code itself? (analog or otherwise) which causes this.. hmm... why i asked about the 'technical explanation'.. one thing you did say in an offhand way which kinda got my curiosity up was this..</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I just set-up the basic global calibration to make sure the sticks are centred properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>...that being said, is there a technical difference in something? anything? that even i might not be aware of which would help an otherwise seemingly perfectly running game with said analog controller not being calibrated? i know BD, i know.. it's like explaining
 stripes on a zebra to a kid at the zoo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>:laughs: more to come i'm sure and i can't wait!</p>
<p>

            <p>heya BD. I found a thread which has brought me dang snippity close to the moment of truth and of course i'll do the gentlemanly thing and share it with you.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that what most game (emulator) programmers do is implement the analog joystick 'dead zone' within the program itself. I will also assume analog joystick 'range' is done the same way. going to see if I can find such a thread to explain this
 as well. again.. this is not to say that the dead zone or range of an analog joystick are new concepts to me only that I wish to understand the whys involved. example: if the dead zone and/or range of an analog stick is preset within the actual code of a game
 then why isn't the dead zone and/or range 'doubled, multiplied or amplified' in the final running product once the dead zone/range setting has been tweaked in the settings or emulator that is running the game in the first place? ..and furthermore by the calibration
 in windows itself? ..and so on and so on..</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway.. happy mother's day, game on and all that..</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>apparently windows doesn't actually calibrate the dead zone, only the range of the analog stick. more to come...</p>

            <p>G'day mate... </p>
<p>Back again after a Win7 forum break. I did start a post earlier (below), but wanted to do a bit more
</p>
<p>checking before posting, and then let it slip a bit longer than I intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"example: if the dead zone and/or range of an analog stick is preset within the actual code of a game then why isn't the dead zone and/or range 'doubled, multiplied or amplified' ...."&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p>- I don't think there is a problem in regard to 'amplification' of range or dead zone . I reckon it's the way the math/physics, or something universal in the coding works.&nbsp; AA is similar.&nbsp; There is no amplification if you set&nbsp; 2xAA in both the game settings
 and graphics control panel. 2xAA is still 2xAA. </p>
<p>I expect that as controllers don't have an option to 'enhance game settings' or 'override game settings', that they automatically override the game settings, well at least if the game has a controller option</p>
<p>that's <em>not</em> Monopoly$oft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the article on dead zones -</p>
<p>- I get what he's saying regarding avoiding 'snap' from dead zone to movement, but don't really follow</p>
how the scripts he shows are implemented outside the games code ( <em>"It needs to be placed in a MonoBehaviour"</em>&nbsp; - something to do with the OUYA console ? ).
<p>- Scripting is interesting though. There are a couple of regulars on the Logitech forum who are into scripting and provide some helpful scripts for people with&nbsp; Logi keyboards, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- XBOX controller - Didn't read, because I'm an XBOX controller&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e4f4b404-d1c6-4e9b-81a0-b4ba32b8d193" />&nbsp;&nbsp; hater/bigot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I know... Cut my&nbsp; nose.... It <em>is</em> a good controller ( If anyone asks - I never said that.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>------------- Earlier ----------</p>
<p>Glad you like my musings, mate....<br />
<br />
You caught me fudging a bit with the -&nbsp; <em>"I just set-up the basic global calibration to make sure the sticks are centred properly"</em> - I went with this general statement in case I was forgetting something more refined with calibration, and couldn't be
 bothered plugging in my controller to verify (As I have done now) because, for me it's just a matter of course that all my peripherals get whatever set-up options are available, so I guess I've always calibrated without thought as to it's effectiveness (wheels
 excluded of course).<br />
</p>
<p>- I suppose though; if you have a very steady thumb you could reduce the axis size on the left<br />
stick by 'drawing' a smaller box within the big box. A tricky little game of it's own, that....<br />
- The right stick, Z axis, or rotation sliders are easy enough and,&nbsp; may benefit in some games by not going to the end of the scale ?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Bioshock with controller... Who'd a thought ? But to gain the spin on a dime trick you sacrifice some<br />
aim accuracy&nbsp; vs using a mouse, yes ? (setting up a mouse profile with a secondary dpi setting, and allowing mouse acceleration would also spin you pretty quickly. On a Brass Razzo, no worries.)</p>
<p>I just checked Bioshock and it has the option I hate most since the advent of 'Games for Windows' -<br />
Default XBOX controller, so no default options for my old Logitech . I suppose I should&nbsp; setup a</p>
<p>profile in the Logi software and see how it goes, but meh !</p>
<p>
</p><p>- btw -&nbsp; Am I correct in assuming the newer Logitech controllers emulate the XBOX, and would be recognised in 'XBOX' controller only games ? ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are certainly many games that are best with a controller, particularly old platformers ,<br />
on rail driving games, and the like. Playing an old SNES game - Lost Vikings atm, and a controller</p>
<p>is certainly best with the old Oddworld series.</p>
<p>I've read comments on some newer games being best with controller as well. </p>
<p>Don't recall which just now, but I do recall thinking - 'Nonsense'&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8565cd3a-eb4c-4241-b619-1b89cda4ca3b" /></p>
<p>And that's when my G13 fanboyism&nbsp; shines brightly.<br />
That and... "We're using PC. Be more flexible. You can use keyboard/mouse <em>and</em>
</p>
<p>controller with that game". </p>

            <p>i just love readin your replies :) ...and yes if you plug any controller into a microsoft xbox game (pc) it will be recognized but the button cfg is out of whack but settings can change that and of course i agree with you and also use mouse/kybd when i can.
 who can argue with a razer or a steel series in a half-life 2 deathmatch? of course being a hardcore pc gamer, not only do i enjoy the games but i HAVE to try out controllers, tweak everything and hack the **** out of anything i can. i went through quite a
 few first person shooters on a 52 inch rear screen projection well, because it's amazing. was like being in the movies and i used an xbox 360 controller for all of them (in this particular setting of course). i used the controller because i wanted to have
 that console feel from the sofa etc. tweaking this and that beforehand i had everything set up so i could just grab my rig and pop it in the living room and i enjoyed the response it had will every game. when i said 'turn on a dime' i didn't mean as far as
 how FAST i could turn but the 'sensitivity' at which i could turn, although with the 360 stick, if i jammed hard to the right or left i actually DID turn (rotate) with some serious speed. (maybe cuz it is a 52 inch?) no idea. at my desk i'm all about mouse/kybd
 as you said and yes always a dpad or stick for retro gaming. as far as the 'snap from deadzone to movement' that you, I, spoke about... that is what most interests me about this post and yes it 'only' concerns retro gaming as i haven't encountered that SNAP
 in any of the newer games and THAT is what i want to know. what changed between 'super castlevania IV' (snes) and bioshock that eliminates that snap? mad love man and game on!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps i have no idea if the new logi controller is configured as an xbox controller but if you should find that out let me know. my next controller purchase will be the xbox one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>pps maybe i should have said what changed between atari 5200's space invaders and bioshock as they are comparable (as for using an analog stick that is.)</p>

<h2>            Help required with product ID key please</h2>
                    Hi I am having problems with my laptop. I keep getting a pop up box coming up saying that my windows product ID key is not genuine! I have had the laptop for three years, it hasn't had anything done to it, so why now?
<br />
I spent nearly an hour on the phone to Microsoft this morning, they refuse to have anything to do with it, saying that the id key has been used on loads of laptops. They reccommended I spoke to the makers of the computer (zoostorm) which I have done, they have
 also checked the code and say it should be fine to use. What the heck is going on???
<br />
Any advice would be gratefully received! <br />

            HI I have tried this several times today and just go round in circles, it ended up with hubby phoning Microsoft, and after being on the phone for nearly an hour they were unable to help, kept saying our license key had been used on hundreds of laptops!
 and telling us to contact zoostorm the manufacturer, which I have done and they say it should work fine. Getting seriously hacked off with this now!<br />

    <title>My Uverse remote will not control my Denon AVR-2112ci volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> plaidleaf981  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Uverse remote will not control my Denon AVR-2112ci volume</h2>
                    
<p>After installing the XBOX One my Uverse remote no longer controls my receiver volume. &nbsp;When I volume up or down it appears to be controlling the XBOX volume rather than my receiver making no change to the outputted volume. &nbsp;Also, when I select Mute the XBOX
 screen freezes rather than muting the receiver. &nbsp;My Receiver Remote still works for volume but it is an inconvenience to again have to use more that one remote. &nbsp;My Smart Glass and voice commands also work for the volume and mute.</p>
<p>Cable Box: &nbsp;Uverse</p>
<p>Receiver: Denon AVR-2112ci</p>

<p>Thank you for any suggested fixes to the issue I am experencing.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like something is physically blocking, rather than an issue with a code-set. Did you change from RF to IR? Sounds like a very odd issue.

<p>Unfortunately there is nothing blocking it. &nbsp;My Uverse remote will control the XBox volume but not receiver. &nbsp;The following is a link to a similar situation: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.avsforum.com/t/1503881/xbox-one-snap-tv-game-volume-control-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.avsforum.com/.../xbox-one-snap-tv-game-volume-control-issues</a></p>
<p>Smart Glass and all of my other remotes control the receiver volume without issue. &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is a bad remote code but I cannot find the code for my receiver to manually input to Xbox.</p>
<p>At a lost and frustrated not being able to use my Uverse remote for volume.</p>

<p>I assume you are Juiced46 on AVS. If so there are some interesting things to note. The Uverse remote is controlling the volume on the TV, from the sound of it. I think this because the Xbox does not receive incoming IR codes. It only sends out IR codes.
 So, in essence the Uverse remote is still controlling the volume of the TV instead of the Denon. SmartGlass works though telling the Xbox to send the signal to turn the volume up or down. So boiling this down from what info I have:
</p>
<p>1. Does the Xbox One work via voice commands to turn the volume up/down on Denon?</p>
<p>2. Does SmartGlass work to turn the volume up/down on the Denon?</p>
<p>-The Uverse not working after hooking up the Xbox One makes no mechanical sense to me as the functions have nothing in common. The only thing that would make that change is physical blocking of the Denon's IR port (although I don't know offhand what the
 Uverse remote is supposed to control via additional hardware.</p>
<p>3. Is it safe to assume the Uverse remote is factory stock or is it an aftermarket (like Harmony)?

<p>Thanks for the note. I'm not juiced46 on AVS. &nbsp;My Uverse remote controlled my Denon on volume without issue prior to the xbox. &nbsp;It is now not controlling the TV volume but a volume on the xbox and it is in a small black box in the right upper corner of the
 TV (my TV volume shows in the bottom center). &nbsp;The volume on the upper corner goes 0 thru 25. &nbsp;0 acts like the mute button and freezes the screen rather than muting the Denon and the volume up/down changes the number but not the actual volume. &nbsp;Yes I know
 that sounds crazy! </p>

<p>wsmfpGA are you also, PlaidLeaf981? </p>
<p>That just... defies logic. Aside from possibly switching from RF to IR commands on the Denon (which sounds like something you would have mentioned adjusting). Here would be my thought: Unplug everything 100% go back to as it was before the Xbox got there.
 See if it works. This really sounds like a red herring (although not intentional) case to me. Aside from physical blockage it makes no sense.

<h2>            Family Safety &#34;Times up&#34; &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had time limit set and my son ran up against the limit.</p>
<p>He was given the "times up" message saying you can ask for more or wait for 7 days for more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed my son to be able to do his homework so I removed all time restrictions on his account.</p>
<p>However he is still getting that blocking message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He cannot login to his computer!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC is connected to the net ok as others are using it but we can't use his login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message says if he waits until next Monday (ie next week) then he'll get more time but given I've removed all the restrictions I don't understand why he can't login?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my son's login working again on the PC?</p>

    <title>What happened to my scrolling&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What happened to my scrolling&#63;</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10 I can't use my mouse pad to scroll anymore. I used to be able to go up and down a screen by using the right side of the pad and go side to side by using the very bottom of it. I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop that I've had
 for 5 years and the fact that I now have to scroll manually because of this upgrade is very disappointing. I tried to fix it but the result is still the same. Please help!

            <p>Hi Salena, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model of the Toshiba Satellite laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue would have happened if the laptop is not compatible with Windows 10. I would request you to install the touchpad drivers of the laptop in compatibility mode and see if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Right click on the setup file of the touchpad drivers and click
<strong>properties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Then click the <strong>compatibility tab </strong>and choose any earlier version of the operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us for any issues pertaining to Windows in the future. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

    <title>Bluetooth adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> razgraphics  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a <strong>Fujitsu Lifebook s761 vPro</strong> which had Windows 10 OS on it but I reinstalled a fresh copy of
<strong>Windows 7 Professional 64bit</strong> and I downloaded all the necessary drivers from Fujitsu's site. Everything works just fine EXCEPT my
<strong>Bluetooth</strong>. It doesn't show up in Device Manager under Network Adapters or Other devices, nothing. I don't have a single (!) or (?) sign anywhere. When I try to install the recommended driver or any other Bluetooth driver a dialogue pops up
 saying <strong>"No Bluetooth device was detected. Please make sure that your Bluetooth device is plugged in properly in order to continue installation."</strong> and that is it. My
<strong>Radio switch is turned on</strong> (which is supposed to turn on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), there is no option in BIOS to Enable Bluetooth, every other driver is installed correctly, my OS is updated, Wi-Fi working, I
<strong>started Bluetooth Support Service</strong> and put the startup on Automatic. I really don't see a reason why it shouldn't work. I even used the Identification Number to download the drivers so I am positive that there is a Bluetooth adapter built in
 and I know that the hardware cannot be damaged. Any ideas as to why it isn't working?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
<br />
Raz.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Raz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that this concern occurs due to compatibility issues. Were you able to use the Bluetooth device before downgrading to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you contact the support team of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) of your device for assisting you in repairing the Bluetooth issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h3> larry maddox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 7 Professional on a New Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p><span><span>The hard drive crashed on my Dell XPS 420 desktop computer running 64 bit Windows 7 Professional operating system.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I purchased a new hard drive (Model Number WD10EZEXSP), installed it and have been trying unsuccessfully for several days to install the Windows Professional 64 bit disc that was previously installed and running
 on this computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The installation proceeds well up to near the finish then stops and displays the message âWindows setup could not configure Windows to run on this computers hardware.â</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have run many diagnostic tests but cannot find the problem.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Any suggestions would be appreciated.

    <title>Bug Report&#58; Runaway Windows 10 service &#34;Delivery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bug Report&#58; Runaway Windows 10 service &#34;Delivery Optimization&#34; burns up uncontrollable levels of bandwidth</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Support. This report comes with a $30 invoice for the costs associated with discovering the bug. Please contact me via email to obtain my bank details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was given a new notebook/tablet by work that has Windows 10 Pro on it. I've had it about a week, but I was finding something really strange.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Every day, I would come home from work at about 6:30pm, turn on the work laptop, and suddenly all the Stan/Netflix my girlfriend was watching jammed up. Horrendously.<br />
<br />
We'd tried restarting the TV server (Also Windows 10 Ent) to no avail. We restarted the router. Nothing. I needed to log into the work VPN and check a job (and maybe we're shaped), so I just turned tethering on on my mobile phone. Before I could even get the
 VPN to connect, I got a message from my telephone provider that my data was gone.<br />
<br />
"Thats a bit strange. I just put credit on it. Oh look, its used 1.5GB today".<br />
<br />
I connected my computer back to the wifi and checked the network since there is no data on my plan - and checked out the data moving in task manager - about 40kb/s. Nothing.<br />
<br />
So, I came home again tonight and turned on my notebook. Again, TV stopped working. I opened up task manager, and surprise surprise, bandwidth is being throttled to the max. What is this virus I have installed? The only thing on here is Office, Dropbox and
 Notepad++. It doesn't even know what a torrent looks like.<br />

<br />
So, I had a look through the processes, and there is a massive Local System service group with a bunch of Microsoft services running under it. Lets see whats there:<br />
http://i.imgur.com/lzJGQ4x.jpg (initial)<br />
<br />
So, I started shutting down things I thought might be able to easily hemorrhage data, Window Update - Gone. BITS - Gone. No Change.<br />
http://i.imgur.com/kXm6mzT.jpg (after bashing a few BITS and Windows Update services)<br />
<br />
Finally, I smashed out Delivery Optimization - 0kb/s.<br />
<br />
So, this absolute virus of a service has now burnt off about 5GB of data in two days and has nothing to show for it. This is not an obvious service to switch off. There are no warnings on the login page or on the box. Why it is on by default is beyond me.<br />
<br />
I've submitted this as a bug report to Microsoft as well as an invoice of $30 for the credit they have wasted with a defective service that has real world consequences (not limited to not being able to perform my job - the one reason the software (Windows)
 was purchased).<br />
<br />
I should point out that this computer has been scanned multiple times for updates in the past week. The computer is up to date. And besides which, what kind of broken MS update is 5GB? Did Microsoft suddenly realise the entire OS was complete trash and quietly
 re-released it?<br />
<br />
Most sub-optimal service Microsoft has ever deployed. While I'm happy for Microsoft to take it upon themselves to manage updates, they need to do so responsibly. I have a 20GB/s connection at work, but it doesn't use that for updates. Why does it have to update
 at 6:00pm-8:00pm. All Windows computer in Australia do this by default. Why not do this at 2:00am or a reasonable time? Many business operate up to and past 8:00pm. How does Microsoft expect them to tolerate these unpredictable outages?</p>

            <p>Interested to find this. I've been keeping an eye open to see if anyone else reports this issue.</p>
<p>We've been turning this service off over many machines across our clients to a) improve the operation of the PC (100% CPU utilisation) and b) to stem massive data loss (one client lost over 30Gb of internet data in a 12 hour period).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to offer my feedback through the Win10 Feedback app as well and I'll link back to here.
