<h2>            HTC 8X heats up and drains battery automatically</h2>
                    <p>My windows phone HTC 8X (only a few months old) just heats up automatically once in a while and then drains battery though I turn off all the background apps/data, wifi and 3G, etc.</p>
<p>Anyone with the same problem? Please show me how to solve it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>There are a few occasions when something like this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you install an app recently. I have noticed that some apps can seriously drain battery. Think back which app you installed, and simultaneously when this problem might have started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem could be network connectivity. For instance if you are in a location where the signal constantly keep switching between 2G, 3G or 4G and so on, that can cause battery drain as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a hardware issue as well. The only way you can find out is if you do a phone reset, and see i the battery drain continues to happen.</p>

    <title>Problems Syncing iphone 6s with Outlook 2019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alg48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Syncing iphone 6s with Outlook 2019</h2>
                    <p>I have previously had no problems syncing my iPhone 6s with Outlook 2010 via itunes all on W10 on my old lap top. I have upgraded to a new lap top also W10 but have now updated to Outlook 2019. I have transfered my Outlook 2010 contents using the Export/import
 feature under File-options. I have also transfered the itunes data held in the Music folder.</p>
<p>I have used all the usual tick boxes in itunes to sync to Outlook for both contacts and calendar as per all the MS and Apple instructions as on my old computer, however itunes seems unable to see my calendars in Outlook and whilst it says it&nbsp; is syncing
 and the phone says it has synced no data is transfered in fact calendar info that was on my phone has been wiped.</p>
<p>I have been round this several times and can find no obvious reason why it will not sync.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the only thing that has changed in the configuration is a move from Outlook 2010 to 2019.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on where to go from here?</p>

<p>I am not sure what this means, how do I rectify the problem? It seem sthat whilst the calendar and contacts are all part of my Ouitlook 2019 that itunes is not picking this up correctly.<br />

<p>The calendar is not marked as a "This computer only" item in Outlook 2019 unlike other items in the folder structure. The process still works fine on my old computer using Outlook 2010 but will not work on the new computer using Outlook 2019. The version
 of Outlook is the only variable. itunes works fine with Outlook 2010. It is the same data on both computers that has been transfered using the export/import function available in Outlook for the .pst file. The mail account has not been reset.

<h3> jjengleruk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Onenote really as bad as I think it is&#63;&#63;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I was an Evernote user for 8 years, so had LOTS of notes.&nbsp; When they introduced a relatively low tier price plan ("plus") I decided, yes, that extra functionality (mainly sync across multiple devices) was worth it.....so I started paying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when they scrapped that, enforcing a relatively expensive price plan on all paid users, i thought, having read good things, that I would change over to Onenote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a lot of time trying to get everything imported, which I did successfully.&nbsp; An import tool basically imported my notes into one massive notebook, since I hadn't really been using folders / tags in Evernote (it wasn't really necessary since Evernote
 is so good and fast at searching all your notes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I noticed many problems with sync.&nbsp; Also, the iphone app basically never found anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I read that a note book can't be too large.&nbsp; So I split the "main" notebook into 20 smaller notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, Onenote app for Windows 10 just seems to crash whenever it opens, if I have left it to open all my notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the iPhone app finds notes in "other notebooks not open on the phone", but then when you select them to open, it never does (well not within 5 minutes anyway - which is WAY past my give up time).&nbsp; If you try to open all the notebooks you have, it basically
 grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I thought - if I REALLY need to find a specific note (not knowing which notebook it is in) at least the web version at onenote.com will harness MS's powerful servers to enable me to search ALL my notebooks in one go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WRONG - it cannot even do that.&nbsp; You have to choose your notebook first, then you can search within that notebook only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a joke?&nbsp; So, Onenote can't handle a notebook that's too big, but then it can't handle multiple notebooks properly simultaneously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that the strategy has to be that you divide all your notes into themed notebooks, none of which can be too big, and when you want to see a note you have to know which one it is stored in?&nbsp; That is nonsensical as a design full stop whatever
 the starting point, but particularly problematic if you previously stored your notes without paying too much attention to tagging / folder divisions, since then there's no way of using an import tool to split the notes up into separate notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any pointers to assist?</p>

<p>Use onenote 2016</p>
<p>&nbsp;OneNote 10 is a joke.&nbsp; Its like wordpad.&nbsp; With a nice interface.</p>
<p>What scares me is that they are dropping the 2016 in favor of the latter.&nbsp; I dont understand that.&nbsp; This text box right now has more functionality than onenote 10.&nbsp; Minus the fancy pens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if youre not 7, who cares.</p>

<p>As far as the rest of the complaints, make sure search within images is enabled.&nbsp; You must have done a ton of web clipping, because I have a crapton of data and ive never had the too large error.&nbsp; I do try and keep subject matters to one notebook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lots of trouble with sync, because I have 2 accounts- work and personal.&nbsp; Never works.&nbsp; Maddening.&nbsp; Cant help there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rarely use the phone app and never used evernote.&nbsp; Maybe I need to try it.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Your responses just make me realise how amazingly well-built Evernote was and still is.&nbsp; I have now gone back to it.&nbsp; Like a breath of fresh air honestly, especially for someone (like me) who relies very heavily on notes to store all those useful
 snippets of info we always seem to need at the most inconvenient moments!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found out that the free version actually permits sync to 2 devices (for offline use).&nbsp; So I have nominated iphone and my travel laptop.&nbsp; For other devices, eg when I happen to be using my wife's laptop, the new web interface (in beta at present) is
 so good it's like using the installed program.</p>

    <title>Retention Policy for Junk Mail not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Retention Policy for Junk Mail not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Office 365. &nbsp;Clients are Outlook 2010 and OWA. &nbsp;What I am trying to do is set the retention policy for the junk mail to be more than 30 days. &nbsp;Say 45 days. &nbsp; What I've done so far is add a retention tags called Junk Mail 45 days, type is Junk
 Email, Retention Period is 45 days and retention action is Delete. &nbsp; I then remove the Junk Email tag in the Default MRM Policy and added this new one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I login my account via OWA, right click on the junk mail folder, and click on assign retention policy, it still show the standard Junk Email (1 month). &nbsp; &nbsp;Why is it not showing the 45 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Vince</p>

</p><p>I am not sure if we are on the same page. &nbsp;I have migrated my on-premise Exchange server to Office 365 Business Essentials. &nbsp;So I no longer have the server on-prem. &nbsp;However, my users are all on Outlook 2010 or 2013. &nbsp; What I am trying to change is the default
 retention policy for Junk Email. &nbsp;In Office 365, the retention is set for 30 days. &nbsp;I need to change it to something longer. &nbsp;I went to my admin page and added a retention tag, then added this new retention tag to the default MRM Policy that is default in
 my O 365. &nbsp;However, when I check the retention policy for my junk mail folder, it still showing up with the 30 days.</p>

<p>hello, ive been with my nokia 5530 Xpressmusic for about seven months, everything is great about the phone, i never got more than 30 hours of battery life in it, but that was ok since i get to charge it every day. but since the last update my battery barely
 gets to 10 hours with no changes in the usage. is there any issue with the new software? or is there a way i can check if my battery is ok?.</p>

<p>FWIW, had a similar experience that didn't even involve a software/firmware update. Got an N97 at the end of January. After "training" the battery like we were recommended in the old days (at least 3 full discharge/charge cycles&nbsp; before attempting any partial
 charge), it stabilized and lasted almost a week on a charge if I kept calls, messages or Maps usage to a minimum. Then in March got a spare battery cause I hate to be caught out in the boondocks with a dead phone and nowhere to charge it. Started rotating
 the batteries to age them evenly on a 2 week cycle. By July, the original battery started losing capacity and lasting 2-3 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when I took it to the Care Center at the end of August to get scratched camera lens issue resolved, I also complained of the battery performance. And was promply rebuffed with the sorry excuse that "batteries are only warrantied for 6 months and yours
 already has 8, but we can gladly sell you yet another one!". Now the second battery is also exhibiting the same reduced capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Nokia really expect me to buy a new battery every SIX months?!? No wonder there's such a huge black/gray market for cellphone battery knockoffs! May the Cell Gods take pity on the poor sods who purchase an N8, that comes with a sealed and non-user-replaceable
 battery that will probably require you to relnquish it to the service center every six months or so.</p>

<p>Go for it.&nbsp; If your experience is anything like mine you won't regret it.&nbsp; I barely remember 10125 but remember feeling that 10130 is/was much better.&nbsp; I still think so.&nbsp; There are still obviously bugs but I don't thin they'll be fixed by interim updates
 as opposed to a new release.</p>

            <p>I get the feeling from some comments I have seen there may be another build released officially in the next week.&nbsp; I also feel it is getting close to the time when they would need to release a final build basically ready for release to the public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if both of the above were true, 10135 is the most polished build I have seen and so far seems to be stable.&nbsp; It certainly does still have problems but some of those may be related to the fact it is not a supported build in the Preview program...</p>

<h2>            Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to set my proofing language as German but keep my keyboard &amp; shortcuts in English. (learning German but want to keep typing ala English keyboard).
</p>
<p>Currently I have been able to set my proofing language in Office as German and my Windows keyboard to English (UK). But, when I begin typing in Office the shortcuts are German style even though the button layout aligns with an English keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have experimented a bit and have not found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If relevant I am using Windows 10 Enterprise and Microsoft Office 2016 64 Bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warm thank you, </p>
<p>

<p><span><span>Hi Bob,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Windows shortcuts is related to the default language keyboard. So if you are using German keyboard, you only use the German format Windows shortcuts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Given this situation, for both typing German and using US Windows shortcuts, I would suggest you try United States-International keyboard. You could add it through following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Right-click Windows logo &gt;Settings &gt;Time and Language &gt;Language &gt;Select English &gt;Optional &gt;Add a keyboard &gt;Select United States-International.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then choose it in language bar. After that, you could type German following the corresponding rules.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, Alt Gr + s = ß</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is keyboard layouts for your reference.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Outlook.com not showing all emails in Inbox</h2>
                    <p>In the past couple weeks, outlook.com has been behaving strangely for me: not all my incoming messages are shown in my Inbox. &nbsp;Most are not shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After realizing I hadn't received any new email for several days, I began looking around in different folders wondering if a rule had been moving incoming email around. &nbsp;I was able to narrow down a "workaround": &nbsp;if I click on another folder (such as Deleted
 Items) inside Outlook.com, and then click back on Inbox, then Inbox will show all expected emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looks fine (no "hidden" emails) via the mail app on my mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are other people seeing this too? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Today outlook.com showed me a splash saying "Meet Focused Inbox". &nbsp;Apparently there's a new feature that will allow outlook.com to choose between showing either "Focused" emails (the ones it thinks important), or "Other" (the ones it thinks not important)
 emails. &nbsp;This feature can be disabled in the Options-&gt;Mail-&gt;Layout-&gt;Focused Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately before today it appears I was seeing only "focused" emails, but without my knowledge/control. &nbsp;My problems were artifacts of "work in progress" as Microsoft transitioned to new features before enabling the controls for those features. &nbsp; &nbsp;:(</p>

    <title>Why would Teams require authentication so quickly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rod at work  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why would Teams require authentication so quickly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been waiting for a long time, to get Microsoft Teams into my work environment. I work for a large state agency. Microsoft recently changed the licensing for Office 365 for Business (Government), by allowing Teams to be a part of it. Today, I saw it
 appear as an option for my Office 365 for Business. So, I got into Teams, created a new team for my work group, then sent an invitation to everyone in it. We've been using TFS team rooms for the last 3 years. I know that TFS team rooms is going away. That
 is, at least for me, one of the primary reasons I believe we should move to Teams. Plus the fact that you can do search from within Teams, something I could never do within TFS team rooms. I do tend to be an early adopter. I figured, now that Teams is in our
 Office 365 environment, Teams would be good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I'm wondering if I jumped the gun a little bit. I have Teams running in my browser, waiting for the rest of my coworkers to get on board with it. I stepped away for about 15 minutes. When I came back, I found Teams had gotten into some sort of state
 where it needed to reauthenticate me. I suppose that makes sense, as I was away for 15 minutes. (Although my PC had gone into lock more before that, due to a GPO that locks all machines after 10 minutes of inactivity, so it isn't necessary what Teams to do
 that.) Nevertheless, Teams went into the weird action where it tried to reauthenticate me, but it couldn't. Believe me, if Teams is going to do that,
<strong>all</strong> of my coworkers are immediately going to give up on it and <strong>
never</strong> try Teams again. I've been pushing for adopting Teams for a long time. I'm OK with re-issuing another re-try, but like I said, my coworkers are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tell me, is Teams still flaky enough that it might not reauthenticate someone after 10+ minutes of inactivity? If that is the case, then I can guarantee that for all my coworkers that is a show stopper.</p>

            Hi FredeMax, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Project Plan 365 isn't included in the Office 365 package as it's not produced by Microsoft. The name has 365 in it, but it isn't related to Office 365.
<br />
<br />You can purchase Project Plan 365 from the Microsoft Store here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/projectplan365/9wzdncrdfc3m?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/projectplan36...</a>
<br />
<br />Further information about what's included with Office 365 can be found here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Hopefully that clears things up! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<p>
</p><p>For question 1 and 2, a screen protector or a protective casing may affect proper operation of the screen.<br />
Please verify if it works as expected without a screen protector?</p>

            <p>The double-tap to wake feature requires a distinct 'knock-knock' and the timing is crucial. Others have reported difficulties making this feature work properly.<br />
(Double-tap to wake + the rest of the glance features use too much battery in my opinion, so I keep it switched off and can't comment on the reliability).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The navigation buttons however must work reliably. It is impossible to judge what is possibly wrong over the Internet, so I suggest ask the retailer for his opinion and try another Lumia 532 for comparison?</p>

    <title>Temporary Files Created By Java SE RE Version 7 Update 4 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Temporary Files Created By Java SE RE Version 7 Update 4</h2>
                    <p>Since updating Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment to Version 7 Update 4, every time I open IE8 or open a new tab, I get two temporary files of the format REG??.tmp created in the directory C:\Documents and Settings\[user name]\Local Settings\Temp</p>
<p>The first file contains:</p>
<p>ParsingVersion to 10.4.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 1.7.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 10.4.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 10.0.0<br />

ParsingVersion to 10.4.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 10.0.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 10.4.0<br />
ParsingVersion to 1.7.0</p>
<p>Latest deploy version: 10.4.0</p>
<p>and the second file contains:-</p>
<p>Latest JRE version: 1.7.0_04</p>
<p>The problem is that these temporary files are not deleted when IE is closed.</p>
<p>Has anybody got any comments.<br />

    <title>Display Page Numbers in MS publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james.day  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Page Numbers in MS publisher 2010</h2>
                    Hello all.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to display page numbers in MS Publisher to appear as "Page [X] of [Y]"?</div>
<div>Yes I can insert an # to get the current page number.</div>
<div>Yes I can write VBA to get the value of pages.count.</div>
<div>But there should be an easier method (I think)</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I guess I didnt ask the question clearly, </p>
<p>I want to print page numbers on the bottom of the Publisher documnet that I will produce.</p>
<p>I would like the page number to be in the format of &lt;page&gt; of &lt;pages&gt;.</p>
<p>In Word it would be Page X of Y.</p>
<p>Any Ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is&nbsp;a MACRO for this problem; (Landscape page layout)</p>
<p>Dim strPageNumber As String<br />
Dim x As Integer<br />
For x = 1 To Pages.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ActiveDocument.Pages(x)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strPageNumber = .PageNumber<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shapes.AddTextbox(Orientation:=pbTextOrientationHorizontal, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left:=710, Top:=580, Width:=80, Height:=20) _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .TextFrame.TextRange.InsertAfter NewText:="Page " _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; strPageNumber &amp; " of " &amp; .Parent.Count &amp; "."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
Next x</p>
<p>Still Looking for a better solution however.........</p>

Sorry, I wasn't trying to be a smart aleck, but as no one else had responded (the support&nbsp;engineer answer was not relevant)&nbsp;I wanted to at least confirm that this was not a 'built-in' feature of Publisher...at least not that I could find in any version of Publisher.</p>
<p>Of course you could manually enter the page numbers in that format&nbsp;on either the main page or the master page...</p>

            Yes you would need a macro for this, there is no other easier way out. I've checked with everything &amp; everyone who may know, but its not there!!! sad...<br />
..by the way the macro that you wrote seems to be a pretty good one&nbsp; :)<br />

            Hi Ray,
<br />
<br />Currently, that option is not available. But other users are asking for it; I recommend you click the More menu represented by the three dots then click 'Help &amp; feedback' click Send in feedback.

            Sorry about that Ray. The Skype engineers are keenly listening to feedback though, so, sending it in is the best option right now.

<h2>            How do i find duplicates&#47;unique values in each row&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
can anyone help me with formula that would search each row separately and mark duplicates<br />
<br />
for example<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b<br />
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b<br />
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d &nbsp; &nbsp; b <br />
4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; g &nbsp; &nbsp; c &nbsp; &nbsp; c <br />
<br />
so in this case i would like formula to highlight only A3, D3 and 4th row<br />
<br />
i can do that with each row separately, but in sheet that i'll be working will be much larger (over 10.000 rows)<br />
<br />
also i found an answer here in this thread http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/use-conditional-formatting-to-highlight-duplicate/d9fed2ce-b4ba-41ed-a015-c23a51e57418, but it doesn't work nothing for me (could be difference between
 2007 and 2010 excel)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that Outlook.com is different from Office Outlook 2003/2010. Outlook.com is an account while the latter is a client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook.com can be use like an email client. Now, if you are comparing Outlook.com to do just what Squirrelmail which is also web base mail, please be informed that Outlook.com can does not have that capabilities because it was designed to be synchronize
 to an email client.</p>

            Unfortunately there is no way to fully prevent that from occurring. If no Caller ID is supplied (by being disabled) or the Caller ID is unsupported, the call may be made anonymously but the receiving end may still record an incoming Caller ID originating
 from an unroutable/outbound-only number.

<p>yes, that was the trick that solved the problem. Had and still have a Microsoft account. Reset was not a problem as the phone was brand new so it&nbsp;had no significant content in it.

<p>If you go for the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset via the phone</a>, then you keep your current OS version. However, if you go for the

            Have similar problem. Firstly, I added my live account, then gmail account. After that, downloaded some apps (mail &amp; calendar, notes etc) and wanted to configure them. It turned out that mail, calendar and contacts can't see Microsoft account (althought
 it was still visible in System settings -&gt; accounts). When I try to add Live account through this apps, there are no errors and i can finish it, but after that account is still not visible. What is (not) funny, OneNote and OneDrive apps don't have this problem
 and both work fine. Gmail account in calendar and mail is visible. Can I solve this without reseting my phone? And if I reset my phone, what should I do step-by-step to not get this problem again?

<p>The community is not yet aware of any trick, without resetting. However, because your phone was updated to a newer OS build by now, the migration of your previous Windows Phone 8 account should do after the reset correctly (without doing anything special/extra).
 If you still face that issue, please go for the app&nbsp;<a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/s?appid=ed2b1421-6414-4544-bd8d-06d58ee402a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider</a>&nbsp;» Insider Release Preview.

 Then reset your phone again and start over. In any case, please, report success or failure.</p>
