<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile Camera saving images</h2>
                    How can choose different names when camera takes pictures and save them to the SD card?<br />
I don't wanna change them after saving one by one.<br />
<br />
Default name starts with "WP" and after that comes with the date &amp; time of pictures like "WP_20170711_19_28_01_Rich_LI" &amp; i wanna know that how can change it &amp; choose a different name for them like "00" and after that starts with numbers {1.2.3....}.<br />
Is that possible to change this way of saving images ?<br />

            Sorry, there are currently no 'file manager' apps for the Windows Phone landscape/environment.&nbsp; Because of the way in which the memory and file storage is managed and secured, it is also unlikely this will be provided in the future.

            Hi Cliffhall,<br />
<br />
Does the issue occur only when you watch videos on MSN news website?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur if adobe flash player is updated. <br />

    <title>O365 shows correct primary e-mail address but outbound e-mails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianusvan de ven  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 shows correct primary e-mail address but outbound e-mails originate from tenantname.onmicrosoft.com</h2>
                    
<p>A few hours ago, I noticed that a reply I received from a co-worker's e-mail showed my e-mail address as &lt;username&gt;@&lt;tenantname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com instead of &lt;username&gt;@&lt;tenantname&gt;.com. I logged into Office 365 and, sure enough, all of the primary e-mail
 addresses had changed to &lt;tenantname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com.</p>
<p>After reviewing troubleshooting steps online, I logged into the AD server and added SMTP:&lt;username&gt;@&lt;tenantname&gt;.com to the ProxyAddresses attribute for each user. After doing so and forcing a sync, Office 365 shows the correct primary e-mail address, both
 under Users and Exchange Mailboxes, but all attempts to send an e-mail - whether via Outlook, OWA, or OWA for iPhone - still show &lt;username&gt;@&lt;tenantname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com as address originating address.</p>
<p>There's clearly still something wrong with the Office 365/AD configuration, but I can't figure out what that is since Office 365 shows everything correctly. I even tried signing up for a 365Command trial to see whether it would offer any insight, but it
 shows everything is configured correctly as well.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Some of our site specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've been using Office 365 Enterpise E1 for just over a year </li><li>We have an on-premise AD server (Windows Server 2008 R2) </li><li>We recently configured DirSync on the AD server </li><li>We do not have an on-premise Exchange server (no hybrid configuration) </li></ul>

2.&nbsp;Can you share some screenshot showing the primary address is still 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** in OWA? To upload images, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then select the<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.<br />
3.&nbsp;Do you set them from ADSI edit tool in AD? Please let us know the detailed steps how you changed the ProxyAddress attribute from AD so we can check if they are correct.
<br />
4.&nbsp;Meanwhile, please run the following cmdlet using Exchange online PowerShell and send us the results via PM<br />

<p>1. You said "sure enough, all of the primary e-mail addresses had changed to &lt;tenantname&gt;.onmicrosoft.com", that sounds to me like a scheduled synchronization ran and broke your user accounts because something is wrong on-premises. Straighten this out first.
 AD user accounts should have a UPN of "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", the proxyAddresses attribute should have "SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" matching the UPN. Note the capital SMTP, this sets the primary email address. Any aliases should be format "smtp:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".</p>
<p>2. Check the default domain in your Office 365 domain. This should be "domain.com" (unless you have a reason for it to be otherwise).</p>
<p>3. Check the 'PrimarySmtpAddress' attribute on the users Exchange Online mailbox (use Office 365 PowerShell).</p>

                    I have MSE on my computer yet I still get some malware/virus/trojan thing that pops up has a green shield and starts to run a scan, telling me I am unprotected and do I want to purchase security software.&nbsp; I opened MSE did a quick scan and it said there
 was one trojan did I want to remove, I did.&nbsp; I opened up my Malware Malbytes and ran a scan it said there were 3 trojans and removed them.&nbsp; When the trojan or whatever affects my computer it messes with my internet settings.&nbsp; I have everything fixed and working
 again but why did MSE let that trojan in?&nbsp; Does it not recognize it?&nbsp; Other than not being on the internet how can I prevent that from happening again.&nbsp;

<p>I'm not associated with Microsoft and have no interest in defending MSE other than to try and answer your question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The authors of these rogue programs alter the characteristics/signatures on a regular (sometimes daily) basis to help the programs avoid detection by AV programs.&nbsp; All AV vendors (whether free or paid versions) fight a constant battle to stay ahead of the
 bad guys and keep their databases updated and current and I've read of similar problems with different AV programs on several forums.&nbsp; MSE is probably doing as good a job as any of the AV vendors.&nbsp; Unfortunately you were hit by by a version not yet detected
 by MSE as malware...it is&nbsp;possible the latest one that invaded your system had been just released by the malware authors.&nbsp; Thankfully, you had the foresight to combat the program with your computer skills plus MSE and Malwarebytes.</p>
<p>Following is a well written (in my opinion) "epistle" on how to try to prevent infections by these type of programs; I have copied portions of this excerpt from a post by Stephen Boots, who is one of the forum moderators:</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, these type of malware attacks are difficult to keep up with because they trick you into letting them install. They
 usually come from an infected web site, and usually through an advertisement. You get a pop-up from the infection and you click&nbsp;it to close the pop-up - which allows the infection to install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When you encounter one of these fake virus pop-ups while browsing, immediately do the following:<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">-Do not touch any browser window to close it or browse further</span><span>.<br />
-Immediately press Ctrl-Alt-Del and bring up Task Manager and forcibly end all instances of iexplore.exe, if using Internet Explorer, or the executable for your browser for any other web browser.<br />
--or--<br />
-Go to Start/Shut Down and restart the PC without touching any browser windows.<br />
-If you used task manager to close browser instances, reboot the machine.<br />
-Then go to Control Panel/Internet Options and delete all temporary Internet Files and cookies. If you are using an alternate web browser, open the browser settings to do the same - delete the local cached files and cookies.<br />
-Perform a full scan with MSE.<br />
<br />
The above steps should prevent the infection from taking hold.&nbsp; But if you are infected:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>Start here - <a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a><br />
and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected - and then select the support option for phone (or email if phone is not offered for your region)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Or for email support in English: <a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/eform.aspx?productKey=pcsafetymalware&amp;ct=eformts&amp;supportLinkeformts=E-mail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

For
 international information, see your <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=/international.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
local subsidiary Support site</a> .&nbsp; You can also seek assistance from whichever antimalware vendor you are using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This web site - <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</a> -<span>&nbsp; </span>contains details for many of these common infections, often immediately after they began to appear in the wild, and instructions are provided for how to remove the infections using their malware removal guides.
 They also have forums where you can seek help from people who specialize in malware removal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides MSE, the following recommendations will assist in protecting the PC from infection:</p>
<p>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled.</p>
<p>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</p>
<p>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 and updated with all patches.</p>
<p>-In Internet Explorer 8, use the SmartScreen Filter.</p>
<p>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</p>
<p>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</p>
<p>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that<span>User Account Control (UAC) ON<span>&nbsp;</span>and not running with elevated privileges.</span></p>
<p>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible
 after being notified of available updates.</p>
<p>-<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors
 are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</span></p>
<p>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</p>
<p>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</p>
<p>-Practice safe web browsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will add my two cent's worth - I think sometimes you can be doing everything right and taking the proper precautions but the malware still gets you.</p>

</p><p>I looked it up on the internet and found that i can log in as admin in the safe mod. I went to control panel to log in as admin but it didnt accept my password which was a big shock for me because my password is same everywhere and since i have this computer
 i have only used 1 password. So guys I am stuck. What can i do now?</p>

<h2>            Excessive Junk Mail</h2>
                    Junk mail comes in by the hundreds each day, blocking does not help. Junk emailers are crafty, they use numbers before the @ sign, so they keep using the same domain name and change the numbers. Hotmail did not have so much junk mail.

            <p>Hi net-man,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. We are experiencing high volume of inquiries.&nbsp;As it simple as it looks, spammers put different set of codes to by pass junk mail filtering system of email providers, making each spam mails unique. Setting junk mail filtering to
 exclusive will be the best bet since it will put all emails from unknown/untrusted senders to junk folder. The system will automatically delete it after 10 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product development team is pushing their limits to stop these spammers from sending spam mails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">By default,&nbsp;you will not receive any junk mails until you share your email address or you sign up to any subscriptions online or any similar-related issues. When a website
 asked you to fill out a form and enter your email address, that's when your email address is collected. Be cautious in clicking advertisements on the internet and filling out forms.</font></span></p>

<p>If you downloaded that latest release you would have a Skype 8.x release of the software installed.&nbsp; You can press the ALT key on your keyboard to gain access to the menu to check the version or configure your audio and video settings and test your webcam
 locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Y<span>ou can't make video calls to Skype" is what it will state if it is impossible to make a video call to the other recipient.&nbsp; No one can make calls to the Skype bot.&nbsp; If you are going to be testing video calls you need
 to be calling another Skype user on a device that is video capable (even if they do not have their webcam on). You also need to be calling their Skype account and not someone's phone number as video is impossible over a standard audio-only landline/mobile
 connection.</span></p>

<p>Hi Hessel,</p>
<p>Visio Pro&nbsp;won't show up in portal like a tile. It won't show up&nbsp;under the Software section-&gt; Office&nbsp;either. In fact it is located at Software-&gt; Visio (<a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx</a>)</p>
<p>If you cannot find it in that page, you may contact the admin to un-assign then re-assign the Visio Pro license to see if there's any differences. Please let us know the results for further help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Jim&nbsp;</p>

                    How do I arrange the Favorites bar in windows 8. I&nbsp;don't want to have to open the desktop. I never use the desktop, I only us the apps from start. You can't drag them and I already tried arranging them from the desktop favorites and it didn't work. I want
 the ones I use most&nbsp;to be displayed first. As it is they are in the order added. Is there a secret? You can't drag them.

            hello barb.s 
<br /> open Internet Explorer.
<br />Create folders by right-clicking an existing item on the Favorites bar, clicking New Folder, and then giving the folder a name. You can then drag items from the Favorites bar into that folder.
<br />Remove old items by right-clicking the item on the Favorites bar, and then clicking Delete.
<br />Click the Favorites button, click the arrow next to the Add to Favorites button, and then click Organize Favorites. From here you can add, remove, or rearrange your links, feeds, and Web Slices in the Favorites bar folder.
<br />i hope it helps you

            I already tried this. I don't want to create folders I just want to arrange the favorites bar. If you can't click and drag then I don't see why Microsoft created windows 8 if simple tasks require the Microsoft community to answer.'' Why is it a secret?
 I'm not a member of the Silicone Valley tech circle&nbsp;and&nbsp;not all of us who use a computer are creating documents and doing actual work. I just want an easier way to browse the internet.

<h2>            Question on legitimacy of a pop up from Microsoft on my IPhone for Outlook</h2>
                    My Outlook account on my Apple IPhone asked me to "Enter the password for the Outlook account..." and correctly listed my msn email account name. After entering my password, a screen asked "Let this app access your info?" and further stated iOS needs you
 to confirm its permission for syncing purposes, for iOs to access my info anytime, and to view my basic profile. It also says I can change these permissions at anytime at https://microsoft.com/consent.&nbsp; Checking to see if it is legit. Thank you.

<p><span>Hi MICKEYALTHOUSE,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s possible that the 2-steps verification on your account settings is turned on that’s why your email account keeps asking for your password when accessing it in another application
 or devices. We suggest that you check this </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>article</span></a><span> to get more information on how to manage your security settings on your
 account. You can also use the App passwords to get rid this error message when accessing your account in different devices or applications.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</span></p>

<p>hi piyush,</p>
<p>when we sign up for an office 365 trial, we will be asked to provide an alternative email address,&nbsp;then an email titled with "<strong>get started with office 365</strong>" will be sent to that alternative email address once we have successfully signed up
 the trial.<br />
<br />
so can you still recall and access that alternative email address? if yes, we can go to the inbox of that email account and search&nbsp;the email titled with "<strong>get started with office 365</strong>", the admin's user account is listed in that email shows like
 this:<br />

<p>hi piyush,</p>
<p>since the <strong>easiest way</strong> to get the user&nbsp;id back is through that notification email, would you mind double checking whether&nbsp;that email&nbsp;has been deleted both in local and in the cloud,</p>
<p>1. what about log in to the web page of the&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative email address and check the deleted items again?</p>

<p>Hi Piyush,</p>
<p>Are there any other Office 365 admins in your company? They can check the Office 365 User ID for you via checking either
<strong>active users</strong> or their mailboxes.<br />
<br />
If you're the <strong>only</strong> Office 365 admin and the "<strong>Get started with Office 365</strong>" email can't be found any more, you may need to contact our related team and provide some related information to them to move forward.<br />
For security concerns, I've sent you a private message with the detailed information, please check the PM via
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations .</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
James</p>

            No... but if you reduce the time scale, the day will start with the first working hour. How much you see will depend on the size of the outlook window. On my outlook, 30 min hides the early morning but I see the evening, while 15 min is 8 AM - 3PM, not 8-6.

<h3> tasneemosmani  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to change the e mail address associated with 365</h2>
                    
<p>I have an office (business) 365 subscription and I want to change the e mail address associated with the account in order that I may be able to access my work e mail account in office 365. &nbsp;I did not appreciate when I purchased 365 that the e mail &nbsp;address
 associated with it ( which I also use to access windows on my computer) would be the one and only e mail account that I could work with. How do I change the email account? and how will that impact upon access to windows 10 on my computer? Thanks</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>it's one drive for business plan 1</p>
<p>the e mail address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>i believe i'm on a workgroup computer ( my sole comp/ sole trader) </p>
<p>i wish to change the e mail address currently associated with office 365; i currently sign in to my computer with the same e email address i use for office 365, but my actual email address which I use to work from is a different one and this is inconvenient.
 When I set up the account I did not think to make my work e mail the default one. i don't want to use the address currently associated with office 365, I want to change it. &nbsp;I dont mind signing in to office 365 with the address i currently have , the problem
 is thar the address associated with it is the one windows 10 prompted me to use and i can't change it; so any work documents which i'm working on will not go to 365 as i'm in a different e mail account. sorry i'm not good at explaining this.
</p>

hi&nbsp; winter2016,</p>
<p>sorry that i have not fully figured out the situation. to avoid misunderstanding, i’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;regarding “when i set up the account i did not think to make my work e mail the default one. i don't want to use the address currently associated with office 365, i want to change it.”, do you mean that you want to set office 365 account as the default one?<br />
2.&nbsp;about “the problem is thar the address associated with it is the one windows 10 prompted me to use and i can't change it;”, can you provide the screenshots of the prompt that you can’t change it?<br />
to upload images, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then select the
<strong>insert/edit media</strong> button.</p>

3.&nbsp;at the same time, for “any work documents which i'm working on will not go to 365 as i'm in a different e mail account.”, could you show the screenshots to us for analysis?</p>
<p><br />
thanks,<br />

<h2>            HyperX Clpoud 2 Headset - Microfone - Call-receiver can not hear me, the caller</h2>
                    <p>Good day and thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own and have successfully used my HyperX Cloud 2 Headset on skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few calls the person I call can not hear me. In the setting the mic is showing up and is responding (the grey line when I talk goes green and shows me the level).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I use a different mic and or my webcam as a mic it works fine with the exception that there is a lot of noise for the person receiving the call, which may just be my room echo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought and used the headset with better success in call quality on skype but recently I have problems, but only on skype. Teamspeak and Discord as well as a few others work perfectly. I checked windows setting, levels etc. and it seems all normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            Good day and thanks. I have tried on Skype for Desktop and the WIndows 10 Skype app. Its on all my outgoing calls to landlines. I dont get incoming calls and havent had a problem skype to skype so far. I have had the Issue for a few months now. All other
 apps (discor team speak voip etc) work fine and I tried using a different version of Skype for Desktop which is tricky, but have the same Problem.

                    <p>Original title: internet explorer on windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>the internet explorer has stopped working pop up has been coming up frequently on my computer i would just close it out and continue. however recently the popup comes up a second time and the IE page goes to this page cannot be displayed. the pages im going
 to weather google bing or facebook load and then reset after first popup and then load again before second pop up however fail to load after. other programs on my computer such as steam still have full internet access. the original single pop up instances
 which i have read about on this site where occuring for a month before it switched to this double pop up which prevents me using my web browser. the single pop up instance started after i downloaded some software from online i attempted to delete that software
 and remove it from my startup menu but it repeatedly told me that i cant do it even if i try to use my antivirus shredder program that came with macaffee. i have since uninstalled macaffee and installed nortan however this did not help. one of the programs
 is tower tilt some form of ad web browser **** and the other is some form of download manager program. even when i attempted to use a restore point to reset my computer it said that it could not remove these programs. i dont know if they are malware or just
 incompatable but the way they refuse to be deleted worries me niether nortan or macaffee would remove them. i would rather not rebuild my computer.

            There are no more updates for WP8.1 handsets like the Lumia 630. Official support ended in July this year.<br />

    <title>Word no longer saving footers and pages numbers in my document - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skye4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word no longer saving footers and pages numbers in my document</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a document with a cover page and the remainder as one section. I have inserted a footer with my name and the page numbers using the Quick Parts Tool and fields. For some reason, this information is suddenly no longer being saved. When I opened
 the document today to continue working, the footers and page numbers were all gone. I went through the process again to insert them again but the result was the same. When I opened my saved document both on my computer as well as on OneDrive, the footer with
 my name and page numbers was gone. Up until today, this was working well and each time I opened the document, its formatting was preserved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone has some solution to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hello, <br />
<br />
I suspect that your footer will show up if you print, convert to a pdf or use print preview.
<br />
<br />
Try the following: <br />
1. Insert Tab <br />
2. Footer <br />
3. Edit Footer <br />
<br />
Do you see your footer? <br />
<br />
If so, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/WhiteSpace.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Elusive White Space by Suzanne Barnhill</a>

 fix it for you and explain what I did. <br />

<h2>            Cannot open emails from one sender</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I could open emails from one particular sender and today I cannot. I don't know what is going on. I can open all of my other emails but not this one particular one. Please help because clearing my cache and using a different web browser has not
 helped at all. I have even tried reporting it to Microsoft and no help. I just keep getting the same message: Outlook.com was not able to complete this request. Microsoft may contact you about issues you report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on why I cannot open up messages from one particular sender now when I could open them no problem yesterday.</p>
