<p>This sounds like the issue I reported in Feedback Hub.&nbsp; Below is a link to it in case you want to comment and/or upvote.</p>

<p>It would be nice if you could identify your actual sound device so others could check theirs.&nbsp; In some cases, these situations are related to one brand/model of a device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a situation a few builds ago where a specific version of an Intel audio driver was being installed and it stopped other devices from working correctly.<br />

<p>I upvote yours but in Feedback hub there are more that 30 tickets about "no sound" in 18298.</p>
<p>I opened a ticket in feedback hub today 10 hours ago and none from M$ says nothing about this.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is that after update to 18298 there is no sound because the audio controlers "magically" dissapepars from Device manager.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Windows didn't see none audio controller so... there is no sound at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In 18290 In Device manager I have 3 controllers:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">- Intel display audio;</span><br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and sound was great.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now in 18298 in Device manager I have only 1 controller:<br />
-N</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">vidia virtual audio device</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and this one with an M$ generic driver.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Tried to install an Nvidia driver but after restart there is the M$ generic one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And there are NO other controllers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No Intel and no Realtek.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Tried to install the Realtek driver that works in 18290 but it didn't install nothing because :"There is no device
 installed".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So this build didn't see the controllers and there is no sound.</span><br />

<p>A generic controller may be the Realtek but no drivers are available other than the basic Win 10 one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure and check the hidden devices in Device Manager..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you showing in Device Manager, System devices, any Intel Smart Sound devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a device is not showing up in Device Manger, that usually means the system does not recognize it during boot.&nbsp; Maybe a reboot or give it some time for Windows to pick it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As someone else mentioned, maybe it is intentional for some type of test of some specific device or driver...</p>

<div>In 18298 Device manager there are no other sound controllers besides the Nvidia virtual audio device.</div>
<div>It shows like widows didn't see my sound card.<br />
<div>
<p>But in 18298 it apears in system devices an high definition audio controller that have this error: "This device cannot start. (Code 10) {Operation Failed} The requested operation was unsuccessful."</p>
<div>
<p>As&nbsp; I said before, tried few (4 or 5) Realtek drivers but every time after install my laptop runs in BSOD and restarts.</p>
<p>Tried to install Intel smartsound driver but no luck either...</p>

<p>Nothing works and don't know what else to try.</p>

            I had the same exact thing on both my laptop (EliteBook 8570w) and PC (Pavillion Elite h8-1360t. with Nvidia GTX 1070 and Beats chip). They are both HP computers with Realtek chipsets and NVidia graphics. After the update I only had my NVidia HDMI recognized,
 with no sound.

<p>If that doesn't help, try re-adding your carrier's APN settings by going to settings&gt;network&amp;internet&gt;mobile&amp;sim. The APN settings of your carrier should be found in the carrier's website or their technical support can help you with that.</p>

</p><p>Hello there, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e09f3606-2f74-4735-93e5-725795e15f15" title="WJLJ">
WJLJ</a>! Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>About your concern, you can restart your phone. To restart, press and hold the
<strong>Power</strong> button until a <strong>Slide down to power off</strong> message appears on-screen, then swipe down. (It usually takes about three seconds for the message to appear.) To turn your phone back on, press the
<strong>Power </strong>button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, press and hold the <strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>
Power </strong>buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10 to 15 seconds), then release the buttons. Your phone will restart automatically.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please be reminded that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your phone may vibrate as soon as you press the <strong>Volume down</strong> and
<strong>Power </strong>buttons because it's changing your ringtone to vibrate. Wait to release the buttons until you feel the second vibration 10 to 15 seconds later.<br />
<br />
If you don't let go of the buttons immediately after the vibration at 10 to 15 seconds, your phone may show a black startup screen instead of restarting normally. If that happens, try pressing the button combo again.<br />
<br />
Not all phones restart this way, so check with your phone's manufacturer to find out how to force a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your phone has a replaceable battery (it's often under your phone's back panel), you can also restart your phone by removing and reinserting the battery, and then pressing the
<strong>Power </strong>button to turn on your phone. The date and time may be off after you restart this way, but you can fix that by swiping over to the All apps list from
<strong>Start</strong>, then selecting <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt;
<strong>Date &amp; time</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If restarting your phone doesn't fix the problem, try <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
resetting your phone</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

    <title>why do the graphics disappear when saving a onenote file as word doc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgo2  say:</h3>
<h2>            why do the graphics disappear when saving a onenote file as word doc</h2>
                    missing graphics when saving onenote article to word doc-I have a partial solution to this mystery-<br />
<br />
Applies To: Office | Office 2010 | Microsoft Office OneNote | Windows 7 <br />
<br />
Graphics will disappear when saving OneNote page as word doc‚Äì mystery -sort of solved-<br />
<br />
I kept discovering that all the graphics were gone and replaced by a small red x with a white outline box when saving a OneNote article to a MSWord doc. (either .doc or docx. ‚Äì did not matter which format.<br />
<br />
My OneNote folders are saved at:<br />
<br />
D:\Documents\OneNote Notebooks<br />
<br />
I discovered that when saving a OneNote file as doc, a folder was created here in a Temp folder:<br />
<br />
C:\Users\(xxx)_admin\AppData\Local\Temp\{DD13090A-9E95-414F-A17B-BF72BE28C5CF}_files<br />
<br />
When that Temp folder was cleared (files within the folder deleted), then the graphics disappeared in the Word doc!<br />
<br />
Obviously, the graphics are ‚Äúheld‚Äù in that folder to be made available to the Word article that I had saved. This means that the -OneNote to Word- docs are useless when transferred to another computer or sent to another person. That is because the graphics
 are not saved as part of the Word doc.<br />
<br />
-When saving the OneNote article as PDF of XPS the problem does not exist; the graphics are fine.<br />
<br />
-When creating a Word doc using standard copy and paste into the doc, there is no problem‚Ä¶the graphics are preserved. The problem only shows up when saving a OneNote article to Word.<br />
<br />
So, how do I ‚Äúforce‚Äù OneNote to save the graphics within the OneNote file, or is that possible?<br />
<br />
OS is Windows 7 and Vista&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />Not a setup issue for "wav" files but rather what has been selected as your "output device" as per the attached screenshot (go to Windows --&gt; Settings)<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17b2fa18-66b6-48d5-b4b0-3b089436122c?upload=true" />

<h2>            Installing ISO of Windows 10 I get the error Setup Has Failed To Validate The Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install Windows 10 on my desktop which is currnetly running Windows 8.1 x64</p>
<p>When I mount the ISO and run the setup it exists within about 20 seconds displaying the message
</p>
<p>"Windows 10 Setup Has Failed To Validate The Product Key"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the download from the insider preview page </p>
<p>Windows10_InsiderPreview_x64_EN-GB_10162.iso</p>
<p>
</p><p>At no point does it prompt me to enter the product key.... </p>
<p>Also I have a legally activated copy of Windows 8.1 that has been registered for the Windows 10 consumer release, but I'd love to install Windows 10 but it is proving difficult, especially as the Windows 10 setup via Windows update just seems to result in
 a BSOD with the error about Keneral Security Check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any advice anyone has.</p>

<h2>            Why no longer a postal bar code in formatting an envelope&#63;</h2>
                    <p>To Community:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does Word no longer provide the ability to print a bar code when formatting an envelope? This feature has been around for years in prior versions of Word! Does anyone know of a good reason for Microsoft to eliminate? Running Apple OS Mojave 10.14.4.</p>

<p>Hi <br />
<br />
<strong>They no longer have it because the bar code that was added no longer conformed to postal service requirements and could actually slow mail down.</strong> It certainly would not qualify any mailing for a discount. The BarCode field is still there but
 I do not think it has any use.<br />
</p>
<p>With Word 2013 MS introduced two new fields: DisplayBarCode and MergeBarCode. These produce many bar codes, but not ones suitable for postal use in the USA.&nbsp; I expect but do not know that they work on the Mac version of Office 2019.</p>

            USPS optically scans addresses and prints barcodes directly on the mail. The scanning is now so fast and accurate that even if Word could print barcodes that conform to current standards doing so wouldn't make any difference in mail processing time.<br />

<h2>            That Whacky Conditional Compiler Constant</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Expert
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p>Conditional compilation allows us to control what code is compiled and run depending on environmental or situational sensitive attributes such as whether we are running on a Windows or Mac operating system, in a debugging or production mode, or running in
 a 32 or 64 bit environment. But the way conditional compilation directives function, built-in constants such as VBA7 and Win64 are presented as Boolean values but they are not which can lead to confusing results.</p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p class="contentHeader2">Conditional Compilation</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a long time now, VBA for Office has provided support for conditional compilation. Conditional compilation lets you selectively compile specific lines of code. Below are some reasons for doing this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application needs to run in different versions of Office and there are differences in the object model between the versions, and code that may compile in one version will not in another.</li><li>Your application needs to run in both 32 bit and 64 bit Office.</li><li>You want to develop using early binding to get the benefits of VBE's Intellisense but you want to distribute code that uses late binding to avoid having to ship with library references and thus avoid library version issues.</li><li>You want to distribute a testing version of your application with ample debugging code in place to detect and log status information and anomalous behavior, but want to distribute a production version that excludes the majority of debugging code to optimize
 performance.</li></ul>
<p>Without conditional compilation, doing the above means either having different code projects or commenting and uncommenting a lot of code to create the different versions. The advantage of conditional compilation is that all versions of the code can co-exist
 in the same project. Conditionally compiled code is encapsulated in special ‚Äú#If‚Ä¶#Else‚Ä¶#End If‚Äù directives where the ‚Äú#If‚Äù directive uses one or more conditional compilation constants to determine whether or not the code within the ‚Äú#If‚Ä¶#End If‚Äù is compiled.
 Note that the ‚Äú#If‚Äù directive is not the same as the compiled ‚ÄúIf‚Äù statement‚Äîall conditional compilation directives are preceded with a pound sign or hash tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When evaluating a conditional compilation constant with a ‚Äú#If‚Äù directive, if the constant has not been defined then the test will not fail but always return a negative result. This makes conditional compilation directives work across all versions of Office,
 and allows us to conditionally use code that works in one version of Office where the constant is defined and not use that code in another version of Office where the constant is either not defined or is defined as 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Conditional Compilation Constants</p>
<p>
</p><p>A conditional compilation constant is a named ‚Äúvariable‚Äù set to an integer value. The most commonly used values are 0 (False) and -1 (True). Conditional compilation constants are defined one of three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the ‚ÄúProject Properties‚Äù dialog box. When defined here the constant is available in all modules in the project.</li><li>In the command line when the workbook is opened. When defined here the constant is available in all modules in the project.</li><li>Using the ‚Äú#Const‚Äù directive in a code module. When defined this way the constant is only available in the module in which it is declared.</li></ol>
<p>More detailed information on how to define conditional compilation constants is presented
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa240847%28v=vs.60%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA provides some built in conditional compilation constants that allow conditional compilation determinant on environmental characteristics such as whether the installation is 32 or 64 bit or if the installation is Windows or Mac. A description of these
 constants is presented <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/gg264614%28v=office.15%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Using Conditional Compilation</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides the basic mechanics of the ‚Äú#If‚Ä¶#Else‚Ä¶#End If‚Äù directives and defining the conditional compilation constants, how the #If evaluates the constants is where this discussion gets interesting. If you are not careful, the results may be unexpected. And
 the results are not always obvious since the condition determines what is compiled, not how the code functions when run.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What, Exactly, Is a Conditional Compilation Constant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where things start to get confusing. The conditional compilation constant is essentially an undefined type. When entered using the ‚ÄúProject Properties‚Äù dialog it has to be an integer from -32768 to 32767 (no thousands separators.) When defined using
 the ‚Äú#Const‚Äù directive it can be anything such an integer of any size, a real, a Boolean (True or False,) or a string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, when using the ‚ÄúProject Properties‚Äù dialog to define conditional compilation constants, any value less than -9999 is saved but is not restored in the text edit field when the dialog is re-displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">The Boolean Test</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Boolean test is where conditional compilation really breaks down. Most systems including Excel formulas on the worksheet and VBA code evaluate Boolean tests as an examination of a numeric value (strings generate an error) where a value of 0 is False
 and any non-zero value is True. Effectively any value equal to 0 is False and any value not equal to 0 is True.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the VBA conditional compilation function does not operate this way. It evaluates any value not equal to 0 as True and any value not equal to -1 as False. What this means is that any value other than 0 or -1 is going to result in a positive outcome whether
 or not the ‚ÄúNot‚Äù operator is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Why Is The Faulty Boolean Test An Issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conditional compilation Boolean test is only an issue if the constant is presented as a Boolean value and you evaluate it as a Boolean in a
<span>&nbsp;</span>test condition. Unfortunately, this is the case with <em>all</em> predefined constants: Microsoft defined them as set to a 0 or a 1. Let‚Äôs look at a specific example using the Win64 predefined constant</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>test condition. Unfortunately, this is the case with <em>all</em> predefined constants: Microsoft defined them as set to a 0 or a 1. Let‚Äôs look at a specific example using the Win64 predefined constant</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#If Win64 Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is Win64"<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#If Not Win64 Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the conditional compilation comparison function operated as expected, if Win64 is 0 then ‚ÄúWin64‚Äù will be printed and if Win64 is 1 then ‚ÄúNot Win64‚Äù will be printed. But this is not the case. If Win64 is 0 then ‚ÄúNot Win64‚Äù will print and if Win64 is 1
 then both ‚ÄúWin64‚Äù and ‚ÄúNot Win64‚Äù will print. Effectively, the ‚ÄúNot‚Äù condition will always be true because the test is ‚ÄúIf Win64 &lt;&gt; -1‚Äù versus the correct ‚ÄúIf Win64 = 0‚Äù.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Workarounds</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are four workarounds to deal with this deficiency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don‚Äôt use the ‚ÄúNot‚Äù operator when working with built-in constants. Rather, use the ‚Äú#Else‚Äù clause:</li></ul>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#If Win64 Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is Win64"<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is Win64"<br />
#Else<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Or, if only the negative is needed:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#If Win64 Then<br />
#Else<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the negation operator:</li></ul>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#If ‚ÄìWin64 Then</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is Win64"</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#End If<br />

<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Note that the first case isn‚Äôt really needed but is included for consistency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a non-Boolean test:</li></ul>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#If Win64 = 0 Then<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"</p>

<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#End If</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a new constant:</li></ul>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#Const MyWin64 = -Win64</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">#If MyWin64Then</p>

#If Not MyWin64 Then</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Debug.Print "Is not Win64"<br />
#End If</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Caveat: ‚Äú#Const‚Äù defined constants are not global.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Dear Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an ideal world, the built-in constant values would be a true Boolean of 0 or -1 instead of 0 or 1. However, given that the incorrect values have been in place for a while, changing this now would cause more problems that it would solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address the issue discussed above, changing how the conditional compilation engine evaluates the ‚ÄúNot‚Äù operator would suffice. Currently it uses the logic ‚ÄúIf Value &lt;&gt; -1‚Äù. The correct test is ‚ÄúIf Value = 0‚Äù.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, because the number of object model changes is increasing with the releases, we are in need of built-in conditional compiler constants that reflect the release version. As with the bit version, the release version would be forward but not backward
 compatible. Office15 would be ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù in 2013. Office14 would be ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù in 2010, 2013, and Mac 2011. Office12 would be ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù in 2007, 2010, and 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, a single constant can be used to represent the version number. For example: OfficeVersion = 15.0. This technique eliminates the need to create more constants for each release. And provides all of the functionality needed to implement conditional
 compilation based on version-dependent functionality and features.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">A Final Note on 64 Bit Business</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some confusion about how to use conditional compilation constants to implement code that functions in both 32 and 64 environments. There are two constants used for this:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">VBA7: VBA7 is set to 1 if the code is running in Office 2010 or later, 0 for older versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">WIN64: WIN64 is set to 1 if the Office installation is 64 bit, 0 for 32 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is important to understand when beginning the conversion of code to operate in both 32 and 64 bit environments is that VBA does the conversion for us in a single declaration. All we need to do is tell VBA that the declaration is ready for conversion.
 For example, take this Windows API declaration in a pre-64 bit world:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Declare Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" ( _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Long</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Long</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the declaration to be convertible to either 32 or 64 bit it becomes:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Declare PtrSafe Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" ( _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As LongPtr</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As LongPtr</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PtrSafe keyword tells the compiler that the Declare statement is safe to run in 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office. The LongPtr type is converted by VBA at compile time to either a Long if running in a 32 bit environment or a LongLong in a 64 bit environment.
 (If defining a 64 bit integral variable then explicitly use the LongLong type. Note that the LongLong type is only available in 64 bit environments and should be used only when a Windows API routine specifically requires that type such as when calling a math
 API routine. In general you should not have to use the LongLong type.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So which conditional compilation constant should we use and how? The answer lies in understanding that all we need to do is be aware that the VBA compiler might not understand the keywords PtrSafe and LongPtr. In other words, we might be running in a pre-2010
 version environment. Therefore we need to use the VBA7 constant as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#If VBA7 Then</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Declare PtrSafe Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" ( _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As LongPtr</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As LongPtr</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#Else</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Declare Function FindWindow Lib "user32" Alias "FindWindowA" ( _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpClassName As String, _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ByVal lpWindowName As String) _<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Long</p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Long</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">#End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code in the first part of the ‚Äú#If‚Äù construct is used in 2010 and later versions and VBA handles the task of ensuring it is properly configured for the bit environment in which the code is running. The second part of the ‚Äú#If‚Äù construct is used in 2007
 and earlier versions where 64 bit environments do not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when do we use Win64? Only when we explicitly need to write code that is different depending on the bit environment in any 2010 or later version.</p>

<h3> leonidusov---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio post processing</h2>
                    
<hr />
<div>Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
I will start with a question as it goes:<br />
Is it possible to intercept the PCM stream that is routed by the system to the AudioSink (i.e. speakers or headphones) and inject some post-processing on system wide basis?<br />
<br />
My current investigation lead me to the following status.<br />
<br />
-There is a system-wide audio destination, the CMMFAudioOutput sink. Maybe it is possible to create another sink, that will perform the post-processing and then redirect the resulting stream to the original output.<br />
<br />
-There is a set of codecs that are instantiated by the DataPath depending on the FourCCs of the data source and data sink. Maybe it is possible to create a system-wide wrapper that will be called instead of any other codec, that will inside load the needed
 codec and after that perform the post-processing before returning the stream.<br />
<br />
-There might be some other place for such a sound hook that i haven't found in the documentation.<br />
<br />
I absolutely understand that such a scenario is a very dangerous thing to allow in an OS for phones. This is the reason that makes me wonder if this problem is solvable at all. Still, there might be some ways, that will surely include driver signing and any
 other actions preventing malicious usage.</div>

<h2>            Excel Auto populate list of cells based on drop down box selection</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, I am new to this forum and I need some guidance. I am trying to make a printable list of items for my employees that revolves around a drop down box.. let me explain further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a series of different jobs that take different components to build and I currently have a master sheet set up with all of the parts and what job these parts belong to, as of right now, the page that I am currently making to be the printable "checklist"
 if you will has two things. A drop down box containing the different kinds of parts, and a sub dropdown box containing the part numbers of whichever job type you pick in the first box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am trying to make it so once I pick a part number from the second drop down box, I can automatically fill the cells in the rest of the worksheet with the parts required for the job. Is this possible? I am trying to make it very user friendly for my
 employees to use. Like three clicks and then print kind of deal. I am able to fill a single cell using VLOOKUP but I cannot seem to wrap my brain around have multiple cells auto fill with the appropriate information. This would also need to fill in two columns
 of info, I have a column for "Part Number" and "Description" and the rows can be anywhere from 20 to 40 long depending on how many parts go to each job. Thinking about this has been making my brain hurt for hours as I am still fairly new to excel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any guidance into the right direction will be very much appreciated.. thank you!</p>

<p>Hi BrianHill1994<span>Ôºå</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the data is not complete, you may try the following formulas and share the outcome:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.In the Part number first cell, you can fill the formula with =IF($H$4=Master!$G$2,Master!$H4,IF($H$4=Master!$J$2,Master!$K4,Master!$N4)),</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p>2.In the Description column first cell, you can use this formula</p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>=IF($H$4=Master!$G$2,Master!$H4,IF($H$4=Master!$J$2,Master!$K4,Master!$N4))</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have sent the sample file via<span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">&nbsp; PM</a>.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Can send but not receive emails with hotmail-web or outlook since - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haraldschmitzer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can send but not receive emails with hotmail-web or outlook since Tuesday morning</h2>
                    Since Tuesday morning (4.6.13) no more emails are being received by my Hotmail-Account.<br />
No settings have been changed on my side. It is not a problem of the outlook-application<br />
of windows as the emails, do not show up on the Web-interface as well.<br />
I can send out emails though.&nbsp;<br />
Interestingly forwarding works: so emails that I receive on my hotmail account are<br />
being forwarded, but no copies are left in my inbox (although enabled in settings).<br />
Reverting back to non forwarding does not help with the problem.
<div>All the usual answers (forwarding, junk filter, rules, and so on have been checked), so<br />
I am convinced it must be a server side problem. Especially as it started overnight,<br />
where I definitely did not change anything.</div>
<div>I do not know where I can get support for this. This problem is also not flagged<br />
in any of the status reports.<br />
Am I the only one having this issue ?</div>
<div>Who can I ask ?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
Harald</div>

            Problem Solved: "Total clean up of my email-account"<br />
<br />
Not sure if something has been changed on the server side, but I did the following:<br />
- copied all my emails via outlook on windows to a separate pst-file<br />
- deleted all emails and folders on outlook and synced<br />
- deleted the rest of the files on outlook.com (some were left although non<br />
&nbsp; showed up in outlook on my PC)
<div>- after about 30 minutes some old emails started showing up and&nbsp;<br />
the full functionality (receiving emails) was restored<br />
- moved then all my files back to my hotmail account from my backup.pst-file</div>
<div>- synced (takes 1-2 hours...) to get my emails online again<br />
<br />
(space use was only 1.1GB, so that should not have been the problem).<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Harald</div>

            Thanks Kay, I did solve the issue. I think the problem is that with Hotmail when you look in the outlook data files, it says "not available", while normally you would see your pst file and you would be able to repair it. I think that would have worked.
 In fact I decided to export all my mails to a pst file, when I did that I got a message saying the my ost file was corrupted and he asked me if I wanted to repair it, I clicked yes and after a long time everything worked again.

    <title>Excel 2016 Tablet Annoyances - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ftsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Tablet Annoyances</h2>
                    I'm noticing many variances in Excel 2016 running on tablets. I've posted several times looking for code that is specific for 2016 on tablets but have not yet been answered by anyone, not even MS. Here is one of many minor-minor annoyances. On a worksheet
 double click event. It works like a charm on all desktop versions but on the 2016 tablet it does not trigger especially if you use tap-tap or touch-touch to simulate a double click (you have to assume when working on the tablet version users may not have a
 keyboard available and are using screen gestures to simulate the keyboard. Like touch and hold for right-click and tap-tap for double-click).<br />
<br />
Another&nbsp;minor annoyance is on the right click event. Again, works great on all desktops but on tablet not so. I simply tested the right click event with cancel=true to disable right click short cut menus. On all desktop versions work great. On tablet not so.
 I had to add&nbsp; "Application.CommandBars("Cell").Enabled = False"<br />
to the worksheet_activate on any sheet that I wanted to disable the right-click. Assume all worksheets are protected. Also. I've asked how to display cell comments on the tablet when there is no keyboard to mouse over a cell (w/o using code to hide/show comments)?<br />
<br />
Are there any explanations or updated white sheets noting all of Excel 2016 for Tablets nuances?

            <p>I've also asked several times about a winApi (or other) for coding screen gestures in Excel 2016 on a tablet? Is there anything to capture a screen gesture (swipe left, swipe up, etc) and add code to it similar to double-click, right-click, mouse-up, key
 press events, etc. ? Simple gestures would be adequate. Swipe left, right, up, down move to the next/previous tab, run code,&nbsp;etc. and be able to lock the screen from floating away when a user swipes if gestures are not implemented?? Trying to make an app that
 is fully functional on a tablet while obeying all tablet gestures and&nbsp;ideally when users are not using an attached keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I'm sure&nbsp;MS has noticed Win10 tablets (more than 2-in-1 laptops) have been flying off the shelves. It would be nice to be able to design full functioning business apps to run on all these Win10 tablets w/o having to code for iOS or Android. I think these
 Win10 tablets have hit a happy&nbsp;chord with consumers especially with the price point of some of these&nbsp;tablets that run Win10 and full versions of Office 2016??</p>

<p><span>Let us try to uninstall and reinstall the Touch pad drivers and if that does not resolve the issue then would like to know, which particular tablet you are using and which O.S is installed on it.
 Also if you can get the PSR of the issue that will add more clarity of the issue.</span></p>

            Do the touch pad drivers correlate to the screen gestures? In all of these issues
<em><strong>there is no KB attached</strong></em>. This happens on an ASUS T100TAF and MS Surface 3/3Pro with Windows 10 and latest updates to Win 10?? The only interface to the tablet is fingers and a stylus??

            Is anyone at MS actually going to address these issues with regard to touch gestures on touch screens? For the past 2-3 years there are many, many request to answer these simple questions about touch events on a touch screen not activating and, as you
 can read above there is no real response here either. Does MS actually have engineers trying to answer these questions only using touch (finger, stylus) without using a mouse or keyboard? Go search for similar questions on the web and there are so many un-answered
 questions addressing&nbsp;these same concerns.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of those formula are using User defined functions (UDF's) which is code written in VBA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(ColorIndex(G3:G34,FALSE)=3))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ColorIndex bit of the above formula isn't a native Excel function, nor is&nbsp;the SumByColor&nbsp;part of this formula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=(SumByColor(G3:G34,G3)+SumByColor(G34,G3))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You say they have stopped working but what error do you get?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this ALT+F11 to open VB editor, do you see any modules there underneath wher it say VBAProject(workbook name)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have a look in there and you should find code called ColorIndex and SumByColour. Post that code here so we can see what's gone wrong.</p>

Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum. I understand your worries about the security of your&nbsp;account&nbsp;when you found out&nbsp;an unauthorized photo shown on your sent emails. For investigation, please verify if the same photo is shown on your emails sent via computer.

https://profile.live.com</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes to both, then I request that you <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/messenger/change-password-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset your password</a> immediately. Once done, go back to <a href="https://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>https://profile.live.com</span></a><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;and then&nbsp;click
<strong><span>Change picture</span></strong>. Hit </font></span><span><font color="#000000"><strong><span>Browse...</span></strong> then choose the picture from your computer.
</font></span><span><font color="#000000">Click<strong><span> Save</span></strong>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">In case the problem only happens on your Galaxy S3, then proceed to reconfigure (remove then re-add) and see if it helps.<br />

Hope I was able to help you. Feel free in case the problem persists or if you have follow-up&nbsp;questions.<br />

Thank you!</font></span></p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Murray-Man,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're wondering if your contacts can assign a profile picture to your contact entry on their end. Some email providers allow the users to do this like Gmail. Have you checked your account's profile page to confirm if you have a different
 profile picture there? You can go there by <a href="http://profile.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also send yourself a test email then check if you'd also see a different profile picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what you'll find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rhyan</p>
<p>

Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
I do not have a photo applied to my Profile.<br />
<br />
I have already tested sending an email from one of my Live accounts, to another:&nbsp; no picture appears.<br />
<br />
The Recipient in question is receving my emails to her Microsoft&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(38, 114, 236, 1)">
<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong></span>&nbsp; email account ... so my question is, is it possible that she has assigned an image to my entry in her Contacts Book?<br />

Thanks

            <p>Hello Murray-Man,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting back. Since you've mentioned that the recipient of your email is also using a Microsoft account, the recipient of your email will not have an option to assign/change the&nbsp;picture to her contacts. With the current design of Outlook.com,
 it's by default that the sender's picture should appear on the receiving end and only the sender has the capability to change his/her profile picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to request for following information in the private message area so we could investigate deeper on your issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Account in question.</li><li>Does the issue happens to specific contact&nbsp;or to all the recipients of your email?</li><li>Have you tried to connect any 3rd party services (Facebook, LinkedIn and etc.) to your account?</li><li><span>Sample screen shot of the email with/without your picture.</span></li><li><span>Screen shot of your profile picture.</span></li><li><span>Screen shot of the unknown picture that is showing on the&nbsp;receiving end.</span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You need to click the notification that states <strong>
You have a private reply to this message. Click here to read it on our secure private message section</strong> or by clicking the
<strong>Private Messages</strong> tab. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

 Windows 7 for me and Mac for her.&nbsp; I have and Android phone as well.&nbsp; </p>

            This happened over a year ago and to be honest I cannot recall how it was resolved. I think it was only happening to one contact I was emailing to, so I assume the problem was 'at her end'.&nbsp; Anyway .. I think the problem no longer exists, but I shall email
 the person in question and double-check.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it IS still happening then I shall let you know.

            I followed these instructions but the picture keeps coming back. It is now in every email I have sent or saved as a draft. This is very serious, I have never attached an image to my Outlook emails profile.<br />

<h2>            Access To Generate a Word Document&#63;</h2>
                    Hi friends,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On a database of mine while the current form is reflecting some values I want a VBA code for a button so as to have the values being displayed exported to a Word document in some special tags?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suppose my form's <b>TextBox </b>named (<b>CustNm</b>) is reflecting a value
<b>M/s. XYZ Co. </b>while a word template has a special piece of string <b>&lt;&lt;CUSTNM&gt;&gt;</b>. Can a macro create a document from the word template with the text
<b>&lt;&lt;CUSTNM&gt;&gt; </b>being replaced with <b>M/s. XYZ Co.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

<strong>2) Contains all your personal data files, documents, pictures. Etc.from the previous version.</strong></p>
<p>If you do not need either of these two options the Windows.old folder can be deleted.</p>
<p>Note: Change Windows Explorer option to see the Windows.old folder: <br />

Click the "Show hidden files and folders" option at the top of the list.<br />
