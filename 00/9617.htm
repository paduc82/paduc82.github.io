    <title>Choosing a Skype Number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> --&#40;leo&#41;--  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choosing a Skype Number</h2>
                    When buying a new Skype number, you used to be able to input your favourite number combination and the website would suggest numbers that matched. Now I just see a grid of number suggestions with no way to do that search. Has this been functionality been
 removed? If so, is there another way to look for a Skype Number that matches a preferred combination?

<h2>            Design view help DateAdd Function&#63;</h2>
                    I have an Access table named LotThree with only two fields, a date field named ‚ÄúDTE‚Äù and number field named ‚ÄúCAS3‚Äù. The DTE field list each date of the year for several years in this format: 11-18-2017. The CAS3 field list each three digit lottery number
 in this format:152. I have created a parameter design query where I may enter [Enter 3#:], any three digit number and the query will return every date occurrence of when 152 occurred. What i would like to do using the design view query is have this criteria
 also generate what number occurred one day before and one day after the number that i entered in my parameter query for each and all occurrences of the entered number.

<p>I am a Accces newbie, I really have no experience with sql scripting.</p>
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>All you need to do is open the query designer, and then switch to SQL view from the ribbon.&nbsp; Then paste in the first SQL statement Duane gave you in place of what's there.&nbsp; Save the query under the name Duane gave you.&nbsp; Then repeat this for the second query.&nbsp;
 Open the second query to get the results you are looking for.<br />
<br />
The basis of the queries is quite simple:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The first query simply returns all rows where the CAS3 value is what you enter.&nbsp; One column is returned, the DTE column, and is given the alias TargetDates.&nbsp; This is to distinguish it from the DTE column from the table in the second query below.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The second query draws on the original table and the query which you created in 1 above.&nbsp; However, it does not specifically join them.&nbsp;&nbsp; The result of this is that it returns what is known as the Cartesian product of the table and the first query, which
 means that, in effect every row in the table is joined to every row returned by the first query.&nbsp; To restrict the rows from this set to those you want, the WHERE clause restricts them to those from the table where the date is one day before, the same as, or
 one day after each of the dates returned by the first query.<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to why you are doing this.&nbsp; If it is to help predict a specific number occurring, then I'm afraid that there is no mathematical basis for this whatsoever.&nbsp; Even if a number where to occur 99 days in succession, the mathematical probability of
 it occurring on day 100 is exactly the same as would be the case in any other situation.&nbsp; This can be seen by tossing a coin 100 times.&nbsp; As the number of tosses increases the number of heads and tails will progressively become closer to 50% heads, 50% tails.&nbsp;
 If you have the stamina to keep going until the coin has been tossed 1000 times it will get closer still, and so on, but the result of each toss is every time completely random.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
From my understanding, Yahoo! restricts their IMAP mail access to cell phones that are connecting through cellular data connections.&nbsp; That means you cannot access Yahoo! mail through Outlook using WiFi or by connecting to your desktop.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a cellular connection, you can still access your Yahoo mail via their mobile website (http://m.yahoo.com) or by downloading their free Yahoo! Go client<br />

<p>i suppose it is to be expected with a large organisation but trying to speak to a human to get an answer to an issue is impossible from microsoft, i really honestly don‚Äôt mean hard, i mean impossible, it cannot be done because i have tried for around 4 days
 now to solve an issue and all i have come across if people that pass me to other people and who don‚Äôt seem to understand me.</p>

<p>- i work for a company in the it department so we are a business user. sadly the option wasnt there for office 365 for business</p>

<p>- we use ipads for our users and we put word, excel and powerpoint on them by downloading them from the app store.</p>

<p>when setting up an ipad for a new user we have the create an account for them, so we tap the app on the ipad, scroll through a few screens where we are asked to sign in or create an account. obviously the first time we do this we click create account.</p>

<p><strong>my first question is this: how do i administrate that account that is created? we have a office 365 portal account [https://portal.office.com] but it is not created there.</strong></p>

<p>i have also gone to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;and i get a message saying your account has been temporarily suspended</p>

<p>what do you need to do?we'll send a verification code to your phone.&nbsp; after you enter the code, you can sign in.</p>

<p>i hit continue i get the option to enter in a telephone number, every number i choose i get an invalid message in red come up.</p>

<p>please can someone help, microsoft support has been abysmal in trying to help me solve this.</p>

<p>my workaround solution is to create an alias email for the person and create a new account but this is not a fix</p>

<p>frustrated regards</p>

<p>steve</p>

<p>Hi Rene</p>
<p>I guess we must have been creating these users incorrectly then, We have an Office 365 portal and we used to add users there and manage them there too, we were then told to change this is when setting up new users to go to the create account option on the
 ipad app itself.</p>
<p>I have just looked on that portal and my name is listed there, however nowhere under my name can I see anything about ipad or office applications, In fact if I go under licences all I see is Yammer Enterprise Standalone. I am unsure what plan we are on,
 If I PM you my company name are you able to tell me what we can and cannot do in terms of licences?</p>
<p>As for the Microsoft personal account, I have gone to the link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/account-temporarily-blocked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows.microsoft.com/.../account-temporarily-blocked</a> and entered a phone number, no matter which number I enter it comes up as invalid, ill try the customer support link now.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Yammer Enterprise would not be a qualifying Office 365 plan to do basic editing or use the extra features in Office apps for iOS.</p>
<p>The plans we currently subscribe to are all listed at Office 365 admin center &gt; BILLING &gt; Subscriptions.</p>
<p>Basically, we need to a plan with the license for the Office desktop apps to use the apps with full functionality.</p>

<h2>            Graphics not showing in Word and Visio on insider build</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to view graphics (Embedded pictures, visio diagrams) in word etc. Instead I just get screen artefacts. I've tried disabling hardware acceleration , repairing office etc. I'm on office build 1704 (8067.2018) and windows build 16179. Any ideas would
 be appreciated as this make the laptop pretty unusable</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>I am seeing the same - seems to be when hardware acceleration in Office is disabled - all I get is a blank window in all office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Office turns this on automatically for some old graphics cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with this option turned off which lets me use Office, when I paste images into Word or Outlook they don't appear - they do paste, but the image isn't displayed. However it is there as if I send an email to myself with one of these pasted images then
 the image appears when I get the email back.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the follow up, Sue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you be able to back-up all files on your device? We would like to suggest doing a factory reset on your device since some information on your tiles doesn't align to what you actually have, on top of those missing notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have backed up your phone's files, go to Settings&gt; About&gt; tap Reset my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This resets your phone automatically and hopefully addresses the issues on your mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted on what happens after doing the factory reset.</p>

<p>Hello Marco,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution.<br />
<br />
As Entegy already asked, could you give us more details where these contacts came from?</p>
<p>If these contacts were stored in your Microsoft account, have a look at contact.live.com<br />
if your missing contacts are still stored there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully these suggestions were helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Dimitar,</p>

    <title>Guide&#58; Pausing Music Player on unplugging headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chanchan05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guide&#58; Pausing Music Player on unplugging headset</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>I've heard a lot of complaints regarding this, and I accidentally stumbled upon this application on DailyMobile. This application when active, pauses the music player when you unplug the headset. It's called For Your Ears Only (and rightly so). However,
 compatibility is limited to s60v5 phones (5230, 5530, 5533, 5800, X6, N97 Mini, N97). This has been specifically tested on the 5800.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quote Nick502 (poster on DailyMobile):</p>
<p>For Your Ears Only is a Symbian app that automatically pauses the music player when the headset is disconnected.It is inspired by how Android works, and also headphone daemon for Maemo.<br />
<br />
At the moment, only Symbian (S60 5th edition) onwards is supported. Specifically, it has been tested on the Nokia 5800.For Your Ears Only is a rough prototype, and should be improved with a background running auto starting daemon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usage Steps:<br />
1. Install "For Your Ears Only". BUT DON'T START AS YET<br />
2. Start the music player (must be started before For Your Ears Only starts)<br />
3. Start For Your Ears Only<br />
4. Connect a headset<br />
5. Play music in the music player<br />
6. Pull out the headset cord - music stops!</p>

      If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />

<h2>            Your windows 10 program does NOT have a screen CONTRAST CONTROL&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I bought a Windows 10/Lenovo laptop last year and was happy with it until a few days ago, when Lenovo had a major and totally useless update that eliminated their contrast control. Lenovo has only a coloration control but now no contrast control. I can
 use the Windows 10 brightness control to lighten or darken the screen at will but you have NO contrast control which makes this computer much harder to use. YOU PEOPLE NEED TO ADD A CONTRAST CONTROL TO YOUR SETTINGS RIGHT WITH THE BRIGHTNESS CONTROL.

<p>Ok this screen looks good. And my Lenovo ideapad 110 DOES have an Intel PENTIUM but whether it is build 17686 I don't know and if it is I'm not sure how to bring up an Intel display - never done it before ( never had to) If can bring this up on screen and
 it works I thank you in advance...BTW I'm just a simple computer operator and I'll admit I'm NOT a programmer...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bob, I am using an older Lenovo ThinkPad with a core I5 processor but it does use the intel HD Graphics that you see above. To get to it look in the notification area at the bottom right of the screen and click on the arrow head icon.&nbsp; Next click on the
 intel HD graphics icon and then click on Graphics properties. Next click on the square box that says Display. Then click on the item near the top that says Color. You should then see the controls you are looking for, including Contrast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>
</p><p>Further investigation:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the same update on another PC that was on the same build yet this upgrade was successful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Update PC: Dell XT3 i7 </p>
<p>Un-Installed Update PC: Microsoft Surface Book i7</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm not sure why the two different PC's handled the update differently. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep up the good work Microsoft. I appreciate the fixes that have been included in this new build. Love having the Connect Button back in the notification bar. :)&nbsp;I'll keep trying to resolve my issue not updating the Surface Book.

14261.rs1.release.<br />
14271.rs1.release.160218-2310</p>
<p>Finally performed a PC Rest and installed software packages one at a time and found the suspect software being ZoneAlarm Extreme Security ( Firewall and Anti-Virus ) as the cuplrit causing this issue for myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed all software as per previous installs and PC is working fine, install ZA and bam... BSOD above pops up, reset PC no ZA and all is well.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I also have had&nbsp;Build 14251.rs1_release.160124-1059 fail on my laptop and Surface Pro 3. The installation of the fast ring upgrade went ok, when time came for the reboot both devices booted, presented an error then rebooted, after 5 times of this loop I
 performed a roll-back to previous fast ring build and both devices are back operational on the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error presented on both devices is this ( as below image ):</p>
<p>sad face ( emoti icon ) Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you. (% complete )</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (win32kfull.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** edited 23 Feb 2016 ***</p>
<p>to provide screen capture of the error, as you&nbsp;can see this is different to what others are getting. The latest 14267 also fails with the same error on both laptop and Surface Pro 3 i7, got one other thing to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish MS would release the ISO file immediately for download so we can do a clean install as this is what I had to do to fix the upgrade download failure to go from 10240 to 10525</p>

    <title>Pivot Table - Add Manual Row Label&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pivot Table - Add Manual Row Label&#63;</h2>
                    I am working on a pivot table from a client survey where respondents rate certain areas 1-10. In one of the questions, noone has answered with a value of 8; however, i am certain in the future, someone will. I cannot add a row of survey data as it would
 inaccurately skew the results. Is there a way for me to add a manual value to the existing row labels so that I can prepare for future versions of the survey?

            <p>Hello AhmedAbdel! Thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately this is not exactly what I am trying to accomplish. The table below is a sample of one of my Pivot Tables. I would like to insert a row between Values 6 and 8 in the first column to show 7 but
 there would be no values for any month since it does not yet exist. Below the pivot table we do a chart and we group by 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10 so if in a future month someone chooses 7 I will have to re-do that entire section of the report.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 IMAP account - Calendar and Contacts in Trash, now gone</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Outlook 2016 in Win 10 and my email host requires the use of IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed instructions at this post as I was having the same issue.</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_winother/my-default-calendar-is-in-the-trash-folder-how-can/55ce9c92-bfb0-4fff-b858-5773f7a6e40b

<p>
</p><p>I made an entry for "Root Folder Path" per the post above and now Outlook folder look like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>But now the Calendar is completely BLANK and no Contacts to be seen.&nbsp; I had 100's of entries in both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About to lose my mind over this, not sure where to turn.&nbsp; Can you advise any solution or point me towards an IT person that could help?</p>

            <p>Thank you but that is not really the issue.&nbsp; It is not an ITEM missing but rather the ENTIRE Calendar and Contact folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see either in the Trash folder (IMAP) - there is no Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; When I go to the folder menu (Outlook 2016), there is no "Recoverable Items Folder" either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is first time using IMAP after migrating a calendar and contacts from an older POP3 account.&nbsp; I've come to the conclusion that IMAP email really sucks - not happy how it works at all so far.</p>

            <p>It was about 6 months ago so I don't remember now but I think it just pulled it in from iCloud possibly or I might have copied the PST file over.&nbsp; Regardless, I've made many many entries since then and I use the calendar for some travel expense records which
 would be difficult to recreate if I went back to the calendar of 6 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some items are on my iCloud calendar but not all details.&nbsp; Contacts are also on my phone - at least most of them I think.&nbsp; Frankly, the whole Outlook to iCloud sync is a complete disaster in my opinion.&nbsp; Very confusing.</p>

<h2>            highlight multiple cells&#47;rows with matching values</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a spreadsheet (Excel 2007) that contains several columns and rows of data. I want to identify (highlight) rows where the values in cells are duplicated over 3 columns. e.g.
<br />
<br />
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10</td>

<td>99</td>

<td>97</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>99</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
rows 1, 4 and 7 have the same 3 values and I need to highlight those<br />
<br />
I have attempted to use match and conditional formatting but cannot work out how to highlight over more than 2 columns<br />
<br />
Any help appreciated, cheers<br />

    <title>cant save .DCOM files in word 2010. Save as box keeps re-appearing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            cant save .DCOM files in word 2010. Save as box keeps re-appearing. Original .DCOM file was created in word 2007.</h2>
                    Original file works OK and saves OK in word 2007. But when opening in word 2010 I click on protected mode or order to use the macros and it says compatability mode in the top line. I then try to make changes in the document&nbsp;by typing something, and try
 to save it but&nbsp;comes up with the save as dialog box. And when I try to save the save as dialog box re-appears and this keeps happening even if I chnage the file name and location. This issue happens on any machine with word 2010.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to the issue?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong> :
</p>
<p>Run Internet Explorer in No-addons mode and check whether the issue persists or not. Perform Step 4 from the article and if still the issue persist then perform all the steps from
 the article and check whether the issue is resolved or not.</p>

</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using

<h2>            How can I go about getting a phone offered on Microsoft unlocked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In a previous question I had asked what the "No Contract" means when wanting to purchase the Lumia 520 and I am truly grateful for the answer provided by fredgiblet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: </p>
<p>Here is the question: </p>

<p>
</p><p>Now my new question is (as the title suggests), how can I get this phone unlocked, or atleast a legit service where I can get it unlocked. Here is the phone I am interested in purchasing:

</p><p>I live in the Caribbean and need the phone to be unlocked so I can use it with any carrier.</p>

            <p>Microsoft itself does not sell unlocked phones. They unfortunately subscribe to the locked American model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are stores on eBay that sell unlocked 520s. I've bought a 520 from such places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're looking at the 520 specifically, please be aware that there are also slight variations with different bands for network support. Make sure you get an edition of the 520 that has support for your network!</p>

            <p>Hi Lei,</p>
<p>
</p><p>AT&amp;T typically will not unlock a phone unless you have had 6 months of service with them. &nbsp;Since you are not planning on using the phone on AT&amp;T, you'll want to avoid buying one from the Microsoft Store. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information from AT&amp;T about eligibility for unlocking a phone:<br />
<a href="http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532&amp;cv=820#fbid=u7ivmWHAeN8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414532&amp;cv=820#fbid=u7ivmWHAeN8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>US phones are carrier locked, you'll probably want one from Europe/Asia/Africa. &nbsp;I'm not sure how to buy one that way, but I've seen unlocked 520's on Amazon. &nbsp;Like this one:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Unlocked-Windows-Phone/dp/B00CKUBLFQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Lumia-Unlocked-Windows-Phone/dp/B00CKUBLFQ</a>.
 &nbsp;Or look for one <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_nkw=lumia+520+gsm+unlocked&amp;=&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_ItemCondition=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            When you use the PUK code, you're asked to enter a new PIN code (twice).<br />
<br />
If your PUK code doesn't work any longer, and the SIM is permanently locked, go to your network operator and request them to give you a new SIM card (they'll probably charge for it).

<h2>            Syntax error &#40;missing operator&#41; in Access 2007</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to microsoft access and I'm trying to create age groups in a database containing patient data. The data table is called 'Sheet1'. Each patient is identified by a Patient-ID, which can show up several times in the database, depending on the amount
 of visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I've done a query (Sheet1 Query) extracting each unique patient, with corresponding age (Leeftijd) and gender (Geslacht). I'm trying to create the different age groups from this query, using this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT SUM (CASE WHEN [Leeftijd] &lt; 18 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS [Under 18]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SUM (CASE WHEN [Leeftijd] BETWEEN 18 AND 35 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS [18-35]</p>
<p>FROM [Sheet1 Query]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I keep running into "Syntax error (missing operator) in query expression 'SUM (CASE WHEN [Leeftijd]&lt; 18 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated,</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Instead of the standard SQL CASE expression call the VBA IIF function:<br />
<br />
SELECT SUM(IIF([Leeftijd] &lt; 18,1,0)) AS [Under 18],<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUM(IIF([Leeftijd] BETWEEN 18 AND 35,1,0)) AS [18-35]<br />
FROM [Sheet1 Query];<br />
<br />
Is the Leeftijd colum a computed column retuned by the Sheet1 Query query, or is it a column in a base table?&nbsp; If the latter the values will of course become incorrect over time unless the age is intended to be that at a specific point in time rather than the
 current age.&nbsp; The latter is best returned by computing the age on the basis of the person's date of birth, using a function such as that below:<br />
<br />
Public Function GetAge(varDoB As Variant, Optional varAgeAt As Variant) As Variant<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsMissing(varAgeAt) Then varAgeAt = VBA.Date<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAge = DateDiff("yyyy", varDoB, varAgeAt) - _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIf(Format(varAgeAt, "mmdd") &lt; Format(varDoB, "mmdd"), 1, 0)<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
By default this returns the age in years at the current date, but can return the age at a specific date by passing the latter into the function as the optional varAgeAt argument.<br />
