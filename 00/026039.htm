<h2>            Organisation Chart in Visio 2013 - changing default color on levels &#38; automatically update shape information</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am making an organisation &nbsp;chart, and using the default shapes in Visio 2013&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Excecutive</li><li>Manager</li><li>Position</li><li>Assistant</li><li>Consultant</li><li>Vacancy</li></ul>
<p>When applying a theme, it is possible to make Visio color the different levels in different colors, however - the last three levels (assistant, consultant and vacancy) all end up in the same color (theme color accent 4). This does not look nice; since it
 is difficult to see the differences between these levels - I want ALL levels to have different colors. Also, it would be great if I can set f.ex. all shapes on consultant level to also have a dotted line around the shape (as as standard). And so on - it must
 be made a standard for each and every shape to be used again and again for all shapes on that specific level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to assign a manual color on each of these levels, and save this as a template for future organisation charts we are making?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally make my list in Excel and use the import organisation wizard to make the organisation &nbsp;chart automatically. In Excel we state which person uses what type of shape (Shape 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). So basically - I would like to make a template that automatically
 on shape 0 insert ex a red shape, shape 1 inserts a blue shape, shape 2 inserts a green shape, shape 3 inserts a pink shape, shape 4 inserts a yellow shape , shape 5 inserts a purple shape (just an example with these colors). In addition I would f.ex. also
 like shape 5 to have a dotted outline, or some other specific design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please - anyone know if this is possible?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AUTOMATICAL UPDATING SHAPES IN ORGANISATION CHART</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the import wizard - the organisation chart is made automatically based on the information in our Excel file. However, if we do update the information in the Excel file - how can we easily just update the information in the Visio chart. Is there
 somehow an easy UPDATE data button or similar tool to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using DATA and connecting the information to the shapes in the organisastion chart, however, the shapes look strange - and the information comes out on the right hand side of the shapes in the organisation chart - not inside in the block 1 and
 block 2 area. In addition - once the layout is final in our organisation chart, we want to use this layout and just update the information inside the shapes. A solution is to import the organisation chart again, however - all manuel settings we have done to
 the layout will not be added to the new imported organisation chart. Also when using DATA I have to manually pull each and every person into the organisation chart manually, I can not use the wizard. Or is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope someone has some solutions to these problems :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>Kathrine Jolle Wathne</p>

            <p>Hi Kathrine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great to see that you are using the Org Chart template extensively. Following are some tips to help you achieve your requirements:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To apply color to shapes based on certain parameter:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Data Graphics in Visio to achieve this</li><li>Add another column to your Excel file based on which you would like to determine color, for keeping things simple say the column values are 1, 2, 3...</li><li>After you have created the OrgChart by importing this file, link the file to your OrgChart by using the data linking feature:
<ul>
<li>For Visio 2013 and prior: https://blogs.office.com/2013/04/25/data-linked-diagrams-linking-data-from-an-external-data-source/#k1VZXVHeALMryG3S.97</li><li>For Visio 2016: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-data-to-shapes-in-your-drawing-d174b3fd-3079-42fd-81e8-2dbf8d38bb03?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</li></ul>
</li><li>Now apply Data Graphics - Color By Value - This will allow you to fill the shape with a specific color based on the value in the excel column
<ul>
<li>Refer: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-use-color-by-value-fa42a92f-019d-4baa-940e-e477b9b9dfeb</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>2. You can make configure shapes as per your requirements, say add a dotted line to existing shape and save this as a Visio template for future use, however you cannot enforce the Wizard to use this template directly. I will get back too you on this if there
 is a workaround you can apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. AUTOMATICAL UPDATING SHAPES IN ORGANISATION CHART- </p>
<p>Currently this is not possible out of box in Visio, if your data gets updated (and if you have linked it to your Org Chart) you can Referesh your linked data from Data tab in Visio. Once you have the new rows in Visio you can drag them from the External
 Data Window and add them to your Org Chart to update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need additional help. Also, please help us understand your scenario better by sharing the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If possible your excel data file, we are just interested in the column headers and some sample data, you can delete private info</li><li>How often does your data get updated?</li><li>Do you use any other diagram type in Visio that you wish to create automatically from data? Again, if possible please share a sample data file</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>

    <title>Outlook calendar accessing wrong email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shimmiegk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook calendar accessing wrong email address</h2>
                    <p>I have moved to Office 365 on Mac (which has bee quite disappointing compared to Windows version).</p>
<p>I installed all my emails onto Outlook successfully, and I also monitor some of my client's catchall email addresses too.</p>
<p>Prior to moving to Office 365 Mac, I had all calendar items associated with "On This Computer (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)" it was an IMAP-configured account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However now all Calendar items are linked to a client's catchall email address (Exchange - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***), and I can't find my email address in the calendar list at all. Which means that one of my clients can log into this email address and see
 my own business' calendar appointments.</p>
<p>How can I get my calendar to be associated with my email address without losing any data?</p>
<p>I still have my old computer running, and it actually has "On This Computer (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)"</p>

<p>Hello ShimmieGK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, calendars in the Outlook for Mac client are related to the email accounts. We recommend that you check the web application of your myemail@mybusinessmail.com account. See if the calendar events are still stored in this account’s calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my understanding, your situation is that your own calendar is not synced to the Outlook for Mac client. But your clients may have shared their calendars to you and then you will be able to see their calendars in your email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the problem may be related to the Outlook client, it is recommended that you contact Outlook for Mac experts by clicking on<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_mac/new-contact-support-feature-in-outlook-2016-for/d4fc21c4-25e2-4e10-b943-1fba6542b517"><span>Contact

<p>Hi Barry, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already contacted the Office support team who couldn't solve the problem. They suggested that I change my business' email to an Exchange server which is a) not possible and b) not necessary. I still have my old&nbsp;Windows computer running and that Outlook
 calendar is linked to my business' IMAP email, which means it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now fear that if I delete my client's email from my Outlook, it will take my calendar too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me further please? How do I sync my email with my calendar?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please firstly sign in the web application of your email account and check if all calendars are there. We need to know if the problem is related to the account or the Outlook for Mac client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can see the calendars in the web application, please refer to this article to create a new profile and check this problem. Note: Do not delete the original profile in case it doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Hello Gloria,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, when you add an account as IMAP in the Outlook client, the calendars and the contacts will only save in this device, which means that they won’t sync to the cloud(the web version of your email account). So when you moved to Outlook for Mac,
 only the emails will sync from the cloud. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under this circumstance, it is suggested to export the calendars form the Outlook for Windows client and import it to the Outlook for Mac. You can see the instructions below:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Export the calendars to PST file</a> on the Outlook for Windows client.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/import-a-pst-file-into-outlook-for-mac-from-outlook-for-windows-b4a6a1d6-94bb-4c85-a4fc-a83dc690e18c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Import the PST file to Outlook for Mac client</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I add a symbol to a cell in Excel &#40;Office 365&#41;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to put a checkmark into a cell in Excel. &nbsp;I tried following the instructions in this post: &nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_mac-mso_365hp/inserting-symbols-in-excel/5deb6e74-aedc-4b44-a3c6-5639ab706567<br />
</p>
<p>That didn't work. &nbsp;I got as far as double clicking on the "Show Emoji &amp; Symbols" window but then I couldn't figure out how to get the checkmark into the cell. &nbsp;I finally tried dragging and dropping but I'm left with a little tiny rectangle that sometimes
 looks like a checkmark when I click on the cell and then click into the formula bar but as soon as I click another cell I'm left with the little rectangle again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating that something that used to be so simple is now an hours long research project with (yet again) no resolution!!! &nbsp;I pay every damn month for this software you'd think I could get actual help when I need it rather than wait for, out
 of the whole world, someone to land on my question and provide a usable answer.</p>

            I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet Mac Office forum also as this will increase chances of getting the fast answer to this query. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

<h2>            Adding neighbors in Sims Freeplay&#63;</h2>
                    I have been playing The Sims Freeplay for a long time but have never figured out how to add friends on my game? I know it does not connect to facebook but was wondering if there is another way to add neighbors, can anyone answer this question for me?

            <p>Hello Marob I've searched &amp; messaged EA and tried to contact EA Support chat, phone etc...forget that! Save yourself the the time. They'll send you over to Firemonkeys.com.au and if you roll the dice they might reply with a computer generated reply. It is
 frustrating I know so finally I found this Sims Freeplay community today called:</p>
<p>simsfp.perturbeedotnet</p>
<p>An unofficial forum I asked how to find &amp; add neighbors, I came back hours later and found they merged my posted question to some add a neighbor list where you put your gamertag request in called "(Windows Phone) Neighbours needed!"</p>
<p>Oh well, I didn't get an explanation how to do it but maybe at least you &amp; I will get neighbors</p>
<p>added. My gamertag is Bettab1st.</p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

            Remove the SD card if your system has one installed, also remove anything plugged into USB's ports excepted wired KB/Mouse Also when posting it would help if you posted info about your system.

            What version of Windows are you starting with before the upgrade? You might have to install an earlier build&nbsp;and start from there as something might be corrupted on your pc.

            17 GB is near the low side as MS now advises if Pro 64 to have at least 20 -25 free and home 16 - 10, see if you can free up a little more, the 532 Mhz seems low for DDR 3. This is a issues I had on early builds with too much memory was running 8Gb and
 had issues dropped it down to 4 and it installed but haven't had that issue since.

            <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using build 1607 15007.&nbsp; I have been using the fast ring service for 6 months or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also had trouble with build 1607 and was able to install it from an ISO file I burned on a bluray disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft tech help&nbsp;2 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time the registry was found to be corrupted.&nbsp; Microsoft told me that build 15014 would now install, wrong.&nbsp; Got the same blue screen of death saying "thread stuck in device driver".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second time&nbsp;I contacted Microsoft&nbsp;scannow sfc&nbsp;was run on my pc and nothing wrong was found.&nbsp; Then this tekkie told me that my pc&nbsp;was not compatible with build 15014 because of some message that was posted on my update window in the settings.&nbsp; It said
 "some settings are managed by your organization".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He went to say that he could force install build 15014 and started to but he noticed this message and immediately stopped the installation.&nbsp; I tried the fix for this message but the fix wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan on contacting tech help again today as I wasn't too confident with the fellows command of the English language, no offence intended.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To anyone interested in my issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got build 15014 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had 3 different Microsoft tekkies review the usual stuff on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So between that and a lot of luck I finally had a successful installation of the build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was shut my pc completely down when the pc was re-starting during the upgrade stage of the installation. &nbsp;It re-starts 2 or 3 times if my memory serves me correctly. &nbsp;I did this each time the system re-started. &nbsp;I waited until I saw the bios information
 start to display on my monitor. &nbsp;Then I hit the off switch on the back of my pc. Then I powered it up and the installation continued. &nbsp;And I didn't wait long to restart the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was during these steps that the BSOD paid me a visit before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to try a system shutdown for the heck of it. &nbsp;I honestly doubted that this would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the Microsoft tekkies said my system was incompatible with Build 15014; glad I persisted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear you got 15014 installed... I too have had to resort to drastic measure like you mention on older builds, but not lately...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are talking about the Updating 32% after I think the 2nd restart, that is the point at which graphics drivers are installed... My machines always blink the screen at least once, and usually twice, while holding at&nbsp;32%... then jump to 35%...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that has also worked for me in the past, is to pull the plug on the internet connection during the 1st restart..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>this has happend to me before,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>17gb is about the limit where it usualy let me install a build, anything under and i had the same issue as you</p>
<p>
</p><p>disable your hibernation</p>
<p>
</p><p>right click on start and go to powershell admin</p>
<p>
</p><p>then type this</p>
<p>
</p><p>POWERCFG HIBERNATE OFF</p>
<p>
</p><p>and that should save about 3-6gb more space</p>
<p>
</p><p>then try the install again &nbsp;and when its installed redo the comand i typed but put ON instead of OFF</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the same problem. I have logged in to the ovi store online after creating account with Nokia site. Then I have clicked the verify Mobile and email links in my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I have clicked both the links to verified from mobile and email. Than I have&nbsp;downloaded Ebuddy from Nokia website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I selected the Chat in the messaging, then it gave me the options to setup ie, yahoo,ovi,gtalk,windows live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I was not able to login to OVI store from mobile earlier and now it lets me login.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently I have the 4.65 version on my mobile, I don't remember my earlier version which I upgraded to current version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Airtel India Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this will help you.... I was trying to set this chat since last Friday after I bought this, and it is all set. Let me see how long does this work for me.....</p>

<p>IT WORKED ! Please read to find the steps.</p>
<p>I was facing the problem and struggling to find a solution! I followed the steps given below.</p>
<p>1) Create an account in OVI (Nokia).</p>
<p>2) Download eBuddy from OVI store. Install it.</p>
<p>3) Verify for Email and Mobile from your C3 phone. You can find OVI in Settings.</p>
<p>4) Restart your phone.</p>
<p>5) It should work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>my msn on my chat wasnt working. so i deleted my account from that chat on my nokia c3 and i pressed update service. then i put my account in again and pressed sign in. the first few times it didnt work but afterwards it did. i did have to do this 3 times
 untill its signed me in successfully but now everytime i dign in it does it first time. When i tried to sign in whilst the problem was occuring my screen went blank. but then it said error 504. for some of you it maybe that you have changed your password (which
 was probably my reason) or because you updated your system. Try this and see if it works.</p>
<p>Love to help you all</p>

            I am just wondering that why then Microsoft doesn't fix the issue i.e. either do not allow to attach multiple attachments at first place or if allowed then fix the bug to enable sending multiple attachments?

            Hi Jill,
<br />
<br />You won't need a product key, you need to deactivate your previous Installation and then re-install Office 365
<br />
<br />On the new computer, go to <a href="https://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office.com/myaccount</a> and sign in using your Microsoft account, if prompted
<br />
<br />Select Install
<br />
<br />Under Install information, locate the old laptop which Office was installed on
<br />
<br />Select Deactivate Install to deactivate the Office installation
<br />
<br />Then, click Install to install Office 
<br />
<br />Transfer / Stuff you can Do in MyAccount: Install / Deactivate / Offline Installer / Downgrade
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/wiki/msoffice_install-mso_win10/stuff-you-can-do-in-myaccount-install-deactivate/3018f88b-d838-4cbf-afa4-e40e5a4f21cc?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/wi...</a>
<br />
<br />log in to the MyAccount site <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />This page shows how to install Office AFTER the license has been activated. It also shows a few other things you can do in the MyAccount site.
<br />
<br />Some of the answers can also be found in this FAQ, including how to “Share” your 365 Home subscription:

            That is a business account. Do you get any error messages when you try to set up the account? 
<br />
<br />Do you have it set up in outlook desktop? if so, it means autodiscover is correct, so we can rule that outlook.

            The admin can block access from other products - many admins did because the outlook app used to store data on amazon servers (before Microsoft bought the developer out) - they have since moved everything to azure or within the exchange server. You'll need to speak with the admin and have them open it on the server side.
<br />
<br />more information for the administrator:

            If you aren't familiar with powershell or don't have powershell access, go to the company support - they can fix it for you. 
<br />This is the powershell that you need: 
<br />New-ActiveSyncDeviceAccessRule -Characteristic DeviceModel -QueryString "Outlook for iOS and Android" -AccessLevel Allow
<br />
<br />i don't recall if this is accessible from the admin portal and mine's not loading right now, so i cant check. :(

<h2>            Need to Create a Default Mode for OneNote Web App that Opens Notebooks in Reading View</h2>
                    I have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to change the default mode of open notebooks on OneNote Web App to the Reading View; and, I think that this configuration is not necessary or helpful in all applications. So, I am curious as to whether anyone
 else has figured out how to change this process and force the notebooks to open in the Reading View. I want the people opening the OneNote Web App to have the automatic ability to click on the hyperlinks that I create without first having to change from the
 Edit View to the Reading View.&nbsp;

</p><p>I have problem with related tables when importing to SharePoint.</p>
<p>I have Access database with five tables, where four tables are related to one, parent table (all to one AutoNumber ID field). When I use Access function to export all tables to SharePoint, then SharePoint reindex parent table autonumber field, but replace

<p>I try to reasign relation in Access with lookup wizard, but no result.</p>
<p>When I try to import only one related table, then everything is ok.</p>

            Hi Ingus,<br />
<br />
I'm not able to reproduce this issue, please provide the detailed reproduce steps, for example:<br />
<br />
1. How did you create relationship between these tables? <br />
2. How did you reindex the parent table in SharePoint?<br />
3. How did you reassign relation in Access with lookup wizard?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>Hi, Kim_Vogels!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend you to re-install Nokia store client using this link. You have to type it in phone's browser or download file to your PC, transfer file to your phone and install the app (tapping on the file):<font><br />

<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>If the issue is not solved try to reset your APN or to use other type of connection (Wi-Fi/mobile operator APN).</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Hope this&nbsp;works. If not attach a picture of the error, please.</font></p>

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Word 2013 &#91;Bing&#93; Dictionary Issue - Wrong Language &#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremy the jedi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 &#91;Bing&#93; Dictionary Issue - Wrong Language &#47; Unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting on 8/15, after upgrading to Windows 10, use of the the built in dictionary in Word is not functioning as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you highlight a word &gt; right click &gt; select define, it pulls up a bing window, and nothing more. The Bing window features "Daily Word" and "Recommendations"&nbsp; the words provided by each are paired up with a symbols that appears to come from a Japanese
 or Chinese alphabet. A screenshot has been included.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Following instructions to download a dictionary are unfruitful. If i scroll right, in the Bing Dictionary window and click the links for,, Windows ###, Windows 8 Apps###, where the # is are oriental symbols, the page the screen looks like it tries to load,
 but freezes. This only resolvable by closing Word or by closing the Bing window.&nbsp;
<strong>Update </strong>- Clicking on the Windows ### Link eventually brought me to http://bing.msn.cn/dict/desktop/?FORM=BDVSP6,&nbsp;&nbsp; Could this be caused by large Asian population in the Greater Seattle Area?<br />
<strong>Update </strong>- Now when using the dictionary, and error is displayed. "APP ERROR Sorry, we can't load the app. Please make sure you have network and/or Internet connectivity. Click "Retry" ... "&nbsp;&nbsp; Note, retry results in the same error and internet
 connectivity works fine. See above update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to this, post the upgrade to Windows 10, the dictionary worked as expected when selecting Define</li><li>The same behavior occurs when selecting define via the Menu options. </li><li>The "Display Language" is set to English US</li><li>Changing the Language Settings from Display Language to English does not result in a different experience.</li><li>The Thesaurus works correctly <br />
</li><li>Other Applications such as PowerPoint (Research &gt;) show up in English</li><li>Office 2013 is running on the latest version</li><li>Updating ffice 2013 does not resolve the issue</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>A solution is requested. Also, please update the instructions for downloading additional dictionaries to align with Windows 10 and Office 2013.
</p>

            <p>Same here.<br />
<br />
I changed my dictionary to Merriam Webster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, click on the Insert Tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>then on My Apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>right click on Bing --&gt; remove</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now right click any word in your Word document and click define</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can choose between Webster, Bing and a general English one. Don't choose Bing -- reinstalling did not solve the problem, at least not for me. I went for Webster at least until bing is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, you may change the default printer to XPS Document Writer or OneNote, and then check if Excel works fine when you change the Page Layout
 options. Refer the link given below:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that helps, then this may be an issue with the printer drivers. You may have to repair or update the printer drivers and see if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t help, you may post us the event logs during the Excel crash using Event Viewer, so as to help you better. Refer the link given

                    I have seen video reviews of both Lumia 930 and 1520 and noticed a considerable difference, Lumia 1520 can support 4 windows in the multitask screen while 930 is held back with just one. It does have enough screen estate, processor capacity and&nbsp;resolution
 to support 4 windows, which will make multitasking much more breeze. Can we have this feature??

<h2>            Can I add Sensitivity as a button for Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to make the Sensitivity field a button on either the ribbon or the quick access toolbar, in order to change the setting?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

<div>Hi Jeffrey, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it is not possible to add <b>Sensitivity</b> in <b>Outlook’s ribbon</b> or
<b>Quick Access Toolbar</b>.</div>
<div>If you think this feature is important and want Microsoft to include this in the future versions of the software, provide your feedback in the link below:</div>

    <title>How do you change swipe options for email on the outlook Iphone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you change swipe options for email on the outlook Iphone app&#63;</h2>
                    The swipe options are schedule and archive, neither of which&nbsp;I want. I want unread for right and delete for left.

            You should have colored swatches on the left and right containing the swipe type. Click on the white area on the other side to see the swipe options that are available.
