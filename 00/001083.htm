                    I have uninstalled and reinstalled OneDrive for Business but it will not start automatically. I have to find the program and start it manually every time i start my computer. I use Windows 10 Pro.

<h2>            Build 100041 on Surface Pro 2 can&#39;t connect to Wirless Display Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I recently got the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the adapter connected to a Samsung 5 series LCD TV. It shows up on HDMI 3 as ready to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 TP build 100041 on a 128GB i5 Surface Pro 2, with all updates installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SPro2 detects the adapter but can't seem to connect. On the TV I can see the attempt at connection and the adapter correctly identifies the SPro2 device trying to connect but it is not successful. After two or three attempts, the SPro2 does not seem
 to be able to detect the adapter any more and will not do so again without a reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any experience of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The adapter works fine with a Nexus 5 phone and a Nexus 7 tablet. </p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Solved this.</p>
<p>I installed the latest Intel drivers for the HD 4400, though I had to do so by turning off the digitally signed driver warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I got the newer driver installed, it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems Ms borked the latest round of drivers as this was the case with my Surface Pro 3 too. I had to move up to driver version 10.18.14.4029 to get it to work with eh adapter.

    <title>major problem 16226 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julsie  say:</h3>
<h2>            major problem 16226</h2>
                    61215 would not install on my desktop, but installed on my laptop without any problem .<br />
I waited for new build and a few hours ago 16226 installed on both my machines with :apparent: ease.<br />
However, my Desktop lost most of my program &nbsp;licences and codes.<br />
My Keyboard would not work at all and Windows kept running 'We have run into a problem' etc.<br />
I was NOT able to use my keyboard &nbsp;or type anywhere!<br />
After a while it was clear to me that &nbsp;windows on my Desktop was a mess.<br />
So, I installed 1619 from a backup, and have now signed up for the slow ring.<br />
<br />
My laptop was also unusable because I could not get the keyboard to work at all.<br />
After a great deal of trouble , I was able to restore to 16125, and have changed to slow ring here as well.<br />
<br />
This has been a frustrating journey.<br />
Have any others experienced the same or similar problems<br />
I am looking forward to some responses.<br />
Is it at all possible to install the last update prior to insider builds, or to re install a fresh copy of windows 10.<br />
I am beginning to feel that at 86, this is a little harrowing for me<br />
Thanks for all help received from the community during the past few years.<br />
I apologize for being so long winded, but I needed to explain it all.

<p>You can always go back to the public build of Windows 10, but because it is a prior build, you have to do a clean install. Boot from build 15063 install media. Wipe the hard disk by deleting all partitions and install to the unpartitioned space. Of course
 this means a full backup and restore of your data and a reinstall of any software that you use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other way is to endure Insider builds until around September, when one of them will become the next public build and exit at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slow Ring builds are currently still at build 15063. From that you can tell that no build since the last public build has been considered stable enough for even Slow Ring testing. Fast Ring builds are expected to have issues and many issues are only discovered
 after Fast Ring testers try them. Even Slow Ring builds are not recommended for daily use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like to test Windows Insider Builds, why not install them to a small partition separate from your daily use public install? That is what I have done since the first public release of Windows 10 came out in July, 2015. Prior to that I ran all of the
 Insider builds as my only OS. But I got tired of not having a stable install to actually make use of, so now I run Insider on a separate partition as well as in Hyper-V Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>Hi Julsie</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I haven't had any particular issues of note with build 16226, I couldn't help but wonder if you might have had a 3rd party security program installed when upgrading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some have said that they did, but had disabled it for the install; but what they didn't realize is that many/most security programs are designed to automatically re-enable during a reboot, so that there is a definite possibility for damage to the files and
 processes in the latter part of the install. In such situations, the install may not fail completely, but later exhibit issues, either minor or major, that are incorrectly attributed to the build quality/reliability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that build 16226 runs snappier than either 16199 or 16215 did, so consider it to be a nice improvement. (I continue to grouse about the delivery system, UUP, though, because it gets all tangled up with updates for Defender, wasting time in installing
 the build.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides the other machines in my office, I keep 3 on my desk, and use them for all of my work, both financial and communication. On each machine, I keep all data in separate partitions from the OS, and redundantly backed up. That allows me to use the disk
 image backups of the OS partitions to go back to either the last public release or the previous build without losing the timeliness of my data (such as accounting files), so I can keep working from any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each new build, I make an ISO of it while it's installing on the first machine, so that I can re-install it as/if desired. As soon as the build is set to operate the way I prefer (and debloated), I make the disk image of it, and move on to the second
 machine to install the build, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only 80, but have a lot of miles on me, so feel the need to have everything organized to run smoothly, and to easily recover from any sort of failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can o back to the last public release, but it will require reinstalling all of your programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always recommend making, and saving on a different hard drive, a disk image of one's OS partition running the last public release with one's installed programs.<br />

<p>Does anyone know if there are any issues regarding the compatibility between these two please?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also looking in to this, although it's for Toyota Verso and standard stereo. I see that the Lumia 820 is listed as suported (except for addresssbook), the 920 and 820 are identical when it comes to Bluetooth as far as i can tell. It should be compatible
 but since it's not listed on Toyota's site how knows, i'v emailed my dealer to see if they have some insight .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you can compare specs from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/Lumia_820/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/Lumia_820/</a></p>

<p>This is wat both of us has done, the confusing thing is that 820 is listed as compatible and 920 isn't listed at all.</p>
<p>But as you mentioned 920 "should" be compatible since the they are identical in their inner workings. but given the number of topics regarding 920 and bluetooth pairing with car's you get some what unsure...</p>

                    I keep getting a 404 error once i copy and paste a Sharepoint link within a task in Planner. It will work for the first day, but when i try to click on it again it will send me to the error page. I copy and paste the link again and it will begin the work.
 How can i permanently attach a folder link to a task within Planner?

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re sorry for the inconvenience caused by the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, when we add SharePoint link in Planner task, we can’t reproduce any error but as you mentioned the problem occurs after 24 hours, we request you provide the some more time to check the behavior of it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: When I research about the problem, I couldn’t find any related threads or articles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps I followed (add the SharePoint link in Planner tasks in two ways)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open the SharePoint document library&gt; Select the folder&gt; Click on Copy link (copied the link with permission user in organization can edit)&gt; Copied&gt; Open the Planner&gt; Click on task&gt; Add attachments&gt; Link&gt; paste the link i.e. copied.</p>
<p>b. Open the SharePoint document library&gt; Select the folder&gt; Copy the URL in Address box (its noting but the URL of document library)&gt; Copied&gt; Open the Planner&gt; Click on task&gt; Add attachments&gt; Link&gt; paste the link i.e. copied.</p>
<p>Note: If we followed any wrong steps, please guide us with correct one as you’re doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In meantime, we suggest you try the following and check the outcome:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Add another SharePoint link to a Planner task and check whether it will be corrupted or not. (mentioned the word corrupted because, maybe 404 error message encountered due to corruption in link)</p>
<p>b. Check whether the problem occurs only with specific task or any task?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chitrahaas</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently come back to Windows 10 having used a MacBook Pro for the past 3yrs. One of my favourite features was the virtual desktop capability on the Mac and its great to see that Windows 10 has most of the same functionality in the virtual desktop feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One thing I used regularly on the MacBook was the ability to re-order the virtual desktops using drag and drop. I don't seem to be able to do this on Windows. Have I missed a trick? Or is this a feature that isn't there yet?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason I re-order is for speed when working on two or more virtual desktops and switching between them using the CTRL + WIN + LEFT/RIGHT keyboard shortcuts. Re-ordering the desktops enables me to put the virtual desktops I'm currently using next
 to each other for fast and easy switching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this is a feature that is on the roadmap if it's not there today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<h2>            stop Hotmail from being in Polish</h2>
                    Every time I log in to Hotmail, it is in Polish.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is a bar at the top telling me that the page has been translated from Polish into English, but it hasn't (and it doesn't)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do NOT want to use Hotmail in Polish, I want an English version that I can understand.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you e-mail me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to discuss, as I obviously can't use the Hotmail account as it is permanently in Polish and I can't navigate it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do so that I view my account in my chosen language (and the language used by a third of this planet?)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Error with Outlook.com email address &#40;has a custom domain&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> getunstuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error with Outlook.com email address &#40;has a custom domain&#41; with Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until recently I've been using the Hotmail Connector add-in from Outlook 2003 to deliver my mail into Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week one (of my three email addresses) were upgrade inside Outlook.com. (I noticed in other forum posts that you know if this has happened because it says "Outlook Mail (Preview)" in the upper left-hand side.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the solution of creating an alias. If you need help doing this, simply follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First login to the problem email account via a web browser.&nbsp; Once logged in click on the “avatar” in the upper right corner – you will get a drop down menu – and select “View account” which will open
 a new browser tab for the associated Microsoft account.&nbsp; From the menu bar select “Your info”.&nbsp; On the next screen select “Manage your sign-in email or phone number”.&nbsp; At the next screen (at least for me) I get a Microsoft Account confirmation screen from
 which you can send a code to verify your account to an email address or phone number.&nbsp; Enter the code on the next screen – you will get another screen asking if you want to setup a code generator app on your phone – you can select “Later” for now.&nbsp; The next
 screen will be for managing your account aliases.&nbsp; Select “Add email”.&nbsp; At the next screen you have two choices – “Create a new email address and add it as an alias” or “Add an existing email address as a Microsoft account alias”.&nbsp; I selected the first option
 which guides you in creating an email address with an @outlook.com domain.&nbsp; This address will only be used to login to your existing outlook.com account using your existing password.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Source:&nbsp;</span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oemail-oapps/issues-connecting-to-outlookcom/0618f383-49ca-4595-a215-7e78e9319219?auth=1)</p>
<p>This didn't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to setup a IMAP account (as opposed to my previous MAPI account) using the settings I found on the internet. This didn't work! However, I did find inside Outlook.com their settings for setting up an IMAP account inside Outlook 2010 and used
 them. The test was successful. However, I kept getting error messages that the account was disconnected from the server. No problem. Except I received a lot of these and it caused my machine to slowdown and eventually crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now removed the offending email from Outlook 2010 in order to keep my sanity and try to continue to use Outlook for email from my other accounts. This is problematic because I use the folders from different emails for the odd email I receive in other
 accounts so that I can "archive" mail that I want to read later, for reference, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I would like to ask the community two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, is there a way to get my custom domain, upgraded Outlook.com email address to work nicely in Outlook 2010. If not, what program will work? (Please don't say Office 365 because I'm not convinced it is work the monthly cost and I'm very hopeful there
 is another way.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, what is the best way to "archive" mail? And does anyone have a nice workflow for archiving mail using Outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks. Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply but that doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw the email that Microsoft sent out regarding Outlook not working. In the email, it references this document and despite my version of Outlook being supported, it doesn't work because of the custom domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to do this with my alias instead. It sets it up and then says "You must restart Outlook for these changes to take effect." When I restart, it says, "The name cannot be matched to a name in the address list." Then I get a dialogue box that asks
 me for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft Exchange server: ______</p>
<p>Mailbox:&nbsp;=SMTP:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Check Name"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to enter. I've tried a couple different things like&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">imap-mail.outlook.com&nbsp;</span>but
 I can't get it to work.</p>

<h2>            NEED HELP WITH R.O.I FORMULA IN EXCEL &#40;MORE OF A COST OF ACQUISITION FORMULA&#41;</h2>
                    <p>If someone could help I would really appreciate it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a list which is always growing (B8, B9, B10, etc.) of people. I have the formulas running for the cost but the cost per customer is not a fixed cost, meaning one customer cost $5.00 the next may be $10.72 and then one may even be $0.00.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the total cost (J40) as well as total commission (K40) which are always being changed. The formulas for that is fine. I also know to do the formula I'm asking about once I have a set number of people. The PROBLEM is that I don't know how an excel
 formula can keep a running total of the people as they are added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the formula would look like this: (AGAIN, I AM HAVING PROBLEM WITH A FORMULA INCLUDING EVERYONE AS I GO)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROFIT</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>How to change IE 11 product key in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bry42  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change IE 11 product key in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Recently I installed an OEM&nbsp;copy of Windows 8.1 x64. Let's say for the sake of discussion that the product key of the Windows installation was ABC. Then later, I decided to upgrade that machine to Windows 8.1 Pro x64 by using the "Add new features to windows"
 link on the Windows Update dialog. When asked for a product key, I used an 8.1 Pro x64 product key (not an upgrade key, but a full blown product key) that I had purchased previously but never used. Let's say that product key was XYZ.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then later, I installed windows 8.1 x64 (NOT pro) on another machine. Thinking that product key ABC was now free to be used, I tried to use that key to activate this later installation. However, Windows came back and said that key was already in use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the BelArc.exe tool on the&nbsp;ORIGINAL machine, (the one that I had first installed windows 8.1 and then upgraded to Pro), I discovered the following: The product key for Windows had indeed been changed to XYZ. However, the product key for IE 11 on said
 machine was still set to ABC. Thus, preventing me (I presume) from reusing ABC on another machine. A quick check of the registry confirmed that IE 11 still had the old product key assigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is: How do I set the product key for IE 11 to be the same as the Windows installation itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>thanks for your reply<br />
as I'm totaly out of programming (less the a beginner) I'm not even able to copy/paste in the right way the code to insert in the VBA window<br />
please&nbsp; can you kindly report the correct code here? </p>
<p>by the way, in the first link I see how to work on an incoming email, but it's not showed how to set up the category, that's it my real goal (i guess it should be in the *** 'do something here *** box)<br />
<br />
I don't understand the second link: why should I create a certificate?<br />
<br />
<br />
the account is a shared account running on Exchange and the rules doese'nt works: it requires to launch it many times per day<br />
if you can also tell me how to get an exchanged account (not the main folder&nbsp; <code>
<span>GetDefaultFolder</span></code>) should be great<br />
<br />
really thanks</p>

            hallo<br />
first of all please apologize for my poor english, I hope you will understing my following words.<br />
<br />
I alredy use macros in Outlook but ite never asked me for certificate; it just ask me to activate macro at the first launch in every session.<br />
<br />
so, thanks for your code but unfortunately it doesent works, here the detail:<br />
- the line&nbsp;&nbsp; Private WithEvents Items As Outlook.Items&nbsp;&nbsp; turns red just as i write and if I use F8 to check it select 'WithEvents' and tells me something like "valid only in object module" (please note that i have 6 modules open, because the other macros i
 run - may be this is the problem)<br />
&nbsp;- if I skip the error by posing that line as comment, the Set Items line tell me (obviously) the variable is undefined<br />
I've never used Option explicit e Private variables, so i don't know **** to mage 'em.

<p>
</p><p>The code I posted goes in the <strong>ThisOutlookSession</strong> module (in English language versions of Outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should not be affected by your other macros unless you have other macros of the same names</p>

Option Explicit at the top of a module forces you to declare your variables. They are all declared in my code.</p>

hello<br />
I'm sorry but it still does not works.<br />
when I lanunch Outlook it appears now the macro alert, I allow to run and I have no errors; i send an email to me with the correct keyword but the category is always blank, not red as i requested. I need to set a category for any incoming email.<br />
<br />
so<br />
maybe i have troubles in managing the correct folder, so I've made a change to test in default primary inbox folder, but it's not the right solution<br />
where do I'm wrong?<br />

            <p>hallo</p>
<p>thank you very much, after many attempts now it works, probably the solution was that to act:</p>
<p>msg.save</p>
<p>at the end of the condion</p>
<p>honestly it works fine but not in the way I've searched for: I mean it does not assign the color but an already existing category.</p>

<p>I've got a personal folder (account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, folder 'inbox') and a&nbsp; shared one (account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** [but the folder is namnd as alias: Corporation], folder 'inbox') and I need to run it only in the shared one</p>
<p>can you please how to set this part of code?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If olStore.DisplayName = "Account Display Name" Then 'Change to what you have</em><br />

<p>Replace <em>Account Display Name </em>with whatever is displayed in Outlook as the name for that account and similarly use the spelling for the folder as shown. The following macro will loop through all the stores and folders and list the Account Display

<p>Hi Ron,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response, the trouble is I cannot do any of this without being signed into the original Microsoft account - there in lies the issue.... I don't know what this account/original email address is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a one licence product key and not one that can be shared with others.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>When using another account to ascertain what email address the product key is registered against is should provide a portion of the email address however this does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am instead presented with - 'This product key has already been used'</p>

<p>When you first setup your Office 365 account at:&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://setup.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://setup.office.com/</span></a></span></span>
 you would have been prompted to use the email address and password for a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; This is a security measure, it becomes your ID.&nbsp; Also when you setup your Office and used the email address and password for a Microsoft Account it created an Office
 Account from where&nbsp; you can install Office at any time. You need to sign into your Office Account with the same email address and password at:
<a href="https://stores.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://stores.office.com/myaccount</span></a></span> &nbsp; You can only use the Product Key once to install Office 365.</p>

<p><span>Thanks Ron, </span>
</p>
<p><span>Yes I do understand that, but I do not have those account details.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We have patients at a secure healthcare facility who do not have access to the internet and the patient in question does not know the email address/Office ID that was used to originally register
 his Office 365 account. - Yes I know you can launch Word/Excel and click on account to show the email address, however this is not present.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For whatever reason Office 365 has not downloaded onto their laptop and the request was to re-download and activate the product for them.</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is that the Product ID will not activate as it is already registered against an email address - I do not know and neither do they what this is.
</span></p>
<p><span>Once we know this then perhaps we could transfer the subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>So again, is there a means to find out what email address the product key is registered against?</span></p>
<p><span>That is my issue. </span>

<p>St</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all you need an internet connection to run Office 365.&nbsp; The user must log into their account at least once every 30 days or Office 365 will not work properly (reduced functionality) Therefore you need an internet connection to log into the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For Office 365 Home, Personal, and University, </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact support</a><span>.&nbsp; You
 will need proof of identification re bank account.&nbsp; As you will be aware Office 365 is a subscription service and Microsoft will need to know who the payee is.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry I cannot be more helpful.&nbsp; Please come back if you have any further questions or you need further clarification.</span></p>

<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 Presenter View</h2>
                    In PPT2010, I could see a scrollable list of my slides (small tiles or thumbnails) at the bottom of the screen while in Presenter View, showing both hidden and unhidden slides. &nbsp;I cannot figure out how to display that in PPT2016. &nbsp; I know that I can click
 to get to the view of all slides in a tiled view, but I want to be able to see several upcoming slides while I am presenting. &nbsp;I also like to see hidden slides that I may want to open. &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Are you able to play these games without connecting Online?</p>
</li><li>

<p><span>Technical Preview should work with the same devices and programs that work with Windows 8.1, but you might need to update or reinstall some of them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to section “<strong>What does it work with</strong>?” from this Microsoft link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: If you have not installed proper Network and graphic card drivers. The online games will not run on your PC. Let’s try updating these drivers and check if
 it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download and install drivers (Also applicable for Windows 10 Technical Preview )</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also visit your computer manufacturer support site and check for latest available drivers and install it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong>If drivers are updated then try performing Clean Boot and check if it helps. Clean boot helps is eliminating third party software conflict.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot</span></strong></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section<strong> “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong>
 to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            History Button Missing in IE 8.0</h2>
                    I originally hit the favorites scroll down menu after reviewing the previous question and answer about this same topic. I think it should be mentioned that the history tab is installed&nbsp;behind the favorites&nbsp;button that is designated with a five pointed
 star on the bottom left corner on IE 8.0 and if you have another toobar, i.e. Google toolbar, then that becomes somewhat confusing. Thank You, as I had the same question.

            Thank you, but that isn't the problem. I'm talking about on my PC. I don't want the app to open - just a new email in outlook.com (from my hotmail address). I use Chrome. It just opens a blank page when I open a mailto link...
