                    <p>I was having syncing issues and signed out of the my desktop version of One note. My iPhone is still up to date and the account is still there but now i cannot open the folder and it says "sorry - we couldn't open the notes that you were looking for. they
 may have been deleted or moved, or you may not have permission to open them."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i rectify? i know the notes are still there and i didn't delete anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Brodie,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To ensure that notebooks won't be updated when we have signed out, you could go to Credential Manager &gt;Windows Credentials to clear the items including MicrosoftOffice… to see if it
 makes help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the error message, per my test, when I signed in my account in OneNote 2016 desktop, I could open the notebooks which were stored on my OneDrive or SharePoint Site Library by following
 steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open OneNote &gt;File tab &gt;Open &gt;Open from other location &gt;Sites or OneDrive - Company tenant &gt;Select the notebook &gt;Open</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mentioned that "… signed out of the my desktop version of One note", please re-sign in your OneNote account to ensure your current account is consistent with the OneDrive's or SharePoint Library's
 account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding more synchronization issues, you could also refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-issues-when-you-can-t-sync-onenote-299495ef-66d1-448f-90c1-b785a6968d45?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need further assistance, I would like to confirm following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.You mentioned that "but now I cannot open the folder…". Where was the folder stored? In other word, where were your notebooks stored? OneDrive or SharePoint Library?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.Could you access the notebooks via OneNote Online with the same account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Considering you post this thread in Windows 10, please share your OneNote

            <strong>Final</strong> view just changes the view of the document, not its underlying content. In order to remove the markup, you have to click the bottom of the
<strong>Accept</strong> split button and choose <strong>Accept All Changes in Document</strong>. If there are comments, click the bottom of the

    <title>Water damage indicator in C3-01 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzby---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Water damage indicator in C3-01</h2>
                    
<p>Does the C3-01 have water damage indicators?&nbsp; Vodaphone claim that mine has suffered water damage.&nbsp; It is less than a year old, has never been wet, dropped in water or&nbsp;used in the bath.&nbsp; The screen suddenly stopped working and when I took it in for repair
 it came back as water damage along with a photo, which I couldn't make sense of,&nbsp;showing the damage.&nbsp; I've got over a year to run on my contract and I'm paying for internet that I can't use.&nbsp; I've gone back to my previous phone, a 6303 which has spent the
 last few months sitting in a cupboard, and it works fine.&nbsp; I've had at least 6 Nokia phones over the last few years and have never had a problem.&nbsp; I live in the same house and have the same job, my lifestyle hasn't changed, yet the C3-01 has suffered water
 damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really disappointed and I'd like know whether my faith in Nokia phones is misguided, I will certainly think long and hard about buying another.&nbsp; Is the newer technology (touchscreen) less robust and unable to cope with life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be gratefully for anyones thoughts, I wonder if there is somewhere I could get a second opinion, it was a great little phone before disaster struck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can get a second opinion by sending it to another Nokia care point. Water damage can sometimes also be caused by high humidity and condensation without the phone actually touching water.</p>

<p>I appreciate that they can suffer water damage from humidity/condensation, but I really don't think that the phone has suffered in any way.&nbsp; None of my previous phones suffered and this one has not been treated any differently, except I've been a bit more
 careful with the screen!&nbsp; The girl in the vodaphone shop said mine phone didn't have water damage indicators, but I'm not sure if they were never there or if they think I've removed them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just find it strange that after I'd handed it in for repair a friend said to me "I bet it comes back as water damage".&nbsp; Since then a couple of other people have said they've had the same diagnosis.&nbsp; Up until then I'd never heard of water damage indicators
 or realised how many people have had the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you advice.</p>

<p>The indicator is the liitle white oblong sticker in the battery compartment but may not have changed colour even with liquid on the main board. It's the luck of the draw I'm afraid. You must also remember that it doesn't pay the repair centre to BER a handset
 without &nbsp;good reason, they make no money from handling the handset and end up NOT repairing it (no profit anyway). Like anywhere they can make mistakes so a second opinion is worth considering. Remember also the repair centre is not owned by Vodafone or Nokia
 neither of whom are to blame in this scenario. Failure due to liquid ingress often happens many days or even weeks later than the contamination event and it dosen't take much liquid to kill a phone!</p>

<h2>            ActveX command buttons and Form Control Buttons</h2>
                    <p>Excel VBA</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is not how to add buttons but some advice regarding the use of Form control command button and AtiveX command buttons. What is the difference between the two? Are there any circumstances where one is better than the other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worksheet: I want to add command buttons to allow the user to navigate around a large worksheet.there will be in all 42 sets of 8 bttons each selecting a different cell within the worksheet together with a "top"&nbsp; to return to "A1" placed near all the
 other Nav buttons.&nbsp; These are all placed dynamically as the spreadsheet&nbsp;is populated with data which is different everytime.&nbsp; So the location of the buttons&nbsp;is different each time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the code i'm using to create the form command buttons</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveSheet.Buttons.Add(Xpos, Top, Width, Height).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.OnAction = MacroName(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Characters.Text = Captions(i)<br />
where MacroName and Captions are arrays containg the macro to execute and the caption on each button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Code I can use with AtiveX command buttons</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set buttonMelb = ActiveSheet.OLEObjects.Add(ClassType:="Forms.CommandButton.1", Left:=395, Top:=1, Height:=20, Width:=30)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buttonMelb.Object.Caption = "Melb"&nbsp; 'click macro code<br />
then</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worksheets("MySheet").cells(1, 1).Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advice gratefully received</p>

            <p>Hi RealGuy077,</p><p>I have a page on my site about controls:</p><p><a href="http://www.jkp-ads.com/articles/controls.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jkp-ads.com/articles/controls.asp</a></p><p>The ActiveX ones have two problems from the coding perspective.</p><p>1. If you add activex controls, your VBA code is reset and you loose the variables.</p><p>2. You need a class module to respond to their events if you add them dynamically rather than at design time.</p>

            My problem is not with the apps. It's only the Microsoft Store that doesn't update. I did hard reset one time and the problem solved but after awhile It came back. The store doesn't update itself. I can't hard reset to update every new version of Microsoft
 Store that comes. Pls fix the store. I already notice that so many users have the same problem with store. It sucked in an old version.

    <title>Copy-paste excel data without changing the content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sub212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy-paste excel data without changing the content</h2>
                    1) If I want to copy paste a formula from a field to somewhere else, without wanting the program to adjust the content to the new field, and without adding $$ (with F4), can I do that?<br />
Example: <br />
I want to move from A1 to A5 a function that says =B1 without changing B1, so that it's still =B1 in box A5 without using "$", how can I do that?<br />
I tried all the paste special options, but none give me the result I want.<br />
<br />
2) Moved <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/excelchart/thread/4ae69f04-ca29-4f25-9d05-5584c46e010f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            It depends on the circumstances.<br />
Here's something you might be able to do if the charts refer to data on the same sheet as the chart...<br />
•MOVE the sheet(s) with the charts to the new workbook.<br />
•Close&nbsp;the original workbook...WITHOUT saving it.<br />
•Edit&nbsp;the chart data in the new workbook<br />
<br />
It's easier to redirect formulas, if you need to, than to redirect charts.<br />
<br />
Does that help?<br />

            Here's what I usually do in that circumstance....<br />
<br />
From the ribbon:<br />
Home.Find&amp;Select.Replace<br />
...Find what: =<br />
...Replace with: |=<br />
...Click: Replace_All<br />
<br />
That will prepend every equal sign with a pipe character.<br />
<br />
Now you can copy and paste whatever you want...since all formulas are now text.<br />
<br />
When done:<br />
Home.Find&amp;Select.Replace<br />
...Find what: |=<br />
...Replace with: =<br />
...Click: Replace_All<br />
<br />
Is that something you can work with?

<h3> stormy girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create numbered style linked to heading but don&#39;t change my headings further up&#33;</h2>
                    OK - I've create a new style in my document called Appendix numbered styles. It it is a list style and it has 3 outline levels. I've linked each level to heading1,2,3. Now the trouble is, I've used heading1,2,3 further up in my document and when I apply
 my appendix style to my appendices at the end of the document, I only want it to number those headings but it changes all of my titles that are formatted using hdg1,2,3 to numbered further up the document. How can I stop it from doing this? Thanks.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The best and most robust solution is&nbsp;to have two&nbsp;sets of headings.</p>
<p>So if you create three new styles Appendixheading 1, appendix heading 2, apppendix heading 3 and link thoose to your liststyle. so in the first bit of your document you use the headingstyles and in the apendices you use your appendix heading styles.</p>

<h3> zac force  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change formatting for emails that I forward in outlook 365&#63;</h2>
                    I have accidentally told outlook to never ask me again regarding how I want to format content that I paste into emails that I am forwarding to others. It currently only pastes as plain text and I cannot figure out how to change it back to paste in HTML
 or to at least keep the formatting of what I am copying over. I have done an online repair and reset the pane to try and have it prompt me again regarding my pasting options. When I compose a new email it works perfectly. I have gone into file -&gt; options -&gt;
 Mail -&gt; Editor Options - Advanced and made sure that all of the formatting under cut, copy, and paste options are set to keep source formatting. Does anyone know how I can revert my changes or change the settings in any way to be able to keep my formatting
 when I am forwarding emails? Thanks.

<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />i believe you are using outlook client application, you can change the setting in the forward mail itself. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helps. as the settings you changed in Options are correct.

<h2>            Action Center Tiles Not Responding in Release in Build 16241</h2>
                    <p>The action center tiles are unresponsive.&nbsp; When I move the cursor around the tiles, tiles highlight at random but left clicking with the mouse has no response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered this problem in build 16241?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also posting this problem in the feedback forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. the problem with the mail app error has been fixed in this release for me :-)</p>

<p>I have no problem with Action Center.<br />
The random may be because those tiles are not active.&nbsp; Like on my laptop Tablet Mode is not active as I have no touch screen.&nbsp; When I move the mouse over the tiles those tat are active show a lighted border and there is none on the non-active tiles.
</p>
<p>You can go into Settings and remove those inactive tiles. Go Settings, System, Notifications &amp; actions.</p>
<p>At the top is Quick Actions where you can add or remove quick actions.</p>

<p>Thanks Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your fix resolved my problem when I changed my scaling back to 100% but it fails again when I go back again to 150%.</p>

</p><p>FYI - I have a Lenovo Laptop running an Intel HD5500 graphics adapter and projecting to an external Dell EH2414H DVI monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to stay at 100% but my eyes just aren't what they used to be, hehehe. :-)</p>

<p>Go to Action Center, All Settings, Change size of Text, Apps etc. Reduce size to say 150%. Come out of Settings, and Action Center. Go back in to Size of Text, Apps and put back to 200% (. recommended).</p>
<p>Action Center tiles should then work. (Fingers crossed)</p>

<h2>            Sorry We Could not open XXXXXXXX - SharePoint or OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week Office 2013 (on my work and home PC) decided it wouldn't open any files from Our Office 365 SharePoint Setup nor would it open any files from my personal OneDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system restore solved the issue but then some Windows updates have applied and the issue is back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At home a simple restart to let the updates full apply solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At work i'm stuck not being able to open files - since a system restore fixed it and now its back again i assume it's an update that has applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to solve this - its rather infuriating</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gareth</p>

    <title>MSN Accounts not refreshing on Ipad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rfb_999  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSN Accounts not refreshing on Ipad</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 each MSN accounts and the problem I am having when setting these up on my iPad. I am able to set them up as an outlook.com type, and everything is accepted when adding the accounts. The problem begins when I try to download my emails old and new,
 and I receive the error "Cannot Get Mail the connection to the server failed". Now if I go in and just add the account as an "other" account which only gives me emails it seems to work properly, but I cannot&nbsp;add the calendar, contacts, notes and reminders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log onto outlook.com come I see a black bar across the top and it says "outlook email (preview)" so it seems as though the accounts have not fully migrated over to the outlook.com.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did make a free&nbsp;outlook.com account, and this one I have no issues with on the iPad, it works perfectly. This account reads outlook.com across the top where as the msn accounts read as noted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in hopes that you could advise on how I can get the accounts migrated over to outlook .com and/or how I can&nbsp;save all my emails, address book, calendar etc.&nbsp;into an outlook.com account. I have looked into this, but do not see anything specific for this
 migration, being the 2 accounts are already in the outlook.com system. I see where I can pull Gmail etc. into outlook, but not the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roger Bryce</p>

<p>Error message says "There was a problem setting up Microsoft Office Starter 2010:&nbsp; There was a problem setting up Microsoft Office.&nbsp; Try running setup again.&nbsp; If problem continues, contact Microsoft Product Support."</p>
<p>I tried again before and after reboots -- still no go.</p>

            I went into REGEDIT and the values were already set to %USERPROFILE%...... &nbsp;and I noticed there wasn't really anything to do to "fix" it... I found a fairly simple step and it fixed my pre-loaded microsoft office excel... here's what I did:
<div><br />
<div>1. Click the start button, then control panel.</div>
<div>2. locate and click on the PROGRAMS AND FEATURES icon.</div>
<div>3. Scroll down and locate the MICROSOFT OFFICE STARTER program. Click ONCE to select it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. At the top right above program name, you'll see " Organize, Uninstall, Change "&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. CLICK CHANGE</div>
<div>6. When the UAC pops up, click yes then you will see a box that says "Repair Microsoft Office Click-to-run"</div>
<div>7. Click yes again.&nbsp;</div>
<div>8. That's all.... :)&nbsp;</div>
<div>( I didn't check the box to remove all office user settings and it fixed my problem)</div>
<div>I hope this helps!</div>

<p>It's a no-go.&nbsp; Dell says that Microsoft provides support for their products.&nbsp; That's probably "it" for them in the future.</p>
<p>So, unless Microsoft helps, it's a lost cause. We'll see if they actually support what they sell.</p>
<p>The simple solution would be to just buy the Microsoft Word element that I need, but if I do that I'll feel as if I was cheated since I didn't get the product for which I already paid, so I'll keep working this for a while.</p>

Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Try editing this registry key to see if this helps:</p>
<p>1. Launch the registry editor as Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click on the Windows Start menu, Type "Regedit" without the quotation marks. Right click on Regedit and choose "Run as administrator" and click Yes on the UAC dialog.</p>
<p>2. Back up (Export)&nbsp;and then rename the Registry Key if applicable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Navigate to <span>[HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-18\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Look at the AppData key in the right pane of the registry window.&nbsp; If the Data column contains only "%APPDATA%, then proceed.&nbsp; If not, then do not go any further.&nbsp; Close the registry editor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Click on the AppData key in the right pane of the registry window, which should highlight the key.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Then click on File, Export and choose a location and name of the saved original registry key and click the Save button.&nbsp; Don't forget where you saved it!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. Double-click on the "AppData" key in the right pane of the registry window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. In the "Value Data" field, change "%APPDATA%" to “%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming" and click on OK</span></p>
<p><span>3- Reboot the machine</span></p>
<p><span>4- Attempt to re-initialize Office Starter again</span></p>

            <p>I too have this issue and would like to get it fixed asap as I am currently reluctantly using a replacement&nbsp;non-windows&nbsp;handset.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HTC 8s is in either boot loop (reboot to HTC screen and then restart/vibrate) or blue screen of death (blue screen with the&nbsp;:( symbols) or if I'm lucky I can get the ! sign. Unfortunately it will not hard reset and the windows phone recovery tool&nbsp;suite
 does not appear&nbsp;compatible with this model (to revert to WP8).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to know if Microsoft is planning on including the HTC 8s in the next&nbsp;version (i.e. soon) as if not I&nbsp;will have to 'bite&nbsp;the bullet' and buy a replacement phone (unlikely to be Windows based on current experience) :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to hearing from someone, many thanks - a keen windows phone/mobile&nbsp;user</p>

            WHY is there no option for using gridlines on powerpoint for Mac? Are you guys nuts? Such a simple and useful feature. Just implement it already..<br />
<br />
I’m sorry, but really? it’s these kinds of things that makes it obvious to me that you are all completely out of touch with the program and users. I don’t know what you people do all day.

<h2>            Google maps doesn&#39;t work on my new E72</h2>
                    
<p>I got the phone last week and since then i've been trying to fix the issue but so far no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the newest firmware : 031.023.244.02.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open google maps (latest ver. 4.x ) it gets stuck on a infinite loop between "initializing GPS and GPS active" &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In positioning methods I have the "Network based" option disabled. Assisted GPS and Integrated GPS are enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OVI Maps 3.03 works fine, Sports Tracker works fine, GPS info app works fine, Location Tagger works as well. The GPS on the phone works great, it is just that Google Maps can't make full use of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do I delete them ? And I use my internet&nbsp;access point to connect to the internet..&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if network based is enabled OVI MAPS crashes and the whole phone restarts. Really buggy. IF network based positioning is disabled, OVI maps works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll need a packet-data (gprs) connection for Google Maps anyway, because there are no pre-installed maps on the device. Keep in mind that Google Maps use great amounts of data, so I guess you've an unlimited dataplan with your SP.</p>

<p>I have unlimited data plan with AT&amp;T, yes. I use the same&nbsp;access point for OVI maps as well, i don't have any maps stored on my SD card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that OVI maps crashes the phone when network based positioning method is enabled is a completely different issue. I am more concerned about google maps not working properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a side not I wouldn't even use google maps if OVI was as good at finding local businesses. They should integrate OVI maps with yelp or some other online review web based service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I strongly suggest you reset the E72. Dial *#7370# 12345 reformat, you'll lose all data. Make a backup first and restore without the settings.</p>
