<h2>            One sender always shows in focused inbox, not &#34;other&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Every day I click several messages from a particular sender and move them to "Other". I make extra sure that I select "Always move to other", but the next day, several new messages from that particular sender are again in my focused inbox.&nbsp; I know how to
 set up focused inbox. And there are many emails every day that get to the other inbox correctly. Just not this one sender. What do I need to do?</p>

<p>Hi teylyn</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the messages head shows that there’s a header field “X-MS-Exchange-Organization-BypassFocusedInbox” in messages header, generally, to add this field, admin can create a transport rules, this is an organization-wide configuration and will allow sender
 bypassing the Focused inbox algorithm. If this field value is set to true, the sender’s future emails will still display in Focused Inbox even if you choose “Always move to Other folder”</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to this, if you still want this sender not go into Focused view, since there’s no other options can modify this on end-user side, you may contact your admin and let him help you to check the transport rules and other settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

    <title>Using a phone as a music player in my car - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using a phone as a music player in my car</h2>
                    
<p>Recently ive been using my Nokia 808 as a music player in my car, my Kenwood stereo has a aux input and the 808 has a small headphone jack output so connecting it is no problem (i dont use the FM transmitter on the phone as the aerial on my car isnt so good
 and i get interference).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works well but the major problem is that its very quiet compared to a cd. I have used software to normalise the volume of all my audio tracks so they are pretty much at normal cd level but they are still quietier than cd's played by the car stereo by
 quite a long way.</p>
<p>The problem is not with my car stereo as its an extremely good unit which cost me a lot of money, so therefore it must be that the phone simply does not output enough volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a device that can increase the volume to the car stereo aux input??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
I had some kind of sony car stereo. There was an option to adjust aux levels. Also have you maxed out volume level in your phone?<br />

<p>I'd go with what JackS has said. Also, normalising the loudness tends to drop volume levels in songs, that's what I have found so I no longer bother with my music collection. When running my N8 at times via AUX into my car stereo, I find I have to turn up
 the volume level on my car stereo to quite a reasonable number (e.g. VOL=25) compared to what the same volume would be if I was playing songs through USB (e.g.VOL=15). This behaviour is normal when running it through AUX, whether it be a car or home stereo,
 that's just how it works.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies!</p>
<p>I only normalise when the volume is quiet, like when i rip audio from a video as usually videos are not very loud, ripping from a cd is normally ok so i dont normalise them unless i need to.</p>
<p>My stereo does have volume offset for each source but it only allows you to decrease the volume and not up it.</p>
<p>Sadly i dont have a usb input on my stereo, its the only thing it doesnt have!! And im not going to buy a new stereo as i have a £2000 limited anniversary edition Kenwood screen which is still better than most systems these days even though its from 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a Fiio headphone amp on ebay but im not sure it will work without buying and trying it, might give it a go as its only £20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the moment what ive done is to crank up the gain on my external amplifiers in the boot which gives me enough volume when using the phone, then i used the volume offset to decrease the volume from all other sources so everything is about the same level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a bit of reasearch it seems that you are right about most aux inputs on car stereos being a bit quiet compared to usb or cd or radio, i dont know why this is, it seems silly to me that they do it like this but nevermind.</p>
<p>My Technics amp at home is totally different, it has a loud aux input so it seems not all stereos are the same........</p>

<p>Does it make any difference if you go to settings/phones/accessories and change the default connetion to something like music stand or wireless carkit instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their is a way to increase the volume via a mod so your phone outputs louder sounds but i dont think i can talk about stuff like that here.</p>

<p>Ive just tried it with my home stereo and everything seems to be the same volume except the 'Music Stand' which is a lot quieter than all the others.</p>

<p>Hi yellow_fto,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you could not resolve your car audio difficulties. It's a bummer that this happens unfortunately. I am appalled at how USB ports on car stereos are only able to read about 128 directories with music in it, and if there's any more than
 that it throws a fit and doesn't show up all of what's stored on the USB drive. Thought it wouldn't be that hard to make it access like a phone does, where it finds all the folders. The pitfalls and frustrations of technology these days, they're supposed to
 make life easier but make it harder!</p>

<p>Indeed, things just get more complex!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im on the verge of just giving up using my phone to play mp3's in the car, luckily ive just found out my headunit plays mp3's off a dvd so it might be easier for me to use double layered dvd's for 9gb of music per disc instead of using the phone, although
 the phone would be better as i have a 64gb memory card in it and can add/delete at will so unless i use dvd-rw's they are a one hit wonder!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ah well, at least both methods are still way better than having 100+ seperate cd's in the car!</p>

<p>@amsh1373 - Pl. check if any update is available for your phone by connecting it thru' OVI Suit and selecting appropriate options. It will show the current version on phone and latest available for the phone. If you read other posts regarding upgrades to
 much higher versions its because of their region. OVI Suit will give the correct picture..</p>

<h2>            Exchange online protection mail flow setup</h2>
                    
<p>I need assistance with the setup of my mail flow connector from Office 365 to my organization. My exchange environment has been up and running for a couple of years with mail flowing through an Edge Subscription on ForeFront TMG 2010 (I now need to direct
 the&nbsp;mail flow through Office 365). I can successfully Telnet to my external IP on port 25 and in my understanding this should be sufficient to (without any changes to my TMG setup) directly point the Office 365 connector to&nbsp;this public IP address. On validation
 of my mail connector I get the following error: "Failed to connect or authenticate to internal server with error 'One or more errors occurred.', please try again later.". The domain setup and DirSync steps have already been completed on Office 365.</p>

            <p>Thanks for responding. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I had already tried this and it doesn't solve the problem. &nbsp;What seems to be happening is that every email shows up with a title line. &nbsp; I guess it's supposed to group emails from the same sender together, but if all
 of the emails are from a unique source, it appears as though there are two lines for every email. &nbsp;It's a mess. &nbsp; &nbsp;The new email is frustrating on so many levels I can't even list them all. &nbsp;Whoever thought this change was a good idea needs to have their head
 examined.</p>

<h2>            MS Project 2013 - issue with sub-project duration, start and finsish dates on subject line when on Master Schedule</h2>
                    <p>I have created a Master Schedule with several sub-projects.&nbsp; The first five or so linked seem to have joined the Master without issue.&nbsp; The last two I have tried to link are there ok, though their subject line duration, start and finish dates are all incorrect.&nbsp;
 When I expand the sub-project, the correct dates&nbsp; and duration are there in the lower lines and tasks - the error is only in the top line.&nbsp; I cannot change this as they are defaulted to Auto-Schedule, so I cannot just overwrite the data.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Yes, update Project 2013. This issue was fixed with the December 2016 cumulative update. To update, run Windows Update.</p>
<p>

<h2>            ND Mail and other paid apps</h2>
                    <p>HI, I have posted before on this. &nbsp;I have a Godaddy MS 365 organisation and want to use some paid apps/addins from store. &nbsp;Free ones add in easily. &nbsp;When I go to get a paid one it asks me to sign in to my microsoft account and then shows that I have paid
 but it will not associate the add in with my Godaddy account so I cant use it. &nbsp;I went to NDMail and they tried to solve it and say its a MS problem. &nbsp;I also checked with Godaddy and they say the same thing. &nbsp;I attach a screen print from the NDMail team who
 tried to help me. &nbsp;When you go to purchase an add in you are required to use your microsoft account to pay and it doesnt allow you to log into your godaddy 365 account to pay for a store item there. &nbsp;how can associate the MS account with the right office 365
 licence?</p>
<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the results of the script, both as text and as a screenshot. You’ll note that although it states that you’ve already purchased the add-in, it isn’t actually listed as a purchased add-in within your tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be caused because the Microsoft ID that you are using is associated with a different tenant or account. Microsoft should be able to assist you in associating it with the appropriate tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps and we would be happy to provide any further assistance where we are able.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Nick,<br />
<br />
Did you purchase the add-in via the Office Store directly, or did you first go through the Outlook web app, only then redirected by it to the Office Store?</p>
<p>If you purchased the add-in directly via the Office Store without going through the Outlook web app, please try adding the add-in via the Outook web app, and when the Office Store prompts you to login, login using the Microsoft account that you used to purchase
 the add-in. This may link your Office 365 account with your Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
Please also try the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-a-license-for-an-app-that-isn-t-listed-on-the-apps-for-Outlook-page-84d9c850-4b72-44bb-9180-cbc7c34d6c40?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>hi nick,<br />
<br />
the guide is pretty old so it seems like now the “app” has been changed to “add-in”, the location should still be the same.<br />
<br />
you can go to your outlook settings page and click on the add-in link.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=44407fa6-27df-4088-ad2c-3a0a38784529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d44407fa6-27df-4088-ad2c-3a0a38784529" /></a><br />
<br />
it will redirect you to the office store, where you can sign in using your microsoft account, and then go to your my account page.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Sheen, thanks for your help. &nbsp;I have done this many times. &nbsp;It shows I have purchased the add in but it is not visible on the add ins list. &nbsp;Other free add ins associate with the godaddy account straight away, ones needing to be purchased through my microsoft
 account dont turn up on the add ins screen. &nbsp;I have tried to get to this page all ways suggested to no avail. &nbsp;When I get to the last link I am looking for the option to recover the licence for an add in that does not appear and then it suggests go to a page
 for apps for sharepoint and outlook, but there is no link to such a page.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating. &nbsp;surely someone else has this issue and there is a an easy fix. &nbsp;It seems to apply to paid add ins.</p>

<p>Hi Nick,<br />
<br />
Regarding "<em>It shows I have purchased the add in but it is not visible on the add ins list.</em>", have you tried adding the trial version of ND|Mail and then go to the
<strong>Manage add-ins</strong> page, click "<strong>Click here to buy the add-in</strong>" to buy the add-in?<br />
<br />
About link the Godaddy and Microsoft account, if you mean to link an Office 365 license with a Microsoft account, this is not feasible.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
James</p>

<p>Hi James, yes I have tried this.</p>
<p>I feel I am getting sent in circles here and its frustrating. &nbsp;Is there a way to get proper help with this feature?</p>
<p>I need to be clear. &nbsp;I have office 365 professional through GoDaddy. &nbsp;when I add a free add in for outlook from the store, it is immediately available through managing add-ins, I have several up and running on outlook and they work fine.</p>
<p>When I try to add one that has to be paid for (even on a free trial basis) all the screen flows from wherever this starts take me to a microsoft account log in page, which does not present the option to sign in from the account provided by work, which would
 normally take me to my godaddy sign in page, it simply presents a microsoft account sign in page.</p>
<p>I have signed in to my microsoft account as required and paid for the app. &nbsp;It is then NOT available on the manage add ins page like the free ones are to my Office365 professional licence that I use for my outlook email.</p>
<p>I am online with my professional 365 licence, which gives me access to the add ins in the store. &nbsp;the free ones associate with that account or tenant, the paid ones do not. &nbsp;How do I connect them please?</p>
<p>I am trying to buy stuff from you. &nbsp;Telling me that I cant buy apps in the store through my microsoft account when that is what the screen flow provides is not very helpful! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have spoken to Godaddy help and they walked through the issue and said it was with microsoft. &nbsp;I have done the same with ND Mail who were really helpful and showed the same problem occurs when I try to buy another unrelated app like weather, that requires
 payment, and therefore that the issue is with microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps they are both wrong but i am being sent around in circles. &nbsp;I have bought the add in from store, and I would like to use it.</p>
<p>How do I get to live chat help to show the problem and get some proper answers please. &nbsp;everyone who has offered advice here has been trying to help but not actually helped, or asked enough questions or taken the time to understand the issue properly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I complain what other options for real help are there? &nbsp;I am sure I am doing something wrong and will be user error or some foible of my account set up, but I am not IT illiterate and I cannot see other options or how to work around it. &nbsp;I really
 need someone to see what is happening, diagnose it and find a solution. &nbsp;There must be other customers with the same issue. &nbsp;I am sure it must be simple to fix or your store would not be functioning commercially.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Nick</p>

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to let us know what happened. I understand this was a poor experience, and I’m sorry you were impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the summary of the issue</strong><br />
If the tenant is bought directly from Microsoft, the user experience is:<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to the Exchange admin center(EAC)-&gt;Organization-&gt;add-ins list and click “Find more add-ins for Outlook at the Office Store…”<br />
2.&nbsp;Find the add-in to purchase and click “Buy”.<br />
3.&nbsp;Sign in with a Microsoft Account and completes the purchase.<br />
4.&nbsp;The Office Store generates the appropriate add-in license and downloads a token that represents the license to the purchaser’s environment(Exchange Online)<br />
5.&nbsp;The add-in is listed in the add-ins list in the EAC.</p>
<p>Step 4 and 5 are not completed in your tenant which is bought from GoDaddy.</p>
<p><strong>Current Status</strong><br />
We’ve reported the issue to the related team and will contact GoDaddy to move foward. We will keep you in tune once we have any information at hand.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Daizy</p>

            <p>There is an import feature in Outlook, but it won't import directly from the phone.&nbsp; If your phone is an Android, you can use Google Apps Sync (<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gappssync" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gappssync</a>) to get your
 contacts from your Google account and keep Outlook and your phone synchronized.&nbsp; Note that this isn't free.&nbsp; If your phone can export a comma-separated values file or vcard file, you can transfer the phone contacts to Outlook without Google in the middle.</p>
<p>You don't want to make a contact group from your phone contacts.&nbsp; You want them to be real contacts within the Contact folder.&nbsp; Contact groups contain only name/email address pairs and no other info like phone numbers.</p>

            <span>Hi,</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<div>To solve the problem you can uninstall Microsoft .NET framework 4 and install Microsoft .NET framework 2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't want uninstall Microsoft .NET framework 4 you can try to solve your problem by uninstalling two .Net framework 4 entries on the remove all programs pane. One was listed as "Microsoft .NET framework 4 extended" and the other was "Microsoft
 .NET framework 4 profile view" (or something similar).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope it helpful to you!</div>

    <title>AutoComplete for AutoText restored in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles kenyon  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoComplete for AutoText restored in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>I just was delighted to discover that in Word 2013 the tooltips and AutoComplete work with AutoText as they did in Word 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered this when working on an Add-In <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/download.htm#HeaderFooterBuildingBlocks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Supplemental Building Blocks for Headers and Footers</a> . In Word 2013 when I had the template open on the screen and started typing the name of one of the AutoText Entries a tooltip would pop up prompting for Enter. I thought "How cool! That looks familiar!"
 When I checked, I got the same behavior when the template was loaded as an Add-In rather than the active document. A reason that Word 2013 is an improvement over 2010, even though I hate how it looks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1df8f85-bf00-40cd-b2ba-b0e7ebc4855c" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The Add-In has FileName, FileNamePath, and a number of Page Number field variations as AutoText as well as some supplemental headers and footer building blocks that use these fields.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I expect that this is also true with Word 365 but don't have that version. I will test to see if this is also true of AutoText loaded through the Building Blocks folders.</p>

<p>Hi LB636,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The presence of a third party anti-virus can cause your problem. In order to</p>
<p>use Windows Defender as your real-time protection, you must uninstall any</p>
<p>"other" anti-virus that is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">could</span> have been brought on by malware. You should scan your</p>
<p>PC with the ESET Online Scanner. You can find it at&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also scan with MalwareBytes&nbsp; <a href="https://malwareBytes.com/trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://malwareBytes.com/trial/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Together, they should find the malware that you might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After clearing your PC, you should eliminate the "policy" entry in the Registry</p>
<p>that malware sometimes leaves, that disables Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can accomplish this by using Command Prompt (admin). And entering</p>
<p>the following command.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include the spaces and quote marks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reg Delete "HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"</strong></p>
<p>(space)&nbsp;<strong>/v DisableAntispyWare&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>&lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Exit</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Restart your PC and check Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any questions, please respond. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,&nbsp; Glen</p>

<p>About the virus scanners, I've performed them. None showed anything.</p>
<p>I don't have a different anti virus. But if it continues, maybe I will install one that is more stable and reliable...</p>

<p>
</p><p>hi,&nbsp; just getting back..&nbsp; catching up on work,&nbsp; from trying to get some vb's to work..</p>
<p>note:&nbsp; 'Novice' at vb so can use a working example.&nbsp; i have been trying to find the solution thru other eg's online..</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have an example for sorting rows that i use.&nbsp; if i put cursor in a certain column, my unique sort will take place for entire rows, for all cells selected,&nbsp; else a normal sort dialog will pop up.&nbsp; (will leave an example of that at bottom).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>one sort i need (to speed things up from doing repeat 123 sorts of a section/ to get it back to normal),&nbsp; is the need for set a value for x,&nbsp; if a cell in row&nbsp; (eg col:&nbsp; V)&nbsp; is &gt; 1,&nbsp; then variable x should represent a 1,&nbsp; else 2&nbsp; (for sorting purposes).</p>
<p>i am wondering if i have to turn this into a loop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>what i have:&nbsp; (just my attempt,&nbsp; feel free to rip it up),&nbsp; </p>
<p>PROBLEM:&nbsp; don't think you can do an IF statement in an&nbsp; X = </p>
<p>i will use a second key to do the same thing on a different column</p>

            <p>Hi. &nbsp;It's a little hard to see what you are sorting because you are using "Selection"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have both ActiveCell, Selection, B8, EntireColumn, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">RANGE(B8) &nbsp;should most likely be&nbsp;</span>Range("B8")</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">RANGE("B8").OFFSET(, 0).Column &nbsp;is just returning the value 2.</span></p>
<p>Sounds like &nbsp;you wanted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If ActiveCell.Column = 2 Then...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that in the immediate Window, the following returns 2 (the first column)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Range("B5:F10").Select<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Debug.Print Selection.Column<br />
</p>
<p>Returns: &nbsp;2</p>

            <p>short answer:&nbsp; i use dim ranges to id columns eg workcell B5 has:&nbsp; BG:BG&nbsp; in it.</p>
<p>the selection of cells in a spec column will make my desired sort take place, automatically selecting whole lines for just selecting any number of rows by:&nbsp; i select just the cells in that column.&nbsp; it already is working for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>using active cell for column works,&nbsp; for just sorting any selection of rows i make - selected.</p>
<p>i am not in a hurry for this item, it is not critical.&nbsp; piece at a time is ok here&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>having by selection for rows,&nbsp; and a different sort for what column selected&nbsp; (and thereby automated), makes it a very useful tool:&nbsp; 99% of any sorts i ever do is quick &amp; painless.&nbsp; just select 15 rows in 1 column, hit altZ and done,&nbsp; with shortcut this
 workbook:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application.OnKey "%{z}", "altz"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'a-z&nbsp; sort dialog<br />
</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>hi,&nbsp; thanks for reply,&nbsp; i should have included an extra line describing reference convention for cells.</p>
<p>does not show as much, but have included in main example(s) top posts the Dim String / B5 etc = Range..</p>
<p>with the SUBSTITUTE FORMULA at the bottom of the example,&nbsp; eg 'workcell' B5 will reference a column (else a top row, cells etc),&nbsp; eg&nbsp; B5 may show:&nbsp; BG:BG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is just a method to make references dynamic for cutting / moving columns / rows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the top post main / bottom example already works except for new item this post,&nbsp; for eg:</p>
<p>i select eg 5 10 15 rows by just selecting BG100:BG116 &amp; hit my shortcut:&nbsp; AltZ for sort.&nbsp; my work allows some 5 shortcut items to happen automatically:&nbsp; select whole rows for sorting,&nbsp; scroll view to top of view (if i select eg 80 lines),&nbsp; what else..&nbsp;
 just have top cell selected when done, do diff sorts if cells selected are diff columns, offset is ok for 0, still works / needed in other examples where don't have a dimmed ref,&nbsp; and?&nbsp; else: open sort dialog if last choice..</p>
<p>
</p><p>instead of using reference workcells eg:&nbsp; RANGE(B5)&nbsp; can use actual same:&nbsp; RANGE("BG:BG")&nbsp; for:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim B5 As String&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'note:&nbsp; workcell B5 shows eg:&nbsp; BG:BG<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B5 = RANGE("B5")</p>
<p>
</p><p>'=SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(CELL("address",$BG5),"$",""),ROW(),"")&amp;":"&amp;SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(CELL("address",$BG5),"$",""),ROW(),"")</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is not critical,&nbsp; not needed right away for if a level &gt; 1 etc.&nbsp; i just spend 15 secs more resorting remainder back to normal sort / less stress on sheet doing a re-sort.&nbsp; just been going on awhile &amp; this would double the speed of that item, and thought
 i should make an attempt.&nbsp; other critical work i had to spend some 3 8 hour days on recent attempt to fix 2 lines, but was critical for fixing name errors in aline (to may 2 hours in all on this/ am slow at vb :).&nbsp; this is not..&nbsp; critical at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>what i am not sure of now, is if this can be done logically with just an eg:&nbsp; set x =&nbsp;&nbsp; etc&nbsp; for each line,&nbsp; but may have to do a loop / 'for each' line..</p>

                    <p>All my skype received files are saved into default skype folder -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">%appdata%/Skype/My Skype Received Files etc - and I can't change it.</span></p>
<p>- If I choose the option to "ask me every time" where to save the files - nothing happens - saving goes to default skype folder.
</p>
<p>- If I select "save all files to" folder - it still continues saving in the default skype folder.</p>
<p>The issue is happening on both, laptop with win 10, and PC with Win 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix it?</p>

<p>I did full uninstall many times before. The issue did get resolved but soon enough would glitch out again and re-appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I believe I understand whats causing this issue in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I fully re-installed skype, while chatting with my friend, the first time I received a file - a very small pop-up skype window appeared offering to set Auto-Recieve option ON for the future. If you allow it, it will overwrite your settings in terms
 of received files&nbsp;and all other incoming files will go to default skype folder, even if you play around with settings afterward. This pop-up&nbsp;window probably appeared before, but I was typing or trying to click on a smile - it is possible that I accidentally
 clicked ALLOW without even realizing it or clearly seeing that pop-up. This time I was slow and careful, clicked denied and since then the issue never returned yet</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, basically, accidental set up to allow auto-save while in chat create a problem mentioned&nbsp;above, that would not get fixed while changing the settings at the main options screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have the same problem, do full skype re-install, ask your friend to send you a file. Wait for the pop-up screen and decline the offer to enable auto-save. (Note: you can manually turn on auto-save in setting at any time)</p>

<p>I did all this to no avail.</p>
<p>After renaming the Skype folder in \appdata\roaming and restarting Skype I give a new Save path in the IM Settings &gt; Advanced Options tab, but Skype keeps saving every new image that is sent to me in the old \appdata\roaming (that is the default path).</p>
<p>Any other tip?</p>
<p>I am really disappointed.</p>

<p>Ah! I see. This is very annoying. I'm almost sure that when I used Skype 7.41 in Win 7 it allowed me to save whatever file wherever I wanted.<br />

<p>Hi MarcosMolizane,<br />
<br />
I understand that you got NDRs when sending emails. Since there could be different factors related to this issue in different server environment, I’d like to firstly confirm the following information:<br />
1. I noticed that you said ‘I can't send e-mails to all mailboxes migrated to office 365’, could you send emails to other mailboxes directly created in Office 365 or external your Office 365 tenant like a Gmail account?<br />
2. As you mentioned ‘I manage my e-mail server’ and ‘all mailboxes migrated to office 365’, could you let us know the detailed server environment in your organization, pure Office 365 Exchange Online or hybrid environment with on-promise servers?<br />
3. The entire NDR.<br />
To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the entire NDR. Here is the link to access it.<br />

Yang</p>

<p>Dear Yang,</p>
<p>Sorry, I believe not explanneid the scennario with precision.</p>
<p>I manage my own e-mail server xxxxxxx.com.br, and mailboxes from office 365 can send e-mail to it, but mailboxes from xxxxxxx.com.br can´t reply or send e-mail to mailboxes in office 365.</p>
<p>My situation is the same like this post: <a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/148/t/431422?ss-src=related" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
community.office365.com/.../431422</a></p>
<p>[mailboxes from office 365] to [xxxxxxxxxx.com.br]</p>
<p>Can send e-mails</p>
<p>[xxxxxxxxxx.com.br] to [mailboxes from office 365]</p>
<p>Can´t send e-mails with return message of banned (5.7.511)</p>
<p>[xxxxxxxxxx.com.br] to [mailboxes from other services linke gmail, hotmail, yahoo]</p>
<p>Can send e-mails</p>
<p>I don't received your private message yet, to send the NDR.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi MarcosMolizane,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information. <br />
I have sent a private message to you again. Please check via the link above to see if you have received it.
<br />
Then the NDR only occurred when sending emails from your own server to Office 365, I would suggest you forward this message to the
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** email address as said in the NDR.<br />
<br />

<p>Dear Yang,</p>
<p>This was my first try...and the response of delist is the same (?).</p>
<p>This is the mail system at host xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com.br.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to have to inform you that your message could not</p>
<p>be delivered to one or more recipients. It's attached below.</p>
<p>For further assistance, please send mail to postmaster.</p>
<p>If you do so, please include this problem report. You can</p>
<p>delete your own text from the attached returned message.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The mail system</p>

<p>What is the reason of a existence of this email (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) if it in the same rules of banishment?</p>
<p>Looks like a joke to me...</p>
<p>I answer your private message with the NDR and access data to a temporary e-mail, created to you test the real scenario, with a e-mail sent from a Office 365 account, the banishment message from reply it and the return from a forward to delist email.</p>

<p>Hi Marcos,</p>
<p>Thanks for the private message.</p>
<p>Since the issue occurs when your mail server's IP address is blocked by the EOP (Exchange Online Protection) services, to request remove it, you can use another mailbox like Office 365 mailbox or Outlook.com to send out the delist request to the delist email
 address with the bounced back messages attached. Note the delist process may take a few days once you receive the confirmation email from the delist system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if it still doesn't work, we will need to collect the tenant information of your Office 365 so that we can open a support ticket for you to our relevant team. Your understanding is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot load Microsoft Teams</h2>
                    <p>I am part of the company's MS Teams and up to recently I am able to access the Team Rooms that I have access to. Since October 4th, I seem to have trouble accessing these Team Rooms and the messages that showed on the screen are
</p>
<p>1. "Microsoft.com is not responding due to a long running script" and I was prompted to "stop script"&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. After clicking "stop script" it doesn't works and&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Another message came on "Microsoft.com is not responding" and I was prompted to "recover webpage"</p>
<p>4. After clicking "recover webpage" it still doesn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been facing this challenge for the past 2 days and really at my wits as to what to do; The office administrator can only attend to me next Monday (2 days away) and I thought if I can solve this myself, I will do it.</p>

<p>Hi Jeffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Microsoft Teams Room, would you please provide a more detailed description about this feature? According to your description, I assume that you can’t access Teams from October 4<sup>th</sup>. If issue
 occurs on Teams Web Version, please kindly try the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Temporarily sign-out Office 365 service from all browser then clear the cookies and caches of browsers.</p>
<p>2. Change a different browser, like re-login Teams via IE 11.0, Edge, or Chrome inPrivate mode.
</p>
<p>3. Change another network.</p>
<p>4. Check Operation System updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if issue continues, please provide the full screenshots of errors you encountered to us for troubleshooting, and confirm whether other user in your organization experiencing the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h2>            Lumia 920 Screen will no longer rotate.</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my Lumia 920 for about a month now - it is a German Vodafone model. As of today while I was out at work I went to use it to send a text and they keyboard would no longer change orientation when I flipped the phone sideways. Nothing would rotate
 anymore, photos, web pages; its as if the rotation setting is not working. I looked to find one but I can't. I've heard a few issues on various forums like WPcentral about this and that it might be a software bug, and a search of this forum has another user
 whose rotation doesn't work, but I don't know why this would have just started, and I've tried hard resets and soft resets and nothing seems to fix it.<br />
<br />
I would really like some information about this or a possible fix, as this is really killing the useability of the phone - that along with the random restarts which happen several times a day on average.</p>

            you should have it checked out at your local Nokia care point. Use the link below to locate your local care point.<br />

<p>I re-flashed the phone's firmware with my carrier's firmware, brought it back from the brick. All I had to do was give the phone several decently hard taps and the orientation started working, so I'm assuming that something was stuck. I'm still no thrilled
 with the fact that this happens in a premium smartphone, but all is well again. Also, there seems to be a LARGE amount of people having their phones brick with the built in reset option. What gives?</p>

            I hope now your phone's screen rotate should be working fine otherwise it is hardware problem for sure.

<p>Wondering the same. I have seen this issue posted here and on Windows Phone Centrals website. It appear to be a recent issue.&nbsp;On December 24th&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 8 installed the latest update&nbsp;"Portico" on my Lumia.&nbsp;On December 26th my phone used wireless charging
 for the&nbsp;first time&nbsp;via the JBL PowerUp.&nbsp;Those are the only relevant changes I can think of that may have caused my screen orientation&nbsp;to stop working on December 28th. I did notice my Lumia was&nbsp;hotter than&nbsp;normal when using the wireless charging. This&nbsp;is probably
 expected due to the copper coil needed for the wireless charging. That said, I don't believe the phone should have gotten as hot as it did. I am wondering if&nbsp;somehow the gyroscope got fused. Orientation&nbsp;no longer works&nbsp;at all&nbsp;and&nbsp;has been confirmed on IE browser,&nbsp;Email,
 Text, Picture taking, Picture viewing, Google app and Facebook app. In an attempt to fix this I reset the phone which Nokia told me to do. After I clicked reset the phone rebooted showing gears turning. After 2 hours the gear where still turning. A volume
 down power button reboot of the device was performed 6 times before the phone came back up. Once&nbsp;the phone&nbsp;came back up I chose not to restore the phone with the backed up settings. The phone was completely wiped and no old data was used. The problem still
 exists. At this point I am really hoping this is not&nbsp; a hardware problem.&nbsp;If&nbsp;anyone knows how to fix this problem please advise as this is a big issue for me and I would assume a lot of other users as well if it happens to them. I really like this phone and
 believe it is the best phone on the market. If this issue is in fact a hardware issue this could cause big problems for Nokia. I hope to resolve this soon otherwise I will have to return the phone and JBL PowerUp which is a very impressive audio piece.</p>
<p>FYI - I have had the phone since it was available in November without any issues up until December 28th..</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
N.</p>

            Sounds like you will need to return the device back to your point of purchase for a replacement, I am sorry to hear the problems you are experiencing mate. Glad to hear that the PowerUp is a great device though, pity it is not yet widely available in other
 parts of the world as of yet.

<p>I do believe it is surely a hardware issue with the phone. I love the phone, but I have also experienced both issues you have mentioned.</p>
<p>A, While I was making a video chat with friends, the phone was literally burning hot on the top right hand corner, that is after I started using the wireless charging pad.</p>
<p>B, Screen rotation stopped working at some point after using the charging pad. It has been a month since, however, it started to work again just now......I have no Idea how this have happened........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my phone, you can feel there is something loose inside when shaking the phone, with no previous impact at all....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have to say I am a little disappointed with Nokia this time</p>
