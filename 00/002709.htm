<h2>            MS Project task will not let me show less than 100&#37; complete</h2>
                    I have a project plan that came from a template (i.e., I did not create it).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are certain tasks that Project will not allow me to show 100% complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if I want to show that the build work is 50% complete, it will not allow me to
 do so.&nbsp; I am forced to show either 0% or 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've looked at the task and cannot figure out what is driving this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really irritating, because I cannot accurately reflect progress.

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Please see my responses below:</p>
<p>Have you fully updated Project with latest updates?&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> That is done automatically through my company.&nbsp; I assume so, but cannot state that I am entirely current, to a certainty.</em></p>
<p>What version is it?&nbsp; <em>Project 2013 (15.0.4693.1000)</em></p>
<p>Is the task a milestone?&nbsp; <em>No</em></p>
<p>Is the Task manually scheduled? (use Auto only)&nbsp; <em>No - it is Auto</em></p>
<p>Is there a VBA macro in the project that might be forcing this behavior?&nbsp;<em> I've not created any.&nbsp; However, since it is a template, I'm not sure how I would know this, except that I do not get any notice that it is using or updating macros when I launch.&nbsp;
 My guess is that there are not.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would note that there are other tasks in this plan that do allow me to show partial completion.&nbsp; I have not been able to discern any difference in the tasks.</p>
<p>I appreciate any input you can provide.</p>

            <p>Try this. Set a status date (project, project information) which is later than the scheduled finish of the task. Display the status date on the Gantt chart as a vertical red line (format gridlines). Confirm that the right hand end of the bar is earlier than
 the vertical red line. Click on task, mark on track. What happens? It should go immediately to 100%.</p>
<p>What happens if you edit the % complete to 50%?</p>
<p>What is the duration of the task?</p>
<p>Starting with % complete = 0, go to the tracking table.</p>
<p>Everything is blank or NA, except remaining duration.</p>
<p>Input actual duration = half of the remaining duration.</p>
<p>What happens to % complete? It should go to 50% immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, tracking progress with % complete is not recommended.</p>

I am having the exact same problem. Ironically, all of my Outlook.com calendars show up fine on my Amazon Kindle Fire HDX. I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 running Marshmallow. This problem hasn't been solved, and the first post was almost three years ago.</p>

    <title>Cell border color and thickness&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pmpresenter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cell border color and thickness&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Excel / Windows 10 / Office 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working with a table someone else set up, and I am trying to figure out the color and width/thickness of some borders around certain cells so I can apply them to other cells. In this case, there are different borders applied to different walls of the
 cell. So for instance, the top border could be a thick dotted yellow line, the bottom a thin grey line, and one of the sides a thin dotted red line. This is an extreme example but it helps illustrate my case. If I click on the cell and right click Format Cells
 &gt; Border, there is no way to determine individually what style and color each side is set to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this has FOREVER been a huge problem in PowerPoint when working with tables. A workaround that sometimes (not always) works is to copy/paste the table into Word, and inspect the table there, since Word has a more robust and user-friendly formatting
 set-up for tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying that now with an Excel table and it doesn't seem to work no matter how I paste the table into Word (Keep Source Formatting, Link to Excel or not). The style doesn't copy over accurately. Dotted lines become solid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to select a cell in Excel and determine the color and thickness of a border line?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't work in Excel very often so maybe I'm going about it all wrong - maybe there aren't even thickness options for borders except for the pre-sets (i.e. dotted, double line, single line etc.)?<br />

            Hi Pmpresenter,
<br /> 
<br />My name is Alex. I am an - Independent Consultant.
<br />It is an honor to respond to your participation in the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />Right click on the cell &gt; Format Cell &gt; Border tab : there you can see the border options.
<br />
<br />To set a new border select the line style, color and click in the square to mark the new line style or select a presets.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this does not work or if you've tried this already. 
<br />
<br />Best regards, Alex

            Hi Pmpresenter1, 
<br />
<br />I am sorry you face such problems. 
<br />There might be several reasons for that. 
<br />The table was created in either different version of Office or on the other platform. That's why Office might not be able to recognize formatting. 
<br />In order to solve it I recommend using Format Painter to copy and paste formatting into other tables. If it doesn't work, you might check the source code in Visual Studio, to find out the color, thickness and border type. 
<br />
<br />I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Have a great day!

<p>Thank you Alex but I already understand how to set a border style and color using the right click &gt; format cell &gt; border. That isn't the problem. If ALL the borders are the same, then selecting the cell and choosing that border tab will show me the style
 and the color and i can select the color drop down menu and see exactly what the RGB is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if a cell has DIFFERENT border styles/colors assigned to the 4 four borders Left Right Top Bottom, and you select that cell, there is no way to see in the settings exactly which style and color each border is using. format cell &gt; border will only
 show the style and color of ONE of them. There doesn't seem to be a way to see exactly which styles and colors are assigned to each border of that one cell. This is a huge drawback in Excel.</p>

<p>Dmitriy the tables weren't created in different versions. Is there really no way to see exactly which color and style is applied to each border of the cell? It works if its the same on all borders, but not if the borders in a given cell are different. You'll
 see one of them in styles and color and can drop down to see the RGB, but only one. The other three, there is no way to see the settings and find the style and RGB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you open up Visual Studio to check the source code? Thank you</p>

    <title>High contrast themes for all apps in WM6.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bulaggabi  say:</h3>
<h2>            High contrast themes for all apps in WM6.1</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am visually impaired (Retinitis Pigmentosa) and require the ability invert the fg/bg colors so background is black foreground is white.&nbsp; I have recently purchased an lg incite phone that runs with WM6.1.&nbsp; Unfortunately none of the standard apps such as mobile
 word, calendar, mobile spreadsheet, contacts etc seem to allow for this change.&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating to me and I was wondering if anybody knows of a way to do this.&nbsp; I don't care if it is a 3rd party app or some type of hack.&nbsp; I know in the past
 I have used cetuner and other 3rd party apps to do this, though it still wasn't always that good.&nbsp; Sometimes font was white on a white background etc.&nbsp; I WISH that Microsoft was a bit more section 508 compliant and sympathetic to the millions of us that do
 have visual disabilities and allowed for the customization to do this natively.&nbsp; If there is and I'm just not aware of it, I will be happy to admit defeat and enjoy my phone.&nbsp; If anybody out there is aware of a way to do this natively, please respond.&nbsp; Also
 if you are aware of a 3rd party app that allows you to do this well, please let me know.&nbsp; Maybe even a full screen magnifier that allows you to invert colors as well.&nbsp; Anyway, I am extremely frustrated and was hoping for some help.<br />
<br />
TIA!<br />

            Ok, just in case somebody else needs this.&nbsp; Somebody in another forum pointed me to http://www.freewarepocketpc.net/ppc-download-ui-tweaker-v0-5-3.html&nbsp; This appears to be completely free and works great.&nbsp; It allows
 you to change system colors as well as the today screen and more.&nbsp; Doesn't seem to effectively change the background color for ALL apps, but it's a lot better than what Windows Mobile did out of the box, which is a pity.&nbsp; More effort needs to be made to make
 devices more user friendly for those MILLIONS of us that have some type of disability.<br />

<p>No that is not what I said.</p>
<p>If someone has the right software setup they can send out emails the look like they come from someone else. Your email address, my email address, anyone's. That's spoofing.
</p>
<p>As you can't track down who is using your email address you can't stop it. All you can do is to continue moving the spam into your Junk folder. With time the spoofer will quit using your email address and move on to someone else's.</p>

<p>If you get tons of junk mail through your post office do you just pack up and move every time?</p>
<p>At least spam is electronic and you can delete it.</p>
<p>I've had several of my e-mail addresses for almost 20 years and I've seen tons of spam in that time. It takes me a couple minutes a day to go through it in my mailboxes and I'm done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it's completely up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>change default text highlight color tool in Word 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgt  say:</h3>
<h2>            change default text highlight color tool in Word 2013</h2>
                    In word 2013 I can select some text and in the ribbon (Home &gt; Font) click on the tool to highlight the text. The color defaults to yellow. I know that I can click on the dropdown for the tool and select another color and this is OK but not what I want.
 I want to set the default yellow to one of the available colors thus when I edit any document, select some text and click on the text highlight tool I want it to highlight using my desired color not the yellow without me selecting a color from the dropdown.
 Is this possible?

            <p>Since my previous response, I had shut down the Surface Pro on which I have Office 2013 installed and I have not just restarted it and taken the following screen shot which shows the Highlighting Colour still set as Pink which is the colour that I had selected
 when performing my original test to see if the selection was retained by closing Word and then restarting it.</p>

</p><p>If you want to use a macro to apply shading to the selected text, the only command that you need is</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selection.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = wdColorLightBlue</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Selection.Shading.BackgroundPatternColor = RGB(0,112,192) which is the same colour as wdColorLightBlue.</p>

</p><p>When you click on the More Colors...button in the shading colors dropdown, you will see:</p>

            When you block the domain, do they end up in the Junk folder? If they do then it is working as Microsoft designed it. Blocking does not mean that the emails will not enter your mailbox.

<p>Yes the emails are going to my junk mail folder. However this is not what I am after. I do not want them to come into my mailbox at all. The link you provided asks about sender information, which I do not have since I am not the sender of the emails I want
 to block.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its really simple. In the outlook.com settings it allows me to "Block" domains. If Outlook.com still allows them in my mailbox it is misleading and a stupid design. I should have control to be able to block a domains delivery to my mailbox period!</p>

<p>That's not how Microsoft has designed it. A "blocked" message will still go to your Junk folder. If you want to make a suggestion to the developers to change it you should go to

<p>Hi ChasWorth</p>
<p>Thanks for inquiry again,<br />
I see some of the Very Important info I wrote about, &nbsp;"how to Report Junk Mail" was removed".

</p><p>There is a "Link" about this, I do&nbsp;have the Link Some place.</p>
<p>If my BETA Inbox was not so Messed Up, I could find the Email Link and Post it Here.
</p>
<p>I have been reporting/sending Junk/Spam emails to Microsoft for over 3 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Guess is You have BETA Outlook.com mail and were Moved over from the previous Outlook.com

<p>Or Did The "Try BETA" and got Stuck with BETA Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the Outlook that was from Hotmail or the previous Outlook.</p>
<p>The Same applies as I wrote&nbsp; May 26, 2018 about Blocking Junk/Spam emails and it really Does not Do Much Good as I wrote and You have Experienced.</p>

            If this is why Microsoft designed it, why is it that when I "block" an email that says it's from my own email, it blocks it completely? I can email myself something which I do frequently and I will watch it go directly to trash.&nbsp; So this is a programming
 issue clearly. This is very frustrating for people who don't want certain emails at all in their mailbox.&nbsp; I have went as far as looking at the message source, blocking the IP and domain and that still doesn't work.&nbsp;

            I don't even bother trying to use Blocks, Rules, Safe Senders, etc. as they rarely work correctly. Just letting the system take care of my incoming email has about a 95% success rate of classifying it correctly. You might try the same for a few weeks and
 see if it works better.<br />

            If the characters are available in the font you're using, you can probably use ALT + the character's number. &nbsp;For example ALT + 0033 is !

 all online material is for Office365. I am also aware that I could write a powershell logon script to perform a silent install unfortunately UAC stops me there too as my users to no have Admin access. any help or insights would be welcome, thank you&nbsp;

            Unfortunately, the only approved method for deploying office via a GPO is a or startup script. Although there are MSIs in the media linking one to a GPO is not recommend as each msi only contains a small part of the whole program.<br /> I would first recommend moving the script from login to start-up, this way it should run in the system context and Ensure "Domain computers" have access to the share with the installation files.<br /><br />If that doesn't work, annother opinion is to try rewriting the script to create or import a scheduled taks that runs the I installer either  with an active directory account that has admin rights on all your target PCs.

            So when you ended the partnership and lost all your Contact info, had you already sync'd with MyPhone?&nbsp; If yes, then you can get your contact info back.&nbsp; If NO, then you may be out of luck.<br />

This part of your question worries me.&nbsp; It appears that you may not have sync'd with MyPhone BEFORE you lost your contact info ... is that correct?<br />
<br />
BTW, you can download or install Microsoft My Phone from <a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Office 2016 for Mac bug with UTC time. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samurainigel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 for Mac bug with UTC time.</h2>
                    <p>I've tested this on multiple devices and there appears to be a bug in Microsoft Office 2016 for Mac, specifically Outlook. On Outlook version 15.37, when I send a meeting request, the body of the meeting invite going to another employee starts with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When: Monday, November 6, 2017 12:30 PM-1:00 PM. (UTC-07:00) Mountain Time (US &amp; Canada)<br />
Where: testing<br />
<br />
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to version 15.39, this behavior changes to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When: Monday, November 6, 2017 8:30 PM-9:00 PM. UTC<br />
Where: test<br />
<br />
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the change to the time zone. No other settings on the device have occurred, and double-checking that the time zone in both System Preferences and in Outlook are still set to Mountain time shows that this is the case. For some reason, Outlook version
 15.39 is not respecting this time zone setting, and is instead displaying the body text in UTC. The meeting still appears correctly on my calendar, and on the calendar of invitees, but this body text can lead to confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know where else to submit this, so I thought that this might be an appropriate channel. Others in my organization can reproduce this problem. Can anyone else out there confirm this is an issue?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Calendar Meeting Requests changes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my Outlook 2013 Calendar<br />
<br />
If I set up a meeting and send it to all concerned, it places the meeting in their respective calendars as it should, but if I need to update or cancel said meeting, it updates or removes it from my calendar. But on the recipient side, it keeps the original
 meeting date as it was and also adds it to the updated date and if deleted.</p>
<p>If they click on <strong>Remove from Calendar</strong>, it does not remove the entry from their calendars. They have to physically go in and remove the old entry</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who are receiving the calendar requests are using either Outlook 2010/2013</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> using Exchange for our mail solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could someone assist</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Multiple users that get calendar requests from me are experiencing this, it only happens with entries that I send out.</p>
<p>Other calendar requests that they get from other people work fine, even if there are updates made or if the meeting is cancelled.</p>
<p>

<h2>            IF THEN ELSE Function in Mail Merge Doesn&#39;t Give The Option of &#60;Field Name&#62; CONTAINS</h2>
                    <p>In the IF THEN ELSE mail merge function in Word 2013, I am not seeing an option to select Field Name CONTAINS a particular word or string of characters.&nbsp; The only options in the drop down menu are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Field Name Equal To</p>
<p>Field Name Not Equal To</p>
<p>Field Name Less Than</p>
<p>Field Name Greater Than</p>
<p>Field Name Less Than or Equal</p>
<p>Field Name Great Than or Equal</p>
<p>Field Name is Blank</p>
<p>Field Name is Not Blank</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is no option that says Field Name CONTAINS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I want a certain word to be inserted into my document if the Field CONTAINS the expression "Haiti" anywhere in the Field. How do I get it to do that given that CONTAINS is not one of the drop down options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The reason you don't see a 'contains' option is because Word has no such field. That said, there are limited ways for testing whether a field contains something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example a field coded as:<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD MyField}= "MyText*" "True" "False"}<br />
or:<br />
{IF«MyField»= "MyText*" "True" "False"}<br />
tests whether the results of the MERGEFIELD named MyField starts with 'MyText'<br />
Similarly, a field coded as:<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD MyField}= "*MyText" "True" "False"}<br />
or:<br />
{IF«MyField»= "*MyText" "True" "False"}<br />
tests whether the results of the MERGEFIELD named MyField ends with 'MyText'</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also test whether the text you're interested in exists a pre-defined number of characters from the start or end. Thus, a field coded as:<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD MyField}= "???MyText*" "True" "False"}<br />
or:<br />
{IF«MyField»= "???MyText*" "True" "False"}<br />
tests whether the results of the MERGEFIELD named MyField contains any three characters followed by 'MyText'<br />
Similarly, a field coded as:<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD MyField}= "*MyText???" "True" "False"}<br />
or:<br />
{IF«MyField»= "*MyText???" "True" "False"}<br />
tests whether the results of the MERGEFIELD named MyField ends with any three characters after 'MyText'</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practicable to add them via any
 of the standard Word dialogues. Likewise, you can't type or copy &amp; paste the chevrons (i.e. '« »') - they're part of the actual mergefields, which you can insert from the mailmerge toolbar. The spaces represented in the field construction are all required.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Office 2013 issue with fixing hyperlinks problems.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have searched and read answers to the problem I have with hyperlinks in windows 10, office 2013 excel, and Microsoft Outlook. The problem is regarding the error message "your organisations' policies are preventing us from completing this action for
 you ............' I have tried the following&nbsp;suggestions:</p>
<p>- easy fix,, but get the message saying that it does not apply to&nbsp;the version of my application.</p>
<p>- change htm. and html. in regedit but unable to do so. </p>
<p>- reset the default settings in Microsoft Edge, but it appears that it is for Windows Explorer 11. I cannot see</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tools in the Microsft Edge advance settings.</p>
<p>- have even getting into 'regedit' directly to change the lines for htm, </p>
<p>I have read that some users&nbsp;posted that they have the same problem after uninstalling 'Firefox'. I did this as I do not want to have too many browsers. I mainly use Chrome.&nbsp; In trying to solve the problem I have use Microsft Edge as my default browser but
 all the above suggestions I have tried still don't work. </p>
<p>As with the Office 2013 - Microsft Word, the link within a single document seems to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help.</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for the fast response. I have tried the suggestions you outlined before, &nbsp;but they have not worked. Luckily by chance I had another problem when I tried to convert a pdf file to a word document. The conversion did work but it messed up some
 settings. All the pdf files I have on my desktop suddenly turned into'word' format. I could not convert them back to the pdf format. It also messed up my scanner settings. When I scanned a document on my HP 7520 printer and the scanning completed I was not
 able to save the scanned document as pdf because the scanner application cannot find the application for the file type. I assumed this is the pdf application.</p>
<p>Then when I tried opening another of the pdf files (now laballed as word, as stated above) I was asked to choose an application to open it. I can't remember what I chose clicked and was asked if I was directed to making Firefox as my default browser. I did
 but instead of opening with Firefox it opened with Microsoft Edge. I somehow went into the settings in Microsoft Edge and manage to get into the Reset Default Applications (tried to get to this before but could not). On the list I ticked the boxes for all
 the applications I want as defaults. After this all the pdf files I had converted to Word format automatically reverted back to their orignal pdf state. As if by magic the hyperlinks links on my Outlook 2013 worked again. I tired the hyperlinks on my Excel
 workbook and they also worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I just wonder if the problem arose after I uninstalled Firefox as I did not want to have to many search engines on my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't explain clearly why or what changes took place that removed the problem. Perhaps some one more technical can enlighten us.</p>
<p>In any case I'd like to thank Jomel_Santos for your trying to help and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this may be useful to someone else who may have a similar problem, and the experts explanations may simplify actions and steps for other users benefits.</p>

<h3> nigelfstevens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word attachments won&#39;t open from Outlook - Windows 10.</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, I cannot open Word attachments from Outlook 2010.<br />
Word tries to open in protected mode, but fails.<br />
If I save the file to hard drive, I still can't open it.<br />
On trying to open a new blank Word document, it then says that the previous use went seriously wrong so would I like to use safe mode.<br />
I never had this problem before Windows 10 (used to be Windows 7).<br />
Any suggestions very welcome - thanks!

            <p>Thanks Maxwell, afraid not. </p>
<p>Is it relevant that I also get a message on starting Outlook about missing identity, to which the supposed cure is a registry edit? it was all fine before the upgrade to Windows 10.
<br />
I'm wondering whether to try to reinstall outlook, if that is still possible. I have a product key somewhere, but the product itself was pre-installed.</p>
<p>All suggestions very welcome.</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Nigel</p>

            Is there any timing when this will be fixed its quit annoying that a attachment in office outlook 2013 ( office365) has this kind of issues. Your suggestion helps but is not practical ... I downgraded for now again to windows 7&nbsp;

The workaround in Trust Center doesn't work, but the Unblock button does, so we're in business.</p>
<p>I really appreciate knowing that it's a genuine issue which Microsoft is working on and will be resolved in due course.<br />

            <p>Doug - Thank you. This was really helpful. The error message I was getting was not intuitive or very useful. - "Word experienced an error trying to open the file." "Check file permissions, etc. etc. ".<br />
This was on files that I had previously opened from Outlook just fine prior to the Windows 10 upgrade, and when I re-downloaded them they wouldn't open. The remediation of right-clicking on properties and clicking Unblock worked like a charm every time. I was
 starting to chase it down through the registry and other routes and this saved me a lot of time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they could just update the help message with this remediation method, that would be a huge help I think....</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has the issue been resolved with sending and receiving emails after creating a new profile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Switch to your old Outlook profile and copy the settings for fax and setup the same on the new profile and check how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>No, never applied FAX at outlook 2010 or 2013 before though, add the fax.account at the photo time when , unlooked-after&nbsp; as creating the outlook account. Keep a month then the error provoked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to by fax , wanted to make out ,&nbsp; while, have as&nbsp; yet...&nbsp; where to make sure if the unused fax.account resulted the photo error&nbsp; Oversize&nbsp; ?</p>
