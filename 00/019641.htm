<h2>            Power off after disconneting from charger</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>lately I am experiencing the following issue with my Band 1. I plug-in the band to charge. When I disconnect the Band and put it on my wrist after a few seconds the band vibrates and powers off. I can immediately press the power-button again and it starts,
 after a few seconds, but it is still quite strange that it powers off at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This only occurs so far when I disconnect it from the charger (and also in this case not all the time). Are there any logs that can be read why this is happening? I have already reset and synchronized the device once to make sure there are no issues with
 the version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Build Version: 10.3.3304.0 09 R</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Holger.</p>

            <p>There is only one simple answer for you, and you won't like it</p>
<p>There is no way to upgrade a Lumia 630 to Windows 10 mobile. The Lumia 630 is among the phones that are not supported by Microsoft for upgrading to Windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>That just means no Windows 10 mobile for a 630 </p>

<p>Hi Dalrcook,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the whole process, I recommend you back up all the data for avoiding the data loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Teams data, as far as I know, it should be kept in SharePoint. So, what you need is to know how to back up SharePoint data. Definitely, you may also nned to know how to back up other data. It depends on your real situation. For more information, you
 can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-data-before-switching-O365-for-business-plans-a1da52c9-2167-4973-9e6d-492314a79b87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-data-before-switching-O365-for-business-plans-a1da52c9-2167-4973-9e6d-492314a79b87</a>.</p>

                    Hello.
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having problems updating Office 2011 in an updated Mac OS X v10.10.5 (Yosemite) machine (15" MacBook Pro Retina; early 2013)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft (MS) AutoUpdate says installing Office 2014 14.5.9 Update failed with "An unexpected error occurred.</p>
<p>These applications were not updated:</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel</p>
<p>Microsoft Word</p>
<p>Microsoft Powerpoint"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problems updating MS AutoUpdate and Office 2016 (I have both Office versions installed (/Applications/Offce 2011 and /Applications/Office 2016; never had problems in the past before today). Office 2011's show these versions for its apps that failed:
 14.5.8 (151023). I manually downloaded https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/3/B/43B9AC64-FC80-414F-ABB8-8876339C828A/Office2011-1459Update_EN-US.dmg and ran it and got denied:</p>

<h2>            wireless sync zune with windows phone 7.5 and Windows 8</h2>
                    Hello:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I currently have a lumia 710, that up to&nbsp;December&nbsp;the 24th the wireless sync was working perfectly with the&nbsp;Zune&nbsp;software. I&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;cancelled the sync relationship with the phone from Zune. I have been trying to configure it again and now I keep
 receiving this error message "C00D07C9". I have tried uninstalling and&nbsp;re-installing the Zune software, but no luck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The phone is connected to my home network, and it reflected on Zune software. &nbsp;After clicking next this appears " Can't detect your phone. Zune was unable to connect to the wireless network access point." And the error code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not understand it has been working since I got the phone. As soon as I realized that I had removed the phone I&nbsp;immediately tried to re install. I have been&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;this error ever since.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to establish the wireless sync again. It is a very good feature which is, unfortunately, not available on Windows Phone 8.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Current OS Windows 8 pro, upgraded from Windows 7&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lumia OS version 7.5.</div>
<div>Zune software version 4.8.2345</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            FIXED!
<div><br />
<div>I had the same problem for days. Nothing I did worked. I kept on getting the dreaded C00D07C9 error. I tried everything on every post and forum - nothing worked. Some posters even said it was an unfixable bug that would only work after a firmware update.
 I almost gave up. Until... I did this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure how or why this worked, but it did. Some of the steps might be unnecessary but I'm providing everything I did, just in case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Via the Zune software, gave my phone a new name with no spaces as per Microsoft's advice:&nbsp;http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/wireless-sync#method4 NOTE: I tried everything else on this page but it didn't work. And, the bit that says to go into
 advanced options in the Zune wireless sync settings doesn't work. 'Advanced Options' simply isn't there.</div>
<div>2. Closed Zune Software on desktop PC</div>
<div>3. Detached and turned off Lumia 800 phone</div>
<div>4. Re-started phone</div>
<div>5. Entered &gt;Settings &gt;Internet Sharing and set that function up, following the phones instructions. Note: this also turns off WiFi connection on your phone</div>
<div>6. Exited setting</div>
<div>7. Went back to settings and disabled Internet Sharing</div>
<div>8. Went into settings on phone and checked phone had re-connected to my home WiFi (It had, but just manually re-connect if yours hasn't; making sure you have followed step 7. above and disabled Internet Sharing)</div>
<div>9. Attached phone to PC with USB in the usual way</div>
<div>10. When Zune software had booted, I re-tried wireless sync setup and... Success! It took less than a second to find and link the phone</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I say, I have no idea why this should have worked, but it did, after days of trying everything else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's worth nothing, however, that you need to have your phone plugged into the mains charger to sync (wtf Microsoft/Nokia - not really wireless then... is it?) and, for the first sync, the phone has to have been charging for at least 15 minutes without
 being switched on or used. You'll know when it's ready as Windows pops up a bubble alert in the system tray/taskbar to say it has installed new hardware and Zune software will display a black, active icon for your phone in the bottom left-hand corner of the
 screen, instead of the white, inactive icon. Only God and MS/Nokia know why. I have never encountered anything so ludicrous. I have never had any problems attaching any Phone or MP3 player to any edition of Windows. Attaching a Windows phone to a Windows PC
 running Windows Zune software should have been easy... Shouldn't it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this works for some other peeps, I'm sorry if it doesn't. Good luck.</div>

            <p>I had my phone connected to the PC, started the Internet Sharing&nbsp;on phone and exited back to home screen.&nbsp; Went back into Internet Sharing and turned it back off and the enabled Wireless again.&nbsp; Went into Zune (already running) and did the wireless setup
 and as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/af68dac8-9448-4ba6-932b-cc1219012d81">
richard127wl</a>&nbsp;said, it worked within second.&nbsp; Cheers for the advice :-)</p>

            Wow thanks! &nbsp;This is the only fix that worked after reading like 10 threads. &nbsp;I would only add to your list that Step 5 didn't turn off the Wifi on my phone, and it didn't work. &nbsp;But I realized this and tried it again, manually turning off Wifi first,
 then enabling internet sharing, turning it off, and then Wifi back on. &nbsp;I did this all with the phone still plugged in and the Zune software running.
<div><br />
<div>Seems that wireless and wired networking is still as buggy and difficult as ever with windows/microsoft...otherwise everything seems to be working smoothly.</div>

            Glad it's helped you guys. Although, after using it for a couple of days now, I'm wondering if it's worth it... It's so buggy. I find if my phone is wirelessly connected and correctly showing in Zune software, if I ad an album, Zune knocks the phone out
 of sync and I then have to find where it's plugged in and unplug and re-connect it again. There are all sorts of other minor niggles. It seems like a work in progress that MS couldn't be bothered sorting out.
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, glad this weird solution has worked for some people.</div>

<p>I love the interface with Zune. I use the my old&nbsp; WP7.5 mostly because of the ability to add podcasts not in windows store. Something I can't do on my wp8 lumia. Microsoft can be so frustrating....Windows Phone 8 is a great device except for.......anyway....</p>
<p>All this started when I upgraded from windows 7 to 8. I wonder if anyone is having the same trouble with W7? I am almost considering going back to Windows 7 just to check.

<p>I wish I could connect my wp8 Lumina to the Zune software......</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 - Feed From option does not change printed area of envelope.</h2>
                    After installing Word 2010 the Feed Method for my printer is no longer dectected correctly. Changing the Feed Method options results in no change in the printing of the envelope. The delivery address is printed top center on the envelope and the return
 address is completely off the envelope. The envelope is in the tray correctly and I have tried setting different feed method options but when the envelope is printed nothing has changed. I am running Windows 7,&nbsp;Office 2010, and the printer is an HP Photosmart
 C6180. I never had this problem til installing Office 2010. I would appreciate any ideas on the problem.

You probably need to update the driver for the printer to use it with Office 2010.</p>

<h2>            Reply-to address setting not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;i set the following:</p>
<p>More mail settings-&gt;Reply-to address(Writing email section). I checked "Other address" and fill in correct address which I want is the one used when receiver of my email hit reply. But it is not working. I also checked the header of received email and in
 the Reply-to line is still the original outlook.com address not the changed one in the Reply-to setting. So I understand that problem is not on the receiver side, because header of email is not changed according my outlook.com settings.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I should set for proper reply-to functionality.</p>
<p>Regards </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i didnt mention quite important thing about it (my bad sorry for that). For testing purposes i didnt use web enviroment of sending the email but desktop Outlook 2013. So i realized then maybe the reply-to address setting is local (i mean local for outlook.com
 and local desktop email manager). So i tried send message directly via web outlook.com and it works like charm. Reply-to address is correctly set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i dig deeper(because i use desktop outlook for 99 percent of my email communication) and found that also same setting can be set in desktop version of outlook. I set it for my account, but emails sent from my desktop outlook still has initial reply-to
 address, not the changed one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now i have two questions:</p>
<p>1) Is there somewhere global setting that all emails sent via my live account will have reply-to address accordng to this setting. (This is the best solution because i want this reply-to address for my desktop outlook, web outlook.com and also for my WP7
 smartphone)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) If the&nbsp;first question is not possible and reply address is local setting which depends on software which initiate&nbsp; sending of message, where i can set this setting for outlook 2013. I found following threads which&nbsp;mention my problem but there is no answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installation of office on embedded machine</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Team,<br />
<br />
Can I install MS office&nbsp;on my embedded OS windows 7 (Thinclient) to use it locally?&nbsp;(Not on RDP server).‚Äù
<br />
<br />
My basic query is can I install office on embedded windows 7 machine. Locally means only that particular user will be using that office.
<br />
<br />
I know that for thin client office needs to be installed on RDP but as I do not want office to be used by all those gets connected to the RDP. Please suggest.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Arathi Nair</p>

<p>Hi Arathi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Embedded Windows 7 isn't listed in the system requirements, the Office applications you download from the portal may not run properly on the system, and it may cause some potential issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 not opening&#47;disconnected</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an office laptop (HP Probook 4430s) whose Outlook works perfectly fine when connected to the office WiFi, but just as I bring it back home and connect it to my home WiFi, while I'm able to browse everything on Chrome, etc., I face the following problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Many times Outlook won't open and will have the following error message - "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The attempt to log on to Microsoft Exchange has failed."</li><li>In the off chance that it DOES open, the status bar will initially be showing 'Trying to connect' and it'll then show 'Disconnected'</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried opening it in Safe Mode too but it just doesn't open. This is really frustrating and my office IT department don't know anything at all and how to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>

LCRT</a> is correct. Your phone is not locked to a specific network operator. Make sure that the SIM card is inserted properly. Are you using a standard

            <p>I'm assuming you are designing a Select query in an A2013 client database.</p>
<p>As a test, let's create a new query. Select 1 table (say: tblContacts). In the design grid, click on the field in the first column and the first row. Click the Builder button in the ribbon. Does it open as expected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming it does, you can now build an expression, e.g.</p>
<p>[FirstName] &amp; " " &amp; [LastName]</p>
<p>Click OK to close the builder and copy the expression to the grid. Still works as expected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the query. Observe list of fullnames.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to your problem query. If you invoke the builder on a field that is very complex, it may not be able to handle it. That could be the problem here. Switch your query from design view to SQL view and show us the sql statement.</p>

                    I need some help - please can you advise me on how I can make my E71 make a notication sound (like it does with a text message) when I receive an e-mail that is sent to my googlemail account.<br />
<br />
I have my phone connected to the web and e-mail address ready and displayed (on my phone). I have tried sending a test e-mail from my p.c. to see if my phone bleeps with assigned tone and, although I receive the e-mail on my phone - I do not get a notification
 sound - any help would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks Olly

<h2>            Should I upgrade to Windows Phone 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Lumia 640 XL on AT&amp;T. Windows Phone 8.1 works fine for me, but I notice some newer apps only work on Windows 10. Is there any reason I should or should not upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to back up before upgrading? What will I lose? Can I roll back to 8.1 if I don't like it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well if you put it like that NO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my take </p>
<p>I was totally unaware just how "toxic" W10 turned out to be.</p>
<p>My W8.1 device fortunately didn't qualify for W10</p>
<p>My device like all others went through 6 updates without incident</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we were promised that all W8.1 devices would receive the first W10 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the 950 was being launched clearly with a product years away from being ready</p>
<p>
</p><p>Testing showed that a few models would make the cut, those that did many reverted back to W8</p>
<p>Quite simply put W10 has been unfixable, that in my opinion is why Microsoft have stopped selling Windows 10 devices, no 950, no 650, no 550</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Samsung Note 8 exploding just the Note 8 pulled, not the whole catalogue, remember Microsoft at one point prior to get W10 launch topped the monthly sales for operating systems sold such was the popularity</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever is the future it won't be with any development of any Windows 10 coding as after nearly 2 years, the above list shows that W10 is retrograde not an upgrade, considering W8 devices have worked without issue, those who make the leap to W10 gave a
 non functioning device regularly posted problems encountered,immediately after "upgrading"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are down to 2 operating systems without Microsoft, hopefully Microsoft is developing the W10 replacement which is updating the W8 program which we know works</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 were not such a problem Microsoft would nit have pulled the 3 Windows 10 device as well as All Windows 8 devices

<p>Thanks for the reply, it's a lot more than I've ever gotten from anyone at Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 seems to work fine on my laptop &amp; PC.&nbsp; But I was hesitant to upgrade my phone due to the issues I mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I considered upgrading is that the latest version of several 3rd party apps will now only run on 10, so they are unavailable to me. So it's a Catch-22 -- much less functionality available to me, but at least what I have works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think Windows Phones are being discontinued altogether. I notice that AT&amp;T does not offer them anymore.&nbsp; It's a shame since - aside from the lack of apps - I really like my 640 XL and find it easier to use than the Android or Apple devices my friends
 have. </p>

<p>Any update on fixes for Windows Phone 10?&nbsp; I'm still hesitant to "upgrade" due to the problems I've heard with it, but support for 8.1 and ended. Microsoft has left us Windows Phone owners out in the cold. What are we to do? I really don't want to go to
 an Apple or Android product, since I like the Windows format.</p>

<p>Well you can upgrade your Lumia 640XL to Windows 10. It's just that it won't receive any more feature updates after version 1703 and honestly speaking, you will not missing out anything. Version 1703 was the last major upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile with the
 later feature updates slated to be only some bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade your phone to version 1703, you'll continue to receive security updates and fixes till 2019(if I remember correctly).&nbsp;</p>

 I get:</p>

            Hello  Jacques,
<br />
<br />1. Try opening Excel, then go to
<br />File tab
<br />Account
<br />Product information
<br />Update Options
<br />Update Now and see if the issue can be fixed after installing Office updates.
<br />
<br />2. Try repearing Office
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair</a>...
<br />
<br />3. Open Excel in safe mode
<br />Press the ‚ÄòWindows + R‚Äô key on the keyboard.
<br />In the ‚ÄòRun‚Äô window type Excel /safe and press ‚Äòenter‚Äô.
<br />Note: there is a space between the word Excel and the /
<br />
<br />If Excel works fine in application safe, then disable the add-in
<br />Here how to:

<p>Hi Manuel, the Updating had no updates and the repairing somewhat did not go through the whole process as it ran into a problem and actually deleted my Office program so I downloaded it from my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not that I cannot open my files, it just does not allow a downloaded Excel CSV Spreadsheet to open as the message reads that I do not have enough memory or disk space on my drive, which is completely ridiculous as I have ample memory and disk
 space so search me I have never seen or had a problem like this.&nbsp; I actually used a laptop instead for downloading the CSV file and copied and pasted in another spreadsheet and saved it as an Excel Workbook on a usb drive for copying on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So no safe mode as my files do open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help, but I still have the problem.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi again Manuel, the problem is that I can open any of my files but It will not let me open a new file, as per message below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Excel cannot open or save any more documents because there is not enough available memory or disk space.</p>
<p>.To make more memory available, close workbooks or programs you no longer need.</p>
<p>.To free disk space, delete files you no longer need from the disk you are saving to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, now I am getting an Excel (not responding) error if I try and save, although it does save sometimes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I have a virus somewhere in there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Manuel, sorry for the delay in responding.&nbsp; I have actually reinstalled my Windows 10 and my Office 2016 and I had some trouble with accessing Internet but this is all OK now.</p>
<p>The last troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. It will not let me open any new document, but I can save my documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have done the unblock, but I can not confirm the source of the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the troubleshooting procedures and have scanned my PC, but to no avail, I still get the same message about memory and disk space, it is a mystery!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that I do not have any trouble downloading&nbsp; CSV files with my laptop, yet I always do all my work on the PC because it makes it practical for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I downloaded a CSV viewer and the file does not even come up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<h2>            &#40;Win 7 &#47; Word 2010&#41; &#34;Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error.&#34; with Master Documents</h2>
                    <p>I just finished creating a 130-paged master document, with about&nbsp;100&nbsp;sub-documents.&nbsp; When saving the Master Document, it gave me the error message, "Word cannot complete the save due to a file permission error."&nbsp; The referred name is trunctated, but it appears
 to be the Master Document's file name and not any of the sub-documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been able to save the document before.&nbsp; After initially saving the master document for the first time, I noticed that some of the sub-document file names were incorrect due to unexpected results caused by "/" or&nbsp;"-" in the heading name (which Word
 uses to create the file name).&nbsp; I then fixed the heading, unlinked the sub-document (which merely re-combines the text of the sub-document into the master document), and then created a new subdocument (with the text still selected, I clicked on Create to create
 a new subdocument).&nbsp; Then upon saving, this was when the error message occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to File SaveAs, but I am concerned Word will create 100 new sub-documents linked to this new master document file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The Master document function in Word is broken. It has always been broken and Microsoft has not seen it as a priority to fix it. I have heard no suggestion yet that this has changed. You should use it with extreme caution or you will lose your work..

            You do not need access to Windows 7 or XP, all you need is the .WAB file.&nbsp; Import the .WAB file into Windows Contacts as described, export the Windows Contacts to a .CSV file, import the .CSV file into Outlook, again as described on the page.

<h2>            Subscribed .ics calendar not updating in calendar.live.com</h2>
                    <p>I have subscribed to two calendars in .ics format from teamsnap.com on my calendar.live.com. At least one of the calendars has not been updated in over 50 hours, even though there have been changes to the .ics feed. I can't find any way to force an update,
 even Deleting and re-subscribing to the calendar re-creates the calendar with the old data.</p>
<p>This appears to be a bug, is there any plan on fixing this? As it is, this feature is useless to me.</p>

            <p>It's not a third-party issue. In Outlook.com I subscribe to a calendar from Wunderlist. Even though the Wunderlist calendar is updated and the ICS is updated (I've tested with another online system), Outlook.com does NOT import the changes. It actually does
 not seem to import the ICS after it was initially subscribed to in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also inform with what interval is Outlook.com supposed to update the ICS subscribtions? This information is not available in any helps or information I can find.</p>

            <p>Actually the subscriptions never appear to refresh. I subscribe to a Wunderlist task list and can check the list content easily with the browser (it's ASCII), and for sure it is up-to-date. But on Outlook.com, where I have subscribed to this list, I can
 only see tasks from several weeks back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion, Outlook.com's subscription feature imports the .ics once but NEVER updates it. Whatever the "last updated" information states, the imported content in calendar is, even though a check via browser shows the ics on the Wunderlist site contains
 up-to-date information.</p>

            I can confirm.<br />
ICS file from Wunderlist, as opened in a web browser, shows new tasks.<br />
Removing and readding the ics subscription in outlook shows no changes.<br />
Like it was somewhere saved, never refetched, after readding reused and not downloaded again.<br />
<br />
Please fix it, as it is very painfull.<br />
<br />
That would be also nice to be able to force resync.

            <p>Are there any updates from Microsoft on this issue (subscribed calendars not updating)? I'm having the same issue and have found numerous&nbsp;threads dating back to 2011 where many&nbsp;others have had the same problem. Once the calendar is fetched (.ics), it is
 never updated. Deleting and re-adding the calendar subscription&nbsp;only reloads the items from the first time the calendar was ever subscribed to (i.e., it seems to be cached...no update information is loaded when you resubscribe unless you trick outlook.com
 by adding into thinking it is a new ics path by adding random nonsense&nbsp; characters to the end of the path so it thinks it is new).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not a 3rd party issue, as I've seen noted many times on older threads by Microsoft support. Just as this other poster, the exact same ics&nbsp;feed works just fine and updates in a gmail calendar, my iOS calendar, and in Office Outlook. The only place where
 it does not update is my outlook.com calendar, which is the only way I've found to feed a subscribed calendar into the Windows 10 Calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw threads noting that the issue was escalated to engineers back in 2012! But the problem still seems to be present. in later threads, and I'm having the same issue as well. As noted by this other user, and many others, the issue is not from the 3rd party...the
 exact same &nbsp;ics feed does properly update and works just fine with three other calendars, just not with outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; Though I've seen several moderators post that the feed will update in 24-48 hours, I have a subscribed calendar in outlook.com that has not updated in several days since it was added (well over 48 hours) and still shows that it
 has never updated when I look at the subscription via the outlook.com website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, are there any updates on a resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I really want to be able to use outlook.com to manage this and integrate with the Windows 10 calendar, but this issue is preventing me from doing so since I need ot be able to use multiple subscribed calendars.</p>

<h2>            Harmon Invoke</h2>
                    <p>Is Microsoft working on adding skills to Harmon Invoke Cortona?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am nervous is I bought one but am afraid regardless of where Microsoft is placed in this market, they seem to lose the PR and advertisement battle. For example, smart devices that have been in people's home rather than new ones are ADT or other
 security service. Are they going to add those to skills. There pool of skills seems extremely lagging, and unless they both increase that and use TV ads as Alexa and Google and probably later on Apple will do, they will lose the market. I hate to see now that
 they do not have a phone base due to lack on advertisement, they lose this battle too. Microsoft makes some best products but the has worst ever marketing strategy (except for Surface) lags way behind Apple's, Google's, and now Alexa. The reasons are simple,
 no advertisement on TV, or a little advertisement and then dropping the ball. The evidence is the following to show one can come from behind or lose the front seat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- They arrived earlier than anyone in smart phones but lost to Apple's PR.</p>
<p>2- They arrived at the same time as Alexa, but look how they caught up and surpassed Google and Harmon Invoke.</p>
<p>3- And the last one for Microsoft, they started from behind but caught up with Surface devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need to buy a simple to use phone, something like the 515 for my mom.</p>
<p>The thing is that she needs a huge phone book with say 5000 entries or something.</p>
<p>Anyone got an idea about a phone?</p>
<p>She absolutely doesn't want a smart phone.</p>
<p>She currently uses a 3109 phone (3110 without a camera)</p>

<p>Does she really need 5000 entries?? Wouldn't 2000 be enough?</p>
<p>There's this web site listing phones after amount of phone book storage -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gsmarc.com/model-finder/nokia/phonebook-memory/unlimited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>I do not know if all is correct at this site, but looking at some phones I know, it seems to be correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Series 60/symbian phones are btw concidered as smart phones, but the OS is pretty much dead. I would stay away from those.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Symbian/S60 phones do not need a mobile-data plan and can be used as clever as one&nbsp;like. Even I use mine in style of a feature phone.&nbsp;When I hear ‚Äûno smartphone, please‚Äú a lot of fears are around like:</p>

<p>We are here about feature phones. Why does that&nbsp;matter?</p>
<p>Compared to recent Nokia Series 40 or Nokia Asha Software Platform phones, Symbian/S60 ones are a real bargain when bought second-hand and in the latest sales. Another option would be a

            When it comes to data plans, there are differences. Where I am at, you don't need to have one or get one to use a smart phone.<br />
But it might apply to this user...<br />
<br />
There are entry level smart phones with touch screens that are easy to use as anything else. Look at it this way: In stead of needing to navigate around with buttons moving a cursor on the screen further up above, you just push on what you want to do. How difficult
 can it be?<br />
<br />
And even though we are talking entry level and dirt cheap, you will still have both warranty and support... Might think it's not needed, but can still be good to have if one cannot stand by waiting to help out all the time.<br />
<br />
I even got my old dad to use a 4" touch screen smart phone. He does not have a dataplan. He has bad eyes, and thought he would rather be dead before he would learn how to use one. Well, he's not dead (knock wood) and uses his smartphone!<br />

            And for the record, I just chipped in my 2 cents. I didn't say you were wrong. I just thought it would be proper to inform about the status of s60 - which is a smartphone and has no support.<br />

<p>There is no point in discussing S60 DEVICES they are finished there is plenty &nbsp;of asha devices and cheap nokias here that can do the task required,S60 devices are a waste &nbsp;of time in todays real world no point in dragging them up to be honest they have no
 future at all nor has anyone got interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for 5000 contacts i think is rahter excessive but you can use devices that allows sd storage or you can back up to a PC like who needs 5000 contacts at hand its way OTT this can surely be chopped down to whats required.</p>

<p>Yes, and I want to understand you: Why does that matter here?</p>
<p>If you read some press releases one could come to the conclusion Nokia Series 40 is as dead.</p>

            The motivation for wanting a feature phone hasn't been made all that clear, but one can think that someone would choose such device for other reasons than being dirt cheap and something one could just throw in the ditch if broken.<br />
<br />
It could be good to have support and warranty, but one may not care.<br />
<br />
I'm informing the OP - not you. And as far as I'm concerned, the OP can choose whatever he want.<br />
<br />
If you cannot appreciate this, or just don't want to understand, it's fine for me, either way.<br />
<br />
