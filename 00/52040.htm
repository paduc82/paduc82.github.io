<h2>            Mirrorcast from Windows 10 devices to Hisense K700 Smart TV</h2>
                    <p>I have Hisense K700 Smart TV, which I have used Mirrorcast successfully with my old Android Phone (Xperia Z1). &nbsp;However any attempt with my Lenovo 900 laptop or my Lumia 950XL never connects. &nbsp;I have tried numerous firmware updates and have even had the
 main board on the television replaced on the television side and still no joy, but my Xperia works fine. &nbsp;I have attempted numerous ways with my windows devices, as recommended in the standard documentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly has anyone successfully done it with the K700? &nbsp;Are there any non-standard things I could try? &nbsp;I am at the point where I would buy a third party wireless dongle, if I knew it would work with both. &nbsp;Does anyone have any advice on this?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just want to verify if you have tried updating the driver of your Wi-Fi and Display drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to your Windows PC and navigate to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Devices then Connected Devices, have you have tried clicking on Add a Device while your TV Miracast is on?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

            <p>I refreshed everything, made my PC discoverable and sharing to all on the WIFI network.&nbsp; Added the SmartTV, as specified above, it seem to add ok - the bar went to completion and TV indicated progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I "Connect", it sits there for a long time and then comes back "Something went wrong your display couldn't connect".&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried numerous things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it so easy with an Android phone and doesn't connect at all on a Windows 10 laptop or phone?</p>

            <p>I can cast between my Lumia and my Lenovo, via Continuum and I can cast between Android and the Hisense TV (Anyview Cast). &nbsp;On searching further, Hisense seem to make a big deal about Android casting, but don't mention others. &nbsp;Is there a standard that Android
 uses that Microsoft differs from? &nbsp; I get the feeling that this is so. &nbsp; Will Microsoft &amp; Hisense possibly investigate and then possibly rectify - I doubt it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come to the conclusion it would be far less frustration to simply by a further dongle and achieve my aims of casting my lumia &amp; Lenova Yoga to my television. &nbsp;I would also like to cast my Lumia to my car's head unit, at some stage too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would interested in peoples advice on this, as I would like to implement something that works reliably. &nbsp;Would the Microsoft Wireless Display adaptor do this? &nbsp;Are there better alternatives? &nbsp;Ideally from someone whom has actually done this.</p>
<p>

            <p>After installing Visual Studio 2017 and a couple of restarts, my Continuum has suddenly stopped working&nbsp; and I am unable to fix it.&nbsp; There is no response on the computer (Yoga 900) and the phone comes up with the yellow message "Couldn't Connect".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
 looked for signs in the Event Viewer on the PC, but cannot see anything obviously related and there doesn't seem to be anywhere you can view logs on the phone, other than the rather unhelpful message "Couldn't Connect".</p>

            The rumors have the sale date starting in fall/winter of 2009.<br />
<br />
There will probably be 6 flavors (home basic, home, pro, ect .. all the way up to Ultimate), and prices will probably range from 100 US Dollars up to 400 US dollars.<br />
<br />
There will probably also be upgrade versions that will cost a bit less which will require you to have a previous valid installation of windows, but a clean install (wiping the hard drive) is the most highly recommended method for installing the operating system.

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview has expired.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, 1 day ago I got a message on my PC saying something like your PC will restart every few hours and stop booting if you don't activate Windows. I was very busy the other day so I couldn't activate it. Now I'm greeted with a screen saying something like
 Windows evaluation has ended</p>
<p>, If you have a boot disc please enter the disc in your PC. The problem is my PC came Preinstalled with 8, I upgraded to 8.1 then I got 10 Technical Preview. Is there anyway I can fix this without losing my files?</p>

            <p>Or you could set the time and date in the bios back to September sometime, boot up as normal and then back up your data somewhere safe like an external drive before formatting the hard drive and doing a fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had exactly the same problem and this simple method allowed me to get my data without too much trouble. If it is a domain joined account you will most likely have to login to the local administrator account as time sync etc would stop you logging on to
 the domain.</p>

            Hi David, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />Had the same issue here on a few computers and even after using all the known correction methods the problem still popped back up. The final solution was to do a Repair Install specifying to "Apply Updates" during the process. This is easier than you might think and worked every time I tried it.
<br />
<br />A Repair Installation allows you to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea.

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />That update is dated 4th January 2018, any cumulative update since would have superseded that update and included the functionality from that update, your best option is to hide that update and forget about it, Windows Automatic updates will continue to install . . .
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it:

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<p>Hello AlisaO,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>I verified the Canon MX310 series is compatible with Windows Vista. Click on the URL below and review the list of drivers and verify you have the most updated drivers installed. If not, then download and install the driver.

    <title>Open Save As dialog boxes display text in Japanese&#47;Chinese - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doc joeboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open Save As dialog boxes display text in Japanese&#47;Chinese characters in Microsoft Paint and Word Windows Vista</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: MS Paint and MS Word Problem</p>
<p>I have Windows Vista. For some reason when I exit Word Pad or Paint the pop up window that asks if one wants to save or exit is in Japanese/Chinese. The buttons are Chinese and the Blue bar at the top of the window is Japanese/Chinese. I do not read Japanese/Chinese.
 I would like to change it back to English but have no idea how this happened or what to do. Could I uninstall the Chinese fonts somewhere?<br />
<br />
Help,<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

    <title>UAA HD Audio Driver not installed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            UAA HD Audio Driver not installed&#63;</h2>
                    Ok I'm currently using a Compaq Presario Sr2002x with Windows Xp sp3. My Issue is that I currently have no sound once so ever and I know it is a driver issue. So I downloaded the audio driver from manufacturer's site (Fall 2006 Original Realtek High Definition
 Audio Drivers). When I try and install the driver it notifies me that I need the Microsoft&nbsp; UAA HD Audio Driver installed in order to continue with Realtek driver. So I check in the Device Manager&nbsp; and checked under System Devices and the UAA Bus Driver for
 HD Audio is indeed installed. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the UAA Driver, but for some reason when I try and install the manufacturer's HD Audio Driver.. It still doesn't detect that the UAA HD Audio Driver is installed.. Any ideas on what I can do
 to fix this issue?

<div><br />
<div>Audio Device On High Definition Audio Bus
<div>Location 65535 (Internal High Definition Audio Bus)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have gone to Windows update and installed their driver with no success.</div>
<div>I don't know what make, Model or Manufacturer my Audio Bus is so I can't go to any specific site to find the driver.</div>
<div>I have gone into my device manager but it says the device is UNKNOWN and has no driver installed.</div>
<div>My SOUND/VIDEO/GAME CONTROLLERS section say there are no problems and the devices are working fine and the best drivers are installed.</div>
<div>Those are a &nbsp;LEGACY</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have had windows search my Windows CD's for any driver to work but nothing yet when I install any other Windows version the right driver is installed and I have sound.</div>
<div>My computer is a &nbsp; HP&nbsp;Pavilion&nbsp;DV9000</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can anyone tell my why I can't find even a generic driver or why I can't figure out what make, model and so on the hardware is to be able to go to the manufacturer for the right driver to download?</div>

<h2>            PC startup login does not recognize my Microsoft Account Password</h2>
                    I am running Windows 8.1 (64-bit)&nbsp;on an Acer laptop.&nbsp;I have just reset the Microsoft Account password on this computer using a security code provided by phone. I can now get into Microsoft account services that are online but when I try to login or enter
 the new password to verify my account on this computer it fails to recognize the new password. Fortunately I have a pin code that allows me to login but whenever I&nbsp; do something that requires me to verify my account on the PC if fails. What is the problem?&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion. Alas it did not work. Most likely because I tried to resolve the problem in different ways and changed the password several times in the process. I tried all the one I could remember but they did not work.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to move the new Microsoft Account password that works online into my PC or to access a process that will allow me to enter it?

<p>I went through the directions you sent me the link with. None of these directions apply to me:</p>
<p>1. Keyboard&nbsp;Language Layout&nbsp;is a correct one.</p>
<p>2. I never had Webroot antivirus (never heard of this)</p>
<p>3. Already done system restore to the point when it all worked. It did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the settings in Acton Center what exactly do you suggest to look for? I have looked everywhere I could think of.</p>

 since the refresh option protects files from being deleted it also saved whatever file holds the login password. It still does not recognize my Microsoft Account Password and I have to login using my pin.
</p>
<p>Now I have the additional problem of having to reinstall all&nbsp;the lost apps. I will bet that somewhere along the line the PC will ask me for my password and will not accept the pin. Then I'm hooped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am totally frustrated with this problem which seems so simple yet has kept me busy in unproductive activity for so many hours.</p>

    <title>Password Reset Using Secret Questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m. d. lucas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password Reset Using Secret Questions</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday live.com forced me to re-enter my password on one of my e-mail accounts. When I entered the CORRECT pasword it was rejected. Eventually the process toook me to the end of the ordeal, instructing me that reset instructions were sent to a second
 e-mail that I have. OK, so I went to access the second e-mail account (to get to the message in order to reset e-mail #one). Guess what? Live.com dis-allows me entry to e-mail #2 telling me I must re-enter my password. I enter the correct password which is
 denied. Again, I go thru the password reset ritual hoping I will be given the option of choosing to answer my secret questions, but I am not. Again I am directed to go to a third e-mail to get the link to reset e-mail #2.</p>
<p>Do I need to tell you that I went to a third e-mail with the same results? I now have three e-mails that I instructed to enter my password for security reasons. A short time earlier the passwords were accepted. They were correct. WHY AM I TARGETED? WHY am
 I not given the option of using my secret questions? MSN this is ridiculous in the extreme. The reset instructions say come back in 24 hours for more help but I got the same treatment.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Stick&nbsp;your knives in a little deeper
 and twist harder. I hope you are getting a lot of pleasure out of this. I am taking this personally. What else am I supposed to think after all of this?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>When you say your camera is not working, can you elaborate? Is the Windows Camera app not working? Do you get an error? What about other camera apps like Skype? Have you checked your camera privacy settings? What's your make and model of PC and camera?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">To check camera privacy settings:</span></p>
<p>1) Click Start</p>
<p>2) Click settings</p>
<p>3) In search box in upper right, type "webcam"</p>
<p>4) Click "Webcam privacy settings"</p>
<p>5) Check that "Let apps use my camera" toggle is On</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you say you've tried all the troubleshooting steps. Have you walked through the steps in this troubleshooting article?</p>

<p>None of this works. My camera keeps displaying this and doesn't display in device manager. I used the wrong email, so email me at *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to help.</p>

<h3> car377  say:</h3>
<h2>            I think sfc &#47;scannow is lying to us about tcpmon.ini being &#34;corrupt&#34;.</h2>
                    I got "cannot repair member" complaints about tcpmon.ini&nbsp;in the CBS.log when I ran sfc /scannow on my Vista Ultimate system (no service packs).&nbsp; Following advice here and elsewhere, I downloaded and installed AIK, mounted the .wim from my Vista&nbsp;install
 CD, copied the tcpmon.ini there into my system32 directory, and re-ran the sfc /scannow.&nbsp; Again, sfc complains that the file is "corrupt".&nbsp; I looked at the old "corrupt" file and the new "corrupt" file, and neither one of them appears to be "corrupt", although
 they are different.&nbsp; The larger one appears to be a superset of the smaller one, i.e., it has entries for additional printers.&nbsp; Since I know that Vista was loaded from that CD (because I loaded it myself), and since I think that&nbsp;the only software changes I've
 made that should affect legacy printers are Vista updates from update.microsoft.com, I think the plague of "corrupt tcpmon.ini" complaints (2030 hits in Google on "tcpmon.ini corrupted")

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No on the checksum and&nbsp;yes&nbsp;on updates and others issues&nbsp;that&nbsp;can cause that file to be easily&nbsp;<br />
corrupted however it is also easily fixed.<br />
<br />
Start - in search box type -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command<br />
<br />
at top of list find COMMAND - RIGHT CLICK on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Type the following commands (or copy and paste one at a time), each followed by pressing enter.
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>nbtstat -R</p>
<p>nbtstat -RR</p>
<p>netsh int reset all</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
That resets your TCP/IP stack<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also update your drivers :<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

            thanks for the advice - however after following your instructions, sfc still finds corrupt files.&nbsp; The ipconfig flush reported 'unable to flush' but the other runs did work (also had to reboot after the ip reset)&nbsp; I updated the drivers as instructed but
 no success.&nbsp; I lost my instructions on how to view the cbs.log file (access denied when trying to view) so I can't confirm that the tcpmon.ini files are still corrupt, but have to believe it's still them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<span><span>When I do a search of my computer, it finds 4 tcpmon.ini files - 2 from 2008 and 2 from 2009 - I purchased my computer in 2009 with windows vista 64 sp1 installed.&nbsp;
 When I run sfc only on the file in the system32 folder (2009) is shows corrupt, but the file in the sysWOW64 folder
</span></span><span><span>(2008)</span>
</span><span><span>isn't corrupt.&nbsp; The other 2 files are in the winsxs folder - 1 in amd64_microsoft... folder (2009) and the other in x86_microsoft... folder (2008), which
 I assume will match up to the corrupt files being the 2009 versions and the 2008 files being ok.<br />
<br />
Do you know if copying the 2008 file over the 2009 version will fix this problem?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The files not fixed are no issue so do not worry. DO NOT copy any old files over the new ones, and the ones<br />
in winsxs are backups anyway.<br />
<br />
Did you copy and paste all the TCP/IP commands in? Some will report errors however as long as you used the<br />
command as shown it is ok.<br />
<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
This is how you usually want to run Cleanup, SFC, and CheckDisk if needed.<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN</strong><br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
To read Log use elevated command prompt as in bold above AND right click on Notepad or Wordpad<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN then navigate to the files to read is best.<br />

Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

            Hi<br />
<br />
Still no luck.&nbsp; Ran disk cleanup and sfc as instructed but it still reports the same tcpmon.ini files being corrupt.&nbsp; They refer to kb936330 as being the problem but there are so many references to this one causing all sorts of problems with sp1 and sp2 it's
 too hard to determine what's really going on.&nbsp; I don't even have a printer hooked up to my computer so can't see what the connection is, unless it refers to printing to the monitor.<br />
<br />
I didn't run checkdisk this time because I ran it earlier in my attempt to fix this problem, so there's no disk errors.&nbsp; It feels like I'm beating a dead horse with this problem since nothing seems to fix the corruption (almost sounds like a politician involved)
 and even though I can't install .net framework 3.5 all my programs run just fine and I'm not going to do a clean install that Dell and Microsoft say is needed since upgrade won't fix it either.&nbsp; Makes you wonder why they say it's an option when it never works.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your suggestions, but I give up and am not going to spend any more time on this.

<p>I've had a similar problem on my Vista x64 sp2 box.&nbsp; SFC reports the following:<br />

However, when I manually check the hashes on these files, they're all good.&nbsp; How do I know the hashes are good?&nbsp; I checked the manifests in the winsxs\manifests directory. For example, here's the manifest for the File C:\Windows\System32\tcpmon.ini, which&nbsp;was

My files all check good.<br />
<br />
There is one weird issue with this situation.&nbsp; The files C:\Windows\System32\tcpmon.ini and C:\Windows\sysWOW64\tcpmon.ini have different directory lenghts, but in fact the files are identical (I confirmed this with a binary file compare utility).
<br />
<br />
Here are the directory listings for the two files:<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\SysWOW64&gt;dir tcpmon.ini<br />
&nbsp;Volume in drive C is System<br />
&nbsp;Volume Serial Number is 3486-0DBD</p>

            Hi thomasmcloeod,<br />
<br />
I wonedr if anyone here could help me, I'm afraid you'll have to bear with me, but of a philastine when it comes to these things,<br />
<br />
I tried to install a&nbsp;printer on my Dell which is 3 weeks old on the 6/1/10, I thought I had corrupted my spooler by tring to install my printer with an outdated Windows installtion CD (doesn't cover Windows 7), then not fully deleting the old drivers and downloading
 and installing the updated drivers. After many hours with Lexmark,&nbsp;and a bit of a learning curve, I discovered that my printer spoolers weren't working despite trying to start them manually through cmd administrator process.<br />
<br />
Then I found I could scan using cmd, and am having the exact same error messages as you above.....I have no clue what a hash is let alone how to check if it's mismatched, but<br />
<br />
Here's my log <br />
<br />
2010-01-08 13:10:28, Info&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CSI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00000118 [SR] Cannot repair member file [l:20{10}]"tcpmon.ini" of Microsoft-Windows-Printing-StandardPortMonitor-TCPMonINI, Version = 6.1.7600.16385, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_AMD64 (9), Culture neutral, VersionScope
 = 1 nonSxS, PublicKeyToken = {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35}, Type neutral, TypeName neutral, PublicKey neutral in the store, hash mismatch<br />
<br />
<br />
I've another 3logs directly underneath like you, just with differeing time and date and CSR numbers.<br />
<br />
I'm gutted as from what you are saying, all that microsft will do is tell me to update drivers, reinstall windows 7 (home premiun 64 Bit)....and this will NOT resolve the issue ?<br />
<br />
I haven't tried to replace the file yet, also I've found some stuff on the net saying that there is a trojan that creates this file and it can be deleted ???!!<br />
<br />
any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything else is working OK, I'd just like to be able to install this printer my Dad gave me.<br />

<p><strong><em><span>workaround:&nbsp;restore the original files from your installation disk.</span></em></strong><span>&nbsp;
 details:<br />
&nbsp;open your <strong>vista install disc</strong>, open folder sources, and dbl click (open) file<strong>install.wim</strong>.&nbsp; that's a compressed archive (like .zip) but ms created a new format.&nbsp; i found that<strong>7zip</strong> opens
 it quite well.&nbsp; maybe other things, but 7zip is free and a great program for archiving, more formats, etc.&nbsp; get it at the usual places; e.g., downloads.com, majorgeeks.com, tucows.com, etc.&nbsp; within 7zip file browser, open what you need, find the file(s) you
 need, copy 'em out (extract), then copy them where they go in the system.&nbsp; here are the ones i copied: (copies of tcpmon.ini and its manifest and deleting the manifest cache):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \windows\system32\tcpmon.ini<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6001.18000_none_d278d2aaa749970e\tcpmon.ini<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>[folder and file]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \windows\winsxs\manifests\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6000.16386_none_d04210aeaa5e863a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \windows\winsxs\manifests\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6001.18000_none_d278d2aaa749970<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; \windows\winsxs\ManifestCache\6.0.6002.18005_001c11ba_blobs<br />
[n.b. the second one above, copied into winsxs, is a folder containing a backup copy of tcpmon.ini.&nbsp; copy folder and its content.]</span></p>
<p><span>since these are the ones installed, they must match for sfc!&nbsp; certainly, updating the tcpmon.ini copies is needed, so&nbsp;they will all&nbsp;match the manifest's hash value.&nbsp; copying the
 manifest itself insures it has the right hash value.&nbsp; there were two files i found under manifests containing "tcpmonini" in their titles, so i copied both.&nbsp; one is an older version and can probably be deleted, but i don't know enough to mess with that.&nbsp; i
 also copied the cache file (probably good enough to erase it) so sfc with use the current, updated file contents (not stale/wrong/old cached values).</span></p>
<p><span>the long random-looking #S are probably GUIDs or SIDs, unique numbers ms creates to differentiate between different types (classes) and instances.&nbsp; they're not perfectly unique,
 'cause that's hard to do without a central authority gfiving 'em out, which becomes a bottleneck.&nbsp; similarly, the hash values do not contain all the info in the file, just enough info for one 32bit (or whatever) number.&nbsp; two different files with different
 content can result in the same hash value, but it's rare.&nbsp; i guess ms thinks rare is good enough.&nbsp; nothing's perfect anyway.&nbsp; i wonder if anyone's run into a collision yet?&nbsp; most probably wouldn't know if they had.&nbsp; bottom line:&nbsp; those weird numbers may be
 different for you.&nbsp; just look for the embedded "tcpmonini" in the filename.</span></p>
<p><span>fyi:&nbsp; i still don't understand how the hash value is calculated.&nbsp; i see what it's supposed to be (in the manifest), but when i calculated sha256 for tcpmon.ini it doesn't come out
 right.&nbsp; so they're doing something else strange and undocumented, or i made a mistake.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; i tried 3 different sha256 calculators.&nbsp; they all match.&nbsp; my question then is what exactly are they hashing?&nbsp; and why don't my sha256 values match theirs (on the same
 file)?&nbsp; often i find things like this i'd like to learn, search ms for docs, and rarely find anything useful.&nbsp; :(<span>&nbsp;</span>finally, I’d love to know how winsxs works, and how I can trim it down from 15GB to something realistic.<span>&nbsp;</span>Pt
 me to docs if you know some.<span>&nbsp; </span>if someone could write a simple utility to do that, it would be great.</span></p>
<p><span>hope this helps some others</span></p>

<div>&gt; file(s) you need, copy 'em out (extract), then copy them where they go in </div>
<div>&gt; the system. here are the ones i copied: (copies of tcpmon.ini and its </div>
<div>&gt; manifest and deleting the manifest cache):</div>
<div>&gt; \windows\system32\tcpmon.ini</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt; \windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6001.18000_none_d278d2aaa749970e\tcpmon.ini</div>
<div>&gt; [folder and file]</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt; \windows\winsxs\manifests\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6000.16386_none_d04210aeaa5e863a</div>
<div>&gt; </div>
<div>&gt; \windows\winsxs\manifests\x86_microsoft-windows-p..rtmonitor-tcpmonini_31bf3856ad364e35_6.0.6001.18000_none_d278d2aaa749970</div>
<div>&gt; \windows\winsxs\ManifestCache\6.0.6002.18005_001c11ba_blobs</div>
<div>&gt; [n.b. the second one above, copied into winsxs, is a folder containing a </div>
<div>&gt; backup copy of tcpmon.ini. copy folder and its content.]</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; since these are the ones installed, they must match for sfc! certainly, </div>
<div>&gt; updating the tcpmon.ini copies is needed, so they will all match the </div>
<div>&gt; manifest's hash value. copying the manifest itself insures it has the </div>
<div>&gt; right hash value. there were two files i found under manifests containing </div>
<div>&gt; "tcpmonini" in their titles, so i copied both. one is an older version </div>
<div>&gt; and can probably be deleted, but i don't know enough to mess with that. i </div>
<div>&gt; also copied the cache file (probably good enough to erase it) so sfc with </div>
<div>&gt; use the current, updated file contents (not stale/wrong/old cached </div>
<div>&gt; values).</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; the long random-looking #S are probably GUIDs or SIDs, unique numbers ms </div>
<div>&gt; creates to differentiate between different types (classes) and instances. </div>
<div>&gt; they're not perfectly unique, 'cause that's hard to do without a central </div>
<div>&gt; authority gfiving 'em out, which becomes a bottleneck. similarly, the </div>
<div>&gt; hash values do not contain all the info in the file, just enough info for </div>
<div>&gt; one 32bit (or whatever) number. two different files with different </div>
<div>&gt; content can result in the same hash value, but it's rare. i guess ms </div>
<div>&gt; thinks rare is good enough. nothing's perfect anyway. i wonder if </div>
<div>&gt; anyone's run into a collision yet? most probably wouldn't know if they </div>
<div>&gt; had. bottom line: those weird numbers may be different for you. just </div>
<div>&gt; look for the embedded "tcpmonini" in the filename.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; fyi: i still don't understand how the hash value is calculated. i see </div>
<div>&gt; what it's supposed to be (in the manifest), but when i calculated sha256 </div>
<div>&gt; for tcpmon.ini it doesn't come out right. so they're doing something else </div>
<div>&gt; strange and undocumented, or i made a mistake. :) i tried 3 different </div>
<div>&gt; sha256 calculators. they all match. my question then is what exactly are </div>
<div>&gt; they hashing? and why don't my sha256 values match theirs (on the same </div>
<div>&gt; file)? often i find things like this i'd like to learn, search ms for </div>
<div>&gt; docs, and rarely find anything useful. :( finally, I’d love to know how </div>
<div>&gt; winsxs works, and how I can trim it down from 15GB to something realistic.</div>
<div>&gt; Pt me to docs if you know some. if someone could write a simple utility </div>
<div>&gt; to do that, it would be great.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; hope this helps some others</div>

<h2>            &#34;msconfig&#34; and the disaster after setting Maximum Memory incorrectly</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>looking for any help here whatsoever, I am very desperate for an answer here....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two very high end Dell Workstations (T7910 and T7610) which I use for intensive electromagnetic simulations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the RAM in each from 64 GB to 256 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then noticed that Windows7 reports "only 192 GB accessible".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to access all 256 GB so I found notes online that say use "msconfig" and change Maximum Memory setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this but I made the critical mistake of changing Maximum Memory to "256" instead of what it should have been "256000" for 256 GB of RAM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although later I found out that Windows 7 does have a hard limit of 192 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, ever since I've made that mistake, I have not been able to get the machines to re-boot normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone into BIOS, I've checked into Safe Mode, I've chatted with multiple microsoft online folks, I've got multiple IT folks at our company looking at this...nothing nothing nothing is working for me here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the answer lies somehow with this "bcdedit.exe" program but I cannot get it to run when I hit F8 during boot and get to the "X:\windows\system32" prompt...I don't know why?<br />
</p>
<p>everywhere a dead-end for me and I'm losing a lot of time here..</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help would be so very appreciated...</p>
<p>

            <p>I suspect you are going to be forced to re-install the OS and if that is the case you might want to install either win 8 or 10 to be able to use all the ram.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>yes, something to consider for the future (different OS to see all of the RAM), but right now just scrambling to get back to my original Windows 7 configuration...at this point seeing 192 GB of RAM instead of 256 would be a huge relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Ansys HFSS (electromagnetic simulator) does "work" with Windows 7 so I would be hesitant to switch just yet (would want to try on a stand-alone machine independent of the mainstream work).</p>

    <title>Edge won&#39;t stay logged into Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poit57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge won&#39;t stay logged into Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure what category to put this question under because I don't see an option specifically related to Microsoft Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently started using Windows 10 at work where we sign in with domain credentials through Active Directory. I've been trying unsuccessfully for&nbsp; a couple weeks trying to add my Microsoft Account under Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Email &amp; app accounts with
 the "Add a Microsoft account" link. &nbsp; After I'd approve the sign-in through the Authenticator app on my phone and select that I sign in frequently from this device, I'd get an error message on the PC stating, "We encountered an error. Please try signing in
 again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried adding my Microsoft Account under "Other People." After I had signed into my work computer for the first time using my Microsoft Account, I was then able to successfully add my Microsoft Account under "email &amp; app accounts" when logged in
 with my domain credentials. Now I can sign in automatically to the Movies &amp; TV app, Cortana, and others, but I'm continuing to have issues with Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sign into a Microsoft page, such as Bing, with my Microsoft Account through Edge. The problem is that even within the same Edge window, I am no longer signed into my Microsoft Account if I open a new tab. I continually select the option to remember
 me on this device and that I sign in frequently, but I have to re-enter my password and approve the sign-in through the Authenticator every time. I believe this is related to the issues I initially ran into trying to add my Microsoft Account in the Windows
 Settings, but Edge seems to be the only app where I continue to have issues staying signed into my Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>Give this s try to start with and restart PC. Then I suspect that the first time you signed into email or account on Edge, that it never asked to save user and password. This could be the problem and maybe delete all temp internet files in edge in internet
 options located in control panel. This includes user forms and passwords. Then sign in on Edge and save the credentials. Make sure you do not have delete temp internet files set when closing the Edge browser or this will also happen.</p>

<p>It appears my issue is with both the Edge browser and Windows itself. I thought that adding the Microsoft Account within my domain user profile would enable all the sync settings, but that option is grayed out and has a message at the top of the window that
 says, "Some Windows features are only available if you are using a work account or Microsoft Account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also cleared the Edge history and made sure that it isn't set to delete when I close the browser.&nbsp;It appears that it won't save the login information for any website in Edge or share that cookies information between tabs (even if a link launches a page
 from the same website in a new tab).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same issue doesn't exist for any other browser including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. I can close out of those browsers completely and remain signed in to any page that I've chosen to remember me including Outlook.com and Bing Rewards.</p>

<h2>            Move Maker, single frame advance</h2>
                    In old Movie Maker / other programs, you can frame by frame shuffle back and forth to find the exact frame you want to cut it on. This used to be done with the roller on the mouse. &nbsp;Is there a way to do this with Windows 10 / Essentials, Movie Maker?

            <p>You know, I never realized you could use the scroll wheel in the older version. I always used the keyboard shortcuts. I'm not sure why they didn't implement that same functionality in the newer version. Maybe the team that worked on the new version was unaware
 of that feature too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose you could always install the classic <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a> if you wanted that feature back. You can install WMM 6.0 and the newer version on the same computer. You could use whichever version made the most sense for a certain project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you have the ability to use AutoHotKey, you could <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm#Wheel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
recognize a WheelUp or WheelDown event</a> and map that to J or L respectively.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and ASUS Laptops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anna mariaanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and ASUS Laptops</h2>
                    <p>I saw the post from 2016 concerning Windows 10 and ASUS laptops. &nbsp;I had windows 10 on my ASUS ROG for over a year. &nbsp;A couple of months ago it did two different Window updates in a row, without asking. &nbsp;The second one crashed my machine. &nbsp;I am sick over this.
 &nbsp;I cannot understand why Microsoft takes it upon themselves to intermittedly do updates and have their OS crash expensive machines. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I now have a large paper weight. A very large expensive paper weight. &nbsp;I need to get several files off, then I guess I am putting linux on it.<br />
<br />
Just like everyone else I will look at a mac laptop. &nbsp;Currently have a mac desktop, enjoy having a laptop to take with me in other rooms and traveling. &nbsp;Microsoft just cost me several thousands of dollars as ASUS was not cheap and now a MAC LAPTOP is not going
 to be cheap.<br />
<br />
I would like an answer as to what is in the updates that causes the crashing on these machines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please answer this question if anyone knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,
<br />ASUS laptop compatibility with Windows 10 is ASUS problem not Microsoft. So sorry, this is ASUS costs you dollars.
<br />Incompatibility of some updates with current hardware is a very well known and very old problem. Unfortunately PC manufacturers stop developing firmware and driver updates for several years old models.
<br />Your computer is not old so please ask ASUS for updated drivers.
<br />There are too many different PC models to take all and every ones in account when developing programs.

<p>Thank you. &nbsp;I thought of doing a clean install but I do not want to wipe out the files I have on the hard drive I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are important. &nbsp;I try to make backups or copies frequently, have failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you heard of something called a "Firestick"? &nbsp;It is suppose to check for viruses before it loads the OS to see if the OS is infected with a virus. &nbsp;I honestly thought that Windows 10 was infected with a virus.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I appreciate it and will follow through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not asked ASUS but I have considered the driver situation. I would agree with this analysis one hundred percent except I recently updated drivers. &nbsp;I do not understand why Microsoft had Windows 10 to do an upgrade twice in three days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We should have a say when we want windows 10 to update. &nbsp;Why does Windows 10 update so often any way?</p>

            I'm not that familiar with it, but I use something similar called the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner:

<br />
<br />If you perform the custom install though, it will archive the damaged installation and let you recover your files from Windows.old.

            Windows 10 Pro have a possibility to delay updates. Windows 10 home - no unfortunately. You may send feedback to Microsoft.
<br />It is possible to look at update history to view what updates were installed.

    <title>Please help me to stop being hacked - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Please help me to stop being hacked</h2>
                    <p>The account that I am currently writing this on is continually being 
hacked by the same person, and they keep logging back in to change the 
password. You might ask.. "Why not just change your email or phone 
number so the hacker can't keep 2-step verifying the account and 
regaining access, thus locking you out?".. GREAT QUESTION!! Well 
whenever I fill out the form and regain access to the account to change 
the password, I can't change the email or phone number for 30 days.. by 
the end of the next day the hacker logs back in, changes my password 
again, and has access. Every time I regain access the stupid 30 day 
waiting period begins again.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>If
 anyone anywhere has a way around this horribly built security by 
Microsoft, I would be ever so happy to be rid of this hacker.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>By
 the way, I called and started live chats with agents who tell me "There
 is absolutely no way around the 30 day waiting period." So here I am.. 
in an endless loop of hack-recover-hack-recover-hack.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Help?</p>

            <p>Hello TR3UE. <br /><br />We certainly understand the frustration with this process and your concern regarding your account. However, we're afraid that a 30-day waiting period is in effect whenever you change the security information on your Microsoft account. You can find that info on our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/security/update-security-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update all of your Microsoft account security information</a> page under "After you've updated all of your security information".<br /><br />Additionally, support teams are not able to expedite that process.<br /><br />We hope this helps to clear up your concern regarding this.</p>
