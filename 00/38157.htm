<h2>            combat flight simulator - saitek joystick does not work, despite callibration and running in XP SP2 compatability mode on a windows 7 64bit machine.</h2>
                    
<p>I have callibrated the joystick in CFS.</p>
<p>I have un-installed the saitek driver and re-plugged in the joystick.</p>
<p>I have tried XP and Vista compatability modes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems many people have had similar problems (with different joysticks.)&nbsp; No answers provided yet appear to work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help - it seems this is not an uncommon problem.</p>

    <title>ANOTHER MICROSUCK - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morbidboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            ANOTHER MICROSUCK</h2>
                    <p>Anyway. That's me going back to Windows 7 x64. Apparently me and about 50 thousand other people decided to take the offer to upgrade to Windows 10, only to discover that our hard drives decided to go 100% active for about 45 seconds without any real throughput
 on the drive. Being the system drive, it obviously locked people out for about 30 to 45 seconds, every 5 to 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Mmmm.... and the silence from Microsoft was deafening. <br />
<br />
Apparently there are lots of solutions out there that involve dancing around in a tutu while rubbing your bottom up against the keyboard after deleting Skype cookies and prefetching a monkey.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'll bother. I don't think I'll bother with Windows 8, 8.1 or Windows 10. Because they all do the same thing. I'll looking forward to watching the News stories about how Microsoft are burning down peoples homes because (unbeknownst to their users)
 - their SSD drivers and motherboard controllers were working flat out solid 24 hours a day. I'm not a sadist. I'm a profit. I'll just be able to say "yes... I had that problem as well". Which makes you feel all warm and smug.<br />
<br />
Fortunately - I have solid state AND hard drives - and I can hear the disk activity.<br />
<br />
Just one other thing Microsoft - for the three weeks windows 10 was installed, could you PLEASE ask the NSA if I can have ALL of my data back please and tell them I've decided NOT to go with Windows 10. It's ONLY fair.<br />
<br />
Here's a parting observation from the Monkey:<br />

            Amen, brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is on another propaganda campaign, and corporate America's media and falsely "objective" website rating sites are complicit in perpetuating the myth that Windows 10 represents an improvement in almost every way for the end user.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 That's the big lie, and with the threat that they will stop supporting older operating systems at their disposal combined with the carrot on the stick (its a FREE upgrade if you act QUICKLY!), most people will fall prey to this charade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only surprise
 is that they haven't removed your and others' critical reviews from their website....<br />

            <p>Correct my good friend.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 - IS A LIE.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 - The NSA has been looking to hire talented software engineers. Now we know where they went.<br />
<br />
THEY BOUGHT MICROSOFT (obviously they couldn't find 'talented').<br />
<br />
Windows 7 x64 works about a gazzilion times faster than this pile of steaming spyware, bloatware junk.<br />
<br />
They can stick DirectX 11 point monkey.<br />
<br />
Cortana can get a job as a call - girl. I don't care who's voice they stole. This software is junk.<br />
<br />
And if THIS is the state of things to come from Microsoft, I look forward to running future games on the Linux platform. Because Microsoft 8, 8.1 and now 10 is DEAD to me. If Windows 11 if the same. That's me DONE with Micro$. End of line.<br />
<br />
Android runs better than this pukeware.</p>

            <p>OK. So firstly we have THIS going off in the world.<br />

<p>http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29</p>
<p>Then "generally" we have the word "BLOATWARE" floating about.... and how people generally think it's a BAAAAD thing.<br />
<br />
Mmm.. K'ay? Following me so far? (Or does Microsoft pay you by the post?... Or are you a robot? Your not a robot are you? ARE YOU?)<br />
<br />
So... assuming not. I'll go on.<br />
<br />
What does Microsoft do to protect us from the evils of the NSA? That's correct. They collect every single piece of information FROM you computer, including your habbits, and store it in the cloud. Then they beam a live feed from your living room/bedroom/where
 ever into the cloud as well in the form of "Hey Cortana".<br />
<br />
They do this BY DEFAULT. Those options are switched on automatically for most people who don't fully realise the implications of activating the default spyware/bloatware which comes with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Can't wait until the EU data watchdog get up to speed on this (usually takes them a couple of years). You thought the google browser court case was bad? The fine on this will make the BP Deepwater Horizon payout seem like loose change.<br />
<br />
Coming back to bloatware/spyware/junkware... how it's generally considered bad? Generally? Because like, people get REALLY angry when an operating system provider presumes to load a boatload e-mail theiving garbage onto your brand new operating system? What
 do Microsoft think a REALLY good idea to do like 3 years AFTER Samsung get blasted for loading bloatware onto their phones when 3 years later they decide they can't support them anymore? Correct. HEY - I KNOW - WINDOWS 10 MAN - LETS LOAD IT FULL OF JUNKWARE
 MAN! PEOPLE'LL LOVE THAT!<br />
<br />
The worst thing about Windows 10? It runs A HELL of a lot slower than Windows 7 x64. I know it does. You know it does.<br />
<br />
It's NOT an improvement. It's horrible. It's buggy... and in MY experience... and I have CONSIDERABLE experience, being a programmer and a software engineer and an IT Manager for the last 30 years, IT IS NOTHING SHORT OF DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS.<br />
<br />
You are loading this onto peoples computers through Windows Update. Many people are loosing ALL THEIR FILES, because a lot of people dont save ALL THEIR FILES in their personal documents folders.<br />
<br />
You are loading this onto peoples computers, when THOSE COMPUTERS DO NOT AND NEVER WILL SUPPORT WINDOWS 10. Leaving them with a completely malfunctioning computer system.<br />
<br />
You are loading this onto poeples computers, which are capable of running Windows 10, but are still running into serious problems with underperformance. I suggest you google "Windows 10 - 100% disk activity". Many users are facing a problem where every 5 minutes
 their system locks up with 100% disk activity for 35 to 40 seconds. It can't be traced down in any of the Windows tools, most people use task manager. There is no real disk transfers going on, just 100% activity. I couldn't even track it down in XPerf.<br />
<br />
Think what that is going to do to peoples southbridge on their motherboards or their SSD's and hard drives.<br />
<br />
Anyway. Hysterical I AM NOT SIR. Real I am. Windows 10 in a complete bag of dog do. Deny it to yourself all you like. Stick with Windows 10 and kid yourself. I'll be running Windows 7 x64 and MY COMPUTER and it's hardware will be doing what I payed for it to
 do and NOT be running THIS atrocity.<br />

            PS. You probably won't remember this. Not sure how long you've been running Windows "Junk". But when I run Windows 7 x64, I like to run Process Monitor to see registry and hard disk activity.<br />
<br />
Do you know what I see? Absolutely nothing. Maybe the odd flash of registry access from my Wacom Tablet. Maybe the odd flash of file activity every now and then from my M-Audio sound card or my nVidia driver. Very little though. I make sure of it.<br />
<br />
My games run smooth. My Ableton and Reason runs SMOOTH. My movies and my videos run SMOOTH. Everything is perfect and there is peace in the world.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 - IS NOT - an improvement. <br />
<br />
I came.<br />
I saw.<br />
<br />
I put Windows 10 in the bin where it belongs and I emptied the garbage. Whenever I see someone running Windows 10 I will recommend Windows 7. It will NEVER run on anything I own.<br />

            Not unless it can actually switch Windows Update back on. I use ESET. The day I rely on Windows Update for my security updates will be the day I stop using Windows.<br />
<br />
To list THE MANY problems and flaws I've encountered going from Windows 7 to Windows 10 would take me at least a week. I'm a software engineer by trade. I've been doing it 30 years. Windows 10 seems to think my PC is a tablet, I don't know. There is this wierd
 control panel called "Settings" where you can never find anything easily and end up having to use the ACTUAL control panel. Maybe they didn't have time to finish it or something like the Windows 10 black theme. Windows Store is another tablet anomoly. Maybe
 it's Android envy or something. Windows RT I can understand. When it's installed on a tablet. Cortana... wierd... my PC's not going anywhere, but it seems to need my location? I can't even see someone getting their laptop out just to find out where they are.
 Motherboard manufuacturers seem like they can't even be bothered updating their drivers for it... it's like... "You've got 8.1 drivers WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US!".<br />
<br />
My USB hard drive doesn't even fire up after sleep mode. I've NEVER had anything that fundemental happen. The many usb power on/off options make no difference.<br />
<br />
There are deferred procedure call blue screens whenever I watched videos. Horrible.<br />
<br />
It's an absolute joke is Windows 10. If someone gave me Windows 10 to test under the pretext it was "early Alpha" software not to be taken seriously, I would hand it them back telling them that most of their ideas for change where absolutely terrible and not
 to implement them.<br />
<br />
This has been released TO THE PUBLIC. Dear god. Thankfully no ones seems to take computing that seriously any more. I hope they're backed up and have good home insurance.

            <p>And some fanbies like reading junk mail...<br />
<br />
Personally. I put it in the bin.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 x64 - Better - Faster - Smoother - 10 times safer and more secure - 100 times less intrusive.<br />
<br />
If YOU want to keep YOUR personal computing experience PERSONAL - Windows 10 IS NOT for you. The NSA have clearly, without a shadow of a doubt, purchased Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
First thing that happens in Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Cortana - "Where do you live - LOCATION / ADDRESS"<br />
Cortana - "OK... Sign in with your HOTMAIL so I can cross reference that and GET YOUR NAME"<br />
Cortana - "OK... thanks... AGREE to terms so I can share that AUTOMATICALLY with our advertising partners (NSA)"<br />
Cortana - "OK... thanks.. I'm going to set myself up now with HEY CORTANNA - so I can beem a life camera and audio feed from your living room, mobile phone or bedroom directly to the NSA"<br />
<br />
<br />
*Or in YOUR case, every room in the house with all your 4 PC's.<br />
<br />
By the way. Your right about not liking change. I don't like "bad" change. Try loading Windows XP or 95 on a modern computer. I think you'll be SHOCKED and plesently surprised at the experience you have.<br />
<br />
I don't like being short "changed". The ONLY reason this operating system is being given away free is because YOU - THE CUSTOMER - are giving away ALL - I MEAN "ALL" OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION to Microsoft and their partners. Your documents. Your address.
 Your e-mail. EVERYTHING. Microsoft should BE PAYING YOU to install this software on your computer.<br />
<br />
What so called IMPROVEMENTS are there EXACTLY on Windows 7. Lets list them.<br />
<br />
1. Cortana - Voice activated BLOATWARE. No thank you. I still have the use of my fingers and know how to use a web browser and keyboard.<br />
<br />
2. Windows Store - No thank you. I'll avoid the large hoard of spyware garbage and get my software directly from the setups provided BY the PROFESSIONAL software companies. I KNOW how to run a setup.exe. If there are updates, I'll look for them and DECIDE myself
 whether or not to install them.<br />
<br />
3. DirectX 11 point whatever - OK. What's it do for me? Oh yes. Nothing the game and graphics designers at the games studio haven't already made sure happens running the original DirectX 11. Which even then amounts to a few tweaks NO ONE CAN EVEN DETECT.<br />
<br />
That's it. Fast boot you say? No.. it reboots MUCH SLOWER than Windows 7. I reboot (when I need to) or go into sleep mode. I don't shut down and boot from cold usually. So Fast boot? Nope. No "FAST BOOTING" happening here?<br />
<br />
Good to see that Microsoft COULD have cold booted much faster in Windows 7 though had it been designed properly in the first place. Clearly.. it wouldn't have been ROCKET SCIENCE to have incorporate that SINCE WINDOWS 95. Shame that the ENTIRE eara of Personal
 Computing is coming to an end before they decide to incorporate fast booting from cold. You'd think something THAT fundemental would have been right up there with the important stuff. Apparently we've suffered 30 years of SLOW booting from cold for no apparently
 good reason what so ever. Wonder how many man hours have been wasted there. Almost criminal when you think about it.<br />
<br />
REALLY looking forward to all the other important improvements Microsoft will be making in my next life. Who knows. Maybe in a generation or two from now they'll figure out how to remember my "shadow under icon text" desktop preference. That bug has been around
 30 years as well. Only it's worse now isn't it. It doesn't just forget you don't want shadows under icon text when Windows Explorer crashes (30 YEARS OF THAT!!!). It forgets your preference every time you use the "Window snapping" feature!!!<br />
<br />
Utter... utter... utter... GARBAGE. Alpha Garbage, SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.... GARBAGE!<br />
<br />
Really.. If I didn't strongly beleive in Bill Gates eugenicist policies.. I'd have gone with an Apple Mac...<br />

<p>Thanks Andre for your quick reply.&nbsp; I don't think you understand my question.&nbsp; In Win10 Mail, I am receiving all my mail, send mail ok, and have created subfolders under the Storage Folder location below Folders and more.... to manage my mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Live, I was able to go through a series of directories to find a folder called Storage Folders and copy that for backing up my data.&nbsp; &nbsp;The instructions from the community says "<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">However,
 all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">email</span><span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;messages

 down at...</span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Indexed\</span></span><span>LiveComm</span></span><span>.&nbsp; There is no Indexed under LocalState.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There's some discussion on POP vs IMAP, saying IMAP doesn't write to the local disk.&nbsp; I changed to POP but didn't get anywhere with that either.&nbsp; I have show hidden files checked since some of these are hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I want to be able to back up my mail folders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What do I need to do to get a local copy of my data?&nbsp; I see where the storage folders I created exist on AOL with emails dating to when I initially set up the mail account on this new computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>So my backup strategy must include aol?&nbsp; How does one access the data to backup on aol?&nbsp; Don't think there's an easy answer there either.&nbsp; What about POP instead of IMAP?&nbsp; Will POP provide local data?&nbsp; Windows LIve Mail was much better than Windows 10 Mail....</p>
<p>I am getting really fed up with Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Book not booting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rev. brandonsayles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book not booting</h2>
                    A client brought me a SurfaceBook that is not booting up. They said that the fan spun up real fast and loud then it just shut off. I have tried holding the power and volume up buttons for 15-60 seconds with no result. I believe this one is out of warranty
 as it is almost 2 years old. Any suggestions?

<p><span>Hi Rev. BrandonSayles,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you charge the Surface, can you confirm if the tip is lit?</span></p>
<p><em><span>(The battery may be drained and unable to turn on the Surface.)</span></em></p>

            Restart your computer a few times to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Keyboards
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Try connecting the keyboard to a different USB port if its a USB wired keyboard.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Keyboards
<br />Right click keyboard
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Reset your BIOS defaults:

<br />
<br />Try the keyboard with another computer to see if it works. 
<br />
<br />Check for the latest driver updates for your computer.
<br />
<br />Try disabling the RAID settings in the BIOS If you have that configured.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try using SharpKeys to remap the keyboard:

            Hi Kathy, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10
<br />
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard  
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-GB
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Then run this command to set the order of installed input languages 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC

<p><strong>My internet was working perfectly fine after running Spybot S&amp;D. I restarted my computer and when it rebooted my internet did not work. I checked my Network Connections page and it was completely empty. I connect to the internet directly through
 a modem which is used for another computer that is not having problems with the internet. I've tried a &nbsp;system restore which was unsuccessful, unplugged/replugged internet cables, and restored the infected items in my last Spybot S&amp;D scan without any luck.
 I then called my cable company who had me command prompt "ipcofig /all" and "ipconfig /renew" which did nothing. After doing some more research I downloaded and ran Winsockxp and LSPfix which didn't seem to do anything either. &nbsp;I've run out of ideas and would
 appreciate any more tips.&nbsp;</strong></p>

I use AVG and Zone Alarm. Is there anything else I should look for in order to successfully restore my system.

            Couldn't find anything in AVG or Zone Alarm that would prevent a system restore. I'm almost certain I have done a restore before with those 2 programs. Any chance working in safe mode could find the problem? I'm running out of ideas.

<p>I assume that you restored the system to a time when everything was working.</p>
<p>Does Device Manager show your network adapter?&nbsp; Does it show that it's working properly?</p>

<p>I did restore the system to a time when the internet was working. &nbsp;ipconfig /all and ipconfig /renew both just show " Windows XP Configuration." &nbsp;As for the Device Manager, the Network Adapter drop down lists the network I was connected to but there is a
 "!" in a yellow box next to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under "Other Devices" in the Device Manager my Multimedia Audio Controller and PCI Modem both have the yellow "!" as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at the properties for my Network Adapter the device status says it cannot start (Code 10). Troubleshooting suggests uninstalling/reinstalling. Should I give this a try?</p>

    <title>Epson Workforce 845 scanner problems after every Windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamie_2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Workforce 845 scanner problems after every Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    Every time Windows updates 8.1 my Epson Workforce 845 scanner will not work. The message on the Workforce reads: "Communication error. Make sure the computer is connected then try again." In the past, it usually takes a few weeks before it starts working
 again. I do not understand what is going on. I am told by both Epson and Microsoft that I have the most updated driver. If this is true, then why did my scanner stop working again after the most recent update? I need my scanner and this is very frustrating.
 Can anyone help me with this compatibility issue? I would like to resolve my current problem as soon as possible and prevent future problems after Microsoft updates.

            <p>You need the scanner driver and utility from Epson installed on all the computers in your network. Get the Combo Pack for both. Here-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to check--the scanner must be directly connected by cable to the computer you are scanning from. If it is a scanner attached to another computer on the network, it will not scan from a diff computer on the network. You can share printers attached
 to a diff computer, but not scanners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wireless printer-scanner must be attached to the <strong>router</strong> (either wired or wireless) to allow all computers on the network to scan as well as print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your printer-scanner is compatible with win 8.1.</p>

            <p>I have this same problem and the answers below are not helpful.</p>
<p>They did not read what you wrote. </p>
<p>If you previously had&nbsp;ability to scan&nbsp;works sometimes and then not at other times, then you obviously had it set up correctly in the first place. Otherwise,&nbsp;it would not have worked in the past. That suggests either a driver or a Microsoft update problem.
 I am sure that the person who first posted this concern also did as I did and made sure that they had loaded the most recent drivers. I have&nbsp;a wireless connection. The problem seems to be that with updates of 8.1,&nbsp;Workforce 845 no longer recognizes the previous
 wireless "Last Used" connection.&nbsp;Therefore the answers below are not helpful.&nbsp;They are only appropriate if the scanner had not previously worked or needed a new driver. An actual solution?</p>

            Thank you for pointing that out. Basically I wait one to three weeks after every up date and it seems to resolve on it's own. It is very frustrating when I need to use the scanner during this time when it is down. I really do not want to purchase another
 printer/scanner/fax because Microsoft can't do an update correctly. I have spent so much money over the years for computer related equipment and software due to Microsoft deciding to do it "their" way instead of what is best for the consumer. If I had my choice
 I would still be with Windows 98 or even XP. I was happy with that program and what it offered. Now I have a PC I absolutely can't stand. Windows 8 SUCKS!!!<br />

<p>Hi Victoria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For "chat feature stopped working", can you provide us with more details, for example, you can't open the chat window or IM button is missing? The related screenshot would be better to understand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may try configuring your Skype for Business account in another client (maybe your colleague or friend's) to isolate whether the issue is related to your client side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we may focuse on that specific client. And, you may try clearing the cache to give it a shot:</p>
<p>1.Log out and quit Skype for Business.<br />
2.Go to Finder &gt; press Command+Shift+G &gt; type in /users/&lt;MacUsername&gt;/library &gt; delete the following files:<br />

Saved Application State &gt; com.microsoft.SkypeForBusiness.savedState<br />

3. Open Keychain Access from /Applications/Utilities folder.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 1709 64bit, windows image restore to a new drive fails, error 0x80042302</h2>
                    <p>What is happening with windows image backup and restore in the latest windows 10 update ?</p>
<p>This used to work fine up to 1703, but it fails with 1709 when trying to restore to a new replaced drive.</p>
<p>Message:</p>
<p><strong>A volume Shadow Component encountered an unexpected error 0x80042302, check application event for more information.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many other people reporting the problem, but no solution or official answer from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Is Microsoft going to fix and support the Image backup and restore or is it going to drop the utility all together.</p>
<p>It sounds like a bad joke if we have to rely on third party utilities ? Nobody will be responsible for fixing the bugs or all the compatibility problems that arise on every new version or update of windows.</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to be going backward, the new applications suck and they abandon the useful ones that used to work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They dropped LiveMail for a new awful Mail app, the screwed up with a new version of Skype dropping the one that used to work fine etc.</p>
<p>It is time for Microsoft to fix the problems rather than creating new ones every 3 months.</p>

<p>Well I tried to tell people this, restoring an image to a new hard drive most likely will fail. Unless you purchase the same brand and model hard drive. I have never known it to work changing any system&nbsp;hardware. It works off the ID from the image creation
 to the image replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also can not restore an image for example, if you changed a audio or video card etc. Because windows would crash on boot up because it would not have the proper drivers in the old image with other hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after you restore image with new HD from old HD image, you could reboot with the repair CD and see if windows can repair your boot and such. It may then be able to load possible drivers or fix the hard drive difference to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI the image recovery works fine in 1709. And 3rd party image apps can only restore image without major hardware changes. There has to be drivers loaded on boot up during install, during boot or during system image restore or the system will crash regardless.</p>

<p>I totally know the whole concept of a system image. I create a new one about every 3 days and if anything happens then I am saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried images from mine and others PC's in the past with different Make, Model and size drives and never worked. Now if I know someone or myself has an image and needs a new HD, then I get the same one for replacement and it has succeeded every time.
 I do not know what else to say about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the size of your new HD. If it is over 2 Terabyte, then you can not use it regardless on old BIOS Board Firmware. Only UEFI supports drives over that size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, as far as I know and experienced, you need to replace hard drive with same&nbsp;Make, model&nbsp;and "possible"&nbsp;size to restore an image from a previous drive to a new drive. There are different reasons for this.</p>

<p>Well that is all fine and dandy what he says, But on Windows 7 and 8, I was not able to get an image to install on a drive that was different manufacturer and or model. this is from experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, I do not know how many hard drives have failed on you or that you upgraded to larger one since windows 7, but I have yet to see an image restore unless same make and model. Can not remember if size was an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it can with newer UEFI Board Firmware and not old BIOS firmware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well good luck. I would buy the same make and model HD and try it. I suspect it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And do you have Old BIOS or new UEFI.</p>
<p>Because if you have old BIOS and if installed a HD over 2 Terabytes, I believe a HD over 2 Terabytes will not work on Older BIOS firmware board.</p>

You say: The system restores fine if I don't have to reformat the original drive which is 512GB.
<p>I do not understand this. What you are saying is putting in old hard drive will restore image that it came from right? But if you reformat on image restore it fails. HMMMMM. Maybe because of a famous Dell and HP thing and most others. They probably have
 a separate partition with their drivers for new installs instead of using Microsoft generic drivers for hardware. So when you use same HD that you created the image from, it works restoring if you do not format. Or the system repair files logs are located
 on a separate partition and formatting would delete them for image restore or delete the Dell partition for their recovery or drivers location and it fails. If your image&nbsp;has more than one partition&nbsp;on it, and you try a new drive formatted with only 1 partition
 or main&nbsp;with smaller one for recovery logs/files, maybe it will not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You get this message</p>
<p><strong>A volume Shadow Component encountered an unexpected error 0x80042302, check application event for more information.</strong></p>
Well the hard drive change? What causes 0x80042302 error?
<p>The 0x80042302 error may be caused by windows system files damage. The corrupted system files entries can be a real threat to the well being of your computer.
</p>
<p>There can be many events which may have resulted in the system files errors. An incomplete installation, an incomplete uninstall, &gt;&gt;&gt;improper deletion of applications or hardware&lt;&lt;&lt;. It can also be caused if your computer is recovered from a virus or adware/spyware
 attack or by an improper shutdown of the computer. All the above actives may result in the deletion or corruption of the entries in the windows system files. This corrupted system file will lead to the missing and wrongly linked information and files needed
 for the proper working of the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok so try this:</p>
<p>Unplug the SATA cable from new drive at the board and plug into new board SATA connector. Then enter UEFI&nbsp;boot menu so it boots properly for install. I doubt this works. Try it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't done this already, make sure the HDD is of the GPT (GUID) type, and not MBR... Do not format the drive... Initialize it only...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been issues with the Windows Imaging tool and UEFI machines due to the FAT32 EFI partition... It seems it has recently been refusing to image these...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously you have not encountered that problem, but there may be a problem with the repair media you are using to recover the image..</p>

<p>No, This has nothing to do with Dell.</p>
<p>This was a fresh install of windows 1709 on a new 512GB drive. The partitions were created by windows install program and Disk Management shows 499MB Haelthy (Recovery Partition), 100MB (EFI System Partition), 476,34GB NTFS Healthy (Boot, Page File, Crash
 Dump Primary Partition).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is nothing else no OEM or any Dell Partition.</p>
<p>The Image restore program is supposed to create the same partitions on a new drive when I replace the original one, but the process fails with the message below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A volume Shadow Component encountered an unexpected error 0x80042302, check application event for more information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put back the original drive and do a restore on that it works, but in that case it doesn't reformat the drive it just restores the image on the existing formatted drive.</p>

</p><p>The original drive was a new drive created by a fresh install<span> of windows 1709 on a new 512GB drive.

<p><span>The partitions were created by windows install program and Disk Management shows 499MB NTFS Healthy (Recovery Partition), 100MB FAT32 (EFI System Partition), 476,34GB NTFS Healthy (Boot, Page File, Crash Dump Primary Partition).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If I look with Minitool Partition Wizard it also shows a 16MB (Other) partition between the EFI (FAT32) and the Primary NTFS Partition.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 - GTX1050 cannot be verified &#40;CODE 52&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had the SB2 for about a month and never used the GPU. I am trying to setup DensePose/Caffe2 etc and it needs a GPU in order to run.</p>
<p>I just realized that the SB2 NVIDIA GeForce GTX1050 is not working correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error I am getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code

<p>
</p><p>It seems like everything is up-to-date, including Windows10 update.</p>

<h2>            windows 8 does not recognize my 2nd hard drive</h2>
                    I installed a SSD on my computer as drive C, I cloned windows from the hard drive it came with, got windows to boot from the SSD but now it will not recognize the hard drive&nbsp; I disconnected the hard drive and booted from the SSD, closed down and reconnected
 the hard drive.&nbsp; The BIOS sees the hard drive but windows does not.

            <p>Just to let you know that Bill Gates hasn't been with Microsoft for several years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He stopped working there in June, 2008 and stepped down as chairman of the board in February, 2014. All he is now is Technology Advisor to the new CEO; my guess is that that's little more than an honorary title, and he does little if anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe his e-mail address was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, but whether it still is, I don't know.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x8009006 unable to boot Windows</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: 0x8009006</p>
<p>I have an IBM NetVista model M42 bought back in March, '07 from IBM/Lenovo, preloaded with XP Professional. On Oct. 9th I did 3 plugin updates that Firefox recommended, Silverlite, Adobe Acrobat, &amp; something from Microsoft. After Firefox was happy I tried
 to shut the machine down. It announced that it had 5 or 6(can't remember) updates(I assume Microsoft) to install and would shut down afterward. The next evening when I tried to use it, just as the Welcome screen came up so did Error message 0x8009006 and the
 Windows loading stopped at that point. With great perseverance I was able one time to get the machine up in safe mode and restored it back a few days. No change in the error message. I have not been able to even get to safe mode since to try yet an earlier
 restore date. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I did notice that all through the restore process a window was up in the lower right corner..."this copy of windows is not activated. In order to be properly licensed, this copy of windows must be activated." Sure looks to me that something in those updates
 hosed my Windows registry. I am concerned that if I do a full F11 product recovery that the Windows registry will still be damaged and unusable.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are not able to boot the computer. I will help you find a resolution however I will need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have the Windows XP installation CD? Which service pack is installed on the computer? Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the Windows XP installation CD, you may perform an
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">in place upgrade</a> also known a repair install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will not affect any of your personal data; it only replaces corrupt Windows files. If you do a full system recovery, all the data might be lost and the system
 reverts to factory settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but&nbsp;you
 may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

            Rohit, thanks for getting back to me. Answers to your questions:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My machine came preloaded with XP, no installation CD came but a paper suggests there is a hidden partition on the hard drive with full product recovery using F11.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine is up to date with the latest service pack and all updates. As for software updates, the recommended Firefox plugin updates and 5 or 6 microsoft updates were done just before this problem showed up.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this problem prevents me from using safe mode with networking and the machine complains in safe mode that the copy must be activated, I can't see how I would accomplish REactivating the machine. Of course I have the key and Cetificate of Authenticity
 number.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I find it curious that all of a sudden that tiny part of my install that contains the key is corrupted but nothing else.<br />
regards,<br />
Bob Morton<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Service pack 1&#40;32-bit&#47; x86&#41; will not install on my laptop.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title</strong>: Windows 7 Service pack 1(32-bit/ x86) will not install on my laptop, either via Windows Update, or manual download from M/soft Download Center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update has been attempted many times since Dec2012, according to failed update history. Recently its repeated failing has caused my laptop to either a) not start at all or b) "configure/install service pack" upon start up &gt; fail &gt; crash. I have searched
 all related knowledge base (KB976932) articles/advice and attempted downloading SystemUpdateReadinessTool (which failed!), numerous hotfixes, troubleshooting via control panel, manual installs...all without success. It seems as though it starts the install,
 progresses, then fails to restart as part of the installation process. One recent attempt achieved "Failure configuring service pack...reverting changes".<br />
<br />
Really frustrating when something as routine as an update, renders the laptop virtually useless!
<br />
<br />
If any replies received, please be patient, and give step by step guidance, as I am not familiar with sending CHKDSK results pages/Command Prompt instructions that I have read on other "help" forums etc.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated<br />
<br />
<br />

Microsoft released the System Update Readiness Tool to resolve <br />
certain conditions that could cause installing updates and other software not to work.
<br />
You do not have to manually run this tool. This tool is offered automatically <br />

<h2>            PC&#39;s Unable to be accessed via LAN connections error 0x80070035</h2>
                    <p>I have been in the process of trying to create a VPN in windows 10 so that two of my stores locations can access POS software on a computer acting as a server at one location. After finally getting the VPN to connect, I was attempting to figure out how to
 access shared folders. After a restart, the LAN connection at on store no longer works. to be clear this was working fine before the restart. Now neither of the two computers at on location can access the shared folders on either computer. They can see each
 other in the windows explorer but if you click on the device, I receive the error that the network path could not be found. I figured that the issue was caused by me playing with the network settings to get the VPN to work. So I begrudgingly reset the network
 settings on both computers via the windows 10 network reset and reset the router to factory settings. I am still unable to connect to either PC. I brought in my laptop to see if I could connect to either PC via a direct LAN connection (bypassing the router)
 to no avail. I am at a loss for what to do.&nbsp; I consider myself a capable user but networking has never been my strong point. Also I have verified that the folders are shared and accessible by everyone on the network and have tried disabling the windows firewall
 and that didn't seem to have any effect. Let me know what info you might need.&nbsp;Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why I forgot those last two digits. the Full error code is 0x80070035. In PowerShell am I using the host IP address to run that test? Also this is an issue for both PC's on the network. Both of these PC's are able to view and access files on
 my laptop. Just not the other way around. Thanks for the help!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Midi Keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Midi Keyboard not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. I have an LPK 25 midi keyboard i was using for years with my Windows 7 pc and it worked great. Now that i have Windows 10, it does not work. The PC recognizes the keyboard and knows that it's MIDI but
 my software (propellerhead reason 5) won't pick it up. I've read that this is due to Windows 10 having different drivers for class compliant USB devices. Is there anything I can do that can fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest BIOS and chipset drivers from your System/Motherboard<br />
Maker's site.<br />
<br />
Other than that it is the midi keyboard drivers so check with its support.<br />
<br />
Possibly use compatibility mode to install them.<br />
<br />
Use Compatibility Mode :<br />
<br />
Download the latest available drivers from the maker's website. Right Click <br />
the setup.exe (installable file&nbsp; if a ZIP unpack first) - click properties then <br />
the Compatibility tab. Check Run in Compatibility mode - select the OS <br />
same as your driver. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>Thanks for the quick reply! I just checked my BIOS and chipset drivers - everything seems up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up the website for the midi keyboard and it says that this is a plug and play keyboard that does not come with any drivers. It said that it should work with the drivers already installed on my machine. I'm not sure why upgrading to windows 10 effectively
 renders my midi keyboard useless.....</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem as Mike but with slightly different software and MIDI keyboard. I'm using Ableton Live 9.5 and a keyboard made by Novation, who explicitly claim that this product line is compatible with Windows 10 (http://us.novationmusic.com/answerbase/windows-10-compatibility).
 Ableton also claims full compatibility with Windows 10. For reference, NI Reaktor 5 running in standalone mode would accept MIDI from the Novation keyboard, but not Ableton. On the other hand, a MIDI utility I use called Bome's gave me error messages when
 I tried to point it to the MIDI keyboard as well as other virtual MIDI ports created by software used for routing MIDI signals between different programs. My system also seems to be up to date. I've downgraded back to Win7 for now, but what should I try next
 time I run the upgrade? Thanks,</p>

            <p>I've been experiencing the exact same issue with my Alesis Q88 midi keyboard (http://alesis.com/products/view/q88)</p>
<p>To be clear: The MIDI controller, like many others, is class compliant and doesn't have or require third-party drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 detects the controller perfectly (it shows up under the Sound- and USB-category in device manager). The software that I use with the controller to play my music also has no problem detecting the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just doesn't accept any input. Once I plug the device in and start Addictive Keys for example, the keyboard works for 3 seconds then just stops. I never had this issue on Windows 8.1 and it only started happening in Windows 10 in since the last 2 weeks
 of december 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what changed in Windows around that time, but from what I've been reading over the internet, a lot more music producers are experiencing their hardware no longer working under Windows 10, while these devices are typically plug-and-play compliant
 just like any other regular keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to answer some troubleshooting that I already did by myself:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've tried different USB cables. No joy.</p>
<p>- I've tried different motherboards (switched from an MSI Z97 Gaming 7 to an ASUS z97 DELUXE). No joy.</p>
<p>- I've tried reinstalling windows entirely - multiple times. No joy.</p>
<p>- I've bought Windows 10 Pro (standalone). No joy.</p>
<p>- I've tried different MIDI devices (over USB). Same problem, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's clearly an issue in Windows that prevents MIDI controllers from sending input to the computer. How and why this is happening is still a very vague....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, I've attempted to apply the Windows registry "hotfix" as described in this Windows 8.1 thread that describes the EXACT same issue as what I've been experiencing under Windows 10, but it didn't help at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>#edit2: I've hooked it to my front USB controller (which is also a USB3.x port) and it suddenly started working. Windows somehow started installing different/new drivers as well. Not sure how long this will actually keep working though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it has something to do with xHCI handshakes or something...</p>

            I finally found time to do a clean install of Windows 10 rather than the upgrade which tries to keep all of your programs and files in place and that solved my MIDI issues. I'm not sure if Microsoft had implemented updates to fix the issue between now
 and my last attempt to upgrade or if it was the process of doing a clean install, but it's working. Good luck!

<p>
</p><p>With my Windows 7 computer there were never problems but with Windows 10, the MIDI keyboard works a few moments and after that I have to disable&amp;enable the device from the Device Manager or reconnect the device cable. This is very annoying. At the same time,

            <p>I've got pretty much the same problem, but with a different keyboard (M-Audio KeyRig 49, which is plug-and-play).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked great back when I had Windows Vista but stopped working when I got a new computer which ran Windows 8 at the time. I currently use two different&nbsp;computers which run Windows 10, and both of them have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in the keyboard the computer recognizes the device, it shows up in the&nbsp;"sound, video and game controllers" category in Device Manager as a "USB&nbsp;audio device", but&nbsp;does not seem to accept input? I've tried numerous different recording softwares
 but to no avail.&nbsp;The manufacturer claims full compatibility with Windows 10, so it's not just&nbsp;that the keyboard is a few years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's fairly upsetting that upgrading my OS has rendered my MIDI controller unusable. I haven't been able to use it for a few years now, despite the fact that it was supposedly designed to work universally with most operating systems. Gathering from what
 I've read on numerous forums, it seems that there is a flaw with Windows 8 and newer systems&nbsp;that prevents a wide array of MIDI controllers from working properly.</p>

            Hello, I understand that your computer is frozen and inaccessible. You may need to create a Windows Bootable USB more on that here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />After you've created the media, change the boot order in BIOS and boot into the USB media. On the bottom left, you will see a "Repair this Computer" option. Click that and there will be a Startup Repair option. Run this and this should fix the problem. Hope this helps!

            Hi Peter,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
