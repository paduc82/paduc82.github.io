<p>
</p><p>Check the manufacturers website to find out the status of the video card. Check if there are at least&nbsp;Windows 8.1 drivers available. If there are no drivers available or manufacturer support options, you should purchase a new video card.

            Thanks for the quick reply. &nbsp;The error is still coming up in the "Get Windows 10 Update" exe file after removing the display adapter as you mentioned. &nbsp;I am trying to download the windows 10 set up you included in your "how to download official windows

<p><span><strong>Hi Darshan,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As Michael Murphy suggested, let us know the software you have installed so we can provide you further assistance.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When exactly do you get the error?</span></p>
<p><span>a. First, make sure that you have sufficient hard disk space. The Stop error can be caused by insufficient hard disk space.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.</span><span>We can try the Last Known Good Configuration option and verify if it helps in resolving the issue.<br />

<br />
Why'd you buy individual Windows 8 PRO licenses if you planned on using Windows 7 Professional?&nbsp; Windows 8 PRO licenses not included with the sale of a computer (pre-installed) is not included in the downgrade rights.&nbsp; Windows 8 PRO pre-installed on a system
 gives you said downgrade rights for those systems.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You have 24 systems you can legitimately downgrade to Windows 7 Professional provided you have also obtained a Windows 7 Professional Product Key**.&nbsp; The key has to be legitimate.&nbsp; If you are having trouble with said product key (retail/OEM/VL) then you need
 to call the activation center and speak with someone about the issue you are experiencing (and talk to them about where you obtained the Windows 7 product key**.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You have 20 Windows 8 PRO licenses that are Windows 8 PRO licenses and you can use them to install Windows 8 PRO on 20 systems.<br />

I am unsure that if you have a SINGLE (non-VL) product key for Windows 7 Professional if you can use that key to downgrade multiple systems (of the 24 eligible of 44 you listed.&nbsp; If you have a single OEM/Retail Product Key for Windows 7 Professional - can you
 use that single OEM/Retail (not Volume License) product key to downgrade more than one machine - or do you need one OEM/Retail product key PER machine you wish to downgrade?&nbsp; (Meaning - in your case - 24 Windows 7 Professional Product keys from the OEM/Retail

I have numbered the specific areas of your response that I would like to reply to.<br />
<br />
1. We purchased Windows 8 Pro licenses because Windows 7 Pro licenses are not available any longer.&nbsp; We purchased DSP OEI licenses and to my understanding (as well as what I was provided by our suppler) they provide the same downgrade rights as OEM.&nbsp; The full
 text of the description on the packaging is "Win Pro 8 64Bit English 1pk DPS OEI DVD"&nbsp; The specific Microsoft Part Number is FQC-05956.<br />
<br />
2. I have tried to call the activation center and all I get is some script reader in India or somewhere like that.&nbsp; The last guy I talked to could not even grasp the idea that I was not asking him to generate me a product key when I never once asked him for
 that.&nbsp; This is why I am asking if there is any specific department I can address these concerns with.<br />
<br />
3. Again to the concern about the purchased separate licensing, this is exactly what my vendor suggested we purchase.&nbsp; My vender is no small fry.&nbsp; They are one of the biggest etail/retail/distribution companies in the US and has distribution and the same functions
 setup in about 2 dozen countries around the world.&nbsp; They have direct MS resources to make the right recommendations to us on the software needed to be purchased.<br />
<br />
4. The Win 7 product key that I am using specifically is an OEM/DSP product key per the instructions on the exact page you posted http://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/downgrade_rights.aspx#fbid=pr_ANHjqrrY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have followed the exact
 steps provided for the downgrade process and am now hung up between steps 3 and 4 because my key is now locked out.&nbsp; Of the 2 senerios that you mention, we are in the situation of a single product OEM/DSP key to facilitate the downgrade of so many licenses.&nbsp;
 We do not have a VL key due to the expense in purchasing such a key.&nbsp; No where in the instructions does it say I need to obtain 1 key for every install of the downgraded software.&nbsp; If that were the case, how does Microsoft propose to make that a viable option
 in a case like mine of no Windows 7 keys are going to be distributed.<br />
<br />
I apologize if this comes off condescending in any way.&nbsp; I am simply extremely frustrated with spending 4 hours yesterday trying work with half a dozen different departments of MS all referring me somewhere else or reading off a script of poor answers.&nbsp; Today
 I tried to call back the last department (the script readers) only to be put on hold for 50 minutes and finally disconnected.<br />

            1. You can still purchase Windows 7 Professional licenses - will be able to for approximately another 9-10 days... Microsoft’s&nbsp;sales lifecycle for Windows&nbsp;(which is different from its support lifecycle) specifies that retailers will be able to sell the
 boxed version of Windows 7 until at least October 25, 2013, and OEMs can sell PCs with Windows 7 pre-loaded until October 25, 2014.&nbsp; So whenever you purchased these licenses - you could likely still have purchased Windows 7 licenses too (since you still can
 to this day - as posted.)&nbsp; Maybe that one supplier didn't have them, but...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. Peer-to-Peer forum here - I don't know of any - but hopefully this conversation might catch the eye of someone who knows something more!<br />
&nbsp; <br />
1. / 3. DSP (Delivery Service Partner) OEI (Original Equipment Installer) is just a non-specific OEM license - "System Builder" essentially.&nbsp; Seems weird that if the vendor is so large they couldn't sell you Windows 7 Professional licenses when it can be found
 at Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Professional-64bit-System-Builder/dp/B004Q0T0LU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Professional-64bit-System-Builder/dp/B004Q0T0LU</a> and other places (<a href="http://www.trustprice.com/826085/microsoft-oem-microsoft-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.trustprice.com/826085/microsoft-oem-microsoft-windows.html</a>) online.&nbsp;
 While it makes sense from a 'planning for the future' standpoint - not so sure everyone was honest in the sale if you were told you could not get Windows 7 Professional anymore from anyplace. ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
4. About the VL - I'm unsure how much you paid per OEM license, but...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<a href="http://mla.microsoft.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mla.microsoft.com/default.aspx</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
An Open License (pay as you go) for Windows 8 (was similar when Windows 7 was the OS of choice) would be between $100-$300 per license - depending on the selections you make (software assurance, etc.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Anyway - I found the answer to 'needing an individual key for each downgrade' here:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/what_to_do_downgrade_rights.aspx#fbid=S1KSf-qDH5L<br />
&nbsp; <br />
"<strong>Q.</strong> <span>Do I need separate media for each downgrade?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</span>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No. Media associated with one prior legally licensed version of Windows can be used for multiple installations. Multiple sets of media are not necessary for each PC being downgraded. As long as each PC acquired by the end user included
 a legitimate full Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 7 Professional, or Windows 7 Ultimate license, this confers upon the user the right to downgrade to the versions specified in the license"</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>You have the right to be frustrated - just remember that the people here are peers of yours.&nbsp; Most (including me) have no connection with Microsoft other than being a user of their products.&nbsp; Anything beyond tht is of their choosing (like voluntarily answering
 posts in forums like this one, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
That second link I gave:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/OEM/en/licensing/sblicensing/Pages/what_to_do_downgrade_rights.aspx#fbid=S1KSf-qDH5L</p>
<p>... also stated the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<div><strong>"Q.</strong> <span>Will the downgraded software require product activation? If so, what product key should be used to activate the software?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Once the downgraded software is installed, the PC will prompt for a product key in order to activate the software. The product key associated with the original Windows software should be used for activation. If the product key has been
 previously activated, which is likely if the media came from a prior legally licensed version that has been activated in the past, the software may be unable to activate over the Internet, due to the hardware configuration change when installing this media
 onto the Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 7 Professional,&nbsp;or Windows 7 Ultimate system. When this happens, the appropriate local Activation Support phone number will be displayed, and the person performing the downgrade will need to call the Activation Support Line
 and explain the circumstances to a customer service representative. <br />
<br />
Once it is determined that the end user has a valid Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 7 Professional, or Windows 7 Ultimate license, the customer service representative will provide a single-use activation code that can be used to activate the software.</p>
<div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Q.</strong> <span>Clarify again why product activation may fail?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Product activation is an anti-piracy technology that associates the hardware configuration of the PC with the software. If the Windows product key used when downgrading has been activated in the past, it will be associated with a different
 hardware configuration and may register an activation failure when used on the new PC. If activation fails, call the local Activation Support center for help in activating."</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>So - you may want to call to activate and ask to speak to a supervisor if the script-reader seems to not have a clue.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Also - if the vendor you purchased the license from is large enough (say like Ingram Micro or something) then you might contact them to see if they can help you out.&nbsp; If they sold you the System Builder licenses with the understanding you would be able to
 downgrade - they may be able to come up with further assistance.<br />

All of those should be preserved though redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />
<br />
Nothing on other drives should be affected in any manner.<br />

    <title>burning type smell coming from new xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dracoblade11  say:</h3>
<h2>            burning type smell coming from new xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>hi, just today i brought one of the new xbox 360 consoles ( the one that came out alongside the xbox one) and i started it up for the first time earlier and a slight burning smell came out . not really sure if this is standard for a new console because of
 the new plastic and glue or if it is something i should be worried about. i would like to point out that the console isn't overheating and is working fine. i would love an answer from someone that has either had the same problem or knows a lot about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have that too!</p>
<p>The first 360 E smelled like burned plastic, the whole room was full of it!</p>
<p>I exchange it, but the second 360 E smells the same, not so extrem, but the same smell!</p>
<p>I think they use cheap plastic or something, never hat that before with a new 360 or 360 S.</p>

<p>As with most new products this happens (just like that new item smell)</p>
<p>IF the smell does not fade out from use a good 24hrs of HARD use ( being on most of the time).</p>
<p>Then take it back to store or request MS/XBL repair to look at it.</p>
<p>IF you see smoke unplug system and get it replaced. I have had this happen when the slims first came out went away after a day (that smell will hang out in the room/house for a bit). &nbsp;</p>

<p>What happened with your consoles? &nbsp;The smell disappear? I just bought a 360e and it smells like burned plastic. &nbsp;If you touch it it's not hot at all, just a little bit warm. &nbsp;It works great, just this funny smell.</p>

<p>Same issue with my 360E. Smells like some soft plastic or glue maybe, is touching something that gets very hot. The smell has mostly diminished over time but you can still smell it being extracted by the top fan. The console works just fine, but I now NEVER
 leave it plugged in and unattended.</p>

<p>Hey Irixion. </p>
<p>I didn't go scrolling down through the forum posts looking for an old post to bump. I did a google search on "XBox 360 burning smell", and this was one of the search results. So, on the basis that others may find this forum thread the same way I did, it
 seemed reasonable to comment on a subject I'm experiencing as well.</p>
<p>I'm still using my XBox 360, and have put plenty of hours into this particular E model. The smell has diminished, but it's still rather unpleasantly there. Anyway, my advice about never leaving an electrical item that smells like it's burning, plugged in
 and unattended, still stands.</p>
<p>Happy gaming.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Join Home Group with Win 10 - 1607 14393.222</h2>
                    <p>Small home peer network.&nbsp; All computers running Win 10 - 14393.222</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer upgraded to this version a few days ago, all the computers were members of the HomeGroup and it was all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on one of the computers I did a full Reset with the deep clean Format C (like to sell the computer - but not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I cannot get that "one" computer to "Join the HomeGroup" again.&nbsp; I have tried everything I can think of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one computer that cannot join can see files on the server and use them, copy etc. and can print on the shared printers on the server; but it still cannot be a member of the "HomeGroup" and the other computers on the network can not access anything on
 that "one" computer (the one that cannot "join").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp; And to make this one Reset-ed computer "Join the HomeGroup" again?</p>
<p>

            <p>I have done this dozens of times; anyway:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The status is "no errors" and still when attempting to join the HomeGroup the "only" thing it repetitively says is:&nbsp; "This windows computer cannot join the HomeGroup".&nbsp; That little bubble in the password box stays on the screen about 10 seconds and goes
 away?</p>

            <p>Not only to homegroup (I did not try this) .. but the machines dont attach to the windows server 2012R2 either!!
</p>
<p>2 of my 12 machines earlier just working fine on the server, crashed, were restored, upgraded back from home to pro, and now WILL NOT let me log into the domain !&nbsp;</p>
<p>You guessed right, MS TS has no idea, just as in the above case with homegroup. Almost 12 calls and hours and hours of talks/ going round and round from dept to dept, I am back to square one and they want to charge 500 dollars per computer per problem! And
 I am almost positive they will tell me to wait for another update... &nbsp;:(</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I am very happy to report that both “HomeGroup” and “File History” problems are resolved with the Microsoft Update 1607 - 14393.</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>321</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Not only was the sharing and access issues corrected for HomeGroups; all stations can now “join” the HomeGroup and it “instantly” identified shared printers for immediate setup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>File History now works “instantly” on any Windows 10 computer that has been “Reset” with either keep your files OR full, deep clean the hard drive (remover all your files – format C).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I did set up File History recovery&nbsp;on a “Reset” computer with the same MS Account name AND the same computer name as before, in order to assure File History could in fact restore all working folders
 and files to the Reset Computer.</span></p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            High Definition Audio Device Microphone - Static</h2>
                    Hello, I currently got a new PC and installed the Realtek drivers to use my headset. Unfortunately, all I hear is static and when I talk, I can faintly hear myself talk. I am able to hear regular audio, it's just my microphone isn't working. I tried plugging
 my headset in the front and back audio ports but it still didn't work.

                    <span><span>Oh please someone help me. I've been using WLMM 2011 on Windows 7 for a few months, with absolutely no problem. Working great. I am a private investigator, and I edit surveillance films. They are usually about 10 minute videos when they are
 all put together. Suddenly, when I am putting together a video and I play the preview of the clips, the preview stalls, starts, stalls, lags, etc. I will put the cursor on a clip, hit play, and the counter runs but there is only a black screen; suddenly the
 picture comes in a few seconds into the clip. Then it runs, then it stalls again.
<br />
I have a Gateway Quad Core with 6 GB RAM and 2 TB of memory. As I mentioned above, this is sudden; I have been using it for months with absolutely no problem! Yes, I have checked the codecs.&nbsp; I downloaded WLMM 2012 and it was doing the same thing, so I put
 WLMM 2011 back because I'm familiar with all the commands. I have made sure that my video card and all drivers are up to date. I have done everything recommended on this site. The video clips are from a digital camera and I've never had a problem before with
 them. I went back to a movie maker project that I had no problem with, published a movie no problem, and it is now doing it in that move maker project.<br />
<br />
I have done the obvious: uninstalled and installed WLMM 2011; computer on and off; uninstalled my last program installation; made sure I am not running any other programs at the time. I have searched all over the internet and cannot find this exact problem.
<br />
<br />
Please help! I have a report and DVD I need to make!</span></span>

            Hi Beth,<br />
<br />
<p><span>There are several causes on why&nbsp;Movie Maker is producing this issue, please double check the following to isolate the cause of it:<br />
<br />
1. <strong><span>Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker</span></strong>:
</span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started</span></a><span>.&nbsp;<br />
• For Windows Vista - The current 2011 version: 15.4.3555.0308<br />
• For Windows 7 / 8 - The current 2012 version: </span><span>16.4.3503.728
<br />
</span><span>• Windows Live Movie Maker is not supported on Windows XP<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> If you are going to perform an update from 2011 to the 2012 version, Windows Live Mesh will be replaced by SkyDrive app:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/mesh-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/mesh-users</span></a><span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span><span>If you want to keep Windows Live Mesh, you may choose to use this working version of
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows
 Live Essentials 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308</span></strong><span>).</span></a><span>&nbsp;In addition, before updating to 2012, if you are a Movie Maker
 frequent user, make sure you </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/Windows-Essentials-2012-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>meet the requirements</span></a><span>&nbsp;to
 avoid any </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-program/error-code-c945000e-sorry-movie-maker-cant-start/e510deeb-ec20-475c-b821-ddb34e751d23"><span>issues
 when running the Movie Maker 2012 version</span></a><span>.
<br />
</span></p>
<span>2.<strong><span> Check that the files you are using are of a supported format</span></strong>
<b>–</b> Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker. A list of supported formats can be found here:&nbsp;
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq</a>
</span><span><br />
<br />
3. <strong><span>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files</span></strong> - Audio and
<span>Video</span> require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
• Try running the Microsoft <span>FixIt</span> tool for codecs:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</span></a></span><span><br />

<br />
<b>DirectX Diagnostic Tool<br />
</b>• Click on Start button and type “<span>dxdiag</span>” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.<br />
• Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.<br />
• If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.

            Dear Gerard,<br />
<br />
I have done everything you suggest and the problem is still there.&nbsp; Also, please note that I said that I have been using WLMM 2011 FOR MONTHS with no problem.&nbsp; Same computer, same type of files, coming from the same digital camera.&nbsp; For months.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp;
 For months.&nbsp; Suddenly there is a problem.&nbsp; There is a problem with previous movie maker projects I made, when there was no problem with them before.&nbsp; In other words, I went back to a previous move maker project that worked fine, and now it is stalling, freezing,
 and lagging in the preview screen.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I know most people are helped by your canned response, but I am not helped and it is adding to my frustration.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance.<br />

Do you mean a movie maker project that worked before and now isn't? It is doing the exact same thing as the one I just uploaded.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you're asking for.<br />

            Hi Beth,<br />
<br />
I apologize for the confusion. What Christian asked&nbsp; "The video files that worked before in your Movie Maker and now isn't working anymore." was the source files that are included in your Movie Maker project "i.e. Photos, Music, and Video files".<br />
<br />
You can upload them to the folder that contains the project file that you previously provided.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gerard G.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I would really like to get help with this situation.&nbsp; The problem is that I am a private investigator.&nbsp; I'm not taking video at a wedding or something.&nbsp; I can't provide my raw footage to you (it's bad enough I provided some edited footage).&nbsp; Can you not see
 what you need to see with what I've provided? The movie maker project I've provided shows the clips and it shows the type of file (if you hover over the clip; I'm sure you know that), and it shows the delay and lag that I'm talking about.&nbsp; Can we try to figure
 out the problem just with that?<br />

<h2>            Windows Essentials 2012 installation error code 0x800c0006</h2>
                    <p>I have been running window live essentials 2012 for many years and working fine.&nbsp; My notebook is running under Win 10 Home Premium since last year's upgrade and working properly with no problem.&nbsp; Yesterday, I did a reinstall of my Win 10 and all the apps
 had been deleted with keeping only personal files.&nbsp; I tried to reinstall the Window Essentials 2012 but was not successful with the following Error:</p>
<p>An unknown error occurred</p>
<p>Error code: 0x800c0006</p>
<p>Source: WaitForCatalog</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same experience two weeks ago when I bought a new notebook.&nbsp; I install the Window Essentials 2012 and have the same problem and error code as above.&nbsp; I did try to install for several times but failed.&nbsp; Finally I give up and got back the notebook
 to the retailer and change for a new one.&nbsp; Strangely, Window Essentials 2012 was installed successfully in one time.&nbsp; What is the reason and how to solve it?</p>

            By removing the installers from their website, Microsoft have made it very difficult for users wanting to install Windows Live Mail. This forces users to look elsewhere, often a dangerous exercise. Here are links to archive copies of the full installers
 for the English versions of Windows Essentials 2012:

<p>
</p><p>The error you're seeing seems to affect only those using the first of these; it may be that the second (which is significantly bigger) contains language data that the first attempts to download during the installation. Since the files have been removed from
 microsoft.com, the process fails.</p>

<p><span>Hi Frankie Barkere,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 see any message within the square box on the desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in the safe mode.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer to get back to the normal mode</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in the safe mode then there is<span>a possibility that some third party programs installed
 on the computer is causing the issue in the normal mode. I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>Wireless networks disappear minutes after start-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikesr2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless networks disappear minutes after start-up</h2>
                    I start my desktop PC (Windows 7) and everything is working fine. I'm connected to my wireless router and have internet access.
<div>Then a problem occurs, sometimes only 2 or 3 minutes later, sometimes around 5 or 6 minutes later.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer loses internet access, but remains connected to the network. After a few seconds, the internet comes back.</div>
<div>After doing that a few times, the computer finally loses connection to the network, and then the network (along with other networks that were in range) is no longer there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm currently tying this on my laptop which is right beside my desktop. My laptop is connected to the wireless router (and internet) with no problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been struggling with this for some time now, and just a few hours ago I removed Norton Anti-Virus with the Norton Removal Tool. No change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The TP-Link wireless network card in the problematic PC is only about 2 years old. I think my next step is to buy a new netword card, thoughts?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT- I forgot to mention. I have uninstalled and re-installed the network card multiple times. No driver updates available.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just thought of an idea. Before buying a new card, I will see if I can install this one onto my brother's PC. Then I'll see what happens.</div>
                </div>

                    <p><strong>Hi there!</strong> I just got a notification from skype saying it will update my skype and older version won't be capable of running anymore. It also added that old messages MAY get deleted, and it said that i had to contact skype support to get
 me a backup to all my messages, but everytime i write in "Skype support" in google it just tells me to go to skype community to ask the question here, so thats what im doing :-). Does anyone know what to do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Message from skype:</span></strong></p>

Upgrade to the latest version of Skype for Windows 10 to keep the conversations running. The summary of older conversations may be affected during the upgrade. Contact us if you need help to back up chat history.

Could not you upgrade? Tell us more</span></p></pre>

<h2>            Xbox please fix the buying backward compatibility games bug&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>When is Microsoft going to fix the issue that we are all having with buying the backward compatibility games on our xbox ones consoles????</p>
<p>I do not have an Xbox 360 console so therefore cannot buy the games on there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why put the 360 games on the Xbox one if we cannot buy them?</p>
<p>Surely Microsoft is losing alot of money by not fixing this bug which has been going on for years now!!!</p>
<p>Plus I cannot change my Avatars either!!!</p>

<h2>            How do I locate my windows email account&#63;</h2>
                    I just received an HP Pavilion Notebook 15.6" with Windows 10 included and I am searching for my windows email account so that I can receive my verification code. I can't do anything without it. Every time I ask Bing or Google, it directs me to my Microsoft
 account which is totally different. What should I do?

            <p>First, note that there is no such thing as a "windows email account." An e-mail account is created within an e-mail program or if you use web-based e-mail, on the web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Windows doesn't come with any e-mail accounts. It's something that you have to set up yourself--as I said, in an e-mail program or if you use web-based e-mail, on the web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the e-mail program that comes with Windows 10, but it's a very poor choice, as far as I'm concerned.
<span><span>There are many other choices available: some by Microsoft and some by third parties, some for sale and some free. They are almost all better than what comes with Windows.</span></span>

<h2>            Photoshop elements won&#39;t draw with the surface pen</h2>
                    <p>I've just had my surface pro 4 delivered but I have been unable to get my pen to draw on the software, I'm very new to all of this and I was wondering if the device is missing a driver but I have been unable to find any which have solved the issue. The version
 of Photoshop I am currently using is Elements 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Sadly I didn't manage to find any help online. However I did try the trial of the latest version of photoshop which was elements 14, and I found that it was perfect. So my conclusion is that Photoshop elements 13 which I purchased because I was told it worked
 with the surface and scaled all the icons to fit the screen size, didn't actual work. But elements 14 did, I recommend downloading the trial of it before purchasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also one thing you could check is on my pro4 I have an app called surface which allows you to recalibrate the pen and change the pressure settings. That's the only setting that I know of that can sort out the pen. That didn't work for me so I bought the
 latest version of Photoshop, but you could always try it.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In this 'improved' version, I cannot find the option to do this anywhere. In fact the Tools|Options dialog seems to contain a fraction of the options there used to be.</p>
