<h2>            CARK-112 Compatible with 6280&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the 6280 is compatible with CARK112? Most of the phones listed on NOkia website seem to be quite outdated. Is it a case of the phone being too new and car kit being too old? Any ideas?

            The CARK-112 is not listed as an enhacement for a 6280, looks like its no go i'm afraid. http://www.nokia.co.uk/nokia/0,8764,76577,00.html<br />

            CARK 112 is a nokia bluetooth carkit and so SHOULD work with any nokia bluetooth phone. (cradle change required)<br />
<br />
The nokia website is horribly out of date and the fact is that info for the 112 is based on bluetooth models in existance at the time. They could list bletooth models that didnt exist then.<br />
<br />
You could rightly be annoyed if it didnt work (however many people are finding that the 6280 and others wont charge in ANY kit so beware of that possibility)

            actually, you are incorrect there. it would need to share the same bluetooth profile as the phone intended for use - and even then it may not work as has not been designed for use with this kit.

            Are you certain? Ive only come accross 'profiles' with such as the parrot bluetooth kit, used to makes most makes and models of phones work with it.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth is supposed to be a standard for compatability and though nokia product is least so I would be very surprised if even the early 112 wasnt using the same version (1.1?) as the ck7w is

            every bluetooth device uses a profile in order to communicate. there are a lot of different profiles, each device needs to share a common profile in order to connect. but, even though the profile may match you should not make the mistake that this will
 enable the two devices to communicate. in small devices like a car kit, there will still need to be support in the hard and software for this to occur.<br />
<br />
so, whilst nokia make a lot of bluetooth car kits, they are not all compatible with all nokia bluetooth products. this is either due to lack of profile support or lack of support in the devices software. this relates to your comment on the carl-112 being the
 same as the ck7w. its not. the ck7w uses handsfree profile and serial port profiles, the cark-112 uses the same profiles as the ck7w - execpt one, SDAP. this is probably the reason it is not compatible with some nokia phones.<br />
<br />
before you get any equipment, you need to check compatibility first. the nokia site is the best place to do this.

            Are you sure they are your words? Well no matter.<br />
<br />
Even if you are correct (not yet prooved) there is no getting away from the fact that bluetooth is meant to be a standard. And if nokia cant maintain compatibility at least with its own products its a very poor situation.<br />
Next time i see a cark 112 I will be doing some tests but don't hold your breath. Havn't taken one out in a long time.

            i cant help but feel that you are trying to make some sort of comment here, but i seem to be unable to make it out...<br />
<br />
why dont you have a look at the bluetooth website? there is a rather helpful description of it there. also, try on wikipedia - you can find it all in laymans terms there.<br />
<br />
alternatively, you could just do a quick search here, and see all the other posts on bluetooth profiles and the bluetooth standard. there are even some in this section, as the question has been brought up before...

<h2>            Cannot login, states &#34;Account does not exist.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop and have been struggling to get Skype to work. The account I have used for years works perfectly on my Desktop (Version 7.40.0.151) and Phone (Version 8.8.0.61630), my laptop is running Version 12.1815.210.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither my email nor my skype username are working. I am only able to login with the new account given to me when setting up the laptop. I attempted to make a new account with the old email address. While I believe it made a new Microsoft account, I still
 don't have access to my contacts.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, please make sure you have turned on the external sharing on the tenant level and for the site collection. Since the site collection is still updating, you cannot check the sharing setting in SharePoint admin center. So, you may
 need to use PowerShell to check the current sharing setting. For the detailed cmdlets, you can refer to the following article. (Use the cmdlets under the Office 365 Groups tab)</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off-for-sharepoint-online-6288296a-b6b7-4ea4-b4ed-c297bf833e30#ID0EAABAAA=Office_365_Groups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn external sharing on or off for SharePoint Online</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, could you please provide the following information for us?</p>
<ol>
<li>How long has it been since the site collection stuck in the updating status?</li><li>Have you change any settings for the site collection before itâ€™s stuck?</li><li>Are you setting up the site collection the first time? By default, sharing is turned off for the newly created site collections.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Unable to synch HTC TyTnII with corporate XP SP2 environment with AS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tnoyce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to synch HTC TyTnII with corporate XP SP2 environment with AS 4.5</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use corporate, locked down PCs on which I cannot change anything that needs admin priviledges. My profile gets loaded to each PC I use (I move around a lot) but they are all (theoretically) identical XP SP2 configs with AS 4.5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At home I have a Vista laptop. I synch fine with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I synched ok to the corporate&nbsp;environment with my old iPaq. I can still synch ok with it with my old Tungsten. My brand new HTC Kaiser/TyTnII gets either an 85010014 error (notes synch ok, but not tasks, contacts, appointments) or it goes on
 forever and then bluescreens if I break the connection with "BAD HEADER in GROUP POOL" (???). Sometimes, when I establish a new relationship (having deleted the old ones) I get a question about&nbsp;synchronizing "Desktop Services" (combine device and PC, PC overwrite
 device, Device overwrite PC). None of the answers I have tried makes any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried everything I found in forums: deleting profiles on device and AS, reinstalling AS (you can do that), changing the name of the device, Repair on Outlook. I am all out of ideas.&nbsp;Please help.</p>

<p>I think this is a driver issue. Maybe it's just not letting you install the drivers because you do not have admin privileges. But since you can connect the other devices...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Connection &gt; USB to PC on your device. Uncheck "Advanced network functionality" and connect your device again.</p>

<p>Hi Linley</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for the reaction. Tried unchecking the network functionality. Got the "all desktop services" message and selected overwrite the&nbsp;WMD. It started synching but finished almost immediately - checks on everything
 but no real synch except for notes and favourites and a "support code 850100014".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice that the PC&nbsp;overwrote the <strong>
<em>name</em></strong> of my device: I had changed the name as per your advice in another thread and deleted the relationship on both PC and WMD&nbsp;but activesynch popped up now&nbsp;with a name that was my corporate userid with "08" appended, that could only have
 come from the PC. I recognised it because I used to have an issue with the iPaq that&nbsp;I used previously:&nbsp;it made a new relationship every time I used a different PC - so I had "userid01" and then "..02" and now "userid08"&nbsp;as
 devicenames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried the same again (deletes etc)&nbsp;but chose "combine" this time and the name still got overwritten.</p>

            See if this these troubleshooting steps help. Item #9 might help. If it does not, I suggest you remove Outlook and Activesync and reboot your computer and re-install both.

<p>Errm Linley.... what troubleshooting steps?&nbsp;I do not see a document or link....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstalling Outlook is probably not possible: it is part of the corporate environment and I cannot remove it (needs admin priviledges). I have done a repair a couple of times. Activesync effectively gets reinstalled
 every time I use a new workstation (my apps get installed automatically if they are not part of the base install) but of course many settings may be following me around in my "roaming profile".</p>

<p>I'm sorry. Now I realize that I did not insert the link.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code you are getting indicates that there is an issue with Outlook. You already tried the repair. I suggest you run Scanpst.exe to repair and fix errors in the pst file, if any. This application is located in the Office installation
 folder in Program Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I doubt scanpst will resolve your issue. If a repair did not fix it, only a re-install of Outlook and Activesync will. Guess you'll have to contact your sys admin to assist you.</p>

                    <p>I have set up a combo box to find a record (fortnight ending date) from a table. I wrote a small piece of VB code that updates the date in the combo box (DateDropDown)&nbsp;based on which fortnight you are in. When you select the date manually, this updates perfectly
 to the current fortnight with the correct parts of all the other fields for the user to complete. However, when you open the form, it shows the correct fortnight date, but the rest of the fields shown in the form are not correct and display as if the first
 record in the table was open.</p>

            <p>1. You are only setting the combo box.&nbsp; There is no code to go search for the record(s) you want.&nbsp; And, you shouldn't hard code dates in like that.&nbsp; I'm not sure at the moment how best to determine the 14 day period you are currently in without it but I
 am sure there is a way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. That being said, you need to have some code to go find the record, or records, you want.&nbsp; So, what are the field names (and datatypes) in your table, or query, that is bound to the form?</p>

            <p>Hi. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you. Yes, I'm relatively new to access and have had all sorts of trouble doing things with dates. hard coding the dates was the only solution I could get to sort of work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fieldname of the record I'm trying to open is "Fortnight ending" and it's data type = Date/Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other fields shown on the form include:</p>
<p>- "Block complete" data type = Yes/No</p>
<p>- "Technician name" data type = Text</p>
<p>- "Block completion date" data type = Date/Time</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping that by setting the combo box it would find the record as if I had checked it by hand but clearly not, do you know how I can find this using code?</p>

What was the error?&nbsp; If it was method or object not found then you may not have a DAO reference set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you only have one record and the date will be in the table just like the combo you can filter the form by using</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dim strFilter As String</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>strFilter = "[Fortnight Ending]=#" &amp; Me.ComboBoxNameHere &amp; "#"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me.Filter = strFilter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me.FilterOn = True</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And to take off the filter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Me.Filter = vbNullstring</strong></p>
<p><strong>Me.FilterOn = False</strong></p>

<h2>            E90 changes date by itself</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia E90 changes date by itself. Operator's time is not in use. This started happening last week. Yesterday I did a full reset and only imported contact list back to phone. Then I installed Mail for Exchange. Everything was ok during the day and I turned
 the phone off for the night and in the morning when phone alarm woke me up, I noticed that the time was correct but the date was 2 days ahead. I wonder what might be the problem. I cannot use workday-alarming because it's not reliable any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And firmware is 400.34.93</p>

<p>My firmware is the same 400.34.93 and the same problem started recently after the firmware update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem seems to be connected with the alarm set for only week days (which I have) AND turning the phone off for the night (which I always do). Since I need both in the future, too, I am now testing a workaround that seems to work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't let the phone switch on automatically after the alarm has gone off. Instead I turn the power on manually. I got this advice from here in another thread about another E-series phone (E71 I think it was).It seems that the problem has been around for
 ages in different phones.</p>

            Why on earth do you switch your phone off every night? I can see absolutely no point in doing that, especially if you set alarms as well. If you don't want to be phoned, just set it to the Offline profile...

<h2>            Word and PowerPoint opens blank documents when PC is started</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three days ago I started having issues with Word (I have the Office 2016 Pro). At first when I turned on the computer, Word opened like 3-4 blank documents. I checked if Word was in the startup programs but it's not. Now, the problem is still the there,
 and everytime I turn on my computer a higher number of documents appear (now it's up to 15 black documents).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I opened PowerPoint to make a presentation, and the next time I started my computer, a black ppt presentation appeared along with the increasing Word documents. PowerPoint isn't among the startup programs either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just close all the documents and the computer and Office programs run well, but this issue is annoying. I fear the moment Word opens a hundred blank documents...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read other threads discussing this same issue, from a couple of months ago, and the answers said that it was a problem of a recent actualization. Is there any news of this problem being resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be caused by any third-party app installed on your device or antivirus software. For us to better isolate your concern, we would like to know the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes before you encounter the issue?</li><li>Have you tried to close all the programs before shutting down the computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can try to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">start your computer in safe mode</a></strong></span>
 to check if you will encounter the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you also close all of the Office application before shutting down your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

</p><p>I always close all the programs before shutting down the computer, including all Office programs. I have not made any recent change in my computer. All the actualizations are installed automatically. I haven't install any new program either, and I have been
 using the same antivirus (Kaspersky) for years and I have never had any related issue.</p>

            <p>It could be that the import/export module hasn't been installed on his computer. To add them, you can rerun the Office 2007 setup and select to install that Outlook component.</p>
<p>Either way, using Import/Export really isn't the way to create a backup or restore of your Outlook data. Simply copy the exisiting pst-file to a safe location when Outlook is closed to make a proper backup. For full instructions see;<br />

<p>I'd suggest you take a step back and consider the design of your Tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you - as I suspect but don't know! - creating a Questionnaire with one field per question, with each field having its own set of valid answers? If so, STOP: this is a common first approach but ends up getting you a clunky, inefficient, difficult application

</p><p>I am getting the 0x8004e108 error when I try to log-in to my account through any of Office 2013 applications. I have purchased a licence through my university (which has a contract with Microsoft) and also through my employer (has a contract as well).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution for this problem?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have 3 licences for Office 2013: 2 Professional Pro and 1 Personal. Using credentials for all 3 licences brings the same error (which got me thinking that the problem is in my computer - I have previously installed Microsoft Office 2010).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have installed my copy of Office 2013 in Polish language so the pop-up window is also in Polish. A loose translation is below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Unfortunately an error occured during installation of the product key. If the problem keeps repeating, try to fix the product of the Microsoft Office (System error:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x8004e108).'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. I tried using the activation key - one of my licences included a product key - I obtain the same error whichever licence I use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Unfortunately, I get the same error even when I run any Office application as an administrator.</span></p>

    <title>unknown status of external links - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hjc3  say:</h3>
<h2>            unknown status of external links</h2>
                    <p>Why can't Excel keep track of the status of linked workbooks?&nbsp; If I click on 'Data | Edit Links', the dialog always shows the status of all links as 'Unknown'.&nbsp; If I click on 'Check Status' (or even 'Open Source'), then exit and&nbsp;go right back into the 'Edit
 Links' dialog, it shows the status as 'Unknown' again.&nbsp; This seems very odd....</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>I guess the reason is that some of the statuses that could occur happen without Excel's knowledge - you might move or change a source file for example.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So "Unknown" really means "you haven't clicked Check Status since opening this dialog".</p>
<p>It could be argued that the dialog should automatically check all statuses on opening, but maybe that would take a while in some cases.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you do help on "edit links" and select the topic "Check status of links and fix links to external references" you can discover the range of different statuses that might occur.</p>

<p>First of all, update XP to SP3. There are still many issues with OVI, I suggest you do not use it. Uninstall OVI Suite and all the Nokia related drivers. Download Nokia PC Suite, Nokia Software Updater and install as admin, connect the 5800 when you're asked.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply but it does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link starts talking about 2 step verification (which I've never employed) + you &amp; the link talk about 'application-generated passwords'.....which I had to Google for an explanation of what that was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea that I have to download apps &amp; start messing around is too confusing for this 70 yr old; in fact nagivating around this forum is confusing, &amp; takes a lot of trial &amp; error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also received an e-mail from someone called EMMA; she evidently posted a reply in the Microsoft Community...but I cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their must be a simple reason why last week this problem raised it's ugly head for 1 of my Hotmail/Outlook accounts&nbsp; (the others are OK...so far).</p>

            Hello Pannawonica
<br />
<br />Try resetting your Outlook login settings through your windows account manager.
<br />
<br />To do this, follow the steps outlined below:
<br />
<br />1-Go to the Control Panel and click Credential Manager
<br />2-Navigate to User Accounts and go to Credential Manager
<br />In the Windows Credentials and Generic Credentials section, remove all stored credentials that reference Office 365 e-mail addresses or ms.outlook
<br />4-Click Details and choose Remove from Safes
<br />5-Click yes on the warning box
<br />repeat the steps until you remove all credentials associated with your email address
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Windows XP operating system,&nbsp; Control Panel has things like&nbsp; Accessibility Options, Date &amp; Time, Power Options etc...&amp; User Accounts;&nbsp;&nbsp; no Credential Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on User Accounts &amp; found 3 options ....Change Account, Create Account, Change Way Users Log on/off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also 'clicked'&nbsp; on the 'gear' icon &amp; the 'hamburger' icon, etc in the hotmail/outlook web page&nbsp; (i.e. the page I see on the screen with inbox, junk, sent etc folders).....no User Accounts or Credential Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat, this problem only occurs with &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; of my hotmail/outlook accounts. If Credential Manager was involved, would'nt&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; my hotmail/outlook accounts be saying 'incorrect password'/ reset password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and effort.</p>

    <title>Amazon Echo integration for Groove Music&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Amazon Echo integration for Groove Music&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey gang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big fan of Groove Music since the days of Zune. I recently purchased an Amazon Echo and it'd be awesome if it could integrate with Groove Music. Being able to ask it to play certain artists, playlists, songs, etc. would be a great addition to the Groove
 Music subscription line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any plans for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Steve</p>

<h2>            Word shows error for side-by-side config and wont open</h2>
                    <p>I've done some research, think I found a solution, however.. Wellllll.... So, answer&nbsp;I found was to reinstall Microsoft Visual C++ so I ask my admin, he said yes, to get it all ready, he'll come over, type in his creds, then we can get this fixed. (Of course,
 They'd read through, make sure their not typing creds to "virus.exe" or whatever... Don't want em to get in trouble. ANYWAY! Sorry, so I go to open the vcredist_x86.exe but, then, I GET THE SAME ERROR. Side-by-side config is incorrect. So, as you might imagine,
 I'm kind of lost. It also suggests to look at event log and/or use command-line tool "sxstrace.exe" and I'm able to look at event log, along with able to work around to do command-line commands. (I'm good with tech) Anyway, event log says&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Activation context generation failed for "System Default Context".Error in manifest or policy file "C:\Windows\WinSxS\manifests\x86_microsoft.windows.gdiplus_6595b64144ccf1df_1.1.15063.608_none_9e9d5d4256d15def.manifest"
 on line 0. Invalid Xml syntax.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">and, upon going to the manifest file, I find a bunch of white-spaces. No idea what if it's spaces, tabs, other, but I know it's all blank except for white spaces. Understandably, this is slightly tricky for me. Admittedly, I should
 not be looking into this, however I'd like to, in the future, do this type of thing for a living, if possible, so learning something new would be favorably to me.-</p>

            Hi, @raquemorata. To verify, are you using cellular data or WiFi to download the update? Is there any error message? We recommend our users to use WiFi connection for updating their phone's software to avoid data charges &amp; for a stable connection. If you
 have computer access, you can update it using the Nokia Suite. For the detailed instructions on how to update your phone, kindly visit this link:<br />

<p>&nbsp;your firmware variant (059L1C6) is entitled for the firmware version 14.78. As stated before, the update via the phone menu might not work if your network operator does national roaming (because Nokia Series 40 detects this in a wrong way and thinks it
 is international roaming). Furthermore, updating via Wi-Fi might fail because of configuration settings. If you like, we can look into this issue. However, then we need your network operator in the Philippines.</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone 10 - Ukrainian&#47;Russian layout - bug - can&#39;t press letter Ð–</h2>
                    <p>I have Lumia 640 XL, it seems to be that I have the latest Windows Phone 10 update. Previously it was WP8. And there's some unpleasant bug.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Key with Cyrillic letter <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Ð–</span></strong> on keyboard doesn't work.</p>
<p>It &nbsp;only&nbsp;&nbsp;happens when I use built-in sms app and try search for some contact by the letter
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Ð–</strong></span>.</p>
<p>All other keys work properly, and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Ð–</strong></span> works when typing message but not when typing within the contact name input field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw it only happens when cell phone is in <strong>vertical orientation</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing it since WP8-&gt;WP10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts about it? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you perform a soft reset on your phone by pressing the Power and Volume down button for 15 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the phone vibrates, release your hold and wait for the phone to finish rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, check if the Cyrillic keyboard would work this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>A toll-free Skype Number has never been offered. Nothing stops you (except cost) from forwarding an 800 number from another provider to a Skype Number. However, the Caller ID would only be whatever you could verify or use through Skype. Either a mobile number,
 or the Skype Number</p>

            Hi Matt
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Do you mean having a Skype number which is a 1-800 number (toll free)?
<br />
<br />Unfortunately you can not pre-determine your Skype number. Skype will randomly select a number for you.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i-get-a-skype-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA256/how-do-i...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this clarifies! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<h3> charlie_02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 Downloading Local Copy of Online Archive</h2>
                    <p>I've been working with a Home Use version of Outlook for Mac 2016 on my iMac for months with no issues, but on January 25, after updating to version 16.9, the client started downloading a local copy of my online archive. Messages that I had flagged for follow-up
 several years prior started populating my Task list and giving me overdue reminders. Then on Tuesday, January 30, Outlook hung at startup. MS tech support did a remote reinstall, and all appeared well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then yesterday, it hung at startup again. I reinstalled myself, and it was only at this point that I noticed the online archive was attempting to sync. I tried to clear the flags from the downloaded messages that were suddenly appearing in tasks. I noted
 that the flagged items do not appear on the Outlook.com web client, or on my desktop Windows 7 client at work. They do appear in my "Smart Folders" under flagged items, which I hadn't used before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm concerned that the program will hang again because the underlying issue is the local download of the online archive. I did let it finish the download, which I'm hoping will prevent reoccurrence, but my task list is still a mess and the behavior is just
 odd in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have thoughts about what might be going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            It is possible that latest version of Office has this bug as many issues are being reported in this new version. 
<br />
<br />Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognised by your Office.
<br />
<br />Another option is roll back to previous stable version which you had. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as this will be looked into by MS Product team also. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. Experts on both forums will assist you giving you wider reach.

    <title>WP 7.5 OneNote - Missing &#34;Unfiled Notes&#34; folder &#43; &#34;Add - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ayzad-  say:</h3>
<h2>            WP 7.5 OneNote - Missing &#34;Unfiled Notes&#34; folder &#43; &#34;Add to start&#34; note function</h2>
                    (Yes, I have already searched the forums, and I found no answer)<br />
<br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I messed up my OneNote installation on a Windows Phone 7.5 mobile + Office 2010 OneNote on the desktop + SkyDrive for syncing, and I need to restore their functionality.<br />
<br />
<b>The problem</b>: I deleted the Personal (Web)/Unfiled Notes folder and I changed the default folder to a differently named, one section only folder. This setup now sort of works, as it is syncing with the desktop, BUT as a side effect it disabled the "Add
 to start" function in OneNote Mobile - hence I cannot put a "new note" tile on my WP7.5 start screen.<br />
<br />
Reading the forums, it would look like the situation would be to restore the default "Unfiled notes" folder where new notes are stored in the mobile, but it just doesn't work. I recreated the folders, resetted them to default status, deleted all the notebooks...
 whatever, but the "Add to start" feature stays greyed.<br />
<br />
<b>The question</b>: How can I both
<ul>
<li>Have bidirectional syncing (I messed OneNote in the first place because phone-born notes wouldn't go to the desktop)</li><li>Restore the "Add to start" feature in OneNote mobile</li><li>Save myself from hard resetting it all</li></ul>
?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your kind help!

            <p>Here is the How-To section for OneNote - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/office/use-office-onenote-mobile.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/office/use-office-onenote-mobile.aspx</a></p>
<p>Try&nbsp;the following steps:</p>
<p>1) On desktop, log on to your SkyDrive account at <a href="http://office.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://office.live.com</span></a><br />
2) Go to My Documents folder and open Personal (Web) notebook in OneNote Desktop 2010<br />
3) In OneNote Desktop, copy hyperlink of Personal (Web) notebook and send it to you via email<br />
4) On Windows Phone, open the above hyperlink<br />
5) Now Personal (Web) notebook should open in OneNote Mobile<br />
6) On Windows phone, choose section "Unfiled Notes" present in Personal (Web) notebook. Launch context menu and choose "set as default" option.<br />
7) With this, the notes that you take on phone will sync to Web to Unfiled Notes section</p>
<p>Let us know if your issue gets fixed or if it still persists.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, kindly verify the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>How exactly do you access your Outlook email account? Outlook.com is different from Outlook 2016. To check what version of Outlook you have, click
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</li><li>Are you using an Exchange server? If so, this issue&nbsp;is always&nbsp;caused by incomplete or missing
<strong>autodiscover </strong>records in DNS. We suggest asking your Exchange admin to check for this.</li></ol>
