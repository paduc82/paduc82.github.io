<h2>            Cannot connect Nokia Lumia 800 to Zune</h2>
                    <p>When I try to connect the phone to my PC running Windows 7, it fires Zune, but then shows a greyed out image of a phone on the Connect a Device page. I have tried various diagostics on Nokia website to no result.</p>
<p>I am running Zune 4.8 (i think!) and the phone is on&nbsp;Orange network</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can anyone help here please?</p>

            <p>Hi BarryBond,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your forum contribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the problem please follow the steps outlined in below articles:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307</a></p>

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpstart/windows-phone-7-is-not-detected-by-my-computer/1ca2972c-9ce5-4a82-a904-360bfeedd44c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpstart/windows-phone-7-is-not-detected-by-my-computer/1ca2972c-9ce5-4a82-a904-360bfeedd44c</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if none of the steps solve the issue, try to connect the device to a different computer and also try a different cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is still not connected (on different computers with different cables) it looks like a device issue and you might want to contact your provider to get it repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><br />

    <title>OneDrive &#8220;Upload Blocked&#8221; and &#8220;Contacting the server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick_rx  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive &#8220;Upload Blocked&#8221; and &#8220;Contacting the server for information&#8221; prompts from Word and Excel, Sign-in prompt crashes program</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
WEIRD PROBLEM – CAN’T SAVE WORD AND EXCEL DOCS SYNCED WITH ONEDRIVE</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
This following issue happens whenever I attempt to save a local file from an Office 365 product that automatically syncs with OneDrive. Essentially, Word and Excel cannot communicate with OneDrive. When I open a file through OneDrive locally on my desktop application
 versions, the application asks me to sign into my Microsoft 365 account, never prompts for a password, and then crashes / stops working. This has made both Excel and Word effectively unusable. My Dell XPS 13 Laptop using Windows 10 is about one month old and
 has been experiencing these issues from its start.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
PROBLEM I have the problem using all Microsoft desktop programs (not online versions), including Word and Excel. Upon editing and attempting to save a local document on my computer that is also synced with OneDrive, the following error message shows:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Clicking the “sign in” button prompts the following window:&nbsp;<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZOl0v.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign-in
 prompt</a>&nbsp;But, when I type in the email associated with my O365 account, the following two error messages show: This first error message indicates the upload has failed.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/awUEh.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload
 failed</a>&nbsp;And a second message indicates the program is trying to contact whatever “the server” is.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6ftc.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contacting
 server</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXkRn.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign-in
 prompt</a>&nbsp;The “contacting the server for information” message never goes away. Click “cancel” all you want, but the message reappears after a second or so. The changes in the document are never saved in OneDrive. The log-in prompt never asks for a password;
 it simply disappears after entering the user email, and the “contacting the server for information” box appears as a result. In addition, once I have opened a document that is synced in OneDrive, I cannot close the application. Hitting the “X” button opens
 the “contacting the server for information” box. Force-quitting is the only way to close the program.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
POSSIBLE CAUSES I CAME UP WITH 1. I use one set of Microsoft credentials to log-in to my laptop (associated with a personal email) as well as a second set of credentials to log-in to Office 365 (work email). It is possible that Microsoft is looking for the
 wrong credentials or is auto-associating the wrong password somehow. 2. Maybe my computer’s directory has become corrupted.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
STEPS TAKEN SO FAR 1. First, I tried signing out of my Microsoft account using File -&gt; Account -&gt; Sign Out, and then signing back in. This did nothing upon restarting. 2. Next, I removed all Office and OneDrive related credentials in Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts
 -&gt; Credential Manager -&gt; Windows Credentials. I restarted, and this temporarily fixed my issue for about 24 hours. Then the issue reemerged. 3. Next, I hit “stop sync” between my local files and OneDrive through OneDrive -&gt; More -&gt; Account -&gt; “Stop Sync.”
 Then I re-synced the files. This did nothing after restarting. 4. I uninstalled and reinstalled Microsoft Office and OneDrive completely. There was no improvement upon restarting. 5. I tried inputting my personal Microsoft account credentials into the prompt
 for my O365 credentials. This did nothing. 6. I have cleared my cached files through Office Upload Center -&gt; Settings -&gt; “Delete Cached Files”. This never appears to have done anything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
The only solution that has seen improvement is #2 above. But this solution has only been temporary, lasting around 24 hours. Nothing else has shown improvements. I am not sure what to try next.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Also note that I got the laptop at Costco, so returning it isn’t too hard.</p>

            I'd suggest trying a couple of steps to see if that corrects the problem for you.<br /><br />1) First, an add-in or extension may be causing the problem. Start the application in Office Safe Mode. <br /><br />The instructions to start Office in safe mode are here:<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-O...</a><br /><br />2) If that doesn't correct the problem, try repairing the installation.<br /><br />The instructions to follow to do this are here:<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a><br /><br />3) Create a new user profile in Windows and see if it works correctly for the new profile

<h2>            Office for Ipad support</h2>
                    My company decided to try Office for the ipad, through me.&nbsp; The down load and the subscription went well, and I started thinking about what I could do with it.&nbsp; What first came to mind was now that I can finish a word based contract on my IPAD, wouldn't
 it be great to have the customer sign the IPAD and be done with it?&nbsp; Simply email it to him at this point. So I spent an hour looking though the menus for a signature option, or at least a freestyle line option.&nbsp; Couldn't find anything.&nbsp; So I went online to
 Microsoft office 365 support, chat mode and asked how I could get a customer to sign a document.&nbsp; The question I got in return was "you don't know how to sign in?".&nbsp; It went down hill from there. It took forever for him to read my questions and comments, and
 ultimately he had no clue how word worked on an IPAD.&nbsp; So I got referred to another department within Microsoft, and spent another hour with them (1minute of explanation, 3 minutes off line

            <p>I am in a similar situation with trying to complete property insurance survey reports and then attach photos while on my iPad.&nbsp; Currently, I can complete most of the property insurance carrier's required form (.docx) on the iPad.&nbsp; However, I can seem to
 attach the photo nor can I seem to find a (?) button or key.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that the MS Office suite for the iPad is woefully deficient compared to the MS Office suite on laptops or Macs.&nbsp; It's not too surprising, though.&nbsp; MS is a painfully slow responder and innovator of software and hardware.&nbsp; That may be the reason
 that Apple folks tend not to use MS too often.&nbsp; Apple's comparable suite of programs (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Access, etc.) are not much better, so we may be "stuck".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if anyone figures out how to attach photos to a Word document.</p>

    <title>OneNote Save Location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budfudder_  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Save Location</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I'm using OneNote 2013 on a Windows 7 64bit box.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I use OneNote and have two (2) separate notebooks, one for each of the projects I'm associated with. When I created the notebooks, I specified their locations (in a particular location which is automatically backed up to OneDrive,
 outside of any system locations). When I look at the properties for either of those notebooks, the Location is shown as that location I specified.<br />
<br />
However, when I go to those two locations, in one of the directories there is a single .ms-one-stub file; in the other directory there is nothing at all.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, when I go the 'Save &amp; Backup' options, it shows:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Quick Notes Section: c:\users\me\Documents\OneNote Notebooks\My Notebook\Quick Notes.one<br />
Backup Folder: c:\users\me\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote<br />
Default Notebook Location: c:\users\me\Documents\OneNote Notebooks</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">When I go to c:\users\me\Documents\OneNote Notebooks\My Notebook, there is a folder there named for one (and only one) of my two notebooks, and in that folder is the file New Section 1.one and Open Notebook.onetoc2.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously not understanding how/where OneNote saves its data. How do I get it to actually save in the location I specify, and get the stuff out of c:\user\me\Documents\OneNote Notebooks?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi, I have seen this before. Actually on one customer the notebook was not stored locally, everything was pushed to cloud and there was a intermediate storage in the temp folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you ensure that your notebook is synced. </p>
<p>Click File</p>
<p>Click your notebook</p>
<p>Click settings/properties</p>
<p>Click change location.</p>
<p>Place it in a folder somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click File</p>
<p>Go to your notebook and there is a option under the file path that says "Save to Web"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What you have done is to restart syncing, it might fix the stub issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rest assured when you store a onenote on onedrive there is no need for the onprem copy</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. I did what you suggested - changed the save folder. Great, in the new folder all the files I expected appeared - the *.one file, the *.onetoc2 file, and the RecycleBin folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I changed it back to the original folder (where I really want it to be) and it all seemed to work fine - except that the folder is (once again) completely empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it make a difference that the folder I want it to be on is within the OneDrive synching area? Could that be preventing it from creating the local files? If so, How can I get around that? I know you say that there's no need for the onprem copy, but I
 WANT the onprem copy.</p>

            That's not an acceptable response considering this has been going on since NOVEMBER.  Why in the **** would you take down a very crucial function for several months while you develop something new?  That is one **** of a long downtime.  What's the ETA?

            <p>Given that some cruicial Windows 10 problems haven't been fixed since last October, I would not hold my breath waiting for MS to fix what they must see as a secondary service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved my calendars and email from Gmail to Outlook.com primarily because I&nbsp;can sync calendar / tasks with Outlook without the need for a 3rd party conduit. And I really dislike&nbsp;Gmail interface. But I kept my&nbsp;email address and moving back would&nbsp;only be&nbsp;a
 10 min job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has a history of coming up with some great concepts well ahead of&nbsp;competition, never taking time to polish the&nbsp;annoying problems,&nbsp;and then letting these&nbsp;products&nbsp;die a slow death.&nbsp; A great example would be&nbsp;Windows Mobile. They had several years to make
 it really user friendly and would've owned the market&nbsp;well before&nbsp;iPhone or Android had they&nbsp;done their job.&nbsp;Afraid Outlook.com is going the same way. A great interface clobbered by&nbsp;a multitude of things that don't work, or stop working, or are unfinished,
 or&nbsp;slow.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem isn't that it's buggy or missing features, but they are doing a migration to a different platform that is causing this issue.&nbsp; I'm on the old platform and my wife is on the new one so we can't share calendars.&nbsp; Once the migration is complete
 this goes away . . . but it's been going on for far too long.&nbsp; This needs to end now.</p>

            <p>But that's exactly what I was talking about - they start with great concepts, half-bake them and then abandon.&nbsp; And yes, if it doesn't work then it's buggy, from the end user perspective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already gave an example of Windows Mobile - a great phone OS that lingered without basic features like finger-friendly interface or new apps. It was on the market years before iOS or Android, but never materialized it's potential because of the glacial
 pace of development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you have the Windows 10 which is a bugfest with major unfixed problems dating back to at least October of last year (e.g. the non-working Metro Apps that seem to have been broken for many users by a forced update, or the Start menu&nbsp;/ Cortana that just
 refuse to work every now and then).</p>

<h2>            Disable &#34;Tag for status change alerts&#34;</h2>
                    Is there a way to prevent someone from choosing to tag me for status change alerts? Or disable this feature on a user by user basis? &nbsp;Unfortunately, there is someone in my company who is&nbsp;abusing the&nbsp;privilege of being able to receive notifications of my
 status.&nbsp; Within seconds of me starting up my computer in the morning, there is a certain user who will message me so I'm pretty sure he has notifications set up for me. This person is not a supervisor so they do not have a business need to be notified of my
 status changes.&nbsp; It is quite annoying and slightly disturbing to think they have chosen to set up this notification and I have no way to stop them. It's also concerning that there is no way to know for sure who has these notifications set up for me. There
 are creepers in any company. Allowing them to secretly set up these notifications is just making it that much easier for them to be creepers. Please fix this by either: 1) allowing users to disable the abilit

            <p>Hi aviweG, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand a 80072EEF is preventing you from being able to update your phone. I had a look at a support page that includes a lot of different update error codes and I found 80072E<strong>FF
</strong>but not 80072E<strong>EF</strong>. Can you double check the error code for me to ensure which error you're receiving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're receiving the 80072EFF error, please try the steps listed for the error on
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484</a>. I'll also post the specific steps here for you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>80072EFF, 80072EE2, 80072FA8, 801811A5, 801881CC, or 80072EE7</strong>

<div>
<ol>
<li>Restart your phone and check your USB cable:<br />
<ol>
<li>Restart your Windows Phone. Press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Power<span>&nbsp;</span>

<p>I would guess there may have been some updates to the O365 portal. Perhaps there will be&nbsp; patch soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an MSP we create O365 portals with one admin account (Global Administrator) that does not get a license assigned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I had to log into the O365 portal and make the user a global Admin</p>
<p>-Disable the windows firewall and AV on the local PC</p>
<p>-Use a local account with local administrator rights (not the built-in administrator, leave that disabled)</p>
<p>-Download the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant for Office 365 and use it to install Office</p>
<p>(then remember to change the O365 portal user back to a standard account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error did occur whether the PC had recent updates or not. Appears to be an issue with the O365 portal and not so much the local PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Outside of a clean install, what can I do to go back to RTM from Insider builds? Why does the "in place upgrade" function not work for this? At least it doesn't for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any options here? The language of the insider program all over the place suggests you can just go back at any time, but I have yet to find a way to do this barring a complete reformat.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since you didn't (apparently) invest the 10 minutes or so to make a disk image backup of your OS partition when you were running the RTM, you can't return via that route ... it would have taken 10 minutes or less to go back in that manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install would easily do the job for you, but that doesn't seem to be your first choice. The "in place upgrade" can do it, but it is a poor substitute for a clean install, requiring you to reinstall your programs anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you could just buy a new computer with the RTM already installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If only Microsoft would have warned those who came equipped with nothing more than an adventurous spirit to join the insider program ... that they might need more than that ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to persuade testers to have an appreciation for the need to make provisions for going back to previous builds, but haven't had much success with it. It seems that most of them really don't believe they will ever need to go back, until it's too
 late to prepare for it.</p>

            <p>Ok, read above. I've been using insider builds for a long time. An OS image from 2 years ago would hardly be helpful here. Also, it takes longer than 10 minutes to make an image of an SSD (though it's not a massive investment timewise I'll grant you).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather not do a clean install and have to set all my stuff up again. That's a huge pain. I mean, I will if I have to, but that's clearly a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"In place upgrades" keep your installed programs. All build updates use this same process. I have no idea why MS doesn't let you just install RTM in this fashion to get out of insider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buying a new computer makes absolutely no sense here. O_o</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft suggests that getting out of insider builds is easy and you can go back to RTM at any time without reinstalling. This suggestion is in all of the help articles I've seen regarding this topic. None of them are accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In what world do you live that you can easily go back? The built in processes only allow you to go back to the previous build you used, and that's only if it was less than 30 days ago. Yes an image of your OS drive will let you, but you still need to then
 extract any data that you've edited in that time frame. Again, an OS image from 2 years ago really isn't helpful here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just seems to me that MS HAS a way to let this happen, but for some reason they don't properly support it. The "in place upgrade" thing has made clean installs almost a thing of the past these days. Why you can't just downgrade to RTM is beyond me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, though, even the insider fast ring builds have hardly been unstable. I've rarely hit major bugs, and found them to be generally more stable and better than RTM in most cases (though I've yet to see a usable version of Edge). But every now and
 then I hit a bug like in the latest fast build, where plugging in any controller crashes the GPU driver and the DWM requiring a restart. lol</p>

            <p>You could stick with the insider program until the Creators Update is released to the public in April or whenever and then you don't have to try and go back to an earlier build - just&nbsp; update to the released build.&nbsp; If you have been with the program since
 the beginning April isn't much longer.</p>

<p>With more than one drive and Partitions and backup drives plus some kind of third party apps to do Partition backups it is possible to keep just about any type of return point you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my desktop I have my backup Drives for Things like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>External backup drives can be used for the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With multi Boot OS's you can use a different drive for each OS or if you have a large enough drive to Partition and leave enough space for each OS to function it can be done with a single drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a single drive for my Win 7 install and a second Partitioned drive for The Win 10 Builds. One Partition for
<p>
</p><p>My backup drive is Partitioned in 3 parts and I use a Free third party app that can make disk images or individual Partition images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So each OS Win 7, Win 10 Release Preview and Win 10 Fast Ring all have there own image backup location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a running Win 10 Release Preview is a Good way to keep a current backup Image of the latest RTM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 10 Release Preview is an Insider Build and is also the same or one small step ahead of the RTM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is not capable of using multi boot all systems are able to take advantage of External backup drives being USB or Network when it is working.</p>

            <p>That's the point of having on hand an image of, for example, build 14393 with your installed programs. If you have one, just restore to it ... I thought that's what you said you wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We make an OS partition image of every build on every machine ... that's my policy ... and, some of the slower machines take 7 or 8 minutes to do it. When a restoration is desired, it has never taken over 10 minutes on any of our machines. If yours takes
 longer, I would look into the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "in place upgrade" to go back to the RTM, is something that we don't have any occasion to use, but I did run it once to see what a poster was talking about, and when it was ready to install, it indicated that all programs would need to reinstalled, and
 that was all I was looking to find out, so I didn't let it proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"In what world do you live that you can easily go back? The built in processes only allow you to go back to the previous build you used, and that's only if it was less than 30 days ago".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't use the "built in" go back processes ... that is not only slow, but unreliable (if the OS is in trouble, how could one rely on it to "roll back"). We can go back whenever we wish ... that's the reason for the image ... and we can restore back again,
 whenever we wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use an imaging program that doesn't in the least use the OS either to make, or to restore the images. If a hard drive fails, it takes us a few minutes to physically put a new one in place, and 10 minutes or less to restore the desired build onto it, and
 the machine is back in operation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for data, all data here is kept in separate data partitions, so there's no updating of it needed ... I can restore a machine from 15014 to 14393, and the data is not effected ... I can open the accounting program in build 14393, and do the banking and
 stock buy/selling just as though I were in 15014. I can then restore the image of 15014, open the accounting program, and continue right where I left off in build 14393. The data remains safely unaffected by the changing from build to build, and is always
 being redundantly backed up to different drives, as well as online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say, in what world do I live, that I can easily go back? I live in the computer world, as I've described.

            <p>Ok, you guys don't seem to understand my question. Yes, I know how disk images work (though I do very much dispute your 5 minute number. What program are you using to do that?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's give myself as an example for the first scenario. I have NEVER been able to be on RTM. The insider program never allowed me and still doesn't allow me to go to RTM. So there has never been a windows 10 RTM build on this machine, I have never had an
 RTM image. I wasn't a beta tester for long or anything, I went to the RC build of windows 10 the month before general release to test it for my clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can't have had an RTM image of this machine. Ever. There is no "return point" to RTM, there never was. That's my question, how did you get one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario II: Say you are on RTM, and you try out some insider builds. They work 99% perfectly fine (Insider builds aren't for testing windows stability, they are for testing features and feedback, it's not a beta test, or an alpha test). A month passes by.
 Still seems fine, and you've gone through three builds. 2 weeks later and there's a new build that breaks something. Do you seriously just go back to the image from 45 days ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That image is woefully out of date. It doesn't have your settings anymore. It doesn't have your up to date programs. It doesn't have any bookmark changes you've made on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might say "well, I've got the data in another partition!", and yes that is theoretically possible. However, barring very, well, liberal use of junctions how do you keep it all synced? Also that doesn't help the app data itself remain synced at all. And
 even if you did this there comes a point where an old image is just plain out of date and not useful (several scenarios involving quickbooks come to mind). Not to mention there are programs which you can't really sync the data accross builds like that (some
 Outlook data you can't just keep separate, for example, it's part of the install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's my question, what do you do to keep all of that even remotely current? Do you seriously just boot your 4 or 5 images up a day and update them in sync? If that's the kind of **** that's recommended, no thank you. Again, as insider's we're not testing
 alpha code, we're testing near RC code. We test feature ideas and implementation differences to give our feedback, these aren't general stability tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, that ridiculous level of tedious image management is in no way needed. Even the builds in the fast ring are hardly broken. Rarely do they have major bugs. And if they do you can just report them and use the windows.old folder to go back to the previous
 build. The built in system protects you from 99% of the problems you might encounter. It's rather robust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, no, "in place upgrade" always keeps your apps and files. If the installer refuses to do that then it's not an "in place upgrade", you're just reformatting and reinstalling like normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, so I did some experimentation with different build ISOs, and you can't even use them to walk back to a previous build. I'm guessing the installer just doesn't recognize the build number so it flips its **** and says no. I wonder if it would be possible
 to trick it into thinking you were running a different build, and what that might break if you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point though, it's looking like a clean reinstall is my only option. Which is stupid. MS has a vehicle to allow us to switch between them, but just hasn't updated the RTM installer to allow it. If we could swap between the builds easily, then more
 people might become insiders. There would be almost no risk in it!</p>

            <p>I'm running Windows 10 in a virtual machine. I would never use preview software as my day-to-day operating system. The host computer runs Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running in a VM has two advantages:</p>
<p>1- I don't have to worry about any issues associated with the Technical Preview.</p>
<p>2- I can easily stay in the Insider program once I've installed the RTM on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running in a VM also has two disadvantages:<br />
1- Windows 10 runs a little slower than it would if it was installed on the hard drive.<br />
2- I can't test driver support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't care if Windows 10 runs a little slower. I'm only running it to see how it is.<br />
</p>
<p>As for driver support: I've already done the research so I know my hardware will work fine with Windows 10.</p>

            My test machine is an old HP tower, started with the first preview as a clean install have run every build as an upgrade after. This has more or less become my main everyday machine. I also have a custom built tower running 7 which will be upgraded as
 soon as MS releases the final. Looking forward to that as that machine is more powerful than my test machine so will be interesting to see how it runs.

    <title>Problem using E61 Remote Lock Function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ekwng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem using E61 Remote Lock Function</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
When I try to set the Remote lock passphrase, e61 asks for lockcode (12345 by default), once I entered an error message pops up... Unfortunately the pop-up message got covered up by another one but in the split second I think it says "...wrong...5 times..."
 So I try to reset the default 12345 lockcode but receive "General: system error"<br />
<br />
Is there a backdoor to reset the 12345 lockcode?<br />
<br />
I've also set a password for Mem card but makes no difference.. (According to Forum at My-Symbian you need to set a password or lockcode on both mem card and phone to enable this remote lock function.)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thx

<p>I agree that it was mobikwik's promotion but it must be a deal or something with Microsoft. Moreover we bought Lumia and got that offer so our first concern will be to microsoft. Mobikwik didn't offer us, still I had raised the issue with Mobikwik but no
 help. So I would request both Microsoft and Mobikwik to resolve it. Else both would lose our trust.</p>

<h2>            Setting up Rights Management</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to configure Rights Management on our Tenant in order to send secure emails.&nbsp; So far I have:</p>
<p>Activated it in Azure Portal</p>
<p>Ran the IRM configuration powershell commands</p>
<p>Ran the Aadrm configuration commands</p>
<p>Assigned user license (E3)</p>
<p><br />
When ever I try to use the "Share Protected"&nbsp; tab in Outlook 2016, I get prompted to log into Rights Management, then a message is displayed: "Your account was not found in your organization's directory"&nbsp; If I click the link to register it tells me I am already
 registered.</p>
<p>Final comment the 'test-IRMCconfiguration -sender xxxxxx@xxxxxx' (using the same account) cmlet returns PASS for everything.</p>
<p>Does anyone have an idea of how to troubleshoot this?&nbsp; Why does the Outlook client fail but the powershell work?</p>

<p>Note that the RMS sharing app does not support all email addresses and also Personal email addresses are not currently supported by the RMS sharing app.</p>

<p>Those are different things. The "Share protected" feature is added by the RMS sharing app. What you get with integrating RMS with Exchange is the functionality to configure permissions via the File -&gt; Set permissions button.

<p>hi steve,</p>
<p>i’d like to collect the following information to better understand the situation:<br />

<p>Sam, we are actually in the middle of our migration to Exchange and I have not had time to get back to you.</p>
<p>It turns out our problem was related to our DirSync setup. &nbsp;While upgrading to the new AD sync I found out we where not synching information for "Azure RMS". Once I enabled this things started working.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Steve</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a Expr1 Header of course has a control called Expr1<br />

            <p>You could use the DSum function as the ControlSource for that textbox.</p>
<p>I think in this case the subform is not going to be helpful, because you don't want to sum the subform rows, but only SOME of the subform rows.</p>

            <p>I think it is best to use the Sum function in a text box (named txtTotal)&nbsp;in the subform's Header or Footer section:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =Sum(IIf(Medication Like "*EPO*",Dose, 0)</p>
<p>to make sure the Sum is only over the records in the form's possibly filtered recordset.&nbsp;&nbsp;The text box and/or the form header/footer can be invisible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, to display that total in the main form text box,Text45, set its exprssion to something like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =[subform control name].Form.txtTotal<br />

            Hi Marshall,<br />
<br />
That seems to be what I need to do. <br />
There is a new issue!<br />
Some reports will be missing the subreport if no data has been entered in it.<br />
Then the text field on the main report has "Error" or "?Name"<br />
The [HasData] routine can work only if there IS a subreport with no data<br />
How can this be resolved?<br />
<br />
Could you please give me some guidance?<br />
Thanks<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>In that case the main report text box can use an expression like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; =IIf([subform control name].Report.HasData, [subform control name].Report.txtTotal, 0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get #Name, then you have an unrecognizable name in the expression.&nbsp; The usual&nbsp;reason&nbsp;is because&nbsp;the name of the subform control is different from the name of form object it displays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for using .Form when it should be .Report.&nbsp; Check to&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;you&nbsp;did not copy my mistake.</p>

            Thank you Marshall,<br />
No I did not use the "Form"<br />
It was the difference between the placeholder for the sub report and the name of the report.<br />
No matter what I tried it did not give me two diff names<br />
So I created a new control for the subreport and set the data and linking fields appropriately<br />
And that has solved the problems<br />
<br />
Thank you again so much<br />

<h2>            CreateProcess gives error file name incorrect</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
When I use EXCEL.exe to open a file ( here file name is in unicode character e.g Chinese ) using CreateProcess method, it gives me error saying file name is incorrect. But same type .docx file is&nbsp; opened by WINWORD.exe using CreateProcess method. What may be
 the issue here with CreateProcess ?<br />
If CreateProcess does not handle unicode file name using EXCEL.exe ?<br />

<p>I hope this will now let me into my account &amp; I still do not understand WHY you do not back up security code with two security questions ( What was my first dogs name ??? What was the name of first girl I kissed ETC)</p>
<p>Please let me into my e-mail today or I will just give up on Microsoft after many years</p>
<p>Thanks Douglas</p>
