<h2>            Unable to Purchase Adera Episode 2</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I downloaded and played Adera Episode 1 on my Windows 10 PC. I loved the game, so naturally, I clicked on the in-app option to&nbsp;Buy Episode 2. Unfortunately, when I click on Buy for $4.99 option on the next screen, it just returns to the previous screen.
 Has anyone else had the same experience? Was anyone able to download Episode 2? I was chatting with tech support all day, and the issue was not resolved.</p>

<p>So, this is how I solved this problem...</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled Xbox (through Power Shell), and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>2. Downloaded Xbox (from the Windows Store), installed Xbox, and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>3. Uninstalled Adera (right click on the app and select Uninstall), and restarted my computer.</p>
<p>4. Downloaded Adera (from the Windows Store)</p>
<p>5. The first time opening Adera, through the app, I clicked on Buy the Collectors Edition.</p>
<p>Viola!!!</p>

            Yes, CCleaner really works. Rather than spending the money taking the computer to a professional to find out what your teenager has been up to (and you know very well what he has been up to!), you should:<br />
<br />
1. First scan the computer completely for malware. There is a high probability it is infected since it is being used by a teenager.<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Create a free account at <a href="http://www.opendns.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OpenDNS</a> and set up your home network so that unsavory sites are blocked.<br />
<br />
3. Set up users in the recommended way below, setting a strong password for the administrative account(s).<br />
<br />
4. Depending on your circumstances, the general security information at the end of this post may also be applicable.<br />
<br />
If you find that doing all this work isn't your cup of tea (and it's perfectly OK to admit that; we all have our areas of expertise), then yes you should have a competent local professional come on-site and take care of this for you. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad
 type of place.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>General information about security</strong> - Any computer running any operating system can be accessed by someone with 1) physical access; 2) time; 3) skill; 4) tools. There are a few things you can do to make it a bit harder
 though:<br />
<br />
1. Set a password in the BIOS that must be entered before booting the operating system. Also set the Supervisor password in the BIOS so BIOS Setup can't be entered without it.<br />
<br />
2. From the BIOS, change the boot order to hard drive first.<br />
<br />
3. Set strong passwords on all accounts, including the built-in Administrator account in XP (it is disabled by default in Vista).<br />
<br />
4. If you leave your own account logged in, use the Windows Key + L to lock the computer (and/or set the screensaver/power saving) when you step away from the computer and require a password to resume.<br />
<br />
5. Make other users Limited accounts in XP Home, regular user accounts in XP Pro. All users should be on a Standard account in Vista with an Administrator account only used for elevation purposes.<br />
</span><br />
<span>Please understand that these are technical responses to what is basically a non-technical problem and there are ways around all of these precautions. This is a family/interpersonal issue that can't be solved by technical means.</span>

    <title>Cannot add google chrome to the list of exclusions on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgekufman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot add google chrome to the list of exclusions on windows 10 firewall</h2>
                    I add chrome to the list of programs on windows firewall but then when I turn the list again its not on it. Same with other programs I try to add. Firewall asks if I want to allow chrome every time I turn it on. I always say yes, but then it asks again.&nbsp;<br />
Also there is no program on that list - just names that look like windows features.&nbsp;<br />
How can I permanently add programs to this list?

            <p>Hi! After some time it turned out that the issue isn't solved. Still, whenever I start Chrome, Windows asks me if I want to allow chrome on private networks (as it did before).<br />
Also I noticed that each time I sign in to windows after restart, the speaker level (right-left ratio) settings are set to default (I tune it so the right speaker would be quieter than left - but after restart it becomes the same level and I have to tune it
 again). </p>
<p>I think that maybe both failures have something to do with memory related functions in windows.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot Fix Account on Windows 10 Mail App After Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ntnsv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Fix Account on Windows 10 Mail App After Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Anniversary Update, Windows kept on prompting me that my Exchange account in the Mail app is "<em>out of date</em>" and after selecting "<em>Fix account</em>" in the app itself, it would say, "<em>All done! Account was updated successfuly</em>"
 and simultaneously, on the lower-right corner, it would say that the settings are still out of date. I can't update my inbox because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>This prompt just showed up now and somehow the syncing is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, after a while, on the Mail app, I received another prompt saying, "<strong>This device doesn't meet the requirements set by your email administrator.</strong>" I am not sure if this is related to the changes in policy recently.<br />

            Same exact problem.&nbsp; Only it started when my domain work account required a password change.&nbsp; So it should have needed to prompt me the first time.&nbsp; But after entering the credentials and it appearing to be happy with them.&nbsp; Right back to the same thing
 the as soon as it tries to sync.&nbsp; Like it is not saving the new credentials.<br />

<p>You can install Windows 7 only on your Mac Mini if you want, but you will Boot Camp to do it. Boot Camp creates a special CD with all the drivers for components in Mac Mini and to also enable compatibility under Windows 7. The best way to execute this is
 to boot into OS X. Start the Boot Camp wizard (I believe this is located under Applications &gt; Utilities), follow the on screen instructions, you might have resize the partition temporarily before the driver CD is created (you can undo this after). After create
 the driver CD, launch Boot Camp again and remove the partition you created.</p>
<p>Next, boot from your Windows 7 DVD, you will need to format the partition.</p>
<p>Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)<br />
Click Drive Options<br />
Select the drive<br />
Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>After installation is complete, insert the Boot camp CD and launch the setup wizard.</p>
<p>If that does not work, click start, type: Device Manager</p>
<p>Right click each component that displays and exclamation sign</p>
<p>Click Update Driver</p>
<p>Follow the on screen wizard and point to where the drivers are located.</p>

<p>I'm getting the same issue with the disk based version. Got the chevo for rescuing Chico and haven't got any since. &nbsp;Any of you lot ever get the in-game message that it couldn't connect to the network? Wondering if that is the root to our problems.

<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling fixes. &nbsp; But you have to complete the objective again. &nbsp;So if you need an S rank you need to finish with S rank on a mission. &nbsp; Need last tape pick up any tape and it will unlock. etc etc.</p>

<p>This has happened to me as well. My best advice is to make sure you're connected to xbox live and to do a hard reset of your system. Unfortunately it seems like this game may have a few bugs so try to play the missions all the way through without going to
 the home screen or any type of interruption. Also be sure you're playing a fresh game meaning at the xbox one homescreen you pressed the menu button and went to quit if it was a viable option.

            <p>Notice that your error reads that you need permission to make "changes" to the file.&nbsp; Copying a file does not "change" the file, it only reads the file.&nbsp; Therefore, the permissions problem that you are experiencing is almost certainly at the destination
 end&nbsp;(folder) where you are trying to copy this file to.&nbsp; So, try right-clicking on folder in which you are trying to place this file, go to "Properties", and click the Security Tab.&nbsp; Verify that you have the permission that you need to place new files in the
 destination folder.&nbsp; And if a file by the same name happens to exist in the destination folder, verify that you have permission to delete or modify it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH, &amp; Good Luck,</p>

<h2>            Win8 BSOD re-install and still can&#39;t boot up, but ain&#39;t giving up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My challenge is a Lenovo H430 with Win8 MM. It has a tb of storage and I added RAM when I bought it, it has 8 G. Bought it early in 2013 and have never had it online and so have never had an issue with it. The issue now I can blame on myself, I removed a
 flash drive when the computer was shut down. This prevents it from booting up and gets me the BSOD unmountable boot volume. For the past several days I have been acclimating myself to the ironic "don't call us, we'll call you" customer service? at Microsoft
 and educating myself on possible resolves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo claims a one step recovery, but it would not activate. I interrupted a start up attempt , but a safe boot was not an option on any menu I looked through. I'd love to keep current data in tact, but not at the cost of healing the computer. So, with
 that decision already made I downloaded a media creation tool and put a fresh download of Win8.1 on a flash drive. It started doing its thing and I chose a language and agreed to terms, but that was the extent of the progress. The computer still cannot successfully
 bootup, and if it doesn't give the BSOD, then it never gets past "creating automatic repair". The path I should follow from here is not clear to me and I do wish to have a functioning computer again. I am requesting guidance from any with the wisdom to know
 the direction I must take. I am willing to fight the virtual agent to the death in hand to hand combat if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Craig</p>

<h3> cadillacsnow  say:</h3>
<h2>            May 2011 XBOX Live Update Destroyed my Firmware&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This latest Update has crippled my XBOX and it wont even play DVDs now.</p>
<p>What does Microsoft plan to do about this? </p>
<p>After being a loyal Gold member and JUST buying a one year membership THIS MONTH, I am OUTRAGED.</p>
<p>I rave on and on about the benefits of paying for Gold membership instead of playing PSN (Play Station Network) Free of charge.</p>
<p>These forced updates are rediculous especially to international customers who have no access to the content on XBOX Live Marketplace pr netflix or anything else.</p>
<p>The only thing we have is to play our favorite games online and now with the greed of Microsoft trying to implement another payment method, they have disabled their</p>
<p>most loyal customers, promoters and advocates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it aint broke, Dont FORCE us to fix it!!</p>

<p>Well I'd love for them to hurry up and either fix the problem or send me and xbox, cause im new to the xbox world, i've only had one for about 2 months now, then this happens. I figured they would have learned after PSN whole problem not to mess things up.
 i expected more from them, i really did. And come to find out this morning, no reply via email, yesterday lines were too busy. Are they ignoring us!?</p>

<p>Have any of you guys checked the news? The new update only affects some older models of Xbox360 negatively and Microsoft has already offered to replace your xbox with a new 360 S with a 250 GB harddrive if your xbox is one of the affected units.

    <title>Why does my cursor automatically move to the left of my desktop in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjschlitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my cursor automatically move to the left of my desktop in Windows 8 using a Acer Aspire laptop no matter what I am typing and how to I change that&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My mouse pointer moves to the left of the window that I have open no matter if I am in outlook or any other program.&nbsp; I use a USB mouse that is wireless and have clicked the diable button on the pad mouse.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not like a full screen on any program open
 as I like to see my different windows open and easily get to them.&nbsp; This same windows 8 loves to stretch each window to full screen to show it is smarter and knows better what I want than I do.&nbsp; How do I make the mouse&nbsp; stay where I am typing rather thann
 to decide to move all the way to the desktop left into just space.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the future of windows ...I will need to change back to a Mac... They at least don't make their programs think that they know what we want to do better than we do.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have wanted to send this laptop sailing through the air like a Frisbee due to
 the stupidity of the programming of Windows 8!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise if you know how to fix this ridiculous mouse issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>Bitlocker and Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob-nicholson-malt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker and Azure Active Directory</h2>
                    <p>When setting up Bitlocker on an Azure AD connected device, you have the following options:&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/MHbPBu6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/MHbPBu6.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A question about the exact wording of "Save to your cloud domain account". IMO that's not totally clear where it stores it. It infers, to me, that it would save it against my user domain account. However, I suspect it's saved against the device in Azure
 AD as that's the only place I can see this. Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, the laptops are set-up by IT using their own account and a key step is to save the Bitlocker key. However, when a user first logs on, we also save it there. I suspect this later step is not needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supplemental question - on the page linked below (which is the link from the Bitlocker screen), it says to access your Microsoft Azure account to get the Bitlocker key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026181/windows-10-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026181/windows-10-find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I also confirm that this misleading for normal users as the profile page that this takes you to has&nbsp;<em>no</em> information about Bitlocker:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/MeWkcdN.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/MeWkcdN.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And that the only way a user can retrieve their Bitlocker recovery key is to ask an admin with access to the Azure portal to look it up based upon their computer name?</p>

            Hi Rob-Nicholson-Malt
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />On-premise domain accounts and Azure AD accounts are 2 separate accounts that you can login with.
<br />You can join your PC to both Onprem AD and Azure AD.
<br />What makes the difference is which one you login in with.
<br />For my example let's say my work\onprem account is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and my Azure AD account is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
<br />If i login with the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then i am authenticating to my onprem servers.
<br />If I login with the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then i am authenticating to Azure AD.
<br />
<br />So as for your questions when you enable bitlocker which account are you logged in with?  onprem or azure AD?
<br />And if onprem i hope you have a GPO on your DCs that says recovery key stored in Active Directory.  If that is the case then you don't have to worry about saving it to the cloud and yes IT staff would retrieve the key from the computer object for the user.
<br />If they are logging in with their Azure AD account and enabling bitlocker then same thing IT will get it from the Devices in Azure AD.

<h2>            Installing Word on a new computer.</h2>
                    In April, 2016 I bought a basic edition of Word (for students) directly from the MS website and downloaded it onto the computer I had at that time. I was under the impression when I purchased it that I could reinstall the program if need be, or install
 it on a new computer. For $85, that seemed reasonable. My old computer gave up the ghost, I have a new machine and want to download the program onto the new computer. The purchase is recorded in my account order history on my MS account. But I don't see any
 method of doing so. I'm not a geek. How do I get the program to download onto my new computer? Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi Pamela, can I assume you had Office 2016?
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.office.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />If you're not already signed in with the Microsoft account associated with your copy of Office do that now.
<br />
<br /> If you're signed in with a different account, sign out of that and then sign in again with the correct Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />In the Install Information section, select Install. 
<br />
<br />This begins the process to install the 32-bit version of Office on your PC using the language you selected when you redeemed the product.
<br />
<br />f you'd like to install the 64-bit version instead, choose Additional install options &gt; Office (64-bit), and then select Install.
<br />
<br />Depending on your browser, click Run (in Edge or Internet Explorer), Setup (in Chrome), or Save File (in Firefox).
<br />
<br />When you see "You're good to go", choose All done!

<p>Hi, Dave :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I didn't have Office. Didn't need all the extra stuff that goes with Office, just wanted Word so I could use it to print out letters and so forth. The version I bought was a non-commercial/"student" version of Word, nothing else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several months after I purchased the program (which I downloaded from the MS website, no disc) I had to do a reset on my old computer and did do a reinstall at that time. Don't remember how I did it but by MS website standards it was fairly uncomplicated.
 Like, sure, you bought this and can get it back as many times as you need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have a different computer and can't find any method of installing basic Word on it. All I see is Office, which I did *not* purchase and don't want. I just want what I have already bought and paid for - Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! Pam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Andre :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't purchase Office. I bought a non-commercial "student" version of Word. Just Word. And Word is all I want. I don't do spreadsheets and other stuff. I just use it to write letters to snail mail other old fart friends who are not online and don't have
 computers. Easier to read than my handwriting, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, all I bought was Word and that is all I want - Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to reinstall it once on my old computer after it crashed and burned on me, and I remember that being fairly simple. But now I have a new machine and cannot see any method of downloading Word onto this machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything that helps on this matter is appreciated as long as it is not written in Geeklish, which I don't speak very well :-)</p>
<p>

            Do you remember the version of Microsoft Word?
<br />
<br />Please note, if its Word Starter 2010, its not compatible with Windows 10.

<p>Hi, Andre :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to wing it and try going through the Office download, although I didn't think that was what I was looking for. To my surprise the Word 2016/ "Student" version I had popped right up and it only took a couple of minutes to download. I am tickled
 pink (and all sorts of other colors as well!) I have Word back! :-D Thank you, have a nice Thanksgiving :-).</p>
