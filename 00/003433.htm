<h2>            WORD 2011 Mac - How to keep full background color when converting to PDF</h2>
                    <p>On my WORD doc, the entire background is black, which is how I set it. &nbsp;When converting it to PDF, the resulting PDF has a white border all the way around the background color I selected, like a frame. &nbsp;I have checked in PREFERENCES, "keep background color".
 &nbsp;I checked borderless printing in printing dialogue box. &nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>If you're reference to "... borderless printing in printing dialogue box" means the option on the Print Settings or the Paper Handling pane, those do not override the Page Setup spec of the Word document... IOW, that control of the print driver will not
<em>stretch</em> the document &amp; by design a word processing program does not default to borderless printing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may not have to go quite to the extent described by Daniel, depending on your document dimensions &amp; printer capabilities. Many printers now offer a Borderless option for several standard paper sizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As he suggested, in File&gt; Page Setup open the Paper Size List to see if there is a ▶ at the right of the paper size of your document. If there is, point to that listing to open a sublisting... choose the Borderless option if there is one.<br />

<h2>            I need to insert a varaible number of rows based on a value in a cell.</h2>
                    I need to insert a varaible number of rows based on a value in a cell. I have a worksheet that feeds a mail merge in word to create labels. however I can only get 1&nbsp;label to print per row in excel. Each row contains a quantity field&nbsp; and the value of this
 cell must determine how many duplicate labels need to print.&nbsp;So, I am thinking I need to look at each row, and if the Qty &gt;1 insert Qty-1 rows and then copy the oringinal line down Qty-1 times (into inserted roes)&nbsp;this must happen for each row in the table.
 Any help to make this happen in vba would be&nbsp;very appriciated. (please assume i am an idiot, and you may be pleasently supprised). Also if this easier to to do in Word, let&nbsp;me know, however the mailmerge template is company standard.&nbsp;

I would do this in a "non destructive" fashion by putting the&nbsp;result in a separate worksheet.&nbsp; So, suppose the number of labels you want for each row is in the first column and the data start with row 2 (row 1 being a header).</p>

    <title>E51 poor WLAN performance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bohjaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            E51 poor WLAN performance</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
We have bought a bunch of E51 devices. We mainly use these devices for Voip internet calls to our Voip provider (Voipro in Netherlands). We use the embedded SIP client and we have the most current firmware (100.34.20).<br />
<br />
SIP setup is done quite easily with instructions of our provider. The phone also connect to our provider (I think it is an asterisk server) with no problems, and I can make phonecalls and receive calls.<br />
The problem is that the connection to our WLAN network is not stable enough to continuous keep connected. Sometimes we are disconnected but the logo of internet telephony (small world with phone hook) is still on display. This is confusing because the user
 thinks it is still connected.<br />
How do I know the WLAN connection is poor? When I ping the phone continuously I receive many request timed out, like this:<br />
<br />
Request timed out.<br />

<br />
You can imagine that at some point the connection to the provider will be lost. I am not even talking what is happening during a conversation.<br />
Our Wlan is created with several Linksys WAP200 AP. They all have the same SSID (not hidden) and WEP authntication. They all operate on different WiFi channel. We know this setup is not ideal for voice, especially roaming from one AP to another give problem,
 but already accepted that.<br />
But we have also some WLAN-only voip phones from Hitachi and they work good, they never give back a request timed out when I ping them for long time.<br />
I just want to know how I can adjust some settings of the WLAN connectivity so it don't give me back timed out reply's anymore.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I also tried to stop power saving mode on the phone, but that does not help, it only showed replys with less time.

            At home it work a lot better. There I also sometimes I receive a request timed out, but much less than in our office. At home I have a Sitecom router.<br />
<br />
Is it possible there is still an issue with Linksys WAP200 routers?? And what about channel interference? I don't have any neigbour network here, and our 7 AP use different channels.

Now , the request timed outs explain why i can't always see his wlan available , but there are some other wlans ( which i don't have access to , unfortunately ) which i always detect , so this makes me think it's not a phone hardware issue , rather an incompatibility
 one.<br />
<br />
All my settings are ok and i actually managed to load up a page or two , but afterwards i get disconnected and i have to reconnect. The signal strength doesn't seem to be an issue since i am 2 meters away from the actual router ( though i even tried placing
 the phone on the router , and i couldn't see any difference ).<br />
<br />
The router is working just fine since a laptop was able to connect just fine to the wlan and it didn't receive any request timed outs , just replies of 1ms.<br />
<br />
I hope someone can shed some light on this issue , because the wi-fi was one of the most important factors i took into consideration when i decided to buy the phone.

            You write it works better at home with your Sitecom router.<br />
<br />
So there seem to be 2 possibilities.<br />
<br />
1. An interoperability issue between E51 and WAP200. The reason can of course be on either side. I don't know the WAP200. According to the web it has some range booster functionality. Not sure what is. But if it's a proprietary change to the modulation or protocol,
 I'd try to turn it off, and use standard 802.11g mode.<br />
<br />
2. A radio environment issue. You write that all your APs are on different channels. I assume you know that WLAN channels are overlapping and you should only use channels 1, 6 or 11 or 1, 5, 9, and 13 in Europe. And all WLAN networks in the area should obey
 the same convention (which might be challenging, but a couple of "violators" don't cause a catastrophy yet)<br />
<br />
If you can take one of the WAP200 home for a weekend and/or take your Sitecom to the office you should be able to narrow down the problem a bit.<br />
<br />
You don't happen to have a Cisco access point (you can borrow)? It has a channel utilization measurement, i. e. tells you how busy each WLAN channel is.<br />
<br />
<br />
You wrote you got disconnected, but the VoIP globe was still visible. What do you mean by disconnected? I understood this was not during a call.<br />
<br />
Just for curiosity: What is the exact type of your Hitachi VoIP phones?

            Thanks for the replys:<br />
<br />
I have seen some good advises. First of all I think 2night I will bring one wap200 to my home and play there for a while. Have a look what the performance will be there.<br />
I don't know anybody with Cisco AP's unfortunately. Is there no other tool to check how crowded the WLAN channels are? I have network stumbler, but it don't give me so much good information. I also have borrowed the airmagnet analyzer software but they have
 a short list of compatible wifi adapters and I don't have any on the list, too bad.<br />
<br />
I will play some more with channels and have a look if I can disable rangebooster (but I have not seen I can turn it off) I think Linksys just call this feature beacuse it has 2 big antennas.<br />
<br />
Yes sometimes we still see the VOIP logo on the screen but we are not connected to our SIP server, I know this because I have a admin portal for all our phones, and I can see status of all phones. Also when I call my phone from outside I go to voicemail immediately<br />
<br />
We have Hitachi wIP 5000 phones. Wlan connection is quite good but also we receive some complaints from users that conversations are disconnected. So definately there is something wrong with our WLAN enviroment in general.

            Sorry I'm still not sure that I have understood your "disconnected" case.<br />
<br />
So the VoIP server thinks you are disconnected, I got it so far.<br />
<br />
But the headline of this posting says "poor WLAN performace". So what I would be interested in, is WLAN connected or disconnected in this state? There is the WLAN indicator on the idle screen (not sure how to describe the icon, but I guess you know what I mean)
 and there is the connection manager. What do they say about your WLAN connection when the problem occurs?<br />
<br />
And no, I don't know any other way to measure channel utilization. I guess the WLAN network planning tools contain it, but I have never seen such a tool myself. And they are probably an order of magnitude more expensive than a Cisco access point :)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried changing Date/Time Settings.&nbsp; I changed them to a different date and then back to the autosync internet date/time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ive also followed the instructions you posted before.&nbsp; Ive removed all profiles, accounts and data files and then added them back in.&nbsp; I was able to get it to work using a POP manual setup but I want the MAPI setup to work because I liked the syncronization
 with my msn email account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for writing your suggestions!</p>

<p>For the last 20 days or so we are trying to connect the phones E7 and E6 to the corporate WiFi network. We have succeeded to connect all other brands and devices such as Android, WM, iphone, but for some reason there is no successful negotiation with the

            The data is shared among 3 separate computers. Moving the data to the local drive is not an option.&nbsp; The odd thing is, one of the XP computers does not get the popup.

            Either copy the frontend to another trusted location to test or create a simple Access file with some code in each folder and open it. This might determine if there is an issue.

            Field Medic slows down the phone, yes. However, you need one of those freezes, to see something in the log. If the phone gets too slow and/or the freezes do not happen, half the number of ETW providers until you are able to log a freeze again.

<p>Also what firewall do you use? If it offers SMTP filtering, the problem could be with it and that may be configurable.

            Are you sure its in the minority? I have been seeing quite a few posts about this around the web, especially the freezing issue. Don't get me wrong, I have been trying to switch people to WP since 7.0...and I really want to love this phone. I guess I will
 send it in for repair. Thanks anyway!

            So tried both hard and soft resets, no fix. Took my phone back to rogers, and they sent it to nokia for repair. I get the phone back, and guess what....none off the issues were fixed. Very dissapointed in both the phone and service from nokia at this point.
 Regretting not going with the htc or samsung ativ at this point.

<p>Ok. &nbsp;So i sent it back to Nokia for a second time and received it back in working condition this time. &nbsp;However, today I went to send a text and for the third time my phone will no longer rotate. &nbsp;I guess I will now deal directly with Nokia. I am assuming
 that they are just doing something very basic such as flashing the drive, and then not testing it properly afterwards. &nbsp;I should have been sent a new phone after having send it in for the second time. &nbsp;Very dissappointed in the service from Nokia.&nbsp;</p>

            Just installed Win 10 Preview. Can connect to the internet via Ethernet, but WiFi is turned off. The wireless adapter (Broadcom) is operating fine (per Device Manager). Not sure how to turn WiFi on. This was not a problem under Windows 8.1.

            For me the issue is different. I cannot connect to my home network wifi. However, when I turn on the personal hotspot from iPhone or Windows Phone, the system connects to the wifi properly. So I guess it's not a trouble with the wifi adapter or device
 manager. Tried "forget the network" and reconnect options. Still does not work on the home network where as works perfectly on the hotspot. I do not have any other connection method for now. I need to arrange for a cable to connect through ethernet and check.
 Will check and post results if it connects. Any one else getting into similar issues?

<h3> kieranwilkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t remove debit card</h2>
                    Everytime I go to delete my card it states " <br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">You can’t remove a card associated with your Zune Music Pass subscription. You can switch your billing
 to a new card, however.&nbsp;"</span>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
</span></div>
<div>Now... I wouldn't mind, however I don't &nbsp;have a music pass and never have. Furthermore, when I click the link to edit my&nbsp;subscriptions&nbsp;it brings up payment options to BUY a zune pass.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't want and never have wanted a zune pass, I just want to remove my debit card from the account.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi tojo,</p>

</p><p>Change your New tab setting in IE to use a blank page instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;General tab, Tabs section, click the Tabs button, change
</p>
<p>"When a new tab is opened" to "use a blank page".</p>

<p>If you are using a work computer (most probably your IT department is blocking msn.com or they are not using windows hello or you have placed msn.com in your IE trusted sites list), contact your company IT department... they will need to change your user
 profile settings so that the above setting is applied to everyone using a work computer.</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com with iOS Outlook app - limited number of emails being synced</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my Outook.com account set up within the iOS Outlook app.&nbsp; Things generally are working fine.&nbsp; However, I notice that only about a weeks worth of emails are ever displayed in the Outlook app (yes I have looked in the Focused and Other tabs).&nbsp; Anything
 older is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my outlook.com emails are there when I use the native iOS email app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting somewhere within the app that limits the number of emails being synced.&nbsp; Within the actual 'Mail, Contacts, Calendars' section in the iOS General settings, for my Outlook.com account - the 'Mail Days to Sync' setting is set to 'No Limit'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I have this issue as well. &nbsp;Not sure of time frame, but items about a month old or older are no longer appearing in Inbox. &nbsp;This is recent change with update 2.1.7. &nbsp;I think there is a problem with the update.

            <p>I realize this post is old but hopefully someone currently having this problem will find this in a search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, disabling POP in Outlook (via the web site) resolved the problem. Hope it helps you too. However, if you use any 3rd party mail clients that rely on POP this won't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to options &gt; connect devices and apps with POP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once there, disable POP. All my emails were now available in Outlook app. I don't use Apple's iOS mail client.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the confusion. When you mentioned preview in Outlook, are you referring to Outlook.com interface?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you also provide us a detailed steps that led you to "a preview in Outlook instead of a browser" for us to understand this issue more clearly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi JanKara_P, <br />
I was referring to the Outlook.com mobile app for Android.<br />
<br />
The problem is when I select an outside link within a message. Instead of offering to open the link in my browser. The link opens in the app.<br />
<br />
How can I change this?<br />
