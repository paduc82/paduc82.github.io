<h2>            Outlook 2016 error&#58; 0x80040119</h2>
                    <p>How do I resolve my 0x80040119 error. I opened a new mail account, but I have no map where the mail I have sent is saved in. I have other accounts without any problems.</p>
<p>My error locator indicated that either is Outlook offline or the e-mail servern does not permit mail being saved in the map sent (which I don't have). I need detailed descriptions how to solve the problem. Hat lifted for all assisting hands.</p>

<h2>            Kindle Fire 7 and Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I bought a set of Kindle Fire 7's for my kids, and installed Skype so that they can call/video/text me.&nbsp; I am able to send messages in Skype to and from the Kindle, and am also able to initiate a voice or video call.&nbsp; However, when I attempt to answer
 the voice/video call from either side (Kindle or other device) the Kindle screen goes white, then returns to the contact messenger screen without connecting the call.&nbsp; On the other device I just see a spinning wheel as it tries to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a number of inquiries on this site that suggest there are issues with Kindle and Skype.&nbsp; Am I having the same problem as others?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Deleted emails by someone else</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a HUGE problem right now. I had a folder with 2500 messages from the same person. Those emails are court proofs that I need asap. Somehow she figured out my password / installed a key logger / or took access from my computer.<br />
<br />
I REALLY need to recover those emails. Is there somewhere I can call @ microsoft? Can someone can recover those deleted emails?!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a big issue concerning my account.<br />
My ex-girl friend hijacked my account deleting ALL my received and sent emails from her multiple account that I started to save 10 years ago. Those emails were proofs that she took a lot of drugs and her aggressive behavior.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have corporal damage since the incident, and I need those emails in court.<br />
my email account is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
<br />
'Sent' folder had about 1500 emails in it<br />
'Tite Fille' folder had way over 2500 emails in it (approximately 2700)<br />
<br />
My 'delete option' was set at OFF. But I'm sure microsoft has backups of those.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help<br />
regards,<br />
<br />

            I'm aware of that 'recover tool', but it was set at 'OFF' when this happened.<br />
<br />
I've talked to Neil S. on chat yesterday concerning my Hijack, we founded that the person who did that left some traces about his identity. So he told me to re enable that recovery feature, but unsuccessful for the current task i wished to do.<br />
<br />
He even told me that the personnel of the court can call the Microsoft 'cyber crimes' hotline to retrieve the log file to see the activity on the account for a given period of time.<br />
<br />
So I need a system administrator to recover those emails for me, there must be a backup somewhere for sure on their servers. I asked for something similar in the past when it was simply 'hotmail' and they succeeded the retrieval of those lost emails.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t recover my account&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hotmail account that I'm desperately trying to log into for several reasons. (One of them being it's linked to one of my social media accounts and I need to get my forgotten password!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had any issues with logging into this account, but today I couldn't and I got a message saying something strange happened or that I was using a different device yadayadayada. This really bugs me because I'm pretty sure I've logged into the account
 with the phone I'm using right now, and I even tried logging into the account with the computer I know for sure I've used it on but it didn't work! I know my password, so why is this happening??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried recovering the account by filling out a form (two times) but the information I provided wasn't enough.. I can't fill out another form because I don't really have the information that's needed. I typed in a random birthdate when I made the account
 and I didn't use my real name, all the information I can provide is in which country I created it, emails linked to it and social media accounts that are linked to it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? I need to log into this account, and I assure you I'm the owner of it! :/</p>

 the code, you can initiate the "Change password" process of Microsoft. You can do this by following the steps
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, did you add a phone number or an alternate email address when you created your account? If so, do you still have access to these information? If you're still using the phone number or the email address that you've added as the security information
 of your Microsoft account, we highly suggest that you use these to get the code. This will allow you to easily access your account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have access to these information or if you did not add a phone number or an alternate email address when you created your account, the next step that you can do to log-in to your account again is by filling out the account recovery form.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t print anything out of excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t qa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print anything out of excel</h2>
                    <p>I can print out of other office products (outlook, word) and can print the file to .pdf. I've tried repair/diagnosis, detect &amp; repair, I've blown out the printer and driver and reinstalled, I've even taken the computer in to service for clean up. I've been
 through excel options and either there is no option there or I'm not seeing it besides print quality for graphics.</p>
<p>Running a dell laptop tied into a small business network with network printer; Windows Vista and Office 2007. Another person is having the same issue with Office 2003. It seemed to work previously then could only find one file that would print and now it
 won't print either. I can send any excel file to other users in the network and they can print out without any problems.</p>
<p>I've looked into other forums but most of them seem to deal with printier paper going through with little/no information. It appears that the document doesn't even hit the printer que. The printer icon shows up on the bottom tool bar but hover over it or
 open and it shows "0 Documents pending..."</p>
<p>Thoughts, suggestions comments?</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>If you press Ctrl+P, do you get the print dialogue box? If you open a new worksheet, enter something in a cell, can you get that to print?</p>
<p>Are you only using a network printer? Do you have a local printer to test?</p>
<p>Since you are in a small business network, do you have an IT staff or a on-call computer tech to come and test in your enviornment? This will probably be the best solution for you...</p>
<p>Maybe someone else may have some ideas for you...another option would be to try the technet forum. They focus on business/network users/issues.</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried Ctrl+P which takes me to the print dialogue box that you would get going through the windows print function. Same result though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only have a network printer, do not have a local printer although I strongly suspect that the issue is between excel and the network printer as you suggested. I can print out of all other Office products including word, powerpoint, outlook, no problems whatsoever.
 It is just excel that is giving me the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried selecting print area/print cell/resizing, resetting the print range, selecting what to print (all options)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughts, I'll keep on poking away at it.</p>

            To clarify, my old post was in response to someone whose document wouldn't stop continuously repaginating, which took up so much CPU time that editing was impossible. That situation indicates document corruption.<br />
<br />
If you see a message about repagination only briefly and occasionally, that's normal. Every time you make any kind of change in the document, Word recalculates the line endings and page breaks to keep up with it. It is possible to turn off repagination only
 when you're using Normal view or Outline view, by going to Tools &gt; Options &gt; General and clearing the check box for "Background repagination". As soon as you switch to any other view, that check box will automatically be checked and grayed out.<br />

Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to do this is with a userform with a textbox on it. Text boxes on userforms have a passowrd mask setting where you can define the mask ccharacter as *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you give us some details about what's on this worksheet and what you want to happen when you've captured this password then someone will help you set it up.</p>

                    <p>Is there anything like slmgr /dlv command (which works for Windows) &nbsp;for Office 2013 to view the detailed licensing details for Office 2013?</p>

            <p>Office 2013 has two licence keys. The first One is really the Redemption Key, that is the 25 character key that you used to install your Office 2013 when you installed a onetime payment version of Office 2013.&nbsp; You can access the last five characters of
 this key.&nbsp; See <a href="https://support.office.com/en-GB/article/Manage-multiple-one-time-purchase-Office-installs-that-use-the-same-Microsoft-account-b2897d43-9ec1-4040-9cf0-2bafa416e071?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-GB&amp;ad=GB&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
This article</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also find the last five characters by installing the free version of
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Belarc Advisor</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the real Product Key by signing in at your Office Account at: <span>
<a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a> &nbsp; and clicking on&gt;Install from disc&gt;Then on&gt;I have a disc (or on one of the other choices)&gt; You will not see on the right hand side&gt;View your
 product key&gt;Click on that and it will reveal the 25 character Product Key for your Office 2013. As stated above this is not the Redemption/Product key that you used to redeem your Office 2013.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you Palcouk &amp; RonBarker for your replies. Basically I was looking for any command that can summarize the product licensing information for office 2013 if it exists? I thought there should be something available on similar lines of how slmgr.vbs /dlv
 works for Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested to see a snapshot that can be exported to a file from command line and it can have all related info like Type/Edition &nbsp;(Retail/Volume), activation id if relevant, license activation status and just in case itâ€™s in &nbsp;grace period in case the
 product is yet to be activated etc.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>cscript â€œC:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\OSPP.VBSâ€ /dstatus</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now for the Product information/Activation status&nbsp;as Palcouk mentioned:</p>
<p>just open one of your office 2013 apps (e.g. blank word) &gt;FILE TAB&gt;ACCOUNT&gt; on the right side, you should see the product information: (edition of office, if &nbsp;it is activated or not) and just click on about word to view Product ID.</p>

                    <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>how can i put several footnotes in one line, instead of one per line (word 2016 or 2013)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. It seems I can hide the pmark in print for each footnote, but there should be an automatic way to do this, also I need to avoid the blank space.</p>

    <title>Excel Columns are gone. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonim b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Columns are gone.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
I have worked with many versions of Excel, this is the first time I've experienced this issue - but it's happened twice now; I certainly want to stop it before the 3rd time!
<br />
<br />
I'm newly using Excel 2010. This spreadsheet is a work-in-progress, originally started in Excel 2007.&nbsp; I routinely hide and unhide columns depending on what I need to see, printing requirements, etc. It's likely that I had hidden some columns then saved the
 spreadsheet but I've done that many time without issue in the past.&nbsp; For the second time now though 4 of the columns are now completely gone.&nbsp; The lettering is correct (so no indication that they are still hidden), there is no info there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just doing
 a basic database, sums, etc but nothing fancy, no macros, nothing.&nbsp; It did include addresses that I mailmerged with Word (those are what is missing),&nbsp;a few notes and dates, and other info columns.<br />
<br />
Any idea how this happened?&nbsp; I'm presuming the data is long gone....&nbsp; I did check the "Inspect Document" results - nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing -- I had been doing the exact same things with the file using the 07 version, never had an issue.&nbsp; It's happened twice in the last 3 weeks with the 2010 version though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help/insight!<br />
<br />
Toni </p>

            <p>For example, let's say your hidden columns were E, F, G and H, and now you are seeing Columns identified as A B C D E F G H and I&nbsp; but the data from E:H is completely gone, and information from columns I to right edge of the sheet have been moved left just
 as if E:H had been selected and then a delete columns had been performed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DO NOT have any suggestion for you.&nbsp; I haven't seen this type of behavior, <em>
but</em> I don't have any mail merges set up using Excel 2010 and that may be a player in this.&nbsp; I noticed that you got a "me too" indication in your post which would say at least one other person has a similar problem.&nbsp; It would have been nice if they'd described
 their situation, especially if it also involved Mail Merging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had some suggestion for you, I simply don't, I just wanted to get a clearer picture of what you've experienced.</p>

            <p>Yes, that's exactly what happened.&nbsp; Thanks for clarifying.&nbsp; This was the first time I've seen it too, although I've been doing similar work over the years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time, I presumed I made some sort of crazy mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;After it happened a&nbsp;second time, though, I really would like to figure out what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A (quick) internet search showed that it is seemingly also&nbsp;happening with missing rows and 2010; there are also one or 2 posts referring to the same thing but the responses were mixed with people who just didn't know about hidden columns and/or how to unhide.</p>

<p>If you could set up a small test scenario file and at least relatively consistently reproduce the 'failure', that would be awesome for someone - except maybe the Excel development team :).&nbsp; You'd need to detail the procedures needed to perform the sheet
 setup and then produce the error.</p>

            <p>Simply explain how they'd set up a workbook/worksheet to get ready to duplicate the problem.&nbsp; Something like:</p>
<p>Open new workbook.&nbsp; On a sheet, set up these columns:</p>
<p>Column A: A1 label = "Names"&nbsp; holds text entries (names)</p>
<p>Column B: B1 label = "DOB" holds dates (date of birth)</p>
<p>Column C: C1 label = "Age"&nbsp; has formula to calculate age and show the formula for a row</p>
<p>continue until you've explained about what is in the various columns </p>
<p>then detail the process you use to hide which of the columns</p>
<p>and then what actions to take to try to duplicate the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could post a sample workbook that has the problem - but in the pre-disappearing column state to one of the free file hosting sites and post a link to it here and tell people how to try to duplicate the problem.</p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Add-ons are apps that Internet Explorer uses to interact with web content like videos and games. Some common add-ons are Adobe Flash, Quicktime, and Silverlight. Several add-ons come pre-installed in Internet Explorer, but many have
 to be downloaded from the Internet. Add-ons usually require that you give your permission before they're installed on your computer. However, some might be installed without your knowledge. This can happen if the add-on was part of another program that you
 installed.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Sometimes a website you're visiting doesn't look like you expect it to. Images might not show up, menus might be out of place, and text boxes could be jumbled together. This can be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet
 Explorer and the site you're on. When a site is incompatible with Internet Explorer, you'll see the Compatibility View button in the Address bar. You can only turn on Compatibility View in Internet Explorer for the desktop.</font></p>

            <p>Guys, I just bought this Asus notebook from Kuala Lumpur. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>not knowing how to use Windows 8 I went to desktop view/interface (windows + D) to use Internet Explorer. I could access my gmail account but everytime I tried to attachÃ© a file, it would stop working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, is there a way to fix this problem ? I am not a techie. I most certainly had no time to put add ons and stuff. I did manage to install an antivirus (titanium). So the notebook is "pristine".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is this a bug with Asus, IE or Windows&nbsp;8 ? All I want to know is how to get a link to a place that will fix this bug ?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was very annoying, it took me 2 hours to search for a forum that finally helped me realise that if I go to windows 8 interface and launch internet explorer from there, then and only then I could attach files to my web based email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The response given to the earlier question does not help me. because after clearing the history and the cache and disabling add ons, the problem still exists when I use IE launched through the desktop.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Bwoodruff2825,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Which version on Internet Explorer are you using?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Which version of the Operating System are you using (32bit or 64bit&nbsp;OS)?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If its 64bit, you may try to use 32bit Internet Explorer and check what happens.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also websites that were designed for earlier versions of Internet Explorer might not display correctly in the current version. However, you can often
 improve how a website will look in Internet Explorer by using a new feature called
<em>Compatibility View</em>. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Compatibility view applies to Internet Explorer 8.</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>To turn on Internet Explorer Compatibility View</span></span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.
</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Tools</strong> button, and then click <strong>Compatibility View</strong>.</span></span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>If Internet Explorer recognizes a webpage that is not compatible, you will see the Compatibility View button on the Address bar. To turn Compatibility
 View on or off, click the <strong>Compatibility View</strong> button.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<h3> koltonroot  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIX THIS - Facebook, Google &#38; LinkedIn Groups in Outlook.com that Cannot be Deleted&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been battling this issue for YEARS now. The support agents (both on chat and on this forum) are useless. I do not want to be directed to a random help article that does nothing. READ my problem below, and SUGGEST a solution that actually works, or
 FORWARD THE PROBLEM TO AN ENGINEER that can finally fix it. I have found countless forums (especially on this site) asking for help where people are ignored or given boilerplate replies from MSFT reps that are irrelevant. Please don't repeat these forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back when Outlook.com allowed you to connect your account to Facebook, Google and LinkedIn to have contacts synced to your People/Outlook account, separate "groups" have been created in my outlook.com account. However, the services that linked the contact
 have since been discontinued, and users are left with groups they cannot delete or do anything about, and yet continue to show up on their account and the devices they sync it to. More recently, Microsoft seems to have manually removed the Skype group, which
 used to have the same problem, but the other three (Facebook, Google and LinkedIn) persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want these groups GONE from my account. I do not want to see them sync to the contacts client on my iPhone. I do not want to see them in my Outlook Win32 mail client. I do not want them ON MY ACCOUNT. The most recent outlook.com redesign has since hidden
 these groups from the people application, but they are nevertheless still visible on mail clients (Outlook 2016, iOS Mail App) and I want them GONE. What a lazy solution to hide these groups rather than clean them up by deleting. It is clear that they are
 set to read only from the server side since users cannot delete them, but WHY? The connections have been discontinued? What is the point of preserving these folders when they serve no purpose but to clutter up directories? FIX THIS MICROSOFT. As far as I have
 been able to research, literally nothing a user can do will permanently get rid of these folders. It's Microsoft's turn to fix it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DO WE REMOVE THESE ONCE AND FOR ALL. I do not want archaic groups from 2012 lingering in my contacts in 2019. I do not want folders created by Microsoft that I cannot delete cluttering up my directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ADDITIONALLY, before a representative sends me irrelevant "solutions" (read with heavy sarcasm), absorb the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>This problem does <strong>not</strong> <strong>have anything to do with the Outlook Win32 application</strong> - It is a problem with the Outlook.com server/service.&nbsp;</li><li>This problem does <strong>not </strong><strong>have anything to do with any other email client</strong> - It is a problem with the Outlook.com server/service.</li><li>This problem does <strong>not</strong> <strong>have anything to do with the accounts and services I have connected to my Microsoft account</strong>; I removed Facebook, Google and the LinkedIn contact connections manually YEARS ago. Additionally, the groups
 are empty - no contacts are being created or synced to them. They are literally just empty groups&nbsp;- It is a problem with the Outlook.com server/service.</li><li>This problem does <strong>not </strong><strong>have anything to do with my browser</strong>. It occurs on literally any browser that I have used for the past 3 years (at least) that I have tried to fix it&nbsp;- It is a problem with the Outlook.com server/service.</li><li>This problem does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> <strong>have anything to do with the device I am using</strong>. These groups that I am not able to delete appear on every device that I am using, so no one specific device has anything to do with it - It is a problem
 with the Outlook.com server/service.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, it would be great if an engineer could respond to this thread.&nbsp;<strong>I do not want to be told to post this in the feedback for Outlook.com</strong>. I have done so for years with no resolution.

<p>Put a summary of the problem in the text entry box; after seeing the automated responses select
<em>Still need help?</em> to contact the dedicated support team. Your summary will become the subject line of the subsequent email correspondence.</p>

    <title>How to repeal access to webcam on Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to repeal access to webcam on Skype&#63;</h2>
                    As I was setting Skype up on my computer, it asked of permission to use the microphone and webcam. There wasn't an option to choose just one, so I accepted thinking I could repeal the access to the webcam later on. However, I can't find how to deny access
 to it anywhere. Is it possible, and if so, how and where?

<p>Hello ETAA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to repeal access to webcam on Skype once it has been detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can control who can video call you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, please go through these steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign in to the Skype app.</p>
<p>2. In the menu bar, select<strong> Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong>, then under General, select
<strong>Video settings</strong>. </p>
<p>3. Choose to automatically receive video and screen sharing from:</p>
<p><strong>Anyone</strong> - even if they aren't in your contact list.</p>
<p><strong>People on your contact list</strong></p>
<p><strong>None at all</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps us. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            I too just received a call from someone this morning claiming that my computer is reporting "hundreds of errors" back to their server and they want me to turn on my computer and provide them information so they can fix my problem. I asked who I was speaking
 to and a man with a Indian accent said that his name is John Anderson. He asked me to open my Safari browser and browse to www.teamviewer.com. I told him that the site was taking a very very very long time to load. (I was lying of course). I then asked Mr.
 Anderson if he could provide me with a call back number and he did. 1-855-203-7516. I Googled the number and found this info;&nbsp;http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-855-203-7516

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6efff4ee-7445-4c0b-8bf5-1d4536c4a7d1">
<font color="#0072c6">tg1(2)</font></a>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's try an alternative approach.&nbsp; First, let's go to your user profile here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6efff4ee-7445-4c0b-8bf5-1d4536c4a7d1">
<font color="#0072c6">tg1(2)</font></a>.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; If you have more than one user profile or login, you only get to alter settings on threads related to THAT username or login, not any&nbsp;others you might have (and we don't have the access to tell you if you did
 that).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming we are talking about Questions and Answers and not Discussions (these can sometimes move and one view may not show you both at the same time, but you can check both until you find the thread to which you want to unsubscribe),&nbsp;click on Questions
 and Answers and then under that click to sort by latest with the arrow pointing down (most recent first), and then on the left, click the radio button to Filter by All Threads and then when finished click on the Apply button or the Apply link (Note:&nbsp;You may
 need to click Apply a few other times to move forward (I'd explain why that happens due to government accommodation rules if the explanation I got made any sense to me - bit alas).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using this as an example (since the only other question I see under this username is locked and get alerts almost never - only an answer being marked there would do it since nobody can post), it should be one of a minimum of two threads showing (possibly
 others where you participated but didn't start the thread yourself).&nbsp; This thread should show in there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't show all of that to you because, again, I don't have full access to your profile so let me show you on mine (NOTE:&nbsp; Mine may include some things you don't see because I'm a Moderator (like the blue exclamation points), but just ignore that stuff).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 First, an image to get you to see the key parts to getting the screen view you want in your profile:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee10afd3-7ec7-4817-a6a6-afb261556adb" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The red arrows point out the parts I was talking about to get to see a screen that looks ssomething like this.&nbsp; Now basically a duplicate where the red arrow shows where to click to stop emails from the specific thread you want:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96d399e6-3fd2-4232-bc26-db6c2968e96c" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you click it, it should disappear.&nbsp; To re-subscribe to a thread, you'd have to go to the thread itself to add the subscription by clicking Subscribe to Updates where Zigzag's picture shows Stop Emails or you could, if necessary, also do it by clicking
 Had this Question in the top right of the Original Post of the thread (but should only do that if it's true as that has additional meaning that may not apply if all you want to do is re-subscribe).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above doesn't work and you are using the correct account and JMH's browser fixes don't help, then please post back and let us know and I will move this thread to the Feedback Forum since it will then seem to have more to do with Forum/site performance
 (even if some aspect of your Microsoft Account or email account may still be responsible) and be a better place to get help with this question.&nbsp; I'd move it now, but I'd like to first see if this works and somehow doing so "breaks the cycle" of troubles or
 if it's of no value or if it helps but the other way remains a problem.&nbsp; Unless fixed, I will move it upon receipt of your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

            this function does not exist on the N73....u could set reminders (not alarms but reminders with alarms on) for each day of the week but then they ring with the annoying reminder tone, and not the tone of your choice...<br />
<br />
EDIT: i forgot to mention that it is possible with 3rd party software...PM me if u want the name of the SW and where to get it

            I'd like to get this functionality aswell but Handy Clock seems to do much more than I need it to<br />
<br />
Is there a freeware alternative that will just let me set my alarm clock every weekday and have it not go off on the weekend ?<br />

            If I knew a free alternative, I already had posted that. But for that, no! DonÂ´t have any free alternative or at least, I donÂ´t know none.

I've ended up buying the extra software. Thanks everyone for the suggestions. But dear Nokia developers. I find It a bit rude the I had to spend â‚¬10 to get a very simple function back on my phone again. Apart from that, So far I'm loving my new phone.

            I found the software at 
http://www.softwaremarket.nokia.com, Called 'Handy Alarm', you can down load a free trial. The software works fine. You can choose the tone you want to be woken by and set the alarm either to go off 'Once', 'Next 24hrs' 'Daily', 'Workdays' or 'weekly'.
 Not sure why you can't choose actual single days like a Mon or a Wed. The only function that I'm really missing is the snooze function. (Believe me I need that!) Although you can set up to five different alarms, (i.e. to go off every 5 min). But it's not a
 very refined work around. For EUR 10 I was hoping for at least the basic functions of an alarm clock. Oh well I'll keep searching, maybe I'll find one.

Yeah I'm trying the demo of 'Handy Essentials' which includes 'Handy Alarm' but I miss the snooze function aswell, it neds to be configurable aswell. I emailed them and asked them if they were gonna add it. Otherwise its a very nice piece of software which
 I'd be happy to pay for if it did all I need it to do (which isn't actually that much). Seems this wake up thing is a bit of a Holy Grail

<p>Hi Betty,<br />
<br />
We'd like to clarify your concern regarding the email addresses that can't be deleted, by answering the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which browser are you using to access Outlook.com?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried using a different browser to know if the issue will replicate?<br />
</li><li>Have you cleared the browser history from the beginning to check if it will persist?</li></ul>
        </p>

<p>If the "bad" email account is synced from your other accounts (i.e FB or Skype) to your Outlook, you have to delete/edit them on the origin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use this method, see if it will work</p>

<p>You can create a new account and test it, if your problem solved copy your data from old account to your new account.
</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac - issues with IMAP email account</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues with my IMAP email account since upgrading to Outlook 15.9 (Outlook 2016) on my Mac. &nbsp;The account refused to synchronise; I tried a repair of the folders to no effect.</p>
<p>I removed the account and added it back into my profile in Outlook and the account refuses to connect at all now (amber light on the accounts list).</p>
<p>I have also tried creating a new MS Outlook profile and adding in the account there but this also doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same email account setup in Outlook 2010 on my PC and iPhone 5 and it is working absolutely fine there. The account also works fine when I set it up in Apple Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hannah</p>

            <p>Are you allowing Outlook to auto-configure your account or are you entering your settings manually? Most common issues Iâ€™ve seen are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not using your full email address as your username when itâ€™s required</li><li>Wrong Incoming SSL port number</li></ul>
<p>No problems here with any of my IMAP accounts, so not sure why Outlook isnâ€™t working for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Hannah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as yourself. My work email will not work in Outlook 2016 (15.14.2). In the accounts list it has yellow bullet status. In addition....I can send email through the account but not receive anything....of course it does not create the
 IMAP folder structure plus it clearly says at the status bar at the bottom..."not connected to &lt;mail server of my work email&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The funny part is that both Yahoo and Gmail work perfectly well on IMAP in my Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talking moose, </p>
<p>.....thats the typical support questions you ask back...."Did you turn the power on to the computer...etc?". I am sure you can do better</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the same incoming and outgoing server settings as in iPhone why would it still not work? As for me I have NO firewalls blocking anything and to make matters more confusing I tried using Apple's own Mail on the same laptop and works like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My general guess is that it probably has to do with the client certificate management software of MS Outlook 2016 playing some form of game. If the certificate is wrong/not accepted by Outlook (regardless what you as an administrator click/allow/trust, etc)
 it will NOT connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this can only be solved by the rookies who implemented the Outlook software and clearly didn't test it through thoroughly.</p>
<p>

            Have the same problem as @Sami and @Hlmackenzie and I have tried all sorts of solutions. &nbsp; My IMAP is hosted at zoho.com. &nbsp; I have two factor auth turned off and IMAP turned on. &nbsp; Cannot connect. &nbsp; I have been able to connect to this same account from
 my Windows 10 / Outlook 2016 setup no problem, but from my Mac it just isn't working. &nbsp; I was able to connect before I upgraded. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I'm having the same problem. It seems with each incremental update that Microsoft is putting out, IMAP performance slows down. And now, with the latest two updates, 15.14.1 and 15.14.2, my e-mail account never connects at all. I get the amber light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading through the various posts in this thread, it appears this problem is limited to people who use IMAP accounts not tied to a major operation. So folks who use Gmail IMAP aren't affected. For me, I use a Rackspace IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I've tried so far, on both a Mac Pro and a Mac Book Pro:</p>
<p>1. I've tried removing the e-mail account, and re-adding it. No luck here.</p>
<p>2. I've gone into /Users/(my name)/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/ and deleted the Outlook folder and OutlookProfile.plist file to remove the database and settings. Then I deleted the Outlook for Mac 2016 app, and re-installed it. Still no luck.</p>
<p>3. I tried installing an older version of the App - I kept the original download when Microsoft released Outlook only for Office 365 subscribers. That version will install and it will run perfectly. It checks my Rackspace IMAP mail instantly. (Oh, the good
 ole days.) &nbsp;However, it now asks for my Office 365 sign-in every time I power cycle my Mac. This behavior isn't seen in my other Office for Mac apps that are running the latest version.</p>
<p>4. I have set up Mac Mail while I wait for Microsoft to fix this very serious problem with Outlook.</p>
