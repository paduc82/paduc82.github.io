<h2>            Outlook 2010 - receiving duplicate emails from Telstra Bigpond</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm an Aussie using Telstra BigPond (TBP) for my email hosting.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>It was working just fine with Outlook 2010 until now ‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll tell you why.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've just moved across to a Samsung Galaxy Note II (N2) from a Blackberry (BB).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The most disappointing thing I have found is the email program on the N2. Btw, I'm a full business user (not IT).</span></p>
<p><span>BB had a deal with Telstra where all the emails I received at my TBP mail server were forwarded to the BB mail servers. Then my BB would easily download them into its
 mail app.&nbsp;<span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My Outlook 2010 pop‚Äôd the emails from TBP then deleted them immediately which
<font><span>&nbsp;</span>didn't matter because the BB was always going to get a copy via their own mail servers.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Admitted this BB mail server was a nasty +$30/month charge added to my invoice for the "Blackberry service" but it worked.</font></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Admitted this BB mail server was a nasty +$30/month charge added to my invoice for the "Blackberry service" but it worked.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now Im stuck because as soon as Outlook deletes the emails of the TBP mail server the N2 cant read them.<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>The only way the N2 can ‚Äúsee‚Äù emails is to access the host mail server.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It doesn‚Äôt store the emails locally.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now I hear you say that‚Äôs easy, "in Outlook change the setting not to delete your emails off the TBP Server after POP'ing" ......but alas, you cant do that. Why?&nbsp;<span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Well, you can‚Äôt leave them on there because something is wrong with Outlook and ramdomly it thinks it hasn‚Äôt pop‚Äôd the mail from the TBP mail server and it does it again
 !!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, as often as every couple of hours Outlook thinks I haven't received the emails sitting in the TBP Inbox so when you click Send/Receive in Outlook it downloads every
 one again. Yesterday I got my Inbox downloaded 3 times (each time was 900 items = 56MB).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I know have a duplicate of every email I have received in the last 14 days so of course you have to go into View in Outlook, change the view just unread emails and delete
 them .... painful.<font><span>&nbsp; </span>OH, and you have to wait for Outlook to reindex to get them all.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, that's my beef ..... what to do eh?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Oh and by the way, if you delete the emails eventually off the bigpond mail server they are not longer "visible" in N2 .... with my BB they stayed there until you deleted
 them off the BB itself. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suppose I could fwd my TBP emails to Gmail then get my N2 to pop the Gmail mail account instead of TBP and just leave the TBP for Outlook to download the mail items
 then delete them but I shouldn‚Äôt have to do that.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry if this all sounds too difficult but Id really like some advice (as would Im sure the 1,000's of BB users considering the switch).</span></p>

            AFAIK.. this happens when the profile outlook is using is corrupted. Would suggest you to create a new profile and that should take care of it. Use this link to create profile in outlook .<br />

            With the introduction of Word 2013, MS changed the behaviour of the ASCII 160 non-breaking space. It now conforms to the CSS space rules. This allows the space to expand/contract with justification so that all spaces on a line have the same width; the
 ASCII 160 behaviour could look odd with its fixed-width non-breaking spaces in such cases. For fixed-width non-breaking spaces you can use one of the other non-breaking space characters (eg Narrow No-Break Space: 202F,Alt-x).

            <p>schissern, the fixed width of non-breaking space was longly&nbsp;criticized behaviour. Could you tell me a bit about your use case, and why you expect a
<em>non-breaking</em> space to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;<em>fixed-width</em> space? Does your use case actually use the non-breaking property?</p>

            What does it matter <em>why </em>schissern wants them? The fact is he/she does. It doesn't take a great deal of imagination to recognise there are situations where a fixed-width space is preferable to a variable-width space.

</p><p>Write two lines with the same beginning among each other, for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[3]<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DIN‚ÄØ8580:2003-09,‚ÄØ<em>Fertigungsverfahren - Begriffe, Einteilung</em>.</p>
<p>[4]<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DIN‚ÄØ8586:2003-09,‚ÄØ<em>Fertigungsverfahren Biegeumformen - Einordnung, Unterteilung, Begriffe</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the second one will be broken after <em>Unterteilung,</em> cause it is to long for the line. If you have a fixed space after
<em>DIN</em>, it looks well when you compare the two lines. But when you use the nonbreaking space from 2013, it looks crappy. In 2010 everything was ok. Now I have to use 202f,ALT+c. It is very complicated, but I have to live with it!</p>

<p>Because understanding your customers and the way how they work with the product might be helpful, both for them and for you. Although listening to customers ruined pretty much the whole concept on how we work with computers, I can imagine not everybody is
 happy with that and understand the desire to satisfy your customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously it is somewhat deal for my imagination and that's why I asked&nbsp;the question. I am not sure what is the point of&nbsp;discouraging people from asking questions. Also I was not questioning whether fixed-width space might be preferable to a variable-width
 space, but whether non-breaking space per se should carry any width contracts (and as actually turned out from schissern's answer, the non-breaking essence is not important at all in his scenario).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly I believe that if there are groups of people with contradicting opinions they should learn about the rationale behind them instead of blindly fighting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>schissern,</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your use case, I haven't thought about this scenario. I believe the tabs and/or line indents are better suited for this task, as you don't have the DIN words aligned anyway due to the variable width of the digits, not speaking about
 numbers over 9.</p>

<p>I'm curious about what you mean by "customers." If by "customers," you mean the users of these forums, then those who ask questions&nbsp;might in some sense be the "customers" of those who answer them, but if your use of "customers" means Microsoft Word users,
 and you are implying that they are Paul's customers, then you are mistaken. No one here works for Microsoft. We are all volunteers, just other users who are trying to help. Those designated as Community Moderators are those who have been deemed helpful here
 in these forums. Those designated as Microsoft MVPs (Most Valuable Professionals) are those who have been deemed generally helpful in a specific product area (see

            I actually meant Microsoft Word users with no implications about Paul's relationship either to them or to Microsoft. I tried to point out that there are people to whom it matters, especially having developers in mind. Paul's argument is self contradicting
 anyway, because I could have replied <em>what does it matter why does it matter to
</em><em>me</em>. Also my question was to the original poster and he had full rights to not answer it, no need for Paul to speak for others. That no one here works for Microsoft is rather bold statement too.

 find repeat customers and how many times they have come back and bought from a business.</p>

            You can have the correct (access point) settings sent to your phone by calling your operator's (service provider's) customer service.<br />
<br />
They may also allow you to get them sent from their web site.<br />
<br />
Or, you can try Nokia's web site for getting settings:<br />

<h2>            Certification signature block</h2>
                    <p>I'm taking the MOS tests - I have two under my belt (Word and Excel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be completing the tests to qualify as "Masters"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, is it appropriate to put "My Name, MOS" in my email signature block? Then, for Master, is something else appropriate, such as "My Name, MOS-Master"?</p>

<p>Thank you for any guidance.</p>

            <p>I think it depends on whom the email is going to. If you're sending emails to people for whom a Master-level MOS is meaningful, then you could include it; at worst, if you include it in all emails, it may be a conversation starter.I have a correspondent
 who signs all emails with his full business signature, which includes the letters "RCDD, RTPM." Mean anything to you? Me either, but I did google them; they're still pretty much meaningless to me, but I know they mean he has achieved distinction or credentials&nbsp;in
 his field.</p>
<p>I have a client with a string that includes Ph.D., CPA/ABV/CFF, MAI, SREA, SRA, ASA, CRE, and FRICS. Every letter or report he generates includes, in the letterhead or signature block, a subset of these designations designed to impress the intended reader.<br />

<h2>            MS Project Not Adding Up</h2>
                    <p><span>I am trying to automatically configure a project schedule. I would like to be able to put in my resoure's hours and have the schedule adjust to fit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I created all the tasks using the standard calendar. I created my resource assigning&nbsp;it to the standard calendar with 100% units available to it.
</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I assign&nbsp;it to the tasks and assign my resource&nbsp;the set constraint on units. So ‚ÄúResource A‚Äù can only work at 40% utilization for the week, so that breaks down as (40 hours per week*.4 utilization=16
 hours per week/5 work days=3.2 hours per day/40 hours total=.08 utilization per day) 8% per day.</span></p>
<p><span>I take Task 1a (70 hours), create a sub task ‚ÄúTask 1aa‚Äù, and assign Resource A to the task (Task 1aa) with the 8% utilization and have the task as auto scheduled. The task should take a duration
 of 21.875 days (70 hours of work/3.2 hours per day=21.875 working days).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Instead the duration is appearing as ‚Äú<b>8.75days?</b>‚Äù
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>What am I doing wrong? The duration is correct if my resource is working eight hour days but the resource should only be working 3.2 hour days.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>First look up the task type (Task Information, Advanced tab). It should read anything but Fixed Duration.</p>
<p>Now insert the field "Work" into your view. If the units are 40% this should read
</p>
<p>8.75*8*0.4=28 hours. Reset that to 70 and there you are.</p>
<p>And try to avoid the word "Leveling" whihc has a distinct meaning in Project (other than this process)</p>
<p>Do look up all help you can get on Task Type to undestand!</p>

    <title>Need default color scheme for Publisher 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allhaileris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need default color scheme for Publisher 2010</h2>
                    I feel dumb to ask, but I can't find it online.&nbsp; To me it kind of appears that nothing should be chosen to use the default color scheme, but I can't find a way to do this.&nbsp; I've looked on my co-workers computers and they have "bluebird" chosen, which isn't
 correct and I'm not sure why that is even showing up.&nbsp; I need the default so I can match the colors used on my documents already made, which includes a graph made in Excel.&nbsp; There is no "orignial" or "default".&nbsp; The "office" scheme doesn't match.&nbsp; Because
 this has been changed, it will affect every single Publisher document I make in the future.&nbsp; I know how to create a new one, so I'm guessing my best bet is to just make one and hope I pick the correct colors.

<p>I would also look at using building blocks for 'default fonts, font colors, etc':

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A tool I find handy is the Pixie color picker. You can use it to match any color including Excel.</p>

 Since we are not sure if we could afford Azure AD Premium, I like to create attributes based dynamic groups with PowerShell.&nbsp; Is it possible to accomplish?</p>

<p>Hi Akiko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, it's possible to sync Security group from on-premises AD to Azure AD so the Group type shows Security. Also if you update members on premises, it also will sync to Azure AD. It's an expected behavior. But for Dynamic attribute-based&nbsp;Distribution Group
 in Azure AD, it will filter group members automatically based on the rule you created, which is different from Security group.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e14c9f0-903f-40c0-abd2-dbe160486c9b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e14c9f0-903f-40c0-abd2-dbe160486c9b?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Of course, based on your description, the Security group synced from on-premises AD can meet your request. We are glad to hear that and if you have any concern about it, you are welcomed to come back to us.</p>
<p>

I don't think it can possible to accomplish using Power Shell. You need to&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

No, group will not Sync with on-prem or vise-versa.<br />

    <title>How to turn off Excel diagnostics - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to turn off Excel diagnostics</h2>
                    The latest update of Excel (Version 16.13 (180513)) for Mac prompts for diagnostic data gathering and says "You can change it at any time". I clicked on one of the options so I could quit seeing the prompt every time I started up the app. Now how do I
 change it on my Mac?

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why you're receiving duplicate emails is due to the configured rules in your Outlook application. If you have set a rule especially the
<strong>Move to Folder</strong> rule, you are more likely to receive duplicate emails. To isolate this, kindly manage or delete some rules and check if the issue persists.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>File</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Manage Rules &amp; Alerts</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Rules and Alerts</strong> dialog box, click the rule that you want to delete, and then click
<strong>Delete</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you configured multiple accounts in your Outlook application, please make sure that these are indeed separate accounts and not just aliases for the same mailbox. In the case of setting the other account as an alias, you would basically have the
 same account configured twice as all email messages from either alias is being received in the same mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent duplicates from alias accounts, you must configure the alias account not to receive email messages since they are already being received by the original account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>File</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Options</strong>, then select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
Click the <strong>Send/Receive</strong> button under <strong>Send and receive</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>.</li><li>Select the alias account.</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Receive mail items</strong>&nbsp;box then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post.</p>

                    I am logged into Skype and my icon has the green dot, but other people see me as off-line&nbsp; and if they try calling they get me as unavailiable.&nbsp; I've ticked "unmute incoming calls".&nbsp; Old skype you could set how you appeared or set away etc. but not now.&nbsp;
 I have Skype on my Android phone and that works fine.

            Hi David
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 8 or earlier, open Control Panel &gt; Programs and features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:

<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I have gone through and reinstalled Skype.</p>
<p>I think the problem might be that Skype doesn't wake up the computer if it has gone to sleep.&nbsp; I'm sure the older version of Skype, before Microsoft got hold of it, did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try calling from another device to see how this one responds.</p>

            I'll have to give it a few days to see if it happens again.&nbsp; Thinking about it, I was using the computer last week when a Skype call came in.&nbsp; Although Skype was open and logged in on the computer it didn't ring.&nbsp; I only knew a call was coming in as my
 phone was online and Skype rang on that.&nbsp; I called the caller back, and after the call he called me again and that one came through.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm also told I appear as inactive on other people's Skype screen, even when I am using the computer and Skype is open and
 logged in.

            At least your computer acknowledged someone was trying to call in.&nbsp; there is a switch in the settings which says "unmute incoming calls" which by default (god knows why) is set to off.

<p>
</p><p>I've followed some of the other threads, but I cannot seem to update my One Drive for Business credentials.&nbsp; I deleted items from my Credential Manager in the Control Panel.&nbsp; I do not want to disconnect my library again, since it uses up too much of my data

<p>Hi&nbsp;JacoZR,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are talking about OneDrive credentials, I suppose you have your password changed. You can follow the steps below to update your credentials:</p>
<p>1. Sign out and exit all Office applications.</p>
<p>2. Removing all the stored credentials in the credentials manager (Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Run <strong>regedit</strong> as administrator.</p>
<p>4. From <strong>Registry Editor</strong>, browse to:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Delete the <strong>Identity</strong> folder.</p>
<p>6. Open an Office application like Word and sign in with the Office 365 account.</p>
<p>7. Note: Before you modify the registry, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">back up the registry for restoration</a></strong></span> in case of problems occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: <em>Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved.
 Use Registry Edit at your own risk.</em></p>

<p>Hello Neo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately your suggestion did nothing.&nbsp; The button stayed inactive.&nbsp; I had to resort to making my own backup of everything I had in my OneDrive for Business storage (Which was painful and costly).&nbsp; I then removed the software from my computer.&nbsp; Rebooted
 a few times during this phase. Reinstalled the software and started the sync from the web interface again.&nbsp; This seemed to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this is not going to be the procedure whenever I change my password.&nbsp; Surely this should be easier, by just making sure your software responds when a user clicks on the link presented by OneDrive for Business to update the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure your also did not read my initial response where I removed credentials from the Credential Manager, which you said I should try again (This is the definition of stupidity).</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi JacoZR,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear that you can use OneDrive sync client normally now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the duplicate information. I noticed you have deleted credentials and I&nbsp;want to make sure you have deleted all credentials via delivering my suggestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my test steps, please have a look:</p>
<p>1. Sign in my account in OneDrive sync client.</p>
<p>2. Sign in my account in the Office 365 portal and change my password.</p>
<p>3. Reboot the computer and OneDrive will ask me to sign in my account with the new password.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is going to try giving us the better experience according to our feedback -they said-. For now, you can switch to the Start like Windows 8, just go to the Taskbar properties,
<strong>Start Menu</strong> tab and deselect the <strong>Use the start menu instead of Start Screen option</strong>.
