<h2>            Xbox One going downhill</h2>
                    Microsoft needs to wake up. They are going to be losing so much money. I mean the Xbox needs to be kept on at all times? That's a little privacy concern. No online play? What if someone can't afford Internet? They need to get it together. The whole gaming
 community is leaning towards Ps4 and that's going to make Microsoft lose so much money. They need to look at the comments of everybody and fix the problems they are causing.

<p>Microsoft cannot force anyone to leave an appliance plugged into the mains.</p>
<p>kinect needs to remain on when in use,and the internet needs to be checked in on a 24 hour/weekly basis,it does not need to be plugged in 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>Then they are buying the wrong console if they want to play single player offline,xbox one is not an offline console.</p>
<p>you can`t cry poverty when you have just paid $500 for a luxury item that you knew wouldn`t work without the internet.</p>

    <title>Will there be another Xbox console after the Xbox One&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragnarok5000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will there be another Xbox console after the Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The Xbox One is selling better now, but will not catch up to the PS4. Here are some reasons why:</p>
<p>1. I've heard that some people have regret buying the Xbox One, so it made them had to take their Xbox Ones back &amp; brought a PS4.</p>
<p>2. Slightly weak hardware (the CPU is actually identical, but the GPU on Xbox One is slower than the PS4, that's the main reason why some games are not 1080p (some are 900p, few are 720p)</p>
<p>3. Not a lot of exclusives (is that what people buy consoles for, games that you can only get on one platform?), some Xbox One games like Ryse, DR3, &amp; Ori can be played on PC with higher resolutions &amp; better performance. Oh, and Microsoft can't only depend
 on Halo &amp; Gears of War, people have got sick of Halo since the day 343 Industries was born, and the Gears of War community is slowly dying because of Gears of War Judgement. New IPs would always be a good idea, but the problem here is that most of them don't
 do too well (Sunset Overdrive for example) is because of Xbox fanboys only buying Halo &amp; Gears of War, so blame them, not the marketing team.</p>
<p>4. Let's not forget the horrible reveal, the biggest reason why most former Xbox fans moved over to PlayStation, so don't blame the entire Microsoft company for this, blame Don Mattrick for focusing more on entertainment stuff than gaming.</p>
<p>Due to a very mixed reputation (either you love it or you hate it, but most people hated it), the Xbox One may or may not have a bright future, the Xbox One will may or may not last long. Even the diehard Microsoft fans are not helping, so Microsoft please
 get it together. If Microsoft can't get it together, then the Xbox brand may come to an end. This could be Microsoft's last console, again if they can't get it together, then Microsoft should just kill off the Xbox brand for good &amp; possibly sell Halo &amp; Gears
 of War to Sony. Unless Microsoft does make another console, then should call their next console Xbox Four or Xbox IV &amp; make their next console the most powerful of its generation &amp; make games run on either native 1440p or 4K resolutions with 60 or 90 FPS and
 make Xbox Live Gold cheaper ($19.99 for 3 months, $39.99 for 12 months, &amp; $69.99 for 24 months), doing these methods will probably show Sony what Microsoft is capable of. I'm not really trolling or making comparsions, but just saying, I felt like I wanna express
 my thoughts on the future of Xbox brand.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, word of mouth is still the best advertising. And once a product gets a bad rep on the streets, no amount of backtracking can undo the damage.
</p>
<p>Couple that with what we read everyday on the forums about. 'Net etc down and X1 games will not work.' as well as the. 'X1 rep system.' and you can see why word on the street say's. 'No joy!'
</p>
<p>Will there be a next gen Xbox console? I don't see it happening for people are starting to feel the pinch, and the more the cost of living goes up, the less likely people will invest their hard earned money on entertainment/hobbies.

<p>the xbox one is doing absolutely fine in sales, according to the npd group that tracks sales the x1 is about 50% ahead of where the 360 was at at the same time in its life cycle, so 21 months in, the 360 had sold around 15 to 16 million consoles world wide
 which means the X1 has sold 22 to 23 million consoles world wide as of now, the xbox brand is going nowhere, its here to stay.</p>

<p>I firmly believe this will be the last generation of the consoles.</p>
<p>Digital technology has led to most of us having houses full of devices that can all do the same thing. All of the non-gaming features on the consoles can be done significantly better on other devices and that's what has come back to bite MS.</p>
<p>I think we'll see more of a focus on the distribution of the media than on the hardware. As a consumer that's a win because I won't need individual devices to access everything I want.</p>

<p>you realise you are contradicting yourself with your statements dont you?</p>
<p>Digital technology has led to most of us having houses full of devices that can all do the same thing. All of the non-gaming features on the consoles can be done significantly better on other devices and that's what has come back to bite MS.</p>
<p>this is contrdicted by this statement:</p>
<p>I think we'll see more of a focus on the distribution of the media than on the hardware. As a consumer that's a win because I won't need individual devices to access everything I want.</p>
<p>tell me how is a dvd/bluray player any better than X1.</p>
<p>The X1 does exactly what you yourself described as a win for the consumer, to access your content without the need for individual devices.</p>

            I had to replace the HD, after that all was well. But none of the troubleshoot procedures pointed to faulty HW or SW. I removed and re-installed various pieces of HW &amp; SW until the problem was finally found. Even Dell's troubleshooting program did not
 find the faulty HD. The computer is a Dell XPS 435T.

<h2>            Webcam sound not functioning in Movie Maker</h2>
                    Hi... my webcam audio and video work with Skype and EyeJot, but not when recording with MovieMaker. Video is fine, but there's no sound. I've checked the settings and all volumes are set correctly my computer's mic... and I have just used in other formats
 mentioned above, so I know it works. Any ideas?

<h2>            Unable to view e-mails more than 5 days on Windows Live Mail.</h2>
                    <p>OT: Inbox viewing problem</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to Windows Live mail so I may be overlooking the obvious here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, I can only view the past five days of emails in my inbox. Mails are sending /receiving no problem but actually viewing ALL my emails and its history going back months is the issuee. How do I do that? Is there a button to "next page"? Or is
 this a bug? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understandwhy all mails are not being shown. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>How were you reading your messages before you started using Windows Live Mail? It sounds as if you were using a different program, e.g. Outlook Express or Windows Mail, that downloaded messages and then removed them from the server. This would explain why
 there are no older messages in webmail. Is this a possibility?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I change the target drive to restore a backup&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bfmoose  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the target drive to restore a backup&#63;</h2>
                    Prior to doing a clean reinstall of Win7HP, I made a backup of all of the recommended files to an external hard drive. I reinstalled Win7HP and reinstalled all of my software from scratch. Now, I need access to the hugh amount of docs, photos, etc. in
 the My Documents folder. I want to restore the contents of the My Documents folder and other portions of the backup to another external hard drive to prevent overwriting of the newly created AppData with the corrupted AppData in the backup. The total size
 of the backup files is approximately 500 GB with many hundreds of individual backup files created using the backup software in Win7HP.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- Do you have enough space in the Hard Disk Drive to restore the backup?<br />
- Do you get any error message when you attempt to access the external Hard Drive?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you to take ownership of the drive and check if you are able to access the drive.<br />

            Thank you for your reply. I have plenty of space on external hard drives. I am the administrator for all drives, folders and files.<br />
<br />
Since my backup was performed after corruption of my software's executable files, the application data was backed up with all of my docs, photos, etc. I reinstalled all of my software and I want to recover the docs and photos without writing over the new application
<br />
One thing I forgot to mention is that all of my system restore points were corrupted. Even though I faithfully created restore points at least weekly, I tried to utilize each and every one prior to performing a complete reinstall of Win7HP.<br />
<br />
I want to restore the backup files to a external hard drive so I can select which files to save (docs, photos, etc.) and delete the corrupted application and system files.<br />

<h2>            About Digital Audio&#47; Sound Device Issue &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    Hello and good day to all.
<p>
</p><p>Here I would like to say that my laptop had have a difficult problem and very confusing for me. For several weeks I tried to fix it but my efforts failed, I have already tried various measures by watch videos on YouTube and read several articles about the
 "Audio Device Problem" on Google. But my efforts remain unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
Things very confusing for me is like the diagram below :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When we click "Test" in "Playback devices, the volume bar will rising.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4c40a8-987e-45f1-8541-b6d02d5a28b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4c40a8-987e-45f1-8541-b6d02d5a28b8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After clicking "Test", the volume bar did rise. But I still didn't hear any sound from my laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f698bf83-9d0a-44e9-8970-02e9d09b65d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f698bf83-9d0a-44e9-8970-02e9d09b65d6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Look, my Volume Mixer just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cd1c7ef-04ea-4f2d-a858-674bc5cd3263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9cd1c7ef-04ea-4f2d-a858-674bc5cd3263" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Here's my "System Properties".</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c860ff0-230f-492c-a596-4953c1660fda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c860ff0-230f-492c-a596-4953c1660fda" /></a></p>
<p>
After much thought, I became even more confused. Actually "Sound Speaker" or "Audio Device" that has the problem. For those who know a solution to this problem please share with me.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

    <title>Can I manually re-run the compatibility scan for Win 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philolenick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I manually re-run the compatibility scan for Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    My Get Win 10 icon initially said that I'd have problems with my display, but now says simply that I don't have or need a touchscreen.<br />
<br />
How can I manually re-run the scan, which it says was last run 11 days ago? I've tried uninstalling the update that installed the Get Win 10 icon and reinstalling it, but that has no effect on this problem. It still references the scan run 11 days ago and doesn't
 run the scan again.

UPDATE:&nbsp; Just looked again, in case a scan was running on deep background, and found that the date of the last scan had been updated - from June 11th to June 14th. But it's the 25th!<br /></p>

            <p>I went into Task Scheduler and found the "Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser" task. I couldn't get it to run manually, but I noticed that it was set to next run on June 29th. I checked it on the 29th but there was no change in its last run being June 14th
 - however, when I checked it a few days later, it was marked as having run on the 30th.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warning about display incompatibility was still gone, replaced by the notation that I don't have - or need - a touchscreen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume that the earlier warning was a carryover rooted in the orientation of the original Windows 8 towards touchscreen use - though why that warning didn't explicitly say that the problem was that the display wasn't a touchscreen is beyond me!</p>

            I was able to manually run the compatibility check following your instructions and can see that it was completed successfully by going into Task Scheduler. &nbsp;However, my Get Windows 10 window still refers to the previously run compatibility check. &nbsp;How
 do I get he Get Windows 10 program to recognize the new report?

<p>I have a recently installed production server which is having Windows update issues. It keeps saying there is an outstanding update Kb967723 but trying to run it generates an error 80070490. There is also an update shield in the Shutdown button.&nbsp; I cannot
 run an in place upgrade (x64) as the software won't run and I cannot take the server off line for that long at the moment.</p>
<p>CBS.log has the following added after running the update.</p>

<p>Why is HP LaserJet 1020 no longer recognized by applications in Windows Seven as an installed default printer, but shows as such in Devices and Printers. HP driver reinstall fails with error indicating that Windows Seven does not support this driver, although
 it had been working days before in that operating system on the same computer. What's the fix for this problem?</p>

<p><span>Hey Rockero999,</span></p>
<p><span>I'm sorry to hear you're having problems with your power supply. &nbsp;I actually had the same issue, recently. Unfortunately it most likely means the power supply has lived its life/is faulty, overheats too quickly/frequently, and
 needs replaced. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, something you can do to potentially preserve the power brick a little longer is to blow out the dust through the vent holes. &nbsp;I did this and mine lasted another 6 months before dying again. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A can of air works okay, but I prefer the human can of air. &nbsp;The can of air can blow harder, but if you blow the vents clean with your mouth, you can cover all of the holes on one end and the dust only has one direction of travel.
 &nbsp;This is just my personal, unofficial opinion, though. :)</span></p>
<p><span>If you do decide to get a new power supply (and they aren't very expensive), I want to remind you that there are
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know, too, if you have any more questions!<br />

<p>probably better not to tell people to blow in it. &nbsp;that could introduce moisture that can cause more damage to the circuitry. &nbsp;however i agree that it could just be overheating from a build up of dust. &nbsp;cleaning them out can sometimes help. &nbsp;if you do buy
 a replacement, here is a picture showing the 3 different power ratings: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jRN4kMR.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://i.imgur.com/jRN4kMR.jpg</a></p>
<p>if you do get a 203w power supply, it can fit and work with any of the 360 models, because the console will only use the amount of power it needs. &nbsp;the 175w will not work with a console requiring 203w, because it does not provide enough power, and the 150w
 will not provide enough power to the 203w or 175w consoles.</p>
<p>the 360S consoles have two different motherboards and two different power supplies, but interestingly you can use either one on either console. &nbsp;you can also use any of the original 360 power supplies on a slim console if you get an adapter to make it fit
 the port, because the slims use less power than any of the "phat" consoles. &nbsp;the 360E has it's own unique power supply that has just one circle on the port, making it the shape half of the slim port.</p>
<p>here is a link to Microsoft's Official page explaining the details and differences:

    <title>Srvany.exe replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ljack21788  say:</h3>
<h2>            Srvany.exe replacement </h2>
                    
<p>There have been multiple queries about srvany.exe (or instsrv) replacement executables, but nothing definitive (at least that I could find).&nbsp; Essentially, it looks like srvany.exe was a utility supplied with the MS Windows Resource kit, but then never really
 propagated or supported after its release.&nbsp; Consequently, future versions of toolkits and operating systems don't have another executable that can be used as a convenient replacement.</p>
<p>Under Windows 7, there is an "sc.exe" (command line Service Control Manager interface) command, but there seems to be a lack of clarity on exactly how that can be used.</p>
<p>Here's what I'd like to do:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a simple 32 bit executable that I'd like to install as a service.&nbsp; This could be under either Windows 7 x64 or Windows 2008 x64 Server.</li><li>When the system boots, I'd like my simple 32 bit executable to&nbsp;automatically start running like any other service.</li><li>What steps do I need to perform to get the application installed as a service under these OS's?</li><li>Since SrvAny.exe is not a supported application, I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;use only MS supported executables or processes.&nbsp; NSSM (<a href="http://stuff.iain.cx/2010/04/21/nssm-2-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://stuff.iain.cx/2010/04/21/nssm-2-3/</a>)&nbsp;is a possiblility, but I'm holding
 out for an "official" MS solution/approach.&nbsp; Note: I have seen this (<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/ed290a19-3115-4c26-abee-5122181877e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/ed290a19-3115-4c26-abee-5122181877e1</a>),
 but I'm not sure it will do what I'd like to achieve. </li></ol>
<p>Any help/direction would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;&nbsp; JC</p>

<p>Hi LJack21788,</p>
<p>Your Windows 7 question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your question in the TechNet Windows 7 forum.</p>

    <title>Clean Install on old Dell Inspiron 5100 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonyh9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean Install on old Dell Inspiron 5100 laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have been given a old Dell 5100 in perfect condition ( nine years old ),&nbsp;and would like to perform a clean install back to factory condition. I have the original disk as well as supplemental disk that came with the computer,&nbsp;the version is XP Home sp1a.
 There seems to be no recovery partition.&nbsp;Updates have been continuous and show Sp3 installed now.</p>
<p>My problems are when I started the clean install it says I am about to load an older version, thats cool, but will&nbsp;I be able to continue through the updates back to sp3 from sp1a on my factory disk??? I seem to have been reading that I&nbsp; may have issues there
 and&nbsp; also issues with the preinstalled Norton antivirus again having read somewhere that this could be a problem as well. I can not find a definitive answer on the Norton issue. Also does internet explorer on the original factory disk present update issues???</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate some step by step instruction if someone could help me.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!!!!!</p>

            There will be no problems going directly from SP1a to SP3 (there is no need too install SP2).
<br />
<br />
I see that you are using a factory restore disk which comes with pre-installed software (Norton).&nbsp; Just pay attention during the install and if asked if you want to install additional software decline to do so.&nbsp; If you aren't presented with an option then you
 will have little choice but to accept the factory restore process and when done go in Add/Remove programs and uninstall the unwanted programs.&nbsp; DO NOT click on, launch or start any programs that you don't want!&nbsp; Opening these trial or bloatware programs may
 complete or launch a stub that initiates the installation of the software.<br />
<br />
Symantec has removal tools for their Norton AV, see here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?lg=english&amp;ct=united+states&amp;docid=20080710133834EN&amp;product=home&amp;version=1&amp;pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Xbox year in Review - Shows only Community stats no matter what I try</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so I'd like to see my year in review for this year, it would be nice to know how many hours I have sinked into some games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, no matter what I try, it always gives me the same community Achievements and not my own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changed computers, logged in and out multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on PC and from Canada, but idk why that should cause an issue, since a lot of people I've seen fit this criteria and they got theirs. help?</p>

            That's definitely a strange issue. I didn't have any issues with mine. I'll check a little later to see if everything works as intended from my end still. My stats mostly rotated around hours spent in specific games and what I felt was a better achievement
 I'd earned.

<p>Hi Link,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested this out myself on two different accounts. The first one I tried was a generic account I made in the past that basically has no stats or game time played. All I ever did was give it a gamertag when I signed into Xbox.com. The other account
 I tried was my personal account which has hours of gameplay and over 30,000 Gamerscore. The first account that has never been used gave me only the community stats because there were no personal stats to display. On my personal account, the Year in Review
 worked just fine giving me my stats for 2018 with a detailed list after the globe is made at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you are logged into the correct account before you begin the Year in Review. From here
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/year-in-review/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.xbox.com/en-us/live/year-in-review/home</a>&nbsp;select the icon on the top right and select sign out from the account it's logged into. From the login page, type in your correct email and password and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi Link,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear it's still the same. I've done testing to confirm that it is working and the only reason I can think of as to why it would only be giving you community stats is that&nbsp;the account you are doing the review with does not have any game time
 or achievements to review and display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is not much we can do here on the forums other than provide information but if you've confirmed 100% its the correct account then you would want to contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support</a> and have them investigate your account.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the help! I went forth and contacted support, answered that they couldn't really investigate on achievements and that stuff because they didn't have access? They informed me to check trueachievements which I know I have the achievements, I just
 had checked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hours played was what I really wanted to know, but there is no way to figure that out other than contacting the developers apparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time, I have raised this issue with them as I'm not the only one who's been having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm writing, mostly for the people that stumble on this post asking the same thing,&nbsp; you most likely won't be getting your review, sorry.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Every time I boot I get a blank green screen after logos. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Every time I boot I get a blank green screen after logos.</h2>
                    I built a new pc, got windows 8.1 running and I was installing drivers then I decided to install razer synapse for my razer keyboard and mouse had to restart to finish installation and when the PC boots up, after the logos I just get a blank green screen
 and it matches the colour I chose for my Windows theme. So I did a reinstallation of Windows 8.1 and I went back to installing drivers and now and I got to my Nvidia driver wizard and next thing the wizard minimizes and the clock and cursor disappear so I
 pressed ctrl+alt+del and I got the same blank green screen I got the night before after booting. This is not a blue screen of death, I got get a blank green screen on boot up. I was trying things then I managed to get an error message saying 'windows didnt
 start correctly' and I went to troubleshoot options and tried to auto repair it failed and this was posted under it '&nbsp;system32/logfiles/srt/srttrail.txt '. Does anyone have any ideas that can help me?

            <p>Hi Peteeez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting a blank screen after logging to the computer. The issue&nbsp;generally arises due to the display drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you are getting a "<strong><em>Blue Screen Error</em></strong>” on the computer. These type errors usually occurs when a serious problem causes Windows 8 to shut down or restart unexpectedly. There are multiple reasons why this type of errors
 occurs on the computer. In this case, the issue could be due to the damaged or corrupted System Files on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue could be due to the incorrect/incompatible graphics card drivers installed on the computer or</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> due to missing boot files\corrupt system files. I would suggest you to boot the computer/surface
 in a low resolution mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try below mentioned methods and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>If you are using any external keyboard, the trick is to hold the Shift button and mash the F8 key, this will
<em>sometimes</em> boot you into the new advanced “recovery mode”,&nbsp; where you can choose to see advanced repair options.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn3.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x274ximage31.png.pagespeed.ic.zHte_Eo_ef.png" height="274" width="650" /><br />
</p>
<p>You will need to click on the Troubleshoot option.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f511x500ximage32.png.pagespeed.ic.ftK7mUB1cE.png" height="500" width="511" /></p>
<p>Now select Advanced Options.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn3.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f509x500ximage33.png.pagespeed.ic.Ka8cTrg5bI.png" height="500" width="509" /></p>
<p>Now choose the Windows Startup Settings option, by the looks of things we were never meant to find Safe Mode.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x381ximage34.png.pagespeed.ic.J3Dk0QcKYa.png" height="381" width="650" /></p>
<p>Finally hit the Restart button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn8.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2f650x347ximage35.png.pagespeed.ic.r7Sf0hLCRJ.png" height="347" width="650" /></p>
<p>Like magic, when your PC reboots you will be able to see Advanced Boot Options screen. Select the option Enable low-resolution video from the list by using down arrow key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1977b8a9-2a16-4f48-96ad-0020e33c2290" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the recovery environment, try booting the computer in in Low-Resolution Video (640*480) Mode and check if you are able to boot and login to the computer desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If yes, then you may try uninstalling and reinstalling the graphics card drivers installed on the computer from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if that resolves the issue. Please refer to this article:

<p>I tried method 2 and method 3 before I posted the original question. They didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up resetting the computer from control panel with option to preserve other files. This triggers reinstalling all system files and service packs (KB). After this, everything works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking back, resetting wasn't that difficult, just took a couple of hours. I am glad Microsoft has this option for us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, my problem solved.</p>
