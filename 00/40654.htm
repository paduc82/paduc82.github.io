<h2>            Status not changing</h2>

<p>
</p><p>My status shows as offline. &nbsp;I've tried to change it by clicking on the icon by the profile picture, through the menu bar, and closing / restarting the application. &nbsp;None of these are working. &nbsp;I'm running Skype version 7.59(37)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mobile app shows my status as active. &nbsp;When I tried changing it to Do not disturb, the laptop application was still unable to change.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play DRM</h2>
                    <p>I am a Rhapsody subscriber and cannot play DRMs on Windows 10 Anniversary (1607).&nbsp; Why did Microsoft remove this ability? When is the operating system going to be updated? I just want this support back. Has anyone found a workaround so I can reestablish
 the ability to play DRM files? If not, can someone give me information on how to find a previous version of Windows O/S (even 8.1) to reinstall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really rotten of Microsoft to force people to use Groove Music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft: GET A CLUE. When will this problem be fixed? Why can't you just put the DRM functionality back? I am furious that Microsoft is trying to force me into using their app. I am an Office subscriber. I should be able to choose whether or not I want
 this functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, quick question:&nbsp; WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO START SUPPORTING DRMs IN WINDOWS 10 ANNVERSARY?_</p>

<p>Hi Rey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that I don't want WMDRM: that does not work with Napster/Rhapsody. Here is their latest message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update on 2<sup>nd</sup><span>&nbsp;</span>Aug 2016 which removed the support for WMDRM tracks and offline playback. Device sync would also fail due to this recent update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the patch; because Microsoft changed the DRM support, all of my music has been deleted from my account and I can't get it back. And, no, the patch does not work. I need to be able to download my music onto my computer before I can play it.
 Because of your WMDRM, all of the music I'd downloaded is now gone. I need to re-download from Rhapsody but, of course, I can't download it so the patch makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could reset my PC to the earlier version. This choice needs to be based on the customer needs, not Microsoft needs.&nbsp; When will this be fixed?</p>

                    The usb 3.0 on surface pro was really useful since I got&nbsp;the device last May 2013, however since it went dead about a month ago, my surface pro's usefulness is down to 60%. I really badly need help, here in Manila Philippines. I understand this is still
 under warranty, can this be replaced?

<h2>            Evolve - &#38;quot&#59;Too young to play&#38;quot&#59; error - Xbox or 2K issue&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Picked up Evolve last week for my son who has been wanting this game for months... &nbsp;Although I am able to log-on with my Live account and play multi-player, when he tries with his account he gets the "you are too young to play" error. &nbsp;I've searched this
 forum and others in an attempt to solve, but haven't had any success yet. &nbsp;The following would be the relevant information:</p>
<p>-We have separate Xbox live accounts, I am the "manager" of his account/user.</p>
<p>-He was born in 2000 (according to his MS account), and all of his Xbox settings are set to regular "Adult", with no additional restrictions.</p>
<p>-I've verified the Adult and no restrictions on the 360, the ONE, as well as the settings on the PC account.</p>
<p>-He has a Origin account (same DOB) linked to his Live account on both the 360 and the ONE, also set up a 2K account (although I think it's the same thing)</p>
<p>Does anyone have a fix for this? &nbsp;Is this an Xbox issue or 2K? &nbsp;According to the 2K site (regarding a similar situation with different game) they said it's a Xbox problem, but he has never had a problem playing online with any other Teen or Mature game (i.e.
 Far Cry, COD's, Halo's, etc.) which leads me to believe it's a developer issue... &nbsp;Ugh, this is just a pain. &nbsp;Thanks for any help you can provide...</p>

<p>LoKick</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;The game is rated M for Mature so that may be the issue here and would be a developer issue.</p>
<p>However, what you can try is logging in to the link below using your gamertag then select your son's account and see if you can't change his permissions from there.</p>

<p>Onyx thank you for your suggestion. I had already checked that (and just double checked after your response), his settings are the same as mine. I understand the game is Rated M, and while there are games I will not allow him to play I put forth my due diligence
 in reviewing a game before allowing him to play "Mature" games. He is aware of what is appropriate on-line behavior (as all on-line activity is considered unrated), he knows how to mute or block people - and even sometimes when to just log-off. &nbsp;I watch and
 listen in to a lot of his online play and am comfortable he knows right from wrong. As such I have given him "adult" status on his Gold Account, I'm just confused as to why this particular game won't honor that.

<p>The developer may have set it to over-ride any Xbox setting, although that isn't a practice I would recommend, but still, if nothing you do can over-ride it, then that may well be the case here.</p>

<h2>            Boot Failed issues</h2>
                    HELP!!! I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop A665 running Windows 7 Home Premium (64 bit). It continuously gives me a "Boot Failed" when I start it up and the only way I am able to get it to turn on is to use the repair disc. I have tried the start up repair
 several times, went into commandprompt and done the bootrec.exe/fixmbr bootrec.exe/fixboot, bootrec.exe/rebuildbcd. on the bootrec.exe/fixboot I get a message that says "The volume does not contain a recognized file system. Please make sure that all required
 file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted." I am lost as to what to do now. This also happens when it resumes from sleep. Plus I am not able to make the backup discs for this computer. Every time I have done it, I get 96% done and
 then it fails the back up. I am getting really frusterated. Please help. It is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue occurs because the boot manager compares two device signatures incorrectly. These device signatures are the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) device signature that is in the extended boot record (EBR) and the device signature that is in the
 master boot record (MBR).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t view shared computer files on network</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a home wireless network with three nodes, a desktop named Desktop hard wired to a wireless router, a wireless notebook named PC-User, and a network printer, also hard wired to the router, that works with both computers. The desktop runs Windows 2000
 Professtional while the notebook runs Windows 7 Home Premium. Appropriate folders on both computers are set for sharing. Neither of the users on the desktop, Administrator or me by name, require passwords. The desktop can see and use shared files on the notebook.
 The notebook shows the desktop as a node on the network but when I click on the desktop icon on the notebook network window to open a desktop folder I get a pop up window that says, "PC-User\my name, a block to type in a password and an error message that
 says logon failure." No amount of fiddling, creating passwords on the desktop and then using them on the notebook when trying to get into the desktop will work. I keep getting the logon failure message. I'd appreciate any ideas on how to solve this problem.
 Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How can I prevent in game app purchases on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My windows 10 login is connected to my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When someone is using an app, whether it is me or a child, they can simply make an in app purchase by clicking twice (no password needed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I either disable the ability to make an in game purchase, or what would be best, is add a password when there is a request for a purchase. (even if its my same password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Re-installed Windows 7. I had been running Money ( 2007) OK but now will not open any account/file as it says they were created in an earlier version. They started out as .mny or .mbf files but now appear to have become M12 and M14. I've asked MS support and
 have tried Money plus Sunset but of course no help. Any ideas what to try next as I know they were running fine before ?<br />
<br />
Other messages have been can't find them , can't open with file ext <br />

<h2>            Windows 7&#47;10- no 5.1 Dolby or DTS test tone- my solution</h2>
                    <p>This thread has been in discussion for years and I found a surprising solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my home theater PC with new mobo/processor etc. My old board used a
<strong>coaxial </strong>spdif to run to my receiver in another room. The new board only had a
<strong>optical</strong> spdif so I bought&nbsp; one of those $10 optical-to-coaxial adapters online. Seemed to work perfectly....the test tone in Windows worked in all the sampling frequencies. What did
<strong>not</strong> work was the Windows Dolby and DTS test tones. It cycled through the speakers but no sound emerged. So my received played digital audio...just not in Dolby or DTS.
<br />
<br />
- After puzzling over this for weeks I noticed in the small print for the digital adapter ad that it could only pass 2-channel digital, not 5.1 or 7.1. In fact none of the cheap adapters I saw could do more than 2 channel.&nbsp; So I bought a 35 foot optical cable
 online and ran it to the receiver. DD and DTS worked instantly.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 10 MBR GPT Initialise Disc Contradiction - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r27hjoighfawsedfuvighbeatrowginf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 MBR GPT Initialise Disc Contradiction</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Fresh /Clean install of Windows 10 Home to C-Drive here.</p>
<p>Using an Acer laptop which had W8 on it (but has an inaccessible [F9] recovery drive [and a Steam games partition/etc])...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we installed WINDOWS 10 (which it had been previously Updated Win8&nbsp;to MS W10; but there were serious C++/vcredist errors locking up the PC; so we did a fresh W10 install yesterday to the C-Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are 2 problems:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Cannot use Disc Management properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that there is an error message about the SSD Windows 10 is on (which seems to contradict Windows 10 existence). Disc Management tells me I "must initialise a disc before Logical Disc Manager can access it" to "MBR or GPT (GUID)"...........</p>
<p>But for it to be running Windows 10, it must be initialised... right?</p>
<p>Or is it referring to a partition? (4?)</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>No matter which I choose, it seems to be wrong.</p>
<p>If I choose "GPT", it says:- </p>
<p>"Ze specified Disc iz not convertible because ze size is less than the minimum size required for GPT Discs."</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>If I choose "MBR" It says:- </p>
<p>"The system cannot find the file specified"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The CD/DVD Drive is inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Discs are invisible and the system does not recognise.</p>
<p>We tried this from a different MS help thread (but it didn`t work):-</p>
<p><strong>Then, at the command prompt type the following ( you can copy and paste) and press "Enter":</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Restart the computer.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it all part of Microsofts plan to drive the public insane, or is there a fix?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>1st... the laptop seems to run fine*.</p>
<p>As for your questions...</p>
<p>1) The C++ problem has gone away, and I have re-installed Steam and it runs fine now with All C++ apps/games. I was also able to install QuickTime to install Mavis Beacon Touch Typing for the first time ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I have No idea if I did a UEFI or Legacy install (I don't recall seeing an option), but the BIOS is set to&nbsp; UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) There were lots of other partitions on the drive; some which are empty and have no drive letter also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) P.S. To complicate matters, I am in Japan, and am unable to read Kanji, so I have to transfer&nbsp;Windows after install into English; that is a royal pain. I cannot read anything during the install. Microsoft think most people in the world would not use English
 as a 2nd Language, and keep it out of foreign versions of Windows installs. So, I don't know for sure if its GPT/Legacy. The partitions indicate GPT in EaseUS Partition master.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) There are (now) just&nbsp;3 main NTFS/GPT partitions on the Drive and 4 tiny non-lettered partitions one of which is fat32* (another *&nbsp;indicates EFI). Ah, checked..... they all indicate GPT, NTFS,&nbsp;Unallocated and Other.
</p>
<p>Others I removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I am not booting to install anymore, Windows 10 is installed, but I went to Disc Management because the CD/DVD drive is invisible now. That means&nbsp; I cannot install Office 2000 or play a CD etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) I may have removed a "Critical partition", but some seemed useless/spare/added because&nbsp;one was stuck between my C:Drive and my G:Games Drive... and I also got rid of my Windows 8 Recovery partition (Asus F9 boot) because it did not function whatsoever
 at any time ever (and always gave a BDSoD if I held it at Boot to recovery [since Windows 10]).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway the lappy runs fine, but no DVD/CD drive, related to the&nbsp;W10 Disc Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried updating DVD/drivers in System; but after an hour+ of it trying to update each time, I quit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I just tried to fix the DVD/CD issue by moving to the W10 `insider program/update`, re-booted ........ but still no DVD/CD ......... and the Disc management issue is still raising its unfunctioning GPT/MBR&nbsp;head.</p>

            Hi  CinKN, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10.

                    I downloaded Discord a while ago for my computer and it was working fine, but a month or so ago I tried updating it, I think something happened, and it stopped working. I haven't been able to access Discord without going to the webpage, which is something
 I don't really want to do because it doesn't look nearly as clean as in-app. Whenever I try to download the app onto my computer now, it just tells me that there was a problem downloading and to either close the little popup telling me or to open the setup
 log. I don't know how that whole log works so I just clicked help and it brought me here. A couple of weeks ago I had my computer shut down and when I powered it back up, Discord opened like there was nothing ever wrong. I kept it open for a while and only
 ever put the computer to sleep instead of shutting down. I then wanted to test what would happen if I closed the window if I would ever be able to open it again. I did, and I haven't gotten it open since so I guess I got what I exp

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Key Not working. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lydia555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Key Not working.</h2>
                    Hello!.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm having some trouble activating windows. It's a bit of a headache. But basically. I had a Laptop that was on Windows 7. I upgraded the laptop to windows 10. A few months Later that Laptop died. I've just got a new Computer, and I've installed Windows 10,
 but my Activation Key is not working. I Have 2 different keys. The original Key, from Windows 7, and a new key that was generated when i upgraded to windows 10. &nbsp;Now i know 1 key per product. But my laptop is dead. So surely installing on a new machine would
 work... But it's not.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I found a suggestion online to download windows 7 iso onto a usb, and reinstall windows with the original key. But when i entered the original key online to download windows 7, it said that the key was already in use.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So what do I do? I already paid for Windows 7 originally.. The Key is already in use stuck on a completely dead laptop, Is there is a way to deactivate an old device? a setting somewhere on my account?<br />
<br />
Any Help would be much appreciated, I really don't want to pay for another key :/, and it's not really fair that I'm having this problem.<br />

            <p>Your upgrade from Windows 7 on said laptop to Windows 10 was a license that was not transferable (unless you purchased Windows 10 retail license already and used that and it was not the free upgrade that you performed on an OEM licensed system...?)</p>

<p>Also, unless Windows 7 wasn't pre-installed on said laptop and the product key sticker is not on that old dead laptop...?</p>

<p>OEM licenses mean they are non-transferable. &nbsp;If the hardware dies, the license dies. &nbsp;If your new system did not come with an OS for whatever reason, you will need to purchase one or install Linux..</p>

<h2>            Black screen on Dell Vostro 1400 laptop</h2>
                    After installing microsoft updates last night and restarting computer I now have a black screen at all times.&nbsp; The computer will boot up and has sound but you can not see anything on the screen even in boot mode.&nbsp; I tried an external monitor and got a
 screen but it was just a bunch of colors flickering on the screen.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Repeatedly tap F8 and Last Known Good Configuration is a possibility.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to
<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe .<br />
<br />
If you can access Safe Mode or Windows then a System Restore might work.<br />

How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span></a><br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />
<span>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1<br />
</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your system<br />
maker will sell them cheap. <br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it only has to
<br />
be bootable).<br />
<br />
How to Create a Vista Recovery Disc<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/141820-create-recovery-disc.html</span><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

<br />
Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;Google searches where several have found different solutions :<br />
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span><br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 thinks I&#39;m on battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 thinks I&#39;m on battery</h2>
                    <p>I just installed a UPS on my AIO Desktop PC and connected the USB cable.&nbsp;&nbsp; I now see a&nbsp;battery icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Nothing unusual so far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed my display would dim after a few secs..&nbsp; Then I noticed after the display shutdown it would require a login to get back on.&nbsp; Then I noticed it was going to sleep.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all the Power and Display options and I have been unable to figure out why this is happening.&nbsp; When the UPS has power the computer should detect that and use the display and power settings specified..&nbsp; It doesn't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click the battery icon and get the battery status popup that shows Battery level percentage, "Power &amp; sleep settings" link, and two buttons "Battery Saver" and the display brightness..&nbsp;&nbsp; When I chance the display brightness via&nbsp;that button, it makes the
 corresponding change to the brightness slider in the Control Panel / Edit Plan Settings..&nbsp; YET it changes the brightness level under the "On Battery" Column" and not the "Plugged In" Column..&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC is certainly plugged in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So regardless of the computer being plugged in, it thinks it's on battery.&nbsp; It goes to sleep after 10 mins and the display turns off after a min.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an APC UPS and I have not installed the PowerChute software preferring to use built in tools whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Battery Saver turned off. </p>
<p>I have adaptive display brightness turned off.</p>
<p>On Battery I have:&nbsp; Turn off the display after 1 min, and Put the computer to sleep after 10 minutes.
</p>
<p>Plugged in I have: Turn off the display after 10 mins, and Put the computer to sleep Never.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea why the behavior is backwards than what is configured? </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience that you are experiencing connecting your devices&nbsp;via Bluetooth and&nbsp;will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error occurs&nbsp;<span>if the service is started by the Local System account instead of by the Local Service account (NT AUTHORITY\LocalService). The Local System account may have insufficient permissions to start the service.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, I would suggest you to follow the below provided steps and check if you are able to&nbsp;start the&nbsp;service and connect the Bluetooth devices.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key + R, type <strong><em>services</em></strong><em><strong>.msc</strong></em> in the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Locate and double click the <strong>Bluetooth support </strong>service.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>Log On </strong>tab.</span></li><li><span>In the <strong>This account </strong>text box, type “NT AUTHORITY\LocalService”.</span></li><li><span>Set both <strong>Password</strong> fields blank.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart the service and check.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>As of now, try the&nbsp;above steps and check if the issue is reproduced.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using docking station for SP4 to connect two external monitors. I've tried adapters mDP to VGA and mDP to DVI. They have same problem. After connecting, it works fine for a long time until I afk for a couple of minutes, the two external monitor will
 lose connection and become dark. In display settings sometimes I can find them with all possible options in grey, sometimes I can not detect them. I can reconnect monitors by pull and insert the mDP adapter to docking station again. Is there any way to fix
 it?</p>

                    <p>I have a Samsung Galaxy 4 android phone on which I recorded some video files. The phone saved these files with a .vnt file extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if there is a way to open them on the Windows 7 platform. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Some websites indicate that there may be a file registry problem and their "bogus" "free" download will indicate several thousand ( I'm being cynical here ) corrupt file problems before demanding payment. Only if one pays will they "repair" the registries.&nbsp;
 There's still no guarantee that I'll be able to open ..vnt video files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone know the solution to this conundrum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure which windows topic to place this under so I'm trying Devices and Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks and much appreciation in advance for any responses.</p>
<p>A.S.</p>

                    <p>Hello, I tried to run an internet troubleshooter from settings on windows 10 but when i click run i get the following message: 'Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.' I
 also get the same message when i try any other troubleshooter on this page. Im the only user/admin on the computer so Im not sure why i wouldnt have permission to do this. Ive attached a screenshot, can anyone please help me with this? Thank you!</p>
