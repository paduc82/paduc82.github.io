<h2>            Problem clicking on links in instant messaging in Outlook</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
I'm having trouble clicking on links/urls my contacts send me through instant messaging as soon as we have enough message for the chat to need a scroll-bar.
<br />
<br />
When we talked enough that there's a scroll-bar, if I try to click on a link they sent me, it doesn't click on it and the scroll-bar goes back to the top of the conversation.<br />
<br />
When we just started talking and there's no scroll-bar yet, if they send me a link, I can click on it. Otherwise, I can't. It just goes back to the top of the conversation. It's a bit frustrating.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone has had trouble with that, and most importantly if this issue could be fixed.
<br />
<br />
Thanks!
                </div>

            <p>unfortunately I think that is the way it is.&nbsp; =-(&nbsp; I have the same problem.&nbsp; I had messenger installed and then upgraded to Skype and so I usually chat from within the Skype interface so I can share and click on links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>wish it would work.&nbsp; if anyone else has a work-around to get links to work, please share it!!</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I tried to simulate your issue and did not encounter the same scenario. Here are the steps that I took so you can review if we had the same procedure. Please correct me if you find any difference or wrong steps that took place.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open my Outlook account and set my status as available for chat. </li><li>Asked a friend to send me a message containing a link. </li><li>Open the chat icon and the message sent to my account. </li><li>Clicked on the link and the website open in a new tab.</li></ol>
<p>By the way I am using Internet Explorer browser ,&nbsp;please verify what browser you are using. In the meantime, please try to clear your browser cache to ensure that this is not contributing to the issue. Please refer to this
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a> and choose the browser that you are using for instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, please check if the issue occur when using other computer or account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
        </p>

            I use Firefox as my browser.<br />
<br />
I tried explaining it in a picture as well, here's the link: http://i692.photobucket.com/albums/vv286/Feiring/extogether.png<br />
<br />
1) the conversation just started. It's short and if I click on the link it works.<br />
2)well I just put a bunch of letters to make the conversation get longer, and now scroll bar!!<br />
3)my buddy sends me a link, and I click on it<br />
4)right when I click on the link, the conversation goes right back up in a split second to the first message (the scroll bar goes right back up), which becomes selected for some reason, and the link doesn't open...<br />
<br />
I don't think this really helps thought...Maybe I should take a video instead?<br />

            Just wanted to stop by and say I have the exact same issue.&nbsp; I'm using Firefox 19.0.2.&nbsp; I had Chrome and Internet Explorer 10 open on another monitor and I let a conversation with a friend go on for a little while in Outlook.com having all 3 browsers open
 to my Outlook.com account.&nbsp; I asked my friend to send a link, and I clicked it in both browsers [both, being Firefox and Chrome, as Internet Explorer never acknowledged the fact that a chat had even started].&nbsp; Chrome opened the link in a new tab, as it should.&nbsp;
 Firefox took me for a ride on the chat elevator to the top of the conversation, and didn't open the link.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I can get the link to open if I rapidly left click on it, or right click on time that I can get the "Open Link in New Tab" text to come up on the right click context menu.&nbsp; By that time, the context menu is still showing up, but the chat had already
 gone to the top of the conversation, and I can usually still click the "Open Link in New Tab" text, and it works [obviously this is nowhere near ideal and takes a lot of trial and error to just open one link].&nbsp; Even trying to trick Firefox/Outlook.com by clicking
 down the center scroll wheel on the mouse over the link to open the link in a new tab still sends me to the top of the conversation.<br />
<br />
This definitely appears to be some sort of compatibility bug.<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I have already sent my petition about this, through the feedback section of the Outlook (about a month now).<br />
<br />
I am experiencing the exact same issue. I usually use Firefox for browsing, daily clean my browser's cache through 3rd party program (CCleaner) and I just cleared my browser's cache manually according to the links you provided. Nothing changed.<br />
<br />
This is indeed frustrating, I have to carefully select the link with my mouse button, copy and paste on a new tab in order to view the content.<br />
<br />
Would really appreciate a fix on this.<br />
<br />
P.S.: I think the previous posts describe sufficiently the problem.<br />

            <p>Hi nikatsip,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replicated this issue on my end using Firefox 20.0.1 and it works fine. Please tell us what version of Firefox&nbsp;you are&nbsp;using. If you are using a lower version, kindly update it.
 make sure Microsoft Silverlight is installed and running for browsers that support it. Silverlight is required for some SkyDrive and Outlook.com functionality. For more information, please follow this

            Hello Marco,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your immediate response, I really appreciate it.
<div><br />
<div>I have been using the latest Firefox version (20.0.1 as you mentioned), on Windows 7 64-bit, with MS Silverlight installed. I even closed all saved tabs, performed an uninstall and fresh installation, but still the issue remains.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please allow me to update with a more detailed description what I experience, just for the sake of the thread: If the chat history with a certain contact has advanced enough for a scroll bar to appear, then clicking on any link that is not in the first
 "page" of the chat history, results in *bugged* instant scroll up and the first page of the chat can be seen. Right-click produces the same result. Opening any link that fits this description is just not possible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I tested Google Chrome and it works just fine. I'll probably use this for my emails. I'm sure you guys have more important things to check out. It feels great to experience customer support (even though&nbsp;the issue hasn't been solved yet).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep it up~</div>

                    Hi,
<div>I'm using Windows <b>XP</b> SP2 and <b>Outlook 2007</b>. I'm developing an add-in for Outlook 2007 using VB6. I created a&nbsp;CommandBarButton button for the add-in as the code below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Private oPopup As Office.CommandBarPopup</div>
<div>'Outlook explorer</div>
<div>Private oActiveExplorer As Outlook.Explorer</div>
<div>Private&nbsp; oBtnAbout&nbsp;&nbsp;As Office.CommandBarButton</div>
</div>
<div>..........</div>
<div>Set oPopup = oActiveExplorer.CommandBars("Menu Bar").Controls.Add(Office.MsoControlType.msoControlPopup, , , , Temporary:=True)</div>
<div>oPopup.caption = "Test Addin"</div>
<div>
<div>Set oBtnAbout&nbsp;= oPopup.Controls.Add(Office.MsoControlType.msoControlButton)</div>
<div>With oBtnAbout&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .BeginGroup = True</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.caption = "About"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.faceId = 326</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.Style = Office.MsoButtonStyle.msoButtonIconAndCaption</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.OnAction = "<b>Action1</b>"</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;End With</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sub <b>Action1</b>()</div>
<div>'Do something interesting here..</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, clicking on the button "About" does nothing. It seems that there is a security problem preventing the sub Action1 from being executed. I'm wondering if there is any problem with my code or anyway of attaching click event handler to the button.</div>

                    I have an email address with domain.com.&nbsp; I have spent countless hours trying to understand why I cannot connect to their server.&nbsp; This is not a new account.&nbsp; I have had this account for several years and now all of a sudden it stopped working.&nbsp; Domain.com
 has changed all of my settings and they still cannot get it to work.&nbsp; Domain.com now tells me that MS Outlook 2007 is trying to connect to their server via SSL but that they do not support SSL.&nbsp; I have checked my account settings and the box for SSL is unchecked.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?<br />

            The account type is POP.<br />
<br />
The send/error message is:<br />
<br />
"Log onto incoming mail server (POP3): The connection to the server was interrupted. If this problem continues, contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).&nbsp; The server responded: -ERR Cannot establish SSL with POP server 66.11.233.51:110,
 SSL_connect error 336031996"<br />
<br />
The instruction you refer to are the same instructions that Domain.com continuously refers me to.<br />
<br />
Since the error message says "cannot establish SSL with POP..." Domain.com tells me that they do not support SSL.&nbsp; I have checked and the box that says "the connection requires a secure connection (SSL)" is NOT checked.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />

Hi, i'm using WM 6.0 with Activesync 4.5.0 build 5096.&nbsp; I have an O2 Xda Orbit and continually get the error code 85030011 when&nbsp;which is listed as a
<strong>Pocket</strong> <b>Outlook</b> <b>Object</b> <strong>Model failure.&nbsp; </strong>
I have uninstalled and reinstalled activesync and done a hard resset on the Orbit but the problem still exists. There seems to be very little info regarding this on the web.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to resolve the issue?&nbsp; Cheers.

<h3> copperxray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2007 - Find and Replace dropdown list empty</h2>
                    
<p>I use the Find and Replace feature in Excel alot and have words that I replace on a normal basis.&nbsp; When I go to the Find and Replace window, I have to type the same word over and over again.&nbsp; I noticed a dropdown list is present, but it is always empty.&nbsp;
 Is there a way to have excel keep the list of words I use in that dropdown list so all I have to do is just go to the dropdown list each time, instead of typing it???</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Synchronise files to storage card on wm6 device</h2>
                    
<p>I've searched everywhere for an answer to this without success. Is there a reliable, proven way to edit the registry on a wm6 device or in XP so that Activesync can sync files to storage card instead of the internal memory of the device? The closest answer
 I got was this one from Jack Cook @&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobile/thread/df005e15-7116-43a8-aeb5-3e0122442487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobile/thread/df005e15-7116-43a8-aeb5-3e0122442487</a>&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;My quess is that a registry change on your PC might allows for where it is placed.&nbsp; I just did a quick look and found this on my Vsta PC:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows CE Services\Partners\bff30d84\Services\Synchronization<br />
<br />
"There is a value for Briefcase path that if&nbsp;you change might do it for you.&nbsp; If you do try it, caution is the word!&nbsp; Make a backup of your registry BEFORE&nbsp; any changes!!!"</p>
<p>However there is not detailed information to assist a layman like me to undertake the registry change.</p>

<p><br />
I am assuming that you are asking here how to get in and edit the registry.&nbsp; There are several programs out there to help you edit the registry.&nbsp; Here is a link to download and install a free registry editor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pocketpcfreeware.com/en/index.php?soft=31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfreeware.com/en/index.php?soft=31</a></p>
<p>If you are NEW to editing the registry, be cautious of changes because you can make a mistake and mess up your device.&nbsp; Of course, if you do, you can always perform a hard reset to bring it back to life but that is not where you want to be so CAUTION is
 the word of the day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are asking how to edit the registry on your PC, then you run REGEDIT from the START menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BE CAREFUL!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE CAREFUL!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE CAREFUL!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Document with Table in MS Word temporarily Not Responding when I click - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Document with Table in MS Word temporarily Not Responding when I click on imported image</h2>
                    <p>I have an MS Word&nbsp;document that I use all the time.&nbsp; It's my TO DO list and contains a single table that runs many pages.&nbsp; I've been having the following&nbsp; problem for around the past 9 months, maybe longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cut-and-paste an image -- i.e., from a webpage -- into a row of the table, the document becomes problematic.&nbsp; From then on, whenever I use my mouse to click on the image or anything in that row, the application temporarily locks up (for around 10 seconds),
 the whole screen goes gray, and I see the following error message displayed on the top left in the document title area, "TO DO -- Word (Not Responding)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to fix the problem is to delete that row.&nbsp; Even if I delete just the image, the row seems to "remember" the problem and still locks up if I click in it.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />The issue might have caused due to add-in. Open Word in safe mode and check if it works fine in safe mode. If Word works fine in safe mode then disable the add-ins enabled and check if it helps. Follow the steps mentioned below to open Word in safe mode:
<br />
<br />·         Close Word.
<br />
<br />·         Press the windows key+R on the keyboard to open the Run window.
<br />
<br />·         In Run window and type winword /safe
<br />
<br />Note: There is a space between 'Winword' and '/'.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you are able to work with Word without any problem then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below:
<br />
<br />·         In Word, click on File&lt; Options&lt; Add-ins.
<br />
<br />·         Under Manage select COM Add-ins.
<br />
<br />·         Click on GO options beside Manage, uncheck all the add-ins and click Ok.
<br />
<br />·         Try to open Word and check if it works fine.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

            Sometimes the response of a web server or a script on the page can cause problems when you paste from a web page. A couple of things you might try:
<br />Try a different paste option - click the arrow under the paste button and try some of the options there (eg merge formatting rather than keep source formatting)
<br />Rather than copy the picture, save it as an image to disk somewhere, then insert the saved picture in your document.

            Right click on the image
<br />about half way down the context menu is the hyperlink section. 
<br />If there is only a single "Hpyerlink" option, no problem
<br />If there are 3:  Edit / Open / Remove, click on the Remove option.
<br />
<br />The second case means that the image is linked to an external source, presumably on the web. Word goes out to retrieve that image to make sure it is current. This can cause the delay you are seeing. 
<br />
<br />Personally, when pasting web content into word documents I make a point of removing the link.  If the linked source is lost, for example the web site is closed or even if the image is moved, when Word can't find it the image will be removed from your document.  That can be annoying if the now missing image has significant information.

<h2>            Unable to enter formula for one worksheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Excel 2010 at work. I have a workbook with several worksheets and on a couple of the worksheets I cannot enter any formulas. When I type "=SUM(R2C1:R9C1)" for instance and hit Enter, it doesn't sum anything and the contents of the cell actually
 has the syntax of the formula written in it instead of the resulting calculation. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what it was you were trying to get me to do HansV, but I found something that worked for me. I just re-entered the numbers in the cells. This fixed the problem I was having with formulas not recognizing the contents of the cells. I was able
 to do this because it was not a prohibitive amount of data I was dealing with. </p>
<p>I don't know if this is something that happens to all cells if they were formatted as text originally, but from now on I'm going to always check the cell formatting of a sheet before I enter any formulas.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to sort the attachment in Outlook with specific configurations.<br />
If you&nbsp; manually drag attachments to Outlook ,&nbsp; they will be sorted irregularly.<br />
You can set up your folder file order. When you click<strong> Attach File</strong> button in some folders, the folder file order is the same as the file order which you choose in your Outlook.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6d41c64-17aa-41be-81c9-16b73b86cfdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6d41c64-17aa-41be-81c9-16b73b86cfdd" /></a></p>

<h2>            Approved Apps not available when attempting to add a new app</h2>
                    <p>Hi - Question about approved apps.&nbsp; A site owner requested a couple apps from the store be approved for SharePoint online, I was able to approve them fine, and they show as approved in the App Request section.&nbsp; However when going to Add an App on the site,
 they don't display.&nbsp; Is there a lag at all that anyone knows of or any other kind of step that needs to be taken?&nbsp; The apps were approved from the emails that are generated to the Admin.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Appreciate any insight, thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is for Sway, so I think I need to direct you to a different forum, but I'm not exactly clear on where that is yet. I think you might be referring to the topic in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Request-app-installation-permissions-5a25c5b0-bdfb-49f8-8ca3-046edc9cf598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Request-app-installation-permissions-5a25c5b0-bdfb-49f8-8ca3-046edc9cf598</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we probably need to get you to the SharePoint Online forum.</p>
<p>1. go to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com">http://answers.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>2. Click on Office</p>
<p>3. Under Browse by product or topic, click All Topics</p>
<p>4. Category should be set to Office, Office Topic should be set to SharePoint Online</p>
<p>5. Click Apply in the middle of the screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you can browse the existing threads or click the Ask the Community link to start a new thread with Office Topic already set to SharePoint online.</p>

            <p>Hi adams-smith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a lot of drives or attached peripheral storage devices or massive amounts of data (I mean many terabytes and not just a few - or maybe a DVD/CD "jukebox")?&nbsp; A full scan will go after everything attached to the computer (not network drives, but
 anything actually attached even if you had no intentions of having that scanned).&nbsp; The number of files can be inflated dramatically if you have chosen to scan archives in Settings - where they will be in essence opened and each individual file inside scanned
 separately.&nbsp; All of those could result in an abnormally long scan and number of files, but I suspect that isn't the case but did want to mention it to rule out what might be obvious but otherwise overlooked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is absolutely not normal by any means.&nbsp; It suggests a problem with system resources (do you have a lot open and running at the same time - where is task manager putting the CPU and memory utilization?), with confiicts (are&nbsp;you ABSOLUTELY sure you have
 no other security software program installed at the same time or EVER installed but not fully removed using the applicable removal tool for that program?), or there is some installation problem of some sort or perhaps you are infected or installed it on an
 already infected machine.&nbsp; What warning are you talking about - what does it say exactly word-for-word with any codes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases like this, I generally go with this standard advice compliments of our extraordinarily good Forum Moderator, Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>What operating system and service pack?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Prior Security Software?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Any security software still installed?</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC. Reboot.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></b><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a></span></p>

            <p>There are a few things that can cause a scan to take a long time:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Slow PC - If you are on an older machine, it will take some time to process all of the files.&nbsp;<strong>Recommendation</strong>: Let the scan complete.</p>
<p>2. Degraded Hard drive - If you're hard-drive is not performing properly, it can take a very long time to scan.&nbsp; Generally, you will experience slow down when you run other programs.&nbsp;However, if&nbsp;there is damage to a specific part of the disk, then you may
 only experience the problem during scans.&nbsp; <strong>Recommendation: </strong>Run chkdisk on all of your drives.&nbsp; If there are any errors, you can either replace the drive, or exclude the files affected by the damage in the MSE settings.</p>
<p>3. Infection - Some malware will intentionally cause scans to take longer, to avoid detection.&nbsp;
<strong>Recommendation</strong>: Contact support (<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a>) or try the beta for Microsoft's Standalone&nbsp;Offline System Sweeper (<a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper</a>)</p>

    <title>Calibri Font For Commercial Printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dutaadijaya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calibri Font For Commercial Printing</h2>
                    I use Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2010 on my computer. My problem right now... I don't really understand with the license term.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question is, can I use Calibri Font, for commercial use? In my case, for a book that I'm currently writing. Both for Cover and Content of the book.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry for my bad English. It's not my language. Thanks</div>

            Yes, you can when you use the font as part of a document. <br />
<br />
You cannot resell it as a font on it's own or part of a collection, but that is not what you are doing so it is not a problem.<br />

            As far as I know, a legitimate version of Microsoft Office Home and Business 2010 gives you the right to use Word 2010 and the fonts that come with it (such as Calibri) for commercial purposes. So you should be OK.

<p>It is hard to see how you managed that. MDB is a type of Access file sometimes used by Word as a merge data source. You<strong>may</strong> be able to add it to a new merge document then use the old Mailmerge Helper to save the data source as a comma delimited

<h2>            Unable to open a new tab in IE8 on XP SP3</h2>
                    <p>New installation of Windows XP SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed IE8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed all available updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When trying to open a new tab it ALWAYS opens a new window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run the Microsoft FixIt Tool 50680 from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2539060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2539060</a>&nbsp;and the problem is unresolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling IE8, rebooting, and then re-installing and it is just the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use Firefox and the tabs work, no problem, but how can I fix the IE8 problem? Why do Microsoft make it so exceptionally difficult to get help from them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Ultimately the answer was to fully reset Internet Explorer 8.<br />
<br />
So in IE Tools -&gt; Internet Options. On the General tab click Delete for Browsing History and tick ALL the boxes (ie Delete All). Then on the Advanced tab click Restore Advanced Settings and the Reset button to Reset all IE settings to "factory original".<br />
<br />
Now close IE and re-open and voila - it worked!<br />
<br />

<h2>            report print all fields in one page landscape won&#39;t fit</h2>
                    <p>I have this report to print and it has eight fields which means 8 columns to print and I cannot afford to leave any of those out plus I have managed to limit them in their minimum length but even printing in landscape won't fit the page in one sheet.
</p>
<p>Print preview after a while and some trials it started skipping everything so I had to close the database and reopen in order to get the print report image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In libreoffice I have page break vertically placed in access page break it only goes horizontally .</p>
<p>What is going on here and is there is way to automatically let access fit all my report data in one page sheet ?</p>

            Use Layout view to size your controls to fit on the one page. You can set the controls to Can Grow so text that won't fit horizontally will expand the textbox.

            <p>That's already been done. It is not a solution for me because the report looks very ugly with all the controls' sizing so I was hoping to get a different automated action but it doesn't seem to exist.</p>
<p>The only thing I could do is eliminate some fields so as to get one report with half and a second with the rest of them and keeping always the record numbers for relating them.</p>
<p>Also another thing that is useful is to export to ods or excel form so managing from spreadsheet is kind of faster to get what I need here.</p>
<p>Actually I have already exported the table in ods and used Calc to get my report and printed by using the page break option Calc has so I was just wondering what can Access do in such cases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>That is a shortcoming of Access' report writer. But it is specific to only certain types of reports. A screen shot of your report might help us understand better. But the only choices to make your controls fit to the width is:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) to reduce the font</p>
<p>2) resize the controls</p>
<p>3) use Can Grow</p>
<p>4) stagger the controls over 2 or more lines</p>

 with an option in Windows Live Hotmail to upgrade to Outlook.com. Has anyone had the same issue? If so does anyone know why I might be experiencing this? and whether there is a work around to upgrade to the new Outlook.com service? Kind Regards

            <p>Some accounts that are "co-branded" are not currently eligible to be upgraded to Outlook.com. This includes accounts that were offered through companies like Bell Canada and Telstra, as well as some MSN accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be addressed soon, so please be patient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, then I suggest creating a new email address and temporarily forwarding your old mail to the new inbox. But, keep in mind that you won't be able to "merge" these accounts later.</p>

<p>Hi AliceGhryfgrtesdf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know this is a known issue about the search not working in the Outlook for Mac after the Mac OS update. Microsoft is aware of &nbsp;and investigating this issue. It may need some time for the dedicated engineers in Microsoft to
 fix it up, so please wait for some time with your patience, thanks.&nbsp; For more information, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/search-doesn-t-work-in-outlook-for-mac-after-macos-upgrade-b73de6f1-aeb9-4720-bbbe-de65ab50012e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Search doesn't work in Outlook for Mac after MacOS upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you are using Office 365 account, you can try to sign into the Outlook Web App(
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/</a>) and search the emails you want there as a temporary workaround, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding and patience will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>
