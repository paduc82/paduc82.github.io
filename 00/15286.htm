<h2>            PowerPoint 2016 save to network drive fails and causes data loss</h2>
                    
<p>We are having a problem with saving PowerPoint files to a network volume. When the user opens a PowerPoint document from a network share (smb), makes changes, and then selects save from the file menu, images in the document are lost. The original file is
 about 160mb. During the save operation a dialog box opens indicating the progess. Near the end of the save operation the progress bar hangs, and then an error pops up saying "an error occurred while saving this file" "To fix this problem, try reducing the
 file size of your presentation.". When they close PowerPoint and reopen the file, some to most of the images have been replaced with red x placeholders. It seems like the file overwrite partially completes, then fails, leaving the original document damaged.
 This is a major problem but has not yet resulted in data loss since this has not happened to any sole-copy original files yet.</p>

<p>The problem seems to appear once files reach about 150mb. I just recreated it on my own computer by gradually increasing the size of the powerpoint and saving it until it failed. Upon receiving the error, I tried doing a saveas with the document still open
 but data was still lost in the open file, and in this particular instance the original file was deleted completely.</p>

            <p>Your syntax looks correct. The reason why the other example is different, there are TWO WAYS to pass parameters to functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#1 choice:<br />
You pass the parameters based on their position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for a message box with a title, you can use this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MsgBox "hello", , "box title"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above, the "prompt part" = "hello"</p>
<p>In the above the "title part" = "box title"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in all functions you do NOT necessary have to pass parameters based on position. You can use what is called named parameters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The advantage of "named" parameters is order or position DOES NOT matter. So if I decide to use named parameters for the msgBox command, then I can use this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 choice</p>
<p><br />
MsgBox Title:="box title", prompt:="hello"</p>
<p>Or I can use this:</p>
<p>MsgBox prompt:="hello",Title:="box title"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note how the ORDER or POSITION of the parameters DOES NOT matter. However, ALL THREE of the above are functional THE SAME command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the reason why you see different syntax is because there are TWO WAYS to use functions.</p>
<p>In your first example you state your code works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If moving the code to a DIFFERENT application does not work?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the form names used in the second application MUST be different, or you are not sharing some other unknown details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, since your first example (that does NOT use named parameters) works fine, then it should work just fine in the other application. The issue is NOT different syntax but ONLY that your new and other and different application clearly
 must have different names for the forms involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your syntax looks fine – the issue is different form names in the "other" application.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The basic issue is you have some code that works just fine in one application. That same code does not work in a new application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you posted two different syntax examples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you are asking why the help has such a DIFFERENT code sample then what you have (or at least I assume you are doing as such, else why post two VERY different examples of code?)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the reason why the help file has such a DIFFERENT syntax from what you posted is there are two ways of using a function (as I explained above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my explain here is WHY YOUR example looks SO VERY different then the help example. And if you are not confused by the help example then why are you quoting and posting that example that you note is not working for you and of no help then?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My simple suggest is really just that, a simple suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I am stating I think it best you continue using the same code and same syntax as the code that you stated works so well in your first case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we cleared up why your two posted example are so different to the reading public here (<em><strong>after all, people are here to learn</strong></em>), then the next issue remains:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your first example code should work in the other application. We just don't know why and that of course is your basic question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ONLY reason I can think of why this code does not work in the new application is that your form name(s) are different, or as noted there is some different nesting of the forms due to (possible) use of a navigation form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, since you have in the past had success with the particular format and particular syntax you posted, then I think you should continue to use that same base format and tweak that code to work in the new application. (don’t use the help example
 format you posted since as noted it uses a DIFFERENT format for the function parameters).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, I am in effect agreeing with you that it makes LITTLE sense to adopt the help file syntax (that YOU quoted) and that YOU yourself claim is confusing and not helping you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I 100% agree – it makes ZERO sense to use the DIFFERENT syntax and DIFFERENT format THAT YOU outlined and posted from the help file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, CONTINUE using your existing syntax as opposed to the help file syntax which we BOTH agree is not only confusing, but is in fact not required here!</p>
<p><br />
The simple and basic advice here is to continue using, and stick to the syntax and format that you had the most success with in the past.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As noted, since your given first example code does not work in the second example, then something in regards to the form name must be different. Perhaps there is some other issue we simple have not yet considered here such as nesting or navigation forms.
 The code should work, but since it does not then something must be different in the second application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the basic lesson and first advice from the "get go" is I much think it is best to stick to using your first syntax that you at least had some success in the past.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible I am not grasping why you posted two very different syntax here if you did not want a explain as to why the two syntaxes are so different? Perhaps you DO want to adopt the second syntax format you posted, but you have freely admitted that
 such a syntax from the help is of little use to you. And my point is you don't need to adopt that syntax to fix your problem anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the form names are <strong>exactly the same in both applications</strong>, and you double checked that the syntax of&nbsp;your code is&nbsp;also 100% the same (no type-o's), then additional trouble shooting will be required.</p>

<h3> larrymiller35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where&#39;s the progress bar&#63; When does today end&#63;</h2>
                    Two things used to do the right thing on Entourage 2004 (which I do not mourn). But do not do them right on Outlook 2011 Mac. They are:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. A progress bar used to alway be visible in Entourage. Now it is visible in Outlook ONLY if I hit command-7 as I am booting the program and thus bringing in new email.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Question One:&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>How do I keep the progress bar always visible? Or do I have to invoke it each time I boot the program?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. "When does today end" sounds either metaphysical or science fictional. It's neither.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I set a task reminder for End of today. That used to mean 5 PM. Now it means 4 PM, which is when it pops up. I find no control or pref for this but there must be one somewhere.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Question Two:</b></div>
<div>How do I make 5 PM the End of today reminder?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Txt&#39;s stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Day 4 with the 920 and I just hit my first major issue.&nbsp; A short time ago I tried to send a text message and kept getting an error "cannot send, Try Again?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated try's didn't work, so I turned the phone off and then back on, and WHOOSH a rush of txt's
 that I hadn't gotten....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does not boad well for this phone.&nbsp; I have a 14 day period where I can take the phone back to ATT and get an iPhone 5,&nbsp; I may have to if this isn't at least on the radar to get fixed.</p>

<p>I thought of something that had changed,&nbsp; I insalled the Skype App Beta.&nbsp; So after this I uninstalled it, and "rebooted" the phone.&nbsp; I have no idea if this could be the cause, but it's the only change made, so I'm going to keep an eye on it.</p>

            Hi Rottieguy,<br />
<br />
As Jimmyireland has stated, this is a network issue not the phone itself. I have had the same problem myself yesterday and this morning in texting the missus. It has happened before on my Nokia N8, so I know it's not the phones but rather the network operator
 and their coverage. Have had patchy mobile data coverage myself too. You will have to take the issue up with your network carrier.

<p>My apology's if this comes off the wrong way, but I just don't buy the "network issue" on this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone had been working fine, and stopped getting text's.&nbsp; I was also unable to send texts.&nbsp; I did not try making a phone call or any other functions (I should have in hindsight), and when I "rebooted" the phone the queued up text's all came in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was at home all day that day so It's not as if I was swapping around cell towers.&nbsp; This smacks of phone side issue because the only thing that changed was power cycling the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I'm not sure if the Skype beta had anything to do with this or not, but it had to be a client side (phone) issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's the same type of situation as if a computer were to look like it's connected to the internet but not get or send email, you reboot and then it works, does that mean it was your email providors fault?&nbsp; Hardly, that's a client issue.&nbsp; Such is the case
 here.&nbsp; The texts were all delivered after the device was restarted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had the texts all come through without the device restart, then yes, I'd say network issue, but in this case the device restart "fixed" it.</p>

            Well I buy it, because I've had the same thing happen with my partner's iPhone where she's missed messages and then upon rebooting the phone they all come in. I guarantee you it is solely a network issue.

<p>This could legitimately be a problem unrelated to a network issue as I have experienced this problem as well. I think this problem relates to the problem of the People's Hub and email apps hanging on sync as I noticed that my text messaging died as soon
 as I was hit with the sync issues. After a factory reset of the phone the sync issue and failing texts seem to have disappeared. Presently I also have limited the number of apps I install and my 920 is running like a boss so I assume the issue is related to
 a disconnect between the OS and certain apps. Which ones exactly I cannot pinpoint. Someone suggested in another thread that uninstalling Skype might alleviate the problem so perhaps you could give that a try?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure that Nokia/MS will release a (sorely needed) firmware update in the coming weeks (hopefully sooner) so the choice to weather the next few weeks is up to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update:&nbsp; Has happened two more times.&nbsp; Different locations (so different towers),&nbsp; this time I tried some other functions, web browsing worked, phone calls worked (both call out and rec.), and I was able to use several apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Durring this time the phone did not retrieve the Txt messages, nor email.&nbsp; Power cycle of the phone resolved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of several reasons I'm returning this phone today.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I've had my 920 for two and a half weeks now but haven't missed any incoming text messages. Occasionally I've had to resend a text when I'm in a low signal area but that used to happen with my N8 and Samsung Galaxy S too. Definitely a network issue for
 me as I used the same SIM in my previous two devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;With the Samsung, I was advised by my network operator to pull the battery out while the phone was still switched on then replace and power back on. This was to force the phone to re-register itself on the network. I presume that by rebooting the 920 has
 the same effect. Did you receive a new SIM when you got your 920 or are you using an older SIM?</p>

<h2>            Default setting when Office 2010 AND 2013 are installed on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I've had Office 2013 and 2010 concurrently installed on my Win 8.1 machine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use both Word 2010 and 2013 sometimes, but mostly Excel 2010 (because it still has the MDI) and 2013 concurrently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only use Outlook 2013, but when I click links on web sites that open a mail window, it tries to choose 2010 instead of 2013.&nbsp; I've tried all the normal stuff, like setting default programs and such in Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't put my finger on what to do to force IE to point to 2013 Outlook when a mailto:&nbsp;link is clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably a simple thing, but I've spent too much time already :)</p>

<div>My job requires opening multiple documents from many different clients. I've noticed an issue lately where occasionally the last line or two of text will run off the page. It will look like the document ends mid-sentence, but I've found that if I delete
 some characters, more words will slip into view. If I delete too many (generally around 6 words before the 'cut-off'), the entire paragraph will be deleted and I have to undo twice to get it back.&nbsp;</div>

            Sorry for the late reply, I wasn't able to with site maintenance.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This has happened on about 3 files out of the past 100. Not from the same person or of the same format.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I reopened the document yesterday, I had more 'hidden' text being shown, but it wasn't what was there previously and it was nearly complete gibberish. No changes has been saved. I reopened it again while typing this, and it's the same as yesterday;
 since it's not hidden now, I can't really check to see if that helps.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did try removing formatting, but it didn't convert it back to normal.&nbsp;</div>

            I've been having a similar problem, and others have reported it too.&nbsp; In my case it is text that "gets lost" at page breaks. It just doesn't display properly.
<br />
<br />
On the surface it suggests possible document corruption.&nbsp; I don't know for sure, since I have no other apparent problems with the files.<br />
<br />
The workaround I've found is to switch views, usually between page layout and web. The forced redraw displays the missing lines.

Is there a link where I can download a new driver from? Or would it need to be a fresh re-install?&nbsp;

<div>I'll also certainly be using Rohn007's advice about switching views. I hadn't even thought about trying that!</div>

    <title>Setting a tab beyond the right margin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> watson scott swail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting a tab beyond the right margin</h2>
                    <p>I have read other posts about setting a tab to the right of the right margin, which is very important in TOCs for reports so that the long titles of entries does not go right to the page number. None of the other threads seemed to deal with Office for Mac
 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used this feature for literally decades in various iterations of the program. But not know. While the tab icon can be placed beyond the right margin, the text (in this case "number") only goes to the right margin. I used to set the tab for the right
 full margin, and bring in the margin icon about half an inch. But that doesn't work anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's going on?&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, neither Word 2016 on Windows nor Windows 2016 on Mac lets you move the right tab stop beyond the margin using the ruler. Word 2010 (Windows) used to let you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can achieve the same result in Mac Word 2016 by</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. clicking Home-&gt;Styles Pane to open the Styles pane</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. locate each TOC style that you actually use (by default it would be TOC 1 to TOC 3) and...</p>
<p>&nbsp;c. click the dropdown to the right of the style</p>
<p>&nbsp;d. Click Modify Style...</p>
<p>&nbsp;e. Click the dropdown to the right of "Format" at the bottom left of the dialog box</p>
<p>&nbsp;f. &nbsp;Click Tabs...&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;g. Click the tab you need to change, if any (e.g. here I see a right tab at 6.3" ) and click the "-" button below the list of tab stops to delete it</p>
<p>&nbsp;h. Click the "right" radio button and select the tab leader you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i. Enter the tab value you want (say 6.8") and click the + button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(NB, unless something has changed, you have never actually been able to alter the settings for existing tabs - you always have to delete the one you want to change, and create a new one with the settings you want).</p>

<p>I believe it was Word 2013 that first removed the possibility to set a tab stop outside the page margin. What you should do, instead, is set a right indent, which will let you set a tab stop to the right of the indent, but still within the right margin.
 At least in Word for Windows, you will have to use the Tab dialog box to set the tab stop; you can't use the ruler for tab stops outside of a right indent.</p>

<p>hi samantha,</p>
<p>we checked your domain and found that it is not associated with any office 365 tenant. your mailbox is hosted in an on-premises exchange, not in office 365.</p>
<p>the outlook connectivity test is used for windows outlook desktop. for outlook for mac, it uses exchange web sercices (ews) for auto setup. so we suggest you run the exchange web services connectivity test (synchronization, notification, availability, and
 automatic replies). before that, please also run the outlook autodiscover test.</p>
<p>to help investigate the issue, we need to collect some more information:</p>
<p>1.are you an admin or end user? <br />
2.the screenshot of the error you got.<br />
3.the detailed version of your outlook for mac.<br />
4.does the issue affect any other users in your organization?<br />
5.please provide the complete rca test logs for ews and autodiscover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>to protect your privacy, i have sent you a private message. here is the url of the pm:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations. you can provide the requested information&nbsp; by replying it.</p>
<p>to upload the screenshots&nbsp;in forum, you can click<strong> use rich formatting</strong> when replying and then click the

            I have an office full of people using either AA8 or AA9.&nbsp; If I have to purchase/upgrade to AA10 fixing this Outlook2010 bug will cost me approximately $5,000 USD.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But never mind that - every other application in Office 2010 provides the ability to save as/pdf.&nbsp; Where is that capability in Outlook2010?&nbsp;

            Rather than buying more adobe, look into 3rd party PDF printer drivers. They show up as a "printer" that generates PDFs. Typically they cost $10-30 for corporate licenses. They work in all apps.<br />
<br />
I have been using (and still do in Office 2010)&nbsp; bullzipPDF: http://www.bullzip.com/products/pdf/info.php&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of other similar tools out there.<br />
<br />
Have you looked at the 'SAVE AS" PDF option. I don't know if it is available in Outlook, I don't have it to check.<br />

Have you considered checking the site related to the product in question - Adobe Acrobat is not a Microsoft product and first step would be to ensure that your current Adobe program version&nbsp;explicitly supports O'2010 directly or determine how older versions
 are used. Completely puzzles me why&nbsp;every&nbsp;issue&nbsp;involving non-Microsoft products that integrate with Office/Outlook are always immediately assumed to be a Microsoft problem (or Microsoft's responsibility)</p>

<p>Is there supposed to be a logical reason why it is acceptable for Adobe not to ensure that all their old versions (AA8 / AA9) work with anything released until the end of time? Why is acceptable for them not to retrofit all their programs with the same capabilities
 described in the FAQ on their website?&nbsp;&nbsp;(rhetorical questions - not looking for an answer).<br />

            The question isn't why Adobe Acrobat 2009 version whatever isn't compatible with Office 2010, but why Microsoft would render the business standard document format (pdf) incompatible with a Microsoft Office product that offers no pdf capability.&nbsp; What puzzles
 me is why a company with a history of anti-trust convictions would put their competitors in this position.&nbsp; Why Adobe would want to paid for a compulsory upgrade - not so puzzling :)&nbsp;

<p>Funny thing -&nbsp;the very competitor that you so strongly support is the very one that is the cause of the problem that you feel is Microsoft's responsibility (not to mention will cost you $5000+ as per a previous statement if you decided to upgrade).</p>

            <p>Will have to stand slightly&nbsp;corrected. Prior to '2010 - PDF required an addon. Office '2010 now has a built-in PDF writer (don't know whether that is a natively written driver or not).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To simulate Outlook '2007 - would need a PDF "printer" which on my O'2007 systems&nbsp;comes from Adobe. So to that extent - Microsoft has not "innovated my ability to save Outlook 2010 messages as PDF away" - just implement a solution that provides the same
 capbilities. </p>
<p>Do a search on the term "pdfmoutlook Outlook 2010" and there will be countless results about the Adobe addin not working with Outlook '2010 and the answer as to why it does not (if it still doesn't) is something that only Adobe can answer. One such thread

            <p>The point of the oringal post is that Microsoft has the 'Save as PDF' option in every product Excel, Word, Access, Powerpoint except for Outlook.&nbsp; I have a real problem with this issue as well.&nbsp; I hate Adobe products because between flash and Acrobat print
 driver out systems frequently crash and they are overly pushy in their auto-updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft must have a reason for not including this otherwise FREE capability that exists in all elements of Office.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those that interact with legal issues or need to store indivudal messages that are not editable for the record, saving Messages as a PDF is vital.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I bought a tool from Sperry Software that is an add-on. It sucks and crashes a lot but whenever I need to provide an e-mail chain for legal purposes I can do it.

            <p>My account is having the same issues...I have deleted over 10,000 of these Mail Delivery Failure&nbsp;messages thsi morning...I have not sent any e-mail and I never heard of these domains which are sending the Mail Delivery Failure messages.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try changing my password to something else again but I still believe this is not a problem on my end or with my personal hotmail e-mail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that there is something going on wtih Microsoft and Hotmail (Outlook) which is allowing people to see your profile and then they send these bogus Mail Delivery Failure messages to bog down your IN BOX and SPAM folders.</p>

<p>I understand correctly: Go back to Win 8.1, and then back to Win10?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, until this bug is solved, I would stick with Windows Phone 8.1, if you want to use Czech as keyboard. The Hungarian keyboard crashes the whole phone on a regular basis, I guess it is the same for the keyboard from Czech.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft knows this error?</p>
<p>Will be fixed in future updates?</p>
<p>I have to wait for the next update?</p>
<p>Do you know the answers?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Microsoft knowns about this error and in the latest Technical Preview this&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/03/10/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-14283/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">was fixed</a>. Microsoft
 promised to give bug fixes even to the current release branch 10586. Until today, this fix is not released on that branch. Perhaps it is within the April Cumulative Update. However, because Microsoft does not talk to us, I do not know. All this are guesses.
 The April update might come tomorrow. Next week. That fix might not get into April updates, might come June, might never come into the 10586 branch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that is only one part of the story (only one software bug). The other one is installing that keyboard at all. That should do if you follow my&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/62c36334-9550-4b05-b666-c3d543a27413?threadId=1a32ef28-b466-4faa-a3a1-be7025b566b4">step-by-step
 guide…</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why so complicated?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you face two software bugs. To workaround or to live with one bug, can be complicated already. You face two different bugs. Those were not intended. Therefore, the workarounds are complicated.</p>

<p>Hello Larissa Barkley,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’ve got a report that this is a known issue which is caused by the coding. Currently, this issue has been fixed by our related team, if it still not working on your side, please firstly contact your admin let him disable and then
 re-enable the My Templates add-in configuration. Then refresh Outlook Web App and restart Outlook desktop client. Waiting for some time and then check the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If above method still can’t fix it, could you please provide full version number for checking? You can find the version number via Outlook-&gt;File-&gt;Office account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

    <title>Sending a resume to a prospective employer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sending a resume to a prospective employer</h2>
                    I sent an e-mail to a prospective employer containing two attachments. One was my resume and the other was my drivers' abstract. At the bottom I put a follow-up note and sent it. The post master came back and indicated that the delivery of my e-mail failed
 because the follow-up note was deemed as a THIRD attachment and was labelled "PROHIBITED" and "UNSAFE". How do I "fix" this and enable the complete e-mail to be received in the exact form that I sent it ???

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: </p>
<p>1.&nbsp;In your statement&nbsp;"drivers' abstract" could you mention what was the file type of this attachment?</p>
<p>2. Did you try sending this file to any other account (if you have) to check if you could successfully send this file?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            I gave up and just did a system restore back to 11/12/2017. As of that date I still had build 17035, so wasn't sure if that was far back enough to be of any assistance. The system restore worked! I now have build 17040, which is the latest update. I think
 you were on the right track though with this last reply, since I haven't done anything major to my system lately, so it had to be some driver or app that I downloaded recently. Either way, I'm glad that my system is updated and I no longer have that statement
 saying "your Microsoft account requires attention before you can install any insider preview builds". Thanks for helping me brainstorm....much appreciated!

<h2>            IE-11 patch v&#58;1.2</h2>
                    <p>After Entering a CNN website, got this warning windows from IE Security (?) advising not to&nbsp;continue and to install a IE patch V:1.2, Build 11/06/2015. (?)</p>
<p>I am using W-7 64b and IE-11 v:11.0.9600.18059 updated 11.0.24.</p>
<p>I saved the patch but did not installed, it sounded fishi to me.</p>
<p>I had just completed a complete successful scan with the MS Safety Scanner which cleaned two problems.</p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>As instructed, I run sfc.exe /scannow (was OK), then MS &nbsp;Safety scanner fully.
</p>
<p>I found the following malwares: </p>
<p>SoftwareBuldler:Win32/Dowadmin.</p>
<p>TrojanDropper:Win32/Sventore. C</p>
<p>Trojan:JS/Kovter.A</p>
<p>They were removed.</p>
<p>A second run of the MS Safety scanner and a run with HouseCall failed to find anything else.</p>
<p>I have not seen the problem any more.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
