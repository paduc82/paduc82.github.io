<h2>            outlook 2013 properties&#47; permissions&#47; delete items does not let me delete a mailbox folder</h2>
                    When I go to a folder, in the permissions tab I have given owner permission level to both Default and my own 'name' . &nbsp;This means 'delete items' is ticked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked there is no other folder of that name, and ensured it's folder parent (the Deleted Items Folder) &nbsp;is also giving full permission.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to delete it, I get</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cannot delete this folder.. right click.. properties.....change permissions.... Outlook is synching local changes made to items in this folder. &nbsp;You cannot remove this folder till the synchronisation with the server is complete</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is an empty folder that has been stuck there for a week do I do not trust it is waiting for any synching and I'm lost. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>

<h2>            OneNote slow to import file printout of a PowerPoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering whether anyone else is having problems with OneNote. I am currently trying to insert a file printout of a PowerPoint presentation which is about 15 slides long. My laptop has a decent processor (i5) and is new so I can't see why it's taking
 so long. I've been trying to insert it for about 20 minutes now and it still hasn't finished and the progress bar is about 2mm from being complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Need help setting up default versions of Microsoft Office programs for document types</h2>
                    I recently bought Microsoft Office 2013 and want to still use Word 2003 as my default version of Word as I still like it better (as it isn't dumbed down.) I have tried everything.&nbsp; I have gone into control panel &gt; programs &gt; default programs and chosen
 Word (desktop),&nbsp; It doesn't give me the option of unchecking the check box for .doc or any others that are checked. I don't even see Word 2003 (and many other programs listed under the default programs)&nbsp; I have tried changing the default program from the file
 extension itself by going to control panel &gt; programs &gt; associate a file type.... but that hasn't worked either.&nbsp; I've also tried right clicking on a Word document and using Open With.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I go to Word 2003 location, Word 2013 still opens up.&nbsp; Its like
 Microsoft is forcing me to use Office 2013 as my default programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only other options are uninstall Word 2013 (I will have to look up how to do that too) or opening up Word 2003 every time and searching for the file I want to open.&nbsp; This is frustrating
 and for all I know this a Windows 8 problem. &nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. <br />

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am just learning Pivot tables and I have an excel worksheet with data. I created a table with headings and clicked on Pivot tables. I click on a cell. I than get the pivot table worksheet but it only has the Pivot table field list and only allows me to
 select any of the fields as rows because I don't have the bottom part that would allow me to drag to column labels as the BOOK shows.</p>
<p>In fact I can't find the column lables on the toolbar.....only the row labels.</p>
<p>Much of the data fields are hours and I want them as columns</p>
<p>ALL that I want to do is&nbsp;SHOW 1 line for the duplicate names and add up the&nbsp;hours in the duplicate names</p>

<h2>            Word &#38; Suggested words to insert</h2>
                    When working with a document in Word/Office as I write a rectangular box with two or three words appears just above the line as suggestions for me to use. I think I turned this feature on in Options, but now I want to shut it off but I can't find the location
 of the check box so that it won't show. Why does Microsoft have such a frustrating feature anyway? Most of the time the words are irrelevant.&nbsp; Can someone help me with this? I must shut that feature OFF.

<p>There is a default location for a pst, if in fact you are using a pop mail account, but a user could have located the pst on any valid location</p>
<p>Within OL, File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Email Tab............... for your mail account it will show the
<strong>Type </strong>and the location of the data file (All in the email tab)</p>
<p>Dont take any notice of what you have read, as unless you have been fiddling the permissions would have been created correctly when first set up.</p>
If you hold the Ctrl Key when starting OL to force safe mode does it then function without problem?

            The path under appdata is typically used for ost files, not pst files.  Outlook puts pst files under my documents.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Using accounts settings, I found out that all pst files are located on onedrive. All PST files have Full Access rights. 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />The cause of your problem is when outlook is idle for approx. 10 min, it releases the hold on the pst and onedrive sync takes over, triggering the error message. 
<br />
<br />To fix, move the pst files out of OneDrive - if you want a backup copy in OneDrive, copy a pst there.

<p>Thanks Diane, I will try moving PST files to local drive. How do I do that though? It needs 2 things to be done</p>
<p>1. change outlook save location to local drive</p>
<p>2. Move the existing PST file to that location</p>

            Close outlook. 
<br />Move the pst. 
<br />You can open outlook, it will whine that the file is gone and you select the new location - or you can open the mail profile and change it on the data files tab before opening outlook.  
<br />
<br />If you want to change it before opening open, press windows key + r to open the run command and type or paste the following command line in the open field and press enter.
<br />outlook.exe /manageprofiles
<br />Click data files, add the new location, remove the old one.

            <p>In all likelihood, the scam originated neither at AOL nor at Outook.com, but it would take seeing the Internet headers to determine that more fully. The From and To addresses you see on a message are, in fact, purely arbitrary strings that have nothing whatsoever
 to do with the message's source or destination. The delivery of email is handled at a higher level than what you see in the From and To fields. Those fields can be anything the spammer/scammer wants.</p>

            Just type for example 123 to computer and then the same passcode to phone, 123, it should work.<br />
Once you get it working, you can change the passcode to be more unique if you feel that is needed for extra security.<br />
If you like the computer and phone to connect more automatically everytime you put Bluetooth on in PC and phone, use the "set as authorised" option in phone when you connect the first time, it makes the usage easier.

            The Bluetooth passcode is only used when the devices are paired (to generate encryption/decryption keys for the communications). It is not stored/saved or used after any more after the pairing has been done.<br />
<br />
In that sense there's no point in changing it after you've successfully paired the devices.

            The phone does not have any preset/fixed Bluetooth passcodes. Peripheral devices like headsets or GPS units usually do (because such devices won't have any way to input any codes; no keypad, for example).

<h2>            How to recover my hacked outlook account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook account password was reset after my mobile account was compromised after identity theft. &nbsp;I have reset password etc and am now wondering what these people were capable of doing during the 6hrs that they had full access to my Outlook email ie to
 my contacts, friends/acquaintances email addresses, information contained in emails including mobile numbers and bank bsb acc details etc. &nbsp;Was it possible for these people to export / dump my entire email account somewhere to go through at their leisure extracting
 key information that would assist them steal someone else identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to warn friends about their exposure and want to understand it better. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Barrie
<br />
<br />This is an issue many Skype users are reporting at the moment, so you are not alone. It looks like its possibly regional or some server issues depending on where you are.
<br />
<br />I recommend you monitor your Skype Status - Skype Support
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/status/</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try deleting Skype then reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />I would also make sure you have enough credit in order to make the call.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:
<br />
<br />Go to the following link to get assisted live support:

                    <p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)">
so i was looking though some settings and i noticed there was this thing called family group with my mother's Microsoft account as a member, so i clicked "remove from family" and then i was spammed with a "sign in so you don't miss out" pop up for Microsoft
 family. i tried making it stop but i decided to sign in and see what i could do from there. but after i signed in, it just went away and didn't take me anywhere.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)">
<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 1)">
so the question is.. what the heck did i just do? am i off the family group now? did me hitting that sign in do anything? it just weirds me out that i'm in my 20s and i might still be on a parental monitoring thing with my mom. any help would be great.</p>

    <title>Deleting contacts with no email address from Outlook People - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonniebal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting contacts with no email address from Outlook People</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Hotmail for years. &nbsp;Now that it is Outlook, I find numerous people listed in my Hotmail contacts (I guess that's Outlook People) who I not only don't want or need in Hotmail, they also don't even have an email address included in the listing.
 &nbsp;I have tried all the various solutions suggested in these pages. &nbsp;I was able to delete a few (very few) of these unwanted/unneeded contacts. &nbsp;For the rest, I receive an error message: &nbsp;"The selected items can't be deleted from your contacts." &nbsp;Why not? &nbsp;They're
 MY contacts, and I don't want them in there. &nbsp;Maybe I do want them in my Skype list, because I have a phone number for them, but I don't have an email address for them, and I don't want to contact them that way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another infuriating problem. &nbsp;When I list two email addresses for a person (home and work) in People, only one will ever show up in the To: field. &nbsp;I've try clicking on the second address; nothing changes. &nbsp;I've tried entering a separate listing
 for the individual so I wind up with two listings, one for work and one for home, but even when I click on the work email address, the home email address pops up (or vice-versa). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so annoying that I have had to resort to the most bizarre work-around. &nbsp;I downloaded all my People contacts into Excel. &nbsp;I edited all the contacts, deleted the contacts that I can't get rid of in Outlook, and separated the individuals' work and &nbsp;home
 listings. &nbsp;Now, when I want to send a Hotmail message to a list of people, I don't use my Outlook People list at all; I go to my Excel list, and manually enter the correct email address for the people I want to include. &nbsp;This is a crazy way to have to work,
 and the temptation is to just "chuck" Hotmail and move everything to Google. &nbsp;I'd rather not have to do that. &nbsp;Can you help me clean up this Outlook mess? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hello Stephanie Sal,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I went to the link you suggested and tried it, although I had previously tried going to the same site without success. This time was exactly the same - I clicked on one of the names I want to delete, and the banner (don't know the proper name) across the
 top of the web page, which includes the option "Delete," disappears, and a different banner comes up - MINUS the Delete option. &nbsp;If I try to delete the name manually, using the Delete button on the keyboard, I get that same error message: "The selected items
 can't be deleted from your contacts."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Where do all these entries come from??? &nbsp;This morning there were 20 - TWENTY! - entries for a man I NEVER send an email to, and the entries didn't even include his email address. &nbsp;He is in my Skype list and that's OK, but I don't want him in my Hotmail
 contact (Outlook People) list. &nbsp;And I sure don't need that entry in there 20 times! &nbsp;Fortunately, in that case I was able to delete all 20 - but what a pain!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although my work-around using Excel meets my needs in terms of organization, it is a very time-consuming way to enter addresses into an email. &nbsp;I can't believe I am the only one with this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Would appreciate further help if anyone has any other ideas. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;Bonnie</p>

            Your hotmail account is linked to outlook. If you have contacts from your outlook it will automatically shows on your email account which is hotmail? How do you access your email, is it using outlook app or by using a browser and going to outlook.com?

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks, Greg. &nbsp;I do not use Outlook. &nbsp;I go directly to Hotmail from my browser (Google Chrome). &nbsp;And, to the best of my knowledge, I have no Outlook contacts - certainly, I have never consciously entered any contacts in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even so, that doesn't explain where 20 (twenty!) identical entries for the same person - someone I don't believe I have
<em>ever</em> sent an email to - cropped up in my Hotmail contacts (Outlook People) one morning. &nbsp;Those entries had the person's name, and one of those colored "bubbles" with the person's initials in it, and no other information. &nbsp;No phone number (so not from
 Skype), and no email address, and none of the other miscellaneous information such as "nickname" that I sometimes see fields for.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It's very discouraging. &nbsp;But thanks for trying.</p>

            I have received two replies. &nbsp;I tried the suggestions that were made, and neither one worked. &nbsp;In fact, I had previously tried the same things based on my reading of previous, similar comments in the Community discussion threads. &nbsp;The problem persists
 - I keep finding "new" copies of existing contacts without email addresses appearing in my Hotmail Contacts/Outlook People list. &nbsp;And when I try to delete them, in many cases I receive an error message:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;"The
 selected items can't be deleted from your contacts." &nbsp;I am continuing to use my own solution (which isn't very good, but better than using the Outlook People list) of referring to my own contact list in Excel and manually entering each name/email address.
 &nbsp;Eventually I'll find the time to switch the whole thing to Google and hope it works better, unless there's someone else out there who has a better idea.</span>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - Email filtering greyed out</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I noticed that I could no longer filter emails.<br />
<br />
Having done a Google search, I tried disabling and then re-enabling Windows Search.
<br />
<br />
I have now tried doing a repair on Office Professional Plus 2010, but the problem still persists.<br />
<br />
Windows Search Email Indexer is disabled in the Add-in section of Outlook.<br />
<br />
Both email accounts are POP.<br />
<br />
I know recently there were security updates for Office 2010 which were installed without issue; whether that has anything to do with this is unknown to me.<br />
<br />
I run Windows 8 Pro 64-bit.<br />

            <p>Hi Stevie,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Office and thank you for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you understand What Windows Search Email Indexer.
</p>
<p>This behavior is by design. Windows Desktop Search installs a MAPI Protocol Handler. This handler is responsible for indexing data in earlier versions of Outlook. Outlook 2010 now includes some of that
 indexing and search functionality in the program. Because the new functionality is built into Outlook 2010, the original Windows Search indexing components and addin are disabled in Outlook 2010, but not removed. This ensures that earlier Outlook versions
 can be indexed correctly if Outlook 2010 is uninstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on this add-in, refer to the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2385524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2385524</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, let us rebuild the indexing and check if search works for Outlook:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following link to change the advanced indexing option in Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-advanced-indexing-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-advanced-indexing-options</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To rebuild the indexing, refer to the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/reset-indexing-by-rebuilding-your-instant-search-catalog-HA010237832.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/reset-indexing-by-rebuilding-your-instant-search-catalog-HA010237832.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion is helpful. Reply for further assistance.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I've had very similar issues with Zune installation as Dan J 7 and have followed the same steps outlined by Entegy and I STILL get "Setup must stop because the required package 'Zune WMDU component' didn't install. &nbsp;Error code: 0x80070659"
<div><br />
<div>What is the deal with this Zune WMDU issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit: &nbsp;I figured it out! In the x64 folder of the extracted Zune setup files is a Packages folder. Inside that folder is a zunewmdu-64 Windows Installer Package. &nbsp;I ran that, then deleted my temp files again, and re-ran the zunesetup.exe in the x64 folder
 of the extracted files. &nbsp;Install successful! &nbsp;Weeeeeeee!</div>

    <title>Internet graphics slow to load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrian browne2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet graphics slow to load</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 64bit Professional on an Intel Core i5 750 with 4 Gbytes of RAM and use&nbsp;Norton Internet Security 2011. On some web pages that use significant amounts of gif files these files are extremely slow to load and sometimes require the use
 of page refresh before loading and displaying properly (sometimes only the red X shows). Sometimes on refreshing the page the font and page layout change completely.</p>
<p>The problem is that:-</p>
<p>1. It doesn't seem to affect all web sites.</p>
<p>2. It affects both the 32bit and 64bit versions of IE8 and affects Firefox.</p>
<p>I have tried turning off Norton, both the antivirus and the firewall with no apparent affect. Internet speed seems not to be a problem as I have pinged one of the sites that causes most of the problems with an average return time of 19ms. This site is one
 I use a lot and the lengthy delays waiting while .gif&nbsp; graphics objects download is driving me up the wall.</p>
<p>The only other thing that I can add is that I first noticed this problem after my internet speed was upgraded when I was running XP home on my old 2.6G pentium 4 machine. I never did manage to resolve it and despite a clean install of Windows 7 on my new
 machine the problem seems to have followed on.</p>
<p>The machine has been scanned for viruses, spyware etc and is clean.</p>
<p>Some help would be much appreciated</p>
<p>Regards Adrian</p>

<h2>            When open a Word document, it isn&#39;t blank, it has saved a document</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When open a Word document, it isn't blank, it has saved a document. I guess I hit the wrong key. How can I go back to a blank, when I try it keeps on saying save this as Doc1, instead of "normal".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your help.</p>
