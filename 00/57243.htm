    <title>How do I know what my XBOX Parent Account is&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I know what my XBOX Parent Account is&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have linked a XBOX parent account with my so called 'child' account back in the days, and now I forgot what email my parent account is. There is no way to see this anywhere on PC or the web or something. The only way to see this is with a Xbox, which I
 don't have. Please Microsoft, is there any way of showing me the parent account. By the way, I'm 18+ but caused by some stupidity I had to set my parent account anyway.</p>
<p>I will be very pleased if you could sent me the account, because I want to keep my old e-mail address, and don't want to create a new one only for xbox.</p>
<p>Since windows 8 fully includes XBOX services, why do you guys made it so hard to know what my parent account is? I have already contacted customer support, the only thing he could say me that he can't see it either, and that he also have asked Microsoft
 multiple times to make it visible, since there are 10 people calling him every day about this complaint.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In hope of a good answer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luuk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I'm also planning to buy a windows phone, and I have recently bought windows 8, and I had windows 7 and I had never have anything else but windows, so please help this good customer!)</p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div>I'm 18 almost 19 and want my parents account off my account, but the option for them to remove me from their control isn't showing on the xbox. So they deleted their account. Will this take the parental control off since that account no longer exists?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>I'm having the same problem as LuukB, except I don't know whether or not an adult account is connected to my Xbox One. I'm almost sure my Microsoft and Xbox One accounts are over 18, but Ii still can't change my own setting for Online &amp; Privacy settings
 or Restrictions. I can change some of the settings, but the setting I would like to change the most is the one about what content I can but. When I opened Account in settings and choose Online &amp; Privacy settings, It wouldn't let me change the majority of the
 settings, and as I've said above, I'm almost sure I don't have a parent account and that my own account is over 18.</p>

<p>log into this :&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account?refd=login.live.com&amp;destrt=home-index</p>
<p>with your "child account" and then click on "Family" it should show the parent email/account and you should be able to remove yourself due to being over 18 and this will fix the problem!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wifi Smart Plugs and other Alexa and Google Home type automation outlets and home control gizmos</h2>
                    <p>So I bought these for the holidays and love them.&nbsp; My greatest challenge is understanding how Windows 10 or even Windows 8.1/7 have no ability to turn the lights on and off without loading some contrived MEmu type emulator (or NOX etc) and loading the Tuya
 Smart Life app and only then can I use Windows desktops or laptops to turn things on and off like I can with any nine dollar old android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is when does Microsoft plan to allow people to use their windows computers to access some sort of windows API's to access these things more safely and efficiently or does Microsoft instead plan to throw out the baby with the bathwater simply
 because Google and Amazon are getting out in front on this initiative and so we want to SPITE all of our loyal Windows desktop users just because we can?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why exactly are apps like Tuya SmartLife not available on the Microsoft Play App store?&nbsp; Why is it when I get an app like the Amazon Alexa app it doesn't work right on Windows 10?</p>

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to find an app from the Microsoft Store, it could be that the app isn't available in your country or region, or that the app is no longer available in the Store. For more information about unable to find an app from the Microsoft Store,
 kindly see <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13765/microsoft-store-cant-find-or-install-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I can't find or install an app from Microsoft Store</a></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your question about an app that is not working in Windows 10, it might be due to compatibility issues between the app and Windows 10. May we know if you have checked with the software developer's website if the app is compatible with Windows 10?
 Or, if there is a specific version of the app that is compatible with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>My point however is that Microsoft used to be the company that encouraged innovation and built developer platforms and this seems like a huge potential wasted that developers with development desktops and servers cannot work on building solutions which include
 these new devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember when Microsoft would always be first with new tech directions and the whole VB.NET and C# and each new "tech thing" like web development would always have a series of great web development platforms from the very early Frontpage stuff to the later
 Web platform Expression stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is Microsoft actually planning to sit out this whole automation advance without any involvement whatsoever?&nbsp; Have we really allowed all of the bureaucrats to run the innovation wing of Microsoft and how long can the company survive with these worthless
 bureaucrats calling all the shots and hiring all the look alike yes-men?</p>

There is a version of Windows 10 that is specially made for automation using Internet of Things. It is called

Since home automation using Internet of Things is a fairly new technology for the consumer market. Just like other technologies, full adaptability and compatibility depends on consumer demand, developer support, hardware cost, and other factors that could be

In terms of new technology support and feature development for Windows, we have a program called the
 to give feedback for the next version of Windows operating systems. Feel free to be part of the program should you choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding compatibility between Windows 10 and other third-party devices, or applications, other than contacting the developer or manufacturer, you may also utilize the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> app. This is one way for users to give feedback to the Windows development team. In some cases, Microsoft will collaborate with the OEM's or software developers to make their products work perfectly in Windows.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth device shows in &#34;Devices and Printers&#34;, is not working and I cannot remove it.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Mike.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 laptop with Windows 10. It is absolutely up to date with all Windows updates, as of today anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bluetooth earpiece that has been working fine for about a month now, but now it is not functioning. Device Manager shows me that my Qualcomm QCA61x4A has been shut down by Windows with a Code 43.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bluetooth icon does not appear in Action Center. When I go into "Settings/Bluetooth and other devices", it shows my earpiece but is grayed out and says Bluetooth is turned off. Without the Action Center icon, I cannot turn it on OR off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, in "Devices and Printers", I can see my earpiece and it indicates it is paired, but when I right-click and select&nbsp; Remove device, it tells me the remove has failed and returns to a state of being paired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, I have uninstalled the driver for bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Services I have stopped and/or disabled 3 different bluetooth services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still cannot remove the earpiece in "Devices and Printers".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts, anyone?</p>

<p>Thanks, Angel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all those avenues without any change or success.</p>
<p>I went to the Dell support site and had them diagnose all my systems and nothing comes up.</p>
<p>I am beginning to think there is something about the bluetooth device itself that is causing this.</p>
<p>Even though I have disabled all Bluetooth services and uninstalled the bluetooth driver in Device Manager, when I go to Devices and Printer and right-click on the device (an earbud) and select Remove Device, it attempts to do so, then reports that it failed
 to remove it, and it returns to a status of being paired.</p>
<p>Something is broken and I need a way to uninstall this device.</p>
<p>

<h2>            White Noises&#58; Speakers, Headphones, and Earphones</h2>
                    <p>It started when I was using Skype. I was using my earphone microphone which works in my phone. When my friend (who I was calling) said that she can't hear anything, I tried to fix it. I was fumbling around with the 1.3 mm jack connected to my laptop. And
 if I push it in or turn it, it produces white noise. The microphone levels only move using this "technique". After that, the white noise doesn't go away whether I unplug or plug in my earphones.&nbsp;I also borrowed another friend's headphones to make sure but
 the same thing occurs. I tried to use my headphones and earphones on my phone and it works well there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrated, I turned to the internet for some answers. One site said that rather than the built-in microphone being the default recording device, I should choose the plugged in device to be default recording device. Another one said that I should simply
 right click to show disabled device which, obviously, didn't work. The next site's suggestion was expensive saying that I should change my sound driver. The thread was awfully technical so I gave up on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to the control panel to disable my microphone and the other device which actually existed in my laptop. White noise is gone. But how the hell am I going to use my microphone now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what technical information or screenshots I should post with this so if it is any help, please tell me and I will do my best to post it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p><br />
I had exactly the same problem when I loaded KB2454826 to my Dell, Win 7, PC, on Friday 18th February. I had a bad experience with Windows Update in Vista times so I now always load one update at a time. After the update Windows Explorer failed as described
 above. I could double click on the left hand panel, but not the right. 'Explore' on the right click menu&nbsp;did not work on either panel, but 'Open' still worked normally. Thus Widows exploreer could still be used, but not as designed.</p>
<p>Removing the update was successful, but the fault remained in Win Explorer. Running system restore to the point immediately before I loaded KB2454826 restored full functionality in Win Explorer.</p>
<p>I repeated the install, had the same problem, and again successfully removed it.</p>
<p>I finally 'hid' the update in Win Update and thought that was an end to it, but now I've discovered I cannot install Win7 SP1 until KB2454826 is present.</p>
<p>Please advise me.</p>

<p>@qz2026, @cath888 &amp; @Grahaamm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft had issued a "revised" KB2454826 update (aka. V2) to correct the problems caused by the "original" KB2454826 patch AND the stop error problems were documented in<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2498368" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS KB article 2498368</a>. &nbsp;Download
 the revised patches at the following sites:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=ddafd2cb-022c-4235-a644-426ae6b6d36f&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB2454826 update for Windows 7 32bit/x86 systems</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Microsoft should already be offering the "revised" KB2454826 patches through Microsoft Update &amp; Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure to un-install the "original" V1&nbsp;KB2454826 patch first and then install the "revised" V2&nbsp;KB2454826 patch.</p>

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So i was trying to create a recovery drive on my SSd card, because my 2 usb 's are used for a mouse and&nbsp; history file.&nbsp; Turning on my history file it had a message saying&nbsp; "You're not to have a system file on a removable drive."&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I went into disk management&nbsp; I seen my ssd card has primary , healthy and has active next to it..&nbsp; like this:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 0 =&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;EFI&nbsp; Healthy -100 MB&nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Local&nbsp; (C: )&nbsp; &nbsp;25.24 GB NTFS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Boot&nbsp; , wim Boot, crash dump, primary partition )&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; New Volume&nbsp; (E: )&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.57&nbsp; GB NTFS&nbsp; &nbsp;Primary Partition&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / Recovery 1000 MB&nbsp; &nbsp; Healthy&nbsp; ( OEM&nbsp; partition......&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1 =&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FAT 32&nbsp; (7.42 GB)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Healthy&nbsp; ( Primary Partition&nbsp; Active)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 2-&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FAT 32&nbsp; &nbsp;(14.72 GB)&nbsp; USB DISK&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Healthy ( Primary Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this is at all correct.. I don't know how to make DISK 0 active again&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp; think that is the one that should be active. The instructions were to make the SSD card act and be recognized as a USB device.. I lost 2 computers even after making
 a recovery disk, apparently i still don't know how.. Can you help and tell me how make&nbsp; Active the Drive that should be ACTIVE...&nbsp; &nbsp;Cannot tell you how much I appreciate for all your time &amp; patience,,,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Kathi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm glad you asked.  Disk0 is the modern UEFI install to a GPT formatted disk that doesn't use Active flags (which point to the System partition on an MBR Legacy drive).  
<br />
<br />When you install to UEFI you must boot the media as a UEFI device.  
<br />
<br />I'm not sure what history file you're referring to, but if you want to create bootable media or a Recovery Drive, the drive must be wiped completely and reformatted by the creation tool to make to bootable for UEFI or Legacy install.  
<br />
<br />Are you referring to an SD card that is one of the two FAT32 removable drives you show there?  It is possible to format an SD card as bootable media.  More here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/#change-boot-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Morning Greg,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am sorry i didn't explain that right...I did try the Media tool&nbsp; in the Windows download page&nbsp; but said my computer was incompatable&nbsp; so i went to microsoft ask how to guide and followed them.&nbsp; &nbsp;But yes my SSd card I formatted to act
 like a usb drive for a recovery&nbsp; is DISK 1 and is the active partition. on my ssd card&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I thought the active partition should be Disk 0 with the&nbsp; &nbsp;EFI,&nbsp; &nbsp;local disk C:/&nbsp; -- the E:/&nbsp; the new volume ---&nbsp; the recovery drive which are all on DISK 0 . I really
 want it back to normal,&nbsp; Is there a way i can make the Disk 0 active again. I cannot&nbsp; try another " how to" i can't ask questions if i don't understand...Will a reset the whole thing make the DISK 0 active again? how can I make Disk 0 the active partition.
 ?&nbsp; Thanks so much and boy you're working late!&nbsp;

            Greg,&nbsp; I should explain what i was doing ...I wanted to create a system image so if my computer didn't start I could put the ssd icard n and boot into windows to reset or recovery from a system point.&nbsp; The history file is supposed run to back up files.&nbsp;
 Thats where create a system image is. I was suppose to put the system image on a usb or disk then copy to ssd card.&nbsp;&nbsp; To do that i had to format the ssd card to be recognized as a usb recovery drive.&nbsp; The problem was after i formatted and successfully&nbsp; made
 he SSd card a recognized usb I didn't have enough room to download the system image in the microsoft download file. I was suppose to put the system image on a usb or disk then copy to ssd card.&nbsp; I just bought more usb drives&nbsp; to put the system image on to
 complete the task. But i seen the ssd is the active partition and didn't want to do anything else until i talked to someone. I downloaded the instructions and it doesn't say what to do after i fin

</p><p>how to create partiton COMMENTS<br />
If you‚Äôre working with a netbook or a tablet computer, you likely won‚Äôt have an included DVD-ROM drive.&nbsp; Normally this is fantastic! It makes your overall device lighter, and less expensive.&nbsp; But, if you need to install or reformat Windows, then you run into
 some problems rather quickly.&nbsp; No DVD-drive means you can‚Äôt just burn a copy of Windows and throw it in there.&nbsp; Fortunately, most netbooks have an SD Card slot, and ALL of them support USB Pen Drives.&nbsp; Let‚Äôs use that to our advantage and get Windows running!</p>
<div>What you need to do this:<br />
A minimum of an 8GB* removable storage disk.&nbsp; This storage can be an SD card or a USB Flash Drive.<br />
A computer that is already running Windows.<br />
A Windows 7, Vista, or XP installation disk, or .iso file equivalent.<br />
Although you only need 8GB, just grab a 32GB or 64GB from Amazon. As of 2017, it‚Äôs probably more expensive to buy a smaller drive vs. a 64GB or larger. Also, don‚Äôt forget to verify the motherboard you‚Äôre installing Windows on supports booting from a USB / removable
 storage drive. This is fairly common now but if you‚Äôre trying to install Windows on an older machine, something to think about if you run into issues.
<div>Got all that? Way to go! Let‚Äôs get started.</div>
<div>Step 1<br />
Alright, so you have your SD Card or a USB Pen Drive (some people call either of these flash drives.)&nbsp; Keep in mind that if you go the SD Card route, make sure your computer has an SD Card reader. Good news, they are cheap on Amazon so not a big deal if you
 need to order one real quickly.</div>
<div>Once you have procured yourself one of these, plug it into your computer.&nbsp; If you have anything valuable saved on your portable storage, backup any data you have saved on your SD/USB before we get started.&nbsp; In the steps that follow we‚Äôll be formatting
 and completely cleaning it out in the process of turning it into a windows boot disk.</div>
<div>*Oh, before I forget, a great thing about USB Flash Drives, I suppose a 3GB drive would work, but as far as I know, that is a very unusual size.&nbsp; And besides, once you are done installing you can use the 4GB drive for ReadyBoost to improve your system
 performance.</div>
<div>install windows 7 from SD card or usb<br />
Step 2<br />
Go to the Start menu and Type cmd in the search box to open up the command prompt.</div>
<div>start menu launch cmd</div>
<div>In this tutorial we‚Äôll run into a lot of command-line, so to keep it easy I‚Äôll just list the command for each step. You‚Äôll need to Press Enter after each command is typed out.</div>
<div>First, we need to open diskpart, which is a cmd-line program built-in to Windows.</div>
<div>Type: Diskpart<br />
launch diskpart<br />
Step 3<br />
A new window should appear with the system32\diskpart.exe in the title bar.</div>
<div>Type: list disk<br />
Some disks should appear in a small matrix (chart.)&nbsp; Look for the one that matches the size of your SD Card/USB drive.&nbsp; It might not be an exact match since actual usable disk space is about 5% less than what is advertised.&nbsp; For the next command, you need to
 enter the number that corresponds to that drive.</div>
<div>Type: select disk 2<br />
find your sd flash drive<br />
Step 4<br />
Now that the disk is selected, we can start cleaning it up and getting it ready.&nbsp;&nbsp; These commands should be the same for everyone, so just enter them one after the other.</div>
<div>Type: clean<br />
Type: create partition primary<br />
Type: select partition 1<br />
Type: active<br />
Type: format fs=fat32<br />
clean and create partition<br />
format partition<br />
Step 5<br />
Formatting will take a couple of minutes, so now is a good time to grab a snack. ;)</div>
<div>Once it is done, we‚Äôll assign a drive letter to your newly formatted removable storage disk.*</div>
<div>Type: assign letter=y<br />
Type: exit<br />
*You don‚Äôt have to use the letter ‚Äúy‚Äù but since that is likely not taken we‚Äôll use it for this tutorial to keep things simple.</div>
<div>assign new drive letter<br />
Step 6<br />
If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD, insert it into your DVD drive.&nbsp; If instead, you have an installation .ISO, then mount it on your computer using a Virtual disk drive.</div>
<div>windows 7 installation disc or iso<br />
Once your disk is inserted, Click the Start Menu and then Click Computer.&nbsp; A window should pop-up listing all of your hard drives and removable storage.&nbsp; Look for your DVD drive and take a note of what letter is assigned to it. If you are using a virtual drive,
 it might be called the BD-ROM drive instead of DVD. In my case, the DVD drive is assigned the letter ‚Äúe,‚Äù so that is what I‚Äôll be using in the next step.</div>
<div>my computer find dvd drive letter</div>
<div>Step 7<br />
Now, all we have to do is copy the files from the installation disk to the sd card.&nbsp; In the example below, e:\ is my DVD drive and y:\ is my SD card.</div>
<div>Type: xcopy e:\* y:\ /s /e /f<br />
This process might take a while since you are transferring a little over 2GB worth of files.</div>
<div>xcopy from dvd drive to sd card<br />
Done!<br />
After the files ultimately transfer, you are done!&nbsp; You now have yourself a Windows installation portable drive.</div>
<div>Now for the computer that you want to install Windows on using this, all you need to do is restart the computer and spam-press the F2 key while it is booting up; or whatever the setup key is, but F2 is the standard for many systems.&nbsp; Pushing the F2 key
 should load up the system Bios. Here you have to go into the Boot Device Priority section and change the USB/SD card to #1 on the priority list.&nbsp; Once this is set, your computer should treat your SD/USB just like a Windows 7 Installation DVD.</div>
<div>set computer to boot from usb drive </div>

            Kathi, as I explained DISK0 uses the modern UEFI replacement for BIOS which formats the disk GPT and uses NO Active flags at all because they do not exist in GPT disks or UEFI.  So I'm not sure why you are asking again to change DISK0 to Active because it cannot and should not be.
<br />
<br />As to why the bootable SSD card is made active, it is because it is formatted FAT32 which uses Active flags to point to the bootable partition.  
<br />
<br />I don't see anything wrong with your settings.  Are you having performance problems?  
<br />
<br />Is the card bootable to the Repair Mode?  If not I would use an 8gb USB flash stick to create the bootable installation media from Media Creation Tool here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  This has the tools for bootable repair as well as the installation media in case you need to reinstall.
<br />
<br />For best backup I would use an External hard drive to back up a System Image backup using a flexible free app like Macrium:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>.  Then make the bootable Macrium media to use to boot to restore the image if needed.  
<br />
<br />I would also sort your files into their User folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, etc) and copy them to the external drive periodically for backup, as well as store them in the cloud using OneDrive for up to 5gb free or Google Drive backup (which lets you choose which folders to sync to the cloud) for 15 gb free.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Hi Kathi , thank you for the screenshot . . .
<br />
<br />May I ask what trouble you are actually having with Windows, everything in that screenshot looks normal.
<br />
<br />When you say you are trying to make a recovery drive . . . etc., please explain that, are you trying to create installation media for Windows 10?

<p>i want to thank you for your time and thoughts about this dilemna i thought i was in. As long as everything looks ok in my settings i am happy. All i really wanted do do with my computer is for personal use. I just wanted to go on facebook and play games.
 I have went thru all these problems everytime i update and decided it as time to try to make and a bootable backup. I can not count how many times after updating i had to do a DISM.exe to correct the updates.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do yo know that microsoft calls me to let me
 know my services in my admin file are not right . I should have all the services enabled. When i do that i get hacked. i cannot afford another computer. i bought a computer exactly like this one. It is sitting in a corner and won't start because the refurbisher
 installed a corrupt copy of window 10 . The Dism. and Swf were not enough o fix and now will not recognize my keyboard. The ssd slot is in the tablet part and thought if i made a ssd recovery drive it would fix the computer and i could give it as a xmas gift.
 I cannot believe no one has opened a class action lawsuit against them, it seems to me they do it just so their sales go up . Not everyone is a computer whiz and can fix so they capitalize on the ignorance and know another sale of a computer is eminiment .</p>
<p>Thanx for your ear and time again.. Wishing someone would do something to make Microsoft watch their updates and fix any corrupt files they are allowing people to download. exampe: 'The update to windows 10 took away my&nbsp; ACPI battery setting. There is only
 a/c&nbsp; power battery in my device manager" who can fix that but an engineer. Microsoft wants money to even listen .</p>

<p>Windows 7 all MS updates through 3/16</p>

</p><p>On 3/16 I performed a Windows Update.&nbsp; Last WinUpdate prior to that was 2/21, then 2/20.&nbsp; Since then I have lost my ability to use the on-board wireless connections.&nbsp; Tried Fn+F2 several times; tried the Windows wireless resolution manager; tried shutdown/restart;
 each situation with no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7 Device Manager doesn't show any warnings or yellow triangles.&nbsp; I can use an external USB AirLink 101 adapter and it works fine and the system finds the locally available networks.&nbsp; I am on this as I type!&nbsp; No VMs running.&nbsp; Wired connection works fine
 also.&nbsp; Just the on-board wireless that doesn't, afaik.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas for what to do without doing a system restore?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the update/response!</p>
<p>I ran the Method 1 diagnostics and trouble shooting and received the same "error-less" message.&nbsp; That is, the results were A) "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem" (Internet connection test) and B) "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem"
 (Network adapter test for all adapters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message&nbsp;I received when I can't access the Internet is the standard "Server not found.&nbsp; Firefox cannot find the server at ....".&nbsp; Google Chrome yields "Unable to connect to the Internet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 appears to be setup related which is not the area of my focus since things worked for months beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last MS updates installed (right before the loss of connection issue) were:</p>

<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

==========================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to<br />
see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card
<br />
or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : (Set VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft&nbsp;drivers<br />
- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Will there be any more FORCED updates in the future&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This will be the last update i endure from any IM service. Tired of being forced to update from something that works perfectly fine to something that's unfamiliar, bug prone, and honestly, more of an irritation than anything. AIM, MSN, raidcall, teamspeak,
 ventrillo, skype, discord... nobody wants to keep updating and moving to new IM's. It's like picking a new toilet every time you want to take a ****.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messaging, image, video, voice, groups, contacts, file sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop over complicating things, we're fine using the tool how its meant to be used, without the additional junk you keep pushing in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next update will be the uninstall.exe patch for me.</p>

                    <p>Everytime&nbsp; that I have tried to download and install the ''Free Windows 10 Upgrade" it has sat for over 12 hours and it then</p>
<p>freezes at 99% downloaded/installed and goes no further....&nbsp; I have this sitting on the computer right now....&nbsp; why???</p>
<p>and now the ''free period'' has ended.&nbsp; I guess I'll leave this computer at Win 7 Home.&nbsp; I do have another computer that came
</p>
<p>with Win 10...and a new Apple iMac...&nbsp; the support from Microsoft is so poor - but I would like to know what I could have done</p>

<h3> stellakotsampasi  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t connect to an advantage database server as usual</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I've paid for the application 'Insurance Works SQL' -BLUEBYTE Software- and for the last week I've been trying to double click the icon on the desktop so that I can work, but nothing happens. The message is ' Error 6420: the 'discovery' process for the
 Advantage Database Server failed. Unable to connect to the Advantage Database Server. axServer Connect'.</p>
<p>I've no longer technical support from the company, and I&nbsp; refuse to pay the unreasonable amount they ask for, because this is their problem which I met several times in the past, one of which I called them ( when I still had technical support ) and in 2
 minutes they fixed the problem. They said to me to click an icon( like the control panel, I don't exactly remember which one) and change a setting. Now the only thing they told me is that because my pc is a laptop and&nbsp;I remove it all the time, when I change
 environment some router settings need to be reset. All the other times I have had the same problem, it was finally fixed when I restarted my computer. Only the time I called them and this time I can't access to the database. I can't access a program I've paid
 for a huge amount ( no need to mention the time I lost, each time I had this problem, because my customers aren't obligated to loose their time too waiting for me to access the database).</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix it?</p>

            Hi Uroborus, this is caused by your Ralink 802.11 Wireless Adapter Driver
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Network Adapters section 
<br />Right click your Ralink 802.11 Wireless Adapter Driver and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, right click the device and choose Uninstall 
<br />Confirm deletion of the driver files 
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC . . .
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, go to the Railink website and download the latest driver

            Hello,
<br />Just in case to check if anything other is misbehaving.
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            I will submit at least two dump files in the case it does crash a few more time to see if there is a trend since I took the advise of the other person who responded earlier so just make sure if I do respond that it notifies you so you can help as soon
 as you can.&nbsp;

            Hello, it's been a while but I finally fixed my issue. All I had to do was just create a local account at settings and log in to new one and everything just started to work flawlessly. Thank you so much your support, I'm very sure you saved me from a lot
 of trouble like reinstalling Windows and that sort of thing.

    <title>Windows taking too long to boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivanfernandes94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows taking too long to boot</h2>
                    <p>This issue is happening for me for a while now, searched several sources, tried multiple solutions and no success so far.<br />
<br />
My Windows is taking a long time to boot, over 2 minutes. I have 2 computers here at home, the one that has this issue uses an
<span>NVMe&nbsp;</span>SSD from Samsung (Evo 960) while my other computer has an old Seagate HDD (over 5 years old). The old one boots in 1/10 of the speed of the newer one.</p>
<span>NVMe&nbsp;</span>SSD from Samsung (Evo 960) while my other computer has an old Seagate HDD (over 5 years old). The old one boots in 1/10 of the speed of the newer one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>- ASUS prime z270-a</p>
<p>- i7 7700k</p>
<p>-Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3000MHz </p>
<p>- ASUS GTX 1080 ti&nbsp;</p>
<p>- 2x corsair vengance 8gb ddr4 3000mhz ram</p>
<p>- Samsung 960 EVO Series - 500GB NVMe - M.2 Internal SSD (primary drive)</p>
<p>- Seagate 2TB BarraCuda SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5-Inch Internal Hard Drive (data drive)</p>
<p>- EVGA SuperNOVA 650 G3, 80 Plus Gold 650W</p>
<p>
</p><p>It takes long specifically in the windows loading screen, after the motherboard splash screen. After the boot moves from that screen everything is fast again. I can log in&nbsp;and start using any program in no time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The slow boot doesn't always happen. Sometimes the PC boots blazing fast, like the largest portion of time is spent on the Motherboard splashscreen, just like the way it used to do when I bought it. I couldn't find a pattern on why it happened, but I think
 is related to fast boot, because I never got these really fast boot times while rebooting the machine, only by shutting&nbsp;it down and booting back up (if I'm which is the only time the fast boot can work if I'm not mistaken). So my guess is that sometimes the
 windows fast boot "works" and the computer boots blazing fast and some other times it doesn't. Nonetheless,&nbsp;even without fast boot, the boot time I'm having makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried every solution out there. Trying to boot with nonessential services and programs disabled, trying to enable or disable fast boot, tried even to use Windows Performance Analyzer, but while it does show 17s on winlogon&nbsp;phase and 24 in postboot&nbsp;phase,
 which I believe are significant, it doesn't reflect my actual over 2 minutes boot time I'm getting, and also I couldn't pinpoint an issue besides the long boot phases. CPU and storage usage varies a lot along both boot&nbsp;phases, no relevant peak or valley in
 any of those graphs as far as I could tell. I even looked at a bunch of events that happened during those boot&nbsp;phases and even tried to uninstall some programs that caused some of those events (that aren't related to windows services) with no success.<br />
<br />
The only thing I haven't tried yet is formatting the pc, which I really really want to avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing that may or may not&nbsp;be related. I noticed that during the windows loading screen my mouse and keyboard act as if they were turned off. The keyboard and mouse light up during the mobo splash screen that turns off during the windows loading
 screen and when the loading screen is about to end both turns on again. I thought it was interesting because is just before the login screen shows up, it's actually the signal I use to know that the computer is done loading. When the computer successfully
 fast boots, they never turn off.</p>

            Hi Ivan
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors.

<br />
<br />If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.

I had tried to reset my BIOS already with no success. I'll try the other suggestions you mentioned and see what happens.

<p>1) The problem that you are reporting is intermittent so that may make it harder to find the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When the computer was in clean boot how did the boot times change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Did the intermittent slow boots occur when in clean boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Had you yet performed an in place upgrade repair (keeps files, drivers, applications, and resets some customized Windows settings)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Which antivirus )always on and manual) or non-Windows firewall software is in use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Open administrative command prompt and type or copy and paste:<br />
7) sfc /scannow<br />
8) dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />

<p>Thank you for your followup.<br />
<br />
The clean boot didn't alter my boot time, at least not significantly, it still took over 2 minutes to boot. I can't say for sure if the problem was still intermittent&nbsp;during the clean boot because I only performed restarts, and the boot is always slow on restarts
 (hence my theory of the fast boot happening being related to the windows fast boot "working" some time).</p>

<h2>            Keyboard Shortcuts stopped working on MS Surface Pro 3 Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>
</p><p>My most frequently used keyboard shortcuts [e.g. ctrl end and ctrl home] have stopped working on my MS keyboard for MS Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously could be a hardware or software issue. Any suggestions on testing or resolution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I want to know if I can buy a skype number for verify a craigslist ad?. I'm outside the usa but I want to promote some products on craigslist but living outside the usa it is impossible to publish an ad and bypass the phone verification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the answer to my question is positive, how many ads can be posted on craigslist with one single skype number?. I ask this here because craigslist don't answer nothing related with this kind of questions.</p>

<p><span>Hello PJAGAG,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>A</strong>
<strong>Skype Number can only be used for inbound calls</strong>. It is not built for outgoing calls.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With this being said, Skype Numbers cannot be used for phone verification in Craigslist.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
<span>Hi Yogesh Thakur,</span></p>
<p>
<span>What is the model number and the make of your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to install Nokia PC suite and check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are several things to try:</span></p>
<p>
<span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;
</span>Remove and then reinstall the device:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click Hardware and Sound, and then click Bluetooth Devices.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Select the device that's not working, and then click Remove.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click Add, press the reset button on the device (or make it discoverable following the manufacturer's instructions), select the My device is set up and ready to be found check box, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the device is not found, repeat the previous step. When the device is found, select it, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure the device is turned on and that the batteries don't need to be replaced.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure the Bluetooth adapter for your computer is attached and turned on, and that the device is turned on and discoverable. If you're not sure how to turn on discoverability, read the instructions that came with the device or check the manufacturer's
 website.</span></p>
<p>
<span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Make sure that you installed the device using the correct program. If not, reinstall the device.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer the following links for more information:</span></p>
