<p>Thank you for your help. The printer&nbsp;is installed with&nbsp;the most recent drivers. At first I thought the printer was the problem until I saved&nbsp;the document&nbsp;in an XPS viewer format. It saved just the way it prints from the regular word format, with the graphics
 on both sides but the text is missing&nbsp;from the right side of the page. That was a small document so I redo it using the full size word spreadsheet; using text boxes instead. That prints fine. I have a much larger booklet document to print. I will try your
 suggestion to save as PDF file and see how that works. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much like, though if I could print from the booklet word document as I created the file. Therefore I am open to other suggestions.</p>

            The booklet printing ability of Adobe Reader is pretty foolproof and it is the way that I would go.&nbsp; I would be wary of the use of TextBoxes.&nbsp; Quite often when users have issues with documents and a I get them to send the document to me so that I can investigate
 the problem, it is the unnecessary use of TextBoxes that were the cause of the problem and using other methods of formatting, it was possible to achieve the desired layout without the issue arising.

Thanks again for the interest and more so the warning about the use of text boxes. I am familiar with the use of text boxes and their issues. For example sometimes some of what&nbsp;is typed is nowhere to be found on the document but hidden under the border of the
 text box. This document I spoke of though, is a single split page document. More so a flyer that I design for myself. So it is not critical. As soon as I am ready to print the larger document I'll be sure to try your suggestion. I will let you know of the
 outcome. Thanks again.

<p>I have saved one of my documents as a pdf file as you suggested and use the booklet printing facility in adobe reader. That will work will for small files, but not with very large files. In Word I opt large&nbsp;files to be saved &nbsp;saves combination of small booklets
 as I specify and print them as such. These&nbsp;booklets are easily bind in book form. Adobe Reader prints everything as one big book. I will have to cut these pages to bind them.

            <p>Thanks very much for your suggestion. The HP printer I use is a new one with the most recent software. That does not work. It seem to be an issue with the word program. Siince the assistance I got could not resolve the issue, I had converted the document
 from then to PDF and hadsincet been priting using that format.</p>

<h2>            Do you have to have &#34;tbl&#34;, &#34;frm&#34;, &#34;qry&#34; etc in front of the name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I went to a class recently for Access 2007/2010. The instructor had us save all our tables as tblNameofTable or tblName_of_Table. The instructor stated this format is necessary to create macros. We also did this on Forms - frm, Queries - qry, etc..</p>
<p>When looking at other databases (including one that was used during the training class) I don't see the field_names or table_names displayed like this or with the tbl_Name displayed like this with in the navigation pane.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this format required for the database to work? If yes, then why don't other databases have their information displayed this way?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any information offered. </p>

            <p>It is not required, it is merely a convention. Databases can work fine with or without the convention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does have advantages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you cannot have a table and a query with the same name in a database. So for example if you have a table named Customers, you cannot create a query named Customers.</p>
<p>If you use tblCustomers and qryCustomers, no conflict arises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use prefixes for the names of controls (text boxes, labels, command buttons etc.) on forms and reports, for example</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>txtLastName</p>
<p>lblLastName</p>
<p>cmdClose</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In VBA code, using prefixes such as tbl, qry, frm etc. make it immediately clear what kind of object a name is referring to. For the same reason, programmers often (but not always) prefix the name of variables in VBA code with an abbreviation of the data
 type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim strText As String</p>
<p>Dim lngLength As Long</p>
<p>Dim curAmount As Currency</p>
<p>etc.</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 VBA behaving badly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turner3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 VBA behaving badly</h2>
                    <p>I had a report processing server set up using Windows Server 2003 and Office 2003. It uses VBA to watch a folder for new files to come in and then processes them into Excel sheets that it emails out or posts to the IIS server that it runs. It worked OK but
 was on 11 year old hardware and software, so I thought it was time to upgrade.</p>
<p>I spun up a Windows Server 2008 R2 virtual machine and put Office 2016 home and business on it last fall. The thing has always been flaky. I figured that it was the newness of Office 2016 and updates and patches over the next few months would fix it. Here
 we are 5 months later and it still crashes, runs out of memory, stops updating the screen, and locks up. The screen updating can be fixed by clicking on a different worksheet tab and back to the one I was working on. If the workbook has only one sheet then
 I may have to switch workbooks to one that does have multiple worksheets or quit and relaunch the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The out of memory, lockups and crashing happens from a few hours to a few days on different workbooks at different times of the day. The screen updating issue is the only one that is repeatable enough to troubleshoot live, and even that may not happen for
 a few hours after a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done dozens of things to troubleshoot. Disabled all add ins. Uninstalled Acrobat. Changed and reinstalled default printers. Converted everything to .xlsm or .xlsx. Changed lots of my find last cell code. Did the registry hack to disable logging. Uninstalled
 and reinstalled. Made sure that hardware acceleration is turned off. Every few weeks I Google the issue and find another list of steps to troubleshoot Excel 2016 with subtle differences from previous lists I have followed. Things have gotten better. It locks
 up less, but still too much. Now running through the list of troubleshooting steps from start to finish will take me about a month. By then there will be more steps. As you can imagine my bosses patience with me and reports randomly missing from his and our
 customers inboxes is just making me want to scream.(Oh wait, I tried that too. Didn't help.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if reading this jumbled saga makes you say. "Oh, I know that problem. Just do X." I would love to hear it. If not then I would like to know how to punt. Should I downgrade Excel to 2013, 2010 or even all the way back to 2003. Should I downgrade to Windows
 7? Upgrade to Windows Server 2012 or 2016? A new enterprise license is about $4000 so that is not top of my list. Should I separate Excel from IIS? I don't think I would want to run IIS on a client OS but I am starting to think that Excel does not like running
 on a server OS. The fact that I can't even choose a Server OS when using this forum reinforces that.</p>

            <p>I figured out that I could set up a Windows 7 VM and map the drive from the web server over to it so that I had very little configuration to do. Installed Office 2010.</p>
<p>Turns out that you can't just buy the old versions. The licensing here is very convoluted for small businesses. I ended up swapping a retail copy from a workstation.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>

<h2>            Bing Rewards India Redeem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was wondering if Amazon gift cards would be made available to redeem for Bing Rewards India.</p>
<p>If yes, then when can it be expected ? I don't want to use my credits on FreeCharge coupons and would love to spend them on Amazon GiftCards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Abhay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's Bing search engine offers Bing Rewards credits you can redeem for rewards like gift cards and sweepstakes entries. After you set up an account, you earn points by searching with Bing on your phone and computer. You can also get points by participating
 in loyalty programs, through special offers on the Bing website and by referring friends to the Bing Rewards program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Amazon gift cards can only be redeemed on Amazon.com website and not on Bing rewards(India).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, I would suggest you to refer this article and check if it helps.<br />

            Bing/Microsoft may actually be withdrawing or repricing the USA or North AmeriCanada option to redeem Bing points for $5 Amazon credit, "temporarily unavailable" is the message we get and complain about in the wrong place, on the Amazon board at http://www.amazon.com/forum/video%20games/?cdThread=Tx3BE09VM3T2RV9
 ... thus the odds of .India getting to see cooperation between Bing/Microsoft and Amazon seems slight, to me, sorry.

            What to do with the credits after someone has redeemed the Rs 30 and Rs 70 freecharge coupons. Bing India is allowing to redeem once only these coupons. So now all my searches are accumulating Bing Rewards which I cant use now where.

</p><p>"Your email address is part of a <strong>managed domain</strong>, and so you need to contact the domain's administrator to close your Microsoft account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I contacted the <strong>domain's administrator</strong>, who replied that since the domain is currently pointing to
<strong>third party name servers</strong>, I had to contact <strong>my hosting provider</strong>. But my hosting provider said that this "would have to be dealt with by Outlook", and
<strong>told me to post a request in this forum</strong>... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I found the emails, I had used a folder name that was the same as an existing folder in my Outlook account and they went there. I thought I was archiving locally on my hard drive, that is why I used the same folder name. Thanks for your help, it pointed
 me in the right direction to find the emails.

    <title>Outlook contacts to OneNote issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tsunami_australia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook contacts to OneNote issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, I'm currently testing Office2016 (usually use Office2010) for it's integration between Outlook and OneNote. We usually just use all the features in Outlook 2010 such as the notes and journal for keeping a track on things however decided to look
 at the newer way that was suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now each time we contact a utility or supplier etc, lets say the electricity company we put an entry into the journal of who we spoke to when and what happened etc. This has worked GREAT for years and saved us a lot of trouble being able to quote what was
 said on the phone by another person and so on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I create a page/entry for that contact in OneNote and sweet I can give more information etc in OneNote about the call and anything linked to it. HOWEVER, the next time we click on that contact to make a new note about an unrelated subject to the prior,
 OneNote opens on EXACTLY the same page/entry as before. This is useless to us as we need a new entry/page each time we contact the electricity company.<br />
<br />
So is there any way to do what we need (create a new page each time we click OneNote on the contact in Outlook)? I've set it that it goes to "UTILITIES JOURNAL" section as a new page in the settings but it's not creating a new page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA for constructive help. I'd like to get this working and if I can't we will be stuck at Office2010 for a long time.</p>

    <title>Excel 2013 crashes whenever using OLEDB after installing Access 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kkrepsaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 crashes whenever using OLEDB after installing Access 2016</h2>
                    <p><strong>Background info:</strong> We have a Windows 8.1 machine running Office 2013. We have an Excel file that queries data from an Access database using the OLEDB connection string.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Problem:</strong> Recently we needed to purchase/install Access 2016 to make edits to the Access Database. Once installed, the Excel file that pulls data from the Access DB will crash immediately upon loading. All other Excel files work as long as there
 are no connections to the Access DB. If Access is uninstalled, the Excel file will run without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this issue is appreciated!</p>

</blockquote>
Excel is set to prompt the user when there are data connections or macros. The workbook is saved in a trusted location.&nbsp;The excel file crashes once the "enable content" button is clicked (Once the workbook begins to query data).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This workbook works with all other machines, some of them have older versions of Access (2013) installed.

</p><p>Hi Steven</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be the easiest option for getting the RTM build on July 29. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will simply install the final RTM build the same way that you have been installing all of the other preview builds.</p>

    <title>fix the microsoft camera app in 640xl, please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sagnikdey  say:</h3>
<h2>            fix the microsoft camera app in 640xl, please</h2>
                    <p>You've just destroyed my faith in microsoft's camera. Why? Use this app on lumia 640 xl and see for yourself. I HATE this windows camera. Lumia Camera was the best. In order to get photos now you have to keep the camera flash always on, else you'll get very
 low resolution, dull images. No more rich captures. No more living images. Everything was working fine with lumia camera, even after the windows 10 update, until microsoft forced me to say goodbye to the lumia camera app and made me stuck with this buggy Windows
 camera app.! Wake up Microsoft and fix your broken app!!! I'm sick of it. Fix it please</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. Before you tell me to soft or hard reset, I'd like to tell you, I've done it million of times and I've also researched and came to the conclusion that it's about the app not my phone, lumia camera is working well (I mean it was, until I was forced to
 say it goodbye).&nbsp;it's the Microsoft camera that you should be fixing. And it's not just my problem, all of us are having this issue.</p>

<h2>            Missing webpage history in MS Edge Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and have been using Microsoft Edge as my search. On October 9th or 10th I visited a page that I am unable to locate. I clicked on the Hub to view my history (as I know it stays for 3 weeks); however, when I click the week of October 8 -
 14, the last date of history is the 13th. Where is the 12 to the 8th? There is no option to scroll to see more and there are no other pages. I am confused and desire greatly to get back to this particular page. I have never had any issues when I used Google
 Chrome, and I would surely go back to that if this laptop could handle it, but it cannot. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please tell me that why if history is saved for up to three week, I cannot even go back 10 days? Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Joyce,<br />
<br />
Conflicts after a Windows update is one of the possible reasons why some of the webpage history is missing in Microsoft Edge.<br />
For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the
<strong>Windows </strong>key, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press the <strong>
Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Is your Microsoft account signed in on Microsoft Edge?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p><span><strong><em>the last date of history is the 13th. Where is the 12 to the 8th?
</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you always visit the same pages?&nbsp; Then I think only the last visit would be preserved, thus wiping out all the previous visits.&nbsp; Then if enough of that happened there would not be any need for those other days to show.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; We don't
 have the source or support documentation so reverse engineering technique is the order of the day to find out how something works (as opposed to what might have been intended--by the developer or reasonably expected--by the user.)</span></p>
<p>BTW how do you know that Edge saves 3 weeks of History?&nbsp; FWIW I just found something from 1 June in mine.&nbsp; I don't see anything about that in the settings (e.g. via the GUI).&nbsp; Maybe it is in the registry?&nbsp; ProcMon may be needed to go further with this analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>used Google Chrome, and I would surely go back to that if this laptop could handle it, but it cannot</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What does that mean?&nbsp; Perhaps you should open a new thread about that if you really want to use Chrome.&nbsp; Also, of course, there is IE which you may find more usable than Edge.</span></p>

            Re:&nbsp; formula issue<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; replace the the period "." following each sheet name with an exclamation point "!"<br />
2.&nbsp; replace the comma "," between A$2,F$350 with a colon ":"<br />
<br />
So, for instance...&nbsp; <br />
VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet3.A$2,F$350,3,0)))<br />
Looks like...<br />
VLOOKUP(A2,Sheet3!A$2:F$350,3,0)))<br />

            Yes. You can use more than one device with same account.

<br />That is what is the power of Onenote. Use a single account and access from any device.

            Yes, of course. This is mainly what OneNote is all about. If you sign in with your (the same) Microsoft or Office 365 account on different devices (mobile or desktop), all of them will get access to the notebooks that are stored on the cloud space (OneDrive) assigned to that device.

                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a little question.</p>
<p>I want to downgrade Skype. I have different version of 8.xx, with automatic update that i can't change.</p>
<p>So, i want to downgrade to version 7.xx, where I can change the automatic updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, can I use 1 msiexec command to remove all the different versions of 8.xx or should I use each different msiexec to remove it from the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone already tried? or has some experience about these things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Microsoft doesn't support Skype 8 for such environments. Skype 8 is a consumer product. Microsoft would rather have you use Skype for Business for large deployments.
<br />
<br />There are some tools that might be able to help you. Check out the following thread.

<p>I understand that Skype is a consumer product -</p>
<p>BUT many of us have to deal with people who are not part of our lync/skype4business network. In these cases we may have to run Skype.<br />
<br />
The point is one thing, the practical reality of life outside of the perfect world bubble is something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There needs to be a way to prevent auto-updates in general. And specifically for considerations where corporate environment security limitations on software installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow Google Chrome, and Firefox have figured this problem out - how to update a client w/o having to affect installation limitations common to corporate environments.</p>
<p><br />
Surely Microsoft could figure this out as well.</p>

<p>Hi Jamee,</p>
<p>For “android calendar app”, do you refer to built-in Android mail app?</p>
<p>If yes, based on my experience, emails, calendar and contact information can be synced from Exchange server to mobile device if you have set up Exchange e-mail account via ActiveSync on your mobile phone.</p>
<p>For more details, please refer to “Set up Exchange-based email accounts” which is a part of
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-on-an-Android-phone-or-tablet-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872#BKMK_ExchangeSetUp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I misunderstood your requirement.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Toby</p>

<p>Hi Toby, thank you for replying. </p>
<p>While activesync does work, it seems to only work if i use the mobile outlook app for emails calendars and contacts. i am looking for a way to only sync the microsoft calendar between my laptop and mobile phone, without using outlook because i am happy to
 use the original android apps for email and contacts.</p>
<p>best,</p>

<p>hi jameel,</p>
<p>as far as i know, the activesync also works with the original android apps for email and calendar.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a9060cac-0232-425a-b688-502698df6de4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da9060cac-0232-425a-b688-502698df6de4" /></a></p>
<p>if you can’t view the synced calendar on your android calendar app, i need some information below to troubleshoot it:</p>
<p>1. the steps about how do you set up your office 365 account on your mobile. some screenshots would be appreciated.</p>
<p>2. the eas(exchange activesync) test result. to get the eas test result:</p>
<p>a. navigate to: <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>b. select <strong>office 365</strong>-&gt;<strong>microsoft exchange activesync connectivity tests</strong>-&gt;<strong>exchange activesync</strong></p>
<p>c. type the information needed, then click <strong>perform test</strong>.</p>
<p>to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;<strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the post box in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<strong>insert /edit media</strong>. i have sent you a private message to collect the eas test result. to read it:</p>
<p>1.go to “your details” section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2.click private messages.</p>
<p>3.click the subject title (request information) of the response to read the message.</p>

<p>Hi Zoey,</p>
<p>I first deleted my existing email account which was using POP/IMAP. I now understand calendars can not be synced unless using ActiveSync.
</p>
<p>When I go to set up mail manually using activeSync, in the Exchange server settings section, I have to enter the exchange server and domain\user name information. I have not yet been able to get past this area.</p>
<p>thanks, jameel </p>

<p>The Exchange Server for Office 365 account is outlook.office365.com.<br />
And please type your full email address to the box Domain\Username.<br />
Also, you can refer to the following article because it also introduces the steps of manual set up.<br />

<p>Thank you Frankie, that server did work and now i am set up on emails using ActiveSync rather than POP which i had been on previously. That was perhaps the main reason my calendars could not sync between phone and desktop.</p>
<p>Now I am out to sync the calendars on the desktop (office365 and gmail), and have used the following two methods:</p>
<p>1. sharing from office365 calendar via email, inviting my gmail address. </p>
<p>2. obtaining the URL from microsoft from "Publish Calendar" settings and pasting the link in the &nbsp;"Other Calendar" section of google calendar.
</p>
<p>The entries made till date on office365 do transport into google, but new entries made afterwards to not sync.</p>
<p>not sure what to do about this now.</p>
<p>is it simpler to just share google calendar with my office365 calendar instead of doing it the other way around?</p>
<p>best,</p>
<p>jameel</p>

<p>Hi Jameel,</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>Based on my test, the calendar entries created after publishing can be synced when we publish our Office 365 calendar. However, it might take a long time. From our side, it’s about one day. So I’d like to confirm how long you have been waiting up to now.
 If it’s not that long, we suggest you wait for another time and check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Moreover, we may provide limited assistance in our forum regarding sharing a Google calendar with Office 365 calendar as we are not masters at that field. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Sam</p>

<p>Make sure there are no empty paragraphs after the text in the mail merge main document and that the first paragraph in the document is not formatted so that it has a page break before it.&nbsp; Clicking on the Show/Hide (¶) button will help find any empty paragraphs.</p>
