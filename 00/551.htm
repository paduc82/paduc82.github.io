    <title>ActiveSync Error 0x80810005 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ActiveSync Error 0x80810005</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
I use ActiveSync with my mobile phone (WM 6.0) and Axigen Mail Server (has a licensed ActiveSync interface). Now I have the problem that the synchronization sometimes fails with status code 0x80810005. The error always occurs with mails from one specific sender
 but I cannot reproduce this problem with a "self-made" mail from another account. I analyzed the data being transmitted with Wireshark but there seems to be no error in the transmission so Axigen doesn't seem to be the problem.<br />
<br />
However, I have no idea what error 0x80810005 can mean. There seems to be no resources where this error code is explained. Does anyone know this error and what can be wrong to raise it?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Hilmar

            I'm getting the feeling that the issue lies within the Axigen Mail Server but I have no clue how to trouble shoot it.<br />
<br />
From what I can (quickly) gather, this error&nbsp;occurs for those completelly unforseen cases where your exchange server was upgraded or your mailbox got moved or your outlook profile on the desktop changed.&nbsp; It appears that something hasstopped the&nbsp;"handshake"
 between the desktop and your device.<br />
<br />
I might consider going to the support at Axigen to see if the issue is something they might have a solution (or advice for).<br />

<p>can someone please look into this if its just me or if this is really the case? if yes, WHY?</p>

            <p>Only newer versions of Ubuntu support UEFI and Secure Boot.&nbsp; I think you have to hack the EFI file that Windows looks for during boot and replace it with a Linux file (renamed to match the file Windows looks for).&nbsp; I have read about this but have not done
 it.&nbsp; I run Ubuntu in Hyper-V or from the live Ubuntu install on a flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To boot the USB flash drive with Ubuntu on it, the flash drive has to be FAT32 formatted for most UEFI BIOS to recognize it as a bootable UEFI device.&nbsp; I am not sure I have tried this either or if it actually works with Ubuntu.&nbsp; You would have to use something
 like Rufus to create the FAT32 GPT-initialized USB flash drive.</p>

<p>I have it FAT32 formatted, then put iso on it using some pendrive software as I got instruction from wikihow.</p>

            <p>Installing Windows did not change the UEFI (BIOS), so this problem must have been there before.
</p>
<p>You may want to check if your PC manufacturer has released an updated UEFI for your particular PC model. Otherwise I'd advice you to seek help from the Ubuntu community.</p>

            <p>The simplest and easiest way is to hit the esc key during boot or when you see the boot mfg splash screen and choose from the options box. Win 10 claims itself as default OS and what you have to do to override it is not worth</p>
<p>the hassle, happens with all debian flavors too.</p>

            ^^ I've read where Ubuntu is a bit more successful with that but after all the partitioning trying to dual boot Debian and a few arguments about writing grub2 to a GPT partition, I booted into a "no boot menu" lol, ended up using the win10 recovery disk
 I'm glad I made and then using bootsect to repair the boot mbr. I don't use Linux much but was easier to make a persistant USB for 2 Debian distros I use. And with USB 3.0 Sandisk keys, speed is not a issue and all changes/additions/upgrades are maintained.
 I would suggest to anyone dual-booting outside of a VM to make a recovery disk 1st.<br />

<p>SO, since windows 8, MS is using secure boot using UEFI bootloader (if I am right) and so I can't just change the Boot menu i used to in Win7 to restart and boot from USB where another autoexe is waiting.
</p>
<p>But in here I have to go in system settings&gt;recovery where it says boot from USB (image
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d1939e0-5e64-48a7-b01e-f533abd3b2b8" />). I then click it and it then gives me to choice to select from UEFI IP4 or IP6 PCIe GBE Family Controller (img
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/721dc640-ac47-480d-863f-df6e2c78db63" />) .</p>
<p>clicking on either will restart the pc but it will boot from HDD again and not from USB. whether it tries to use USB or not, I don't know but so signs on the screen. on the USB is the Ubunto.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>so as I am guessing all you guys did try to help me out with this boot issue but none was actually a workable solution, I would request MS guys to sort it out and provide a complete guide if possible at all. it is not just Ubunto, it might even be the same
 case when I (or someone else) loose their PC coz of too much torrenting and then can't find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance</p>

            <p>In your boot menu photo, as you have noticed, that all it is offering is UEFI network boot, using IPV4 or IPV6.&nbsp; That means that your PC is not detecting any other UEFI-capable boot device, such as a USB&nbsp; flash drive or hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to boot a hard disk or USB thumb drive, the hard disk or thumb drive requires a System partition initialized as GPT and formatted as FAT32.&nbsp; For the thumb drive, a utility called
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rufus</a> can initialize and format it properly.&nbsp; As a removable drive it can only have a single partition created.&nbsp; For the hard disk, Windows requires the disk to be empty of any partitions
 to convert it to a GPT disk.&nbsp; It is possible to convert it using GPARTED&nbsp;running on&nbsp;Ubuntu Live boot media, but is a risky operation if you are trying to keep your data.&nbsp; Cleaning all partitions off the hard disk is simpler, but requires a backup and restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you use Rufus to prepare the USB flash drive as FAT32, it should show up in the boot menu, if your PC is using Secure Boot and UEFI BIOS mode.&nbsp; Secure boot can be used, as long as your hard disk and USB media are initialized and formatted right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Windows boot manager to try to boot Ubuntu on a UEFI PC, I believe Windows looks for bootx64.efi, so one way that has been used is to rename the Ubuntu boot file to bootx64.efi.&nbsp; Windows will then boot the renamed Linux file instead.&nbsp; Windows
 Vista or newer uses a BCD instead of the old autoexec.bat, boot.ini, etc.&nbsp; So the BCD has to be edited on a USB or hard disk for multi-boot setups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the process here should work&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/dual-boot-windows-8-ubuntu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/dual-boot-windows-8-ubuntu.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use Ubuntu much, so I can get by running it from a live disk or in Hyper-V.</p>

            Did you try the ESC key during boot? I use Debian live persistant on one key and Kali live persistant on another, I'm not a fan of Ubuntu.&nbsp; The F2 key during boot will take me straight to bios settings, but if I hold the ESC key right after power-on it
 brings up a dos-box looking boot menu. There is the windows launcher, Sandisk UEFI, and Sandisk option plus the usual setup menu/mem test. Although there is a UEFI option on the usb debian boot it will just reboot the laptop because I have secure boot control
 turned off., so just pressing the Sandisk option takes me to the usual grub screen where I can then launch the persistant usb. Now, if installing Ubuntu to HDD for dual boot there is excellent documentation in the ubuntu forums to do this. The problem is that
 the windows launcher is placed on the uefi windows partition and all the hoopla to edit can put you into a blank screen during boot like I had. I forgot I had an old bootng program on another usb that probably would have made life easier which I will try should
 I decide to install to HDD. Meanwhile, the usb's run great, just that extra step during boot. BTW, the ESC key during boot has worked on a Asus,Acer,Dell,and HP so far.<br />

            Are you sure that you still have the same phone as what you sent off? Sounds like it might be a locked phone. Do you know if the IMEI is the same? *#06# will give you the IMEI no

            Either that or he just took off your cover and put it onto a stolen N70 from another country. Might want to look into that too.

            <p>To get from 800% to 80%, we need to divide by 10, not by 100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest solution is to divide the source data of the chart by 10.</p>

            Hello. Read your first post again and you mentioned you uninstalled WMDC. If this is correct, you have broken the partnership you had between the PC and the phone so a new one will need to be made. First you should d/l and install PIMBackup (<a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.net</a>)
 and backup your Outlook info on the phone before doing any serious troubleshooting. Also, backup anything else you sync, e.g. important files, IE favorites, etc. Then, on the phone, go to Start&gt;programs&gt;activesync&gt;menu&gt;options. You should see your previous
 partnership with your PC. Delete that off. You may get a dialog that some data will be lost since the last sync. It should be OK since you have a backup in place and restore the backup if necessary. Soft reset the phone. Plug it into the PC USB and you should
 be able to make a new partnership. Select your sync options and you should be OK to sync. Check your PIM data to make sure it is correct.&nbsp;

<h2>            Sort Outlook conversations by original email time stamp</h2>
                    I use Outlook 2010 at work and have my Inbox view set to sort by date and group emails by conversation most of the time. &nbsp;On busy days, I need to make sure that I'm touching my oldest emails first even if more emails with the same subject continue to come
 in before I touch the original one. &nbsp;I find that I'm missing some because the conversation grouping pushes them all to the most recent section of my inbox. &nbsp;For example, I get an email on Monday and another email with the same subject on Tuesday but I get
 emails in between and am out of the office. &nbsp;The 2nd email in the conversation moves it to Tuesday in my inbox. &nbsp;When I come back I want to work all the oldest emails first (especially those with multiple threads from Monday first since those are the ones
 people are asking) about without having to turn off the group by conversation option or scroll through my entire inbox. &nbsp;Is there a way to keep the the entire conversation from moving to a later time and

            <p>Hello There,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This option of sorting all messages in a particular folder by conversation and not having it move a conversation to a new date slot when a new email arrives is not possible. However, here is a suggestion to address
 your need.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you need to work on the older emails, try turning off the Show as Conversations option (just for the time being).</li><li>Turn on the Show in Groups option.</li><li>Work on your older emails and once completed, you may turn off the Show in Groups mode and switch back to Show as Conversations mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Hope the above suggestion helps to fulfill your requirement.
</p>

<h2>            Saving edited pdf in OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I've inserted a pdf file in a OneNote page and drawn on the pdf. Now I want to save the marked-up pdf file as another name. I don't want to print the entire oneNote page as a pdf file; I just want to save the pdf I edited. Is there a way to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can export notebooks in OneNote as a PDF file. Here's how to export notes as PDF in OneNote:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the page that you want to export, click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Export</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Export Current</strong>, pick either <strong>Page</strong>, <strong>
Section</strong>, <strong>Notebook</strong>, depending on your preferences.</li><li>Select <strong>PDF (*pdf) </strong>and click <strong>Export</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Save As </strong>dialog box, choose where you want to save the file.</li><li>Give the file a name, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>As soon as you insert a PDF in OneNote as a printout it is not a PDF anymore but just an image (picture file).</p>
<p>You cannot save this as a PDF anymore (except for converting the whole note page into a new PDF which in no way matches the original one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you draw on a PDF in OneNote you just place lines, markers and text on top of that image, no form of combining or inserting as done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneNote is a note taking app, for "real" annotating of PDF files and saving those edits back in a PDF you need a PDF editor software like Foxit or similar tools.</p>

<h2>            countdown timer between 2 dates</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondering if there is a formula that will allow me to calculate the difference in days between two dates, this should change each day accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so if the first date is 02/06/14 and the second is 15/06/14. Is there a formula that will count how many days&nbsp;left till&nbsp;the 15/06/14, this should change each day by getting smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, today is 02/06/14, means there is 13 days between. today is 04/06/14, then there is 11 days between up till 15/06/14 where there will be 1 or 0 days, then it stops counting afterwards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked everywhere but cannot find help.</p>

            <blockquote>if there is something in f3, I am happy for it to go blank, or just freeze on that digit, but i'm not sure why it would go negative? could you also please explain the 10 days out analysis you mention? The 10 days i wrote in
 there because i am managing something within a 10 day period. Sorry i know, its very silly of me i should have placed that in the initial post.
</blockquote>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If F3 remains blank then your formula goes negative like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In excel dates are simply numbers formatted to look like the dates we recognise. Today (1 Sep 2014) is 41883 and tomorrow will be 41884</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say you are counting down to 5 Sep 2014 which is 41887 we get 41887-41883 = 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>If F3 is still blank on 5 Sep = get 41887-41887=0 but on the 6th Sep we get 41887-41888=-1 and every day until F3 gets filled in the number increments, -1, -2, -3 etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my formula I used MAX(0,C3-TODAY()) so when the formula evaluates negative it displays the larger number of zero.</p>

    <title>Word Is Linking Back to Excel File That I Don&#39;t Need &#40;or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jelarv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Is Linking Back to Excel File That I Don&#39;t Need &#40;or Want&#41;</h2>
                    <p>As background, I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>never </strong>
</span>use "paste link" when pasting a chart from Excel into Word and yet Word insists on creating a link back to the original workbook. I don't need or want the links because they cause all types of problems.&nbsp; I've tried to fix this by going to "Edit Links
 in File" and "Break Link" but Word keeps a "Null" Source File link which then results in an error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't use "Paste as..."</p>
<ul>
<li>"picture" because I lose the ability to change the chart colors</li><li>"Microsoft Excel Chart Object" because it then embeds the workbook into the Word file (some of my Excel files are 10M</li></ul>
<p>This leave me with the option of "Paste as Microsoft Office Graphic Object."&nbsp; For what it's worth, about 20%-25% of the time, I can open a blank Excel file, create a chart and then paste the chart into a blank Word document and the links don't appear (but
 the other 80% of the time they do which is the problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 2010 on Windows 7.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hi, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
A quick question before we proceed.<br />
<br />
Is the data in chart linked with any Excel Spreadsheet?<br />
<br />
By default Word uses Excel feature&nbsp;to edit the chart data. Hence, when you copy a chart and paste&nbsp;it&nbsp; as it is, the chart will be linked with the Excel file.<br />
<br />
If you're&nbsp;pasting a specific&nbsp;chart from Excel Spreadsheet you could try one of the following and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp;Copy the corresponding data from Excel Spreadsheet, create a new chart based on the copied data, then copy it and paste it into Word.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;You may directly create a chart in Word based on the original Excel chart data.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope the above information helps. If you have further questions related to this issue, please let me know.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I can't build my charts in Word (the current document has 25 different charts, all driven by complex macros in Excel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>By default Word uses Excel feature&nbsp;to edit the chart data. Hence, when you copy a chart and paste&nbsp;it&nbsp; as it is, the chart will be linked with the Excel file." I have not found this to be the case with about
 20% of my Word documents.&nbsp; It's a mystery to me, but sometimes the Excel chart in Word doesn't try to link back to the Excel file, which is what I want.&nbsp; In fact, I've done this for at least 8 years going back to Office 2007 and have only noticed this problem
 in the past 4-5 months.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suspect there is a setting I need to change in Excel, Word or Windows but I have yet to find it.&nbsp; Or Microsoft changed something in the background during a recent update
 to Office.<br />

<h3> lcfbiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            No SEND button option on Outlook pop-up &#34;contact-me&#34; options from websites</h2>
                    Even though I have an Outlook account (an old hotmail account that transferred to Outlook when hotmail phased out,) every time I try to use the "contact us" option to send an email via a website link and the Outlook email page pops up, it does not contain
 a SEND button anywhere. I have to cut and past the address into my Outlook mail. I have tried to research this before and the solution to go to Tools under Outlook 2007 was useless bc I could never ever find a Tools option anywhere nor do I even know what
 version of Outlook I'm using. I didn't install it, it just became the new hotmail is all I know. My regular email account via MSN works fine so I can't understand what and how I have to "configure" anything for this to work or why. If it matters, I use Google
 Chrome since Internet Explorer does NOT work for me and locked up constantly.

            <p>"Contact Us" links are typically MailTo URLs and web-based email systems, particularly for Windows 7 and later, don't work.&nbsp; You can't very well have a MailTo URL start a web browser with the necessary values for opening a new message window.&nbsp; The target
 needs to be a mail client.&nbsp; It doesn't have anything to do with Outlook.com vs. Hotmail, it has to do with how Windows 7 and later handle MailTo URL targets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you don't see a Send button is because Outlook 2007 is the mail client you have installed, but you don't have a mail profile containing a mail account defined.&nbsp; The MailTo URL launches Outlook 2007, but Outlook 2007 has no idea what to do without
 a mail profile.</p>

<h2>            Filtering a View by a Lookup Field</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large list in sharepoint online, &gt; 5000 items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the fields in the list (List A) gets it value from looking up a client name from another list (List B).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm am trying to set up a view for List A, that will limit the returned rows to entries with a certain client name. &nbsp;Ideally I'd like the search to be dynamic, meaning I could choose which client entries to return on the fly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not knowing how to achieve that, &nbsp;I have been trying to set up a view with a client name hardwired in as an equal to search criteria. &nbsp;It's not working and I have a feeling its because the client name field in List A looks up it's information from List B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can either address this issue or come up with a simpler way to search by client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Paul</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks James but your reply doesn't answer my actual query.&nbsp; I haven't asked to change the 5000 item limit.&nbsp; I've asked whether it's possible to create a view using a filter that relies on a field which is itself based on a lookup value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've referred to the list you've given and can find no advice on the problem I face.</p>

<p>Paul,</p>
<p>I'd take a look at the url query filter web part. It will let you filter a list on the fly based on the value in a field. You add the web part to a page with your list on, connect it to the list/field and then provide some event to trigger the filter. As
 a simple example, let's say you have a look up column called "Field" and you want to filter the list to only items with "Value" in that field. &nbsp;Add a link formatted as &lt;site/page.aspx?Field=Value &gt; to the page and it will filter the connected list and return
 only those items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to tweak it a bit in your scenario but this should sidestep the issue of having to get values from another list.</p>

<h2>            Problems with installing Windows 10 on an HP Envy 15 &#40;C001DX&#41; 2 in 1 laptop</h2>
                    I reserved Windows 10 and got a pop-up yesterday saying it was ready to download. I then attempted to download it but now it keeps re-starting and nothing is happening. Note, I am running Webroot for an antivirus program. Any suggestions to get my PC working
 again?

    <title>Remove pop-up &#34;invalid values&#34; window in Access that turns - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove pop-up &#34;invalid values&#34; window in Access that turns text in record to Chinese when one attempts to close the window.</h2>
                    
<p>While I was away from my desk last week, a consultant working on another problem in Access 2003 found a pop-up window suddenly appearing in the most recently added record in a table. The window said, "The value you entered isn't valid for this field. For
 example, you may have entered text in a numeric field or number that is larger than the field size setting permits." On the first click to close the window, nothing happens. On the second click, the text in the record turns into Chinese. On the third click,
 the window closes. The consultant, working with local staff, created two more text records, and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>Today, when I looked at this problem, we found it was isolated to those three records. The text returned to English when we revisited the records. We have saved the text in English to a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Has anyone come across this problem before? What could have caused it and how do we solve it? Is the simplest way around it to delete those three records? Should we leave those records there in case there is a bug relating to those three rows in a table,
 but not store any data in them? I'd been using the table for months successfully before this happened.</p>

If you are referring to the row numbering used by Excel, it is 1 based.&nbsp; There's no option for zero-based row numbers.

</p><p>There are different reasons why you cannot receive emails. It's possible it has something to do with your credentials or account settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that your account settings are correct, compare the settings in the Outlook app to the settings for your email account in the desktop app. Any changes on your account like password change will affect how your email works. To learn more about
 updating your email settings, check this <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-an-email-account-to-Outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b#bkmk_updatepc_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong></em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andre how does starting Outlook in SAFE MODE address the errors in the pst file that the OP's question is about?</p>
<p>It doesn't. Everything you posted is to do with errors in the Outlook MAIL PROFILE - which is nothing to do with errors encountered in the PST FILE....</p>
<p>The OP needs to use scanpst as in the error message.<br />

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 535, after reseting the phone SMS service not working</h2>
                    I reset the phone for giving it to my son, after reset the messaging from sim (SMS icon) not visible, the mobile is not receiving any&nbsp;SMS or sending any SMS. Simply the icon is not there in all apps.

            <p>Hi Siva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some tips in case you can't send or receive text messages:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your phone. <br />
The date and time may be incorrect after restarting your phone. To set the time correctly, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Time &amp; language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; time</strong> (Lumia with WP 8:
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>date+time</strong>).</li><li>Check the signal strength on the phone screen, and move to an area with better reception.</li><li>Send a text message to your own mobile phone number. This will test your sending and receiving capabilities in one go.&nbsp;
</li><li>Check the SMS center number (<strong>Messaging</strong> &gt; ... &gt; <strong>settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>SMS center number</strong>). If the number is missing or you think it is incorrect, confirm the number with your network operator.</li><li>If you have Multi-SIM (two SIM cards with the same mobile phone number), note that some text messages can only be received on your assigned primary SIM card.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the previous steps do not help, insert a different operator SIM card into your phone to verify that the phone is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />
