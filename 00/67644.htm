<h2>            Need help transferring Computer security and configuration settings to other computers.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I need help copying the security settings and configuration from one computer to other computers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Background</em>: We have a small department with 4 computers running on an internal network and not connected to the Internet. (Not permitted.) The computers are not part of a domain. When we got new computers last year running Windows 7, we first
 had to harden them according to specs provided by a program called <em>WASSP </em>
(Windows Automated Security Scanning Progam). The scan can result in over 300 findings (computer security settings that need to be changed) that then need to be corrected by hand, which can take quite a long time. We had a 700+ KB MMC .inf file for our previous
 XP computers that a former collegue created which could be loaded into each computer to cut down the time it took to harden the computer. That file won't work with Windows 7 (or at least I don't dare try it), and WASSP finds a lot more security issues with
 Win7 than XP. Basically I have to create a "Build" document showing the steps to harden (or reharden after a crash) a computer and am looking for quicker ways to harden the computers. A previously saved .inf file could be part of the hardening procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been trying to use <strong>MMC </strong>(Microsoft Management Console) to create a new .inf file with very little success. I searched the Internet for help with MMC, and most documents and videos show how to use snapins, but none talk about saving
 and transfering actual data. I did find one answer to a similar question that gave a breif solution about creating a Security template and then saving it, but that was the extent of the help and no details, and following the directions did not produce an .inf
 file with data settings.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, I was able to create some database settings via the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in, analysing a computer that had been configured with the correct settings, and then manually going thru the menu tree and changing
 each database setting one at a time to match the configured computer. (Isn't there a faster way?) It took several more trials and errors before I was able to first save a small 2k file with a few settings to test (and was accepted by the target computer),
 and then a few more tries before I was able to save a 20K file with more settings. But the latter only resolved 22 WASSP findings.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My questions are as follows:</span></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> What is the proper way to create an .inf file with data in it? Sometimes I just get a list of what the menu items are, and not actual data. Only 2 tries saved data, but nowhere near everything that I need.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Is there a faster was to save all of the configured computer's settings (or rather the ones I need) without having to manually tell MMC that I want each value changed in the database? There should be a way to "Save ALL computer settings
 to database".</p>
<p><strong>3) </strong>Is there a way to save the register settings, services settings, file permission settings, etc.? When I select "Analyse computer", the above entries under "Security Configuration and Analysis" shows a lock icon on each root menu item.
 When you expand the menu to look at a particular entry, it says "not analyzed" or "can't analyze". Right clicking on an entry does show a selection to "analyse".</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> Is there a better way to transfer all the configuration settings from one computer to another? It needs to be something that comes with Windows 7, not a product downloaded via the Internet. Last year when I was first working on this I
 tried exporting the register from a configured computer and importing to the target computer. The first try crashed the target computer and I had to start over installing all software. The 2nd try I used a smaller set of the register, but it also copied the
 computer name and address which I had to correct, and didn't cover all settings.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, Shubham, but that's not exactly the info I need.</p>
<p>For example, I already know how to backup the register, but I need to transfer certain parts of it to another computer. &nbsp;If I transfer the full register, then the other computer crashes. &nbsp;If I transfer just a section, like ....Machine, then I still pick
 up the source computer's name and address which is assigned to the target computer, which then has to be corrected. &nbsp;So it's a delicate balance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not able to save all the security settings and registry settings into an .inf file -- only some settings are saved.</p>

<h2>            Xbox lags me out of games and disconnects from Xbox live, also when i join a party it keeps lagging me in and out.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, can someone please help me!<br />
<br />
1. When i try to join a party, it says can't connect. I try again and i get in. After 2 minutes or so it starts lagging me in and out and disconnects me from live.<br />
<br />
2. I try to play online on any game it starts lagging and then disconnects me from live yet again. This can range from CoD Black ops to Minecraft.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've spoken to my Network provider, BT Infinity, supposedly the fastest and best internet. All they did is tested the speed and said nothing was up with connection. So i am so annoyed with whatever is happening! I don't know what to do. PLEASE HELP! I can't
 play with anybody.</p>

<h3> scoobinater  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrade to SSD drive on new Win 8 laptop</h2>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago, I bought a new Asus X202E laptop running Window 8 and I've&nbsp;spent some time on it&nbsp;getting used to the new Windows interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I want to remove the laptop's 500GB mechanical hard drive and replace it with a new 250GB SSD disk that I just purchased.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where do I download the ISO for Windows 8? How can I get Windows installed on the new SSD drive? I assume i'll have to make a bootable USB stick with the Win8 source files?&nbsp; Would have been so easy if Asus had just included a USB thumb drive with the laptop.</p>

<p>Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that you want to install Windows 8 on the new SSD but you did not get the installation media with the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to do a clean install and would need the Windows 8 DVD to do the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Windows 8 came preinstalled on the laptop, you would have to contact Asus for assistance in getting the operating system installed on the new hard drive.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Yes, I am expecting to do a clean install, but this laptop has no optical drive, so installing from DVD isn't an option. I assume the existing hard disk contains a hidden partition with a restore image.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I assumed that Win 8 would be similar to Win 7 in that I could download a freely available ISO file from Microsoft and create a bootable USB stick containg the source files. Is this not the case?</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Yes we have an option of downloading the ISO if you have a product key. Once you download the files you have the option to create media, either a USB or a DVD.</div>
<p>Make sure you are on the PC you want to upgrade or install Windows 8 on as the download architecture (32bit/64bit) would match the system the download is done on.</p>

this doesn't help me. 



The first link sends me to download the "upgrade assistant" which assesses my computer to see if it's capable of running windows 8. From the Win8 laptop in question, this seems rather silly...but I went ahead with it anyway, only for the program to tell me that windows cannot be downloaded from the area in which I am located (Canada).  Well that's just great. 



I also tried from my desktop computer, which runs a legit version of Win 7 Ultimate. Well, on that computer, the upgrade assistant wants me to purchase a copy of Windows 8. 



All I want is to find the source files so that I can manually reinstall the Win8 on my new laptop. Where the **** can I get the source files?  I have my product key. This shouldn't be that difficult, but I'm about to abandon this silly adventure and switch to Ubuntu.

            thanks, but that doesn't help either. That's for upgrading and existing windows license.&nbsp; I don't want to upgrade my Win7 desktop, and the laptop in question is already running a legit copy of Win8... I'm replacing the hard drive with an SSD disk. I just
 want to get a copy of the ISO so that I can make my own install media&nbsp;(DVD or bootable USB, I don't care which).

                    My computer will not go to sleep at home. On the road, it does exactly what I want-- after 5 minutes it does a screensaver of my photos for 30 min, then goes to sleep. At home it will not do this, the screen stays on startup screen forever.&nbsp; Help!

            I would venture a guess that it is running on battery power on the road and plugged in at home. You can set things up so that the computer handles things like sleep mode, etc., differently depending on whether or not it is running on the battery.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>So, the first thing you need to do is make sure that your power settings are the way you want.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To do this:&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>
Place your mouse over the battery icon on the taskbar and right-click.</p>
<p>
Choose "Power Options".</p>
<p>
(You can also access the power options through the control panel: start&gt;control panel&gt;System and Maintenance&gt;Power Options.)</p>
<p>

<div><br />
<div>
<p>
Under the plan being used on your computer, click on "Change Plan Settings".</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/31355658@N05/3397279781/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffarm4.static.flickr.com%2f3455%2f3397279781_d6fb0483c3_m.jpg" /></a>
<div><br />
<div>As you can see, there are two different colums of settings here, one for battery and one for plugged in. Make sure that the settings in each column are set as you desire.</div>
<div>You can access more advanced options by click on the "Change Advanced Power Settings" link. Go through the list of offered settings carefully, making adjustments as neccessary. Click ok.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Click "Save".&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            downgrade Windows 10 to 8.1 and now mail, calendar, people won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>In addition, 6 other apps in the Store are getting errors. I've searched the errors, and they seem to be Windows Update&nbsp;errors. I've run the Windows Update troubleshooter numerous times. It finds errors, and says it fixes them, but I don't think so. When
 I run the troubleshooter now, it just brings up the same error, over and over again, but each time its says its fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original error was 0x80070003</p>
<p>Now in the troubleshooter its stuck on: 0x80070490</p>
<p>But, the apps that won't install in the Store are on: 0x80248007</p>

            <p>Yes. I had copied my Win8.1 image to an external had, prior to loading Win10. Win 10 was&nbsp;horribly slow on my tablet, so I went back to 8.1. Interestingly, Microsoft's scan told me I could install Win 10, but&nbsp;after I did it, I went to Acer's site looking&nbsp;for
 help, and&nbsp;only then did I see, that "they" didn't recommend Win 10 on my tablet. So who was right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, now,&nbsp;Mail, Calendar, and People, as well as Translator show as blank blocks on the re-installed 8.1 start screen. If I click on them they don't open. If I go to Store, it says they're installed. Can I uninstall and reinstall baked in apps like that?

            OK try to find where the apps are installed on your PC. You should be able to just search them. Then try to open them from the original Icon. Instead of the start menu. It could be that the apps are working but you have to remove some of the older shortcuts
 to get the new ones. Usually when you uninstall a program it removes most to all of its contents. But sometimes if there are problems the shortcuts will remain which will only lead to a non working program. Depending on why the old one did not work it could
 spread. But likely not in this case. &nbsp;

<p>Thanks Kyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't work. I even tried going into the Program Files (including hidden files). I found the .exe files but the apps won't start from them either. I chatted with Microsoft help for ages today. Tried dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p>In CMD. That comes up with errors after four tries. </p>
<p>First try: 0x800f081f - Source files could not be found </p>
<p>Last three tries: 0x800f0909 - Source files could not be downloaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC refresh may be the only way, but my concern with this is a password vault app I was using. This is one of the programs that won't load, and I really don't want to lose that app data.

            <p>Well you have made allot of changes to your apps. Which could be creating problems while trying to solve them. I would do a system restore but make sure that you choose a date that is after the date when got windows 10. Otherwise it will likely revert back.
 When you do this it could reset the softwares to work. If that does not work revert back to your previous windows and start all over again. What i don't know is if the option to get windows 10 will still be there if you revert.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks again. But tried System Restore yesterday with the Microsoft help desk. In the end they want $99 to continue to help.
<br />
<br />
When you say revert. Do you mean Refresh PC? I don't mind doing that, but I will loose all app data. Right?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Before I do that, what do you think of the idea, or going back on Win10 and then turn right around and downgrade again to Win8.1? I'm wondering if in the process of downgrading (re-installing 8.1)&nbsp;something has got corrupted. Obviously, if my system backup
 (of 8.1)&nbsp;is corrupted then this wouldn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: just thought now, how can the apps be messed up? I just uninstalled Fresh Paint and reinstalled it, and it crashes straightaway. So, if the old version of the app was at fault, then the new reinstalled version should have worked, right?</p>

            I don't think you can get windows 10 again for free. Try the website you might be able to reserve your upgrade there but i can't promise that. &nbsp;But it's very possible that it can have an effect. Doing this may make things better or could make them worse.&nbsp;

<p>It was still offered in Windows Update. After contacting the developer of the password vault app, I realised the data was probably gone. So, I did a clean install of Win 10 and all the apps weren't working, are now. I've lost my data, but it's&nbsp;a far better
 result. And, Win 10 is really quick now. Looks like a clear install is the best way to upgrade.</p>

<br />
<br />NOTE: Were letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, well begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<div>Thanks for reply. Here is more detailed info:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;The filename(s) would be too long for destination folder. You can shorten the filename and try again, or try a location that has a shorter path.</div>
<div>2. I'm trying to copy files from one external hard drive to another. Both are connected&nbsp;</div>
<div>via USB (2.0)</div>
<div>3. Computer is assembled by me. Configuration:</div>
<div>MB : ASUS P5WDG2 WS Professional ( 975X)</div>
<div>CPU : &nbsp;Intel Core 2 Quad Q 6600</div>
<div>HDD : System(Disk C) Maxtor &nbsp;250GB, External Drive Seegate 1,5 TB, External Drive WD 2 TB. Both HDDs are exFAT&nbsp;</div>
<div>RAM : Kingston 4GB &nbsp;<span>1333 MHz</span></div>
<div><span>4. Actually this is the nested folder and it is 0 bytes. I'm trying to backup the folder and total size of entire folder(with files) is about 200GB. The error message pops up when trying to copy certain folders, nested folders.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Like I said above I found the people have the same problem but with win 7 &nbsp;and the solution is a Patch. I didn't found this patch for Windows 8.</span></div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Licence key on Reinstall - Do I need it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running Windows 10 Pro for a number of years, and it was activated when I upgraded from Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>My Main Hard disk is a Hybrid disk with a 250GB SSD (C:)&nbsp; and a 2TB drive (D:).&nbsp; Recently I have started to get disk corruption errors on my D Drive.&nbsp; Chkdsk does not get further than 10% even after running overnight.&nbsp; The PC still boots fine because C:
 appears to be fine, but that doesn't really help as most of my data is on D:, so I am looking at getting a new hard disk, and as my current one is a hybrid, that means I have no choice other than to replace C: as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had read that the Windows 10 Licence Key was embedded in the BIOS, but after running OEMKEY it tells me "Unable to open MSDM table!&nbsp; This PC does not contain an embedded product key - search for a product key sticker or contact your manufacturer for assistance."</p>
<p>If I look on my current system it tells me that "Windows is activated with a digital licence linked to your Microsoft Account"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So because of this, as I will be installing Windows on the same PC, all be it a different Hard disk, do I need any key at all?&nbsp; I do still have my Windows 8 Pro key, but wasn't sure if that would still work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
                </div>

            Hi Mark.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you upgraded the PC was assigned a permanent Digital License to reinstall Windows 10 as often as you want.  
<br />
<br />Just skip the Product Key and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It will activate after connecting to the internet.  
<br />
<br />I'd replace your HDD with an SSD which is the best upgrade you can give your PC - lightning fast, better than a new higher end PC without one - swap it in and do the Clean Install in the link above.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mark, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you do not need to worry about Activation or a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Will, the mini dump file names World of Tanks as the cause of your Blue Screen crashes.
<br />
<br />If that is a game you play, I would suggest it is your Graphics card driver that is causing this issue:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />If the Roll Back options is grayed out, right click your video card and choose Uninstall, when asked, confirm deletion of the driver files
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC once done . . .

<p>You cannot transfer between DLC between accounts, however you can create a new Microsoft Account with your new preferred email and then move your gamertag over to that new Microsoft Account on your console by going to Settings&gt;Account&gt;Account Security&gt;Change
 Microsoft Account. This way your gamer profile will be intact, and you will be signing in with your actual preferred email. Keep in mind though that if your new Microsoft Account is a 3rd party email (a non-Microsoft email server), then there might be a waiting
 period to be able to associate a new gamertag to it (30 days usually). If your other email address is already a Microsoft Account, then just move that gamertag on over to it with the instructions above :)</p>
<p>****Make sure that you have the new Microsoft Account established BEFORE you initiate the gamertag switch on your console!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Navy1983
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try disabling the sound device and check if the issue still persists.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps to disable the sound:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the speaker icon on the task bar</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on speaker to mute</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: These steps will mute all the output sound. This is just for testing purpose.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Or you can even try these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on start</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Control panel</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open Sound menu</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select sound tab</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>v.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>From the sound scheme: select No sounds</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>vi.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click apply</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Revert back with results to help us troubleshoot better.</span></span></p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93;&#34;Can&#39;t connect to Xbox Live&#34; from inside of backwards compatible 360 game on xbox one</h2>
                    <p>I've seen lots of variants of this question but haven't had success with the answers I've found so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to play Red Dead Redemption on my Xbox one. I had some trouble getting a profile to connect to Xbox live before but was able to fix the problem by deleting my profile information and re-downloading my profile. My downloaded 360 profile disappeared
 and I can't download a profile due to an error saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Can't connect to Xbox Live. Select Test Connection to troubleshoot your connection. For more info, go to www.xbox.com/support.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If I select "Test Connection", it goes to the Xbox one settings and says that everything is fine. I've tried deleting the 360 cache from the Xbox one storage settings and that hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have 2fa enabled. Is that something I need to disable in order to use live on 360 games on the Xbox One?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, you can't save progress in RDR unless you're signed in to a profile inside the emulator, hence the desire to get signed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I put a comment at the bottom but it ended up being a network issue. I moved to a network with a less strict firewall and backwards compatibility started working fine. I suspect I could have found the same results if I figured out what ports needed to be
 open for 360 Xbox Live to work but it was easier to just plug in an ethernet cable.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account must also be set on X1 (the same account name on X360). If you can not set it, try to perform a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a> and try again. After, if the account was created on the console, in the menu emulated X360, hold down the menu and options buttons to enter in X360 menu and check the account settings.</p>

<p>If you have 2fa enabled, make sure you are using an App Password instead of your regular password, when you sign in on the emulated Xbox 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create an App Password on <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, clear the local Xbox 360 storage from your Xbox One console first, and then try to download your account again, using the App Password you generated above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO NOT turn off Two Step Verification as steeledwand7664 recommended!!! This is unnecessary and makes your account less secure and an easier target for phishing and account hijacking!</p>

<p>I tried disabling 2fa and setting my password to 15 characters. When I rebooted my xbox one, i had to re-sign in and starting another 360 game (Mirror's Edge) re-fetched something in the emulator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I'm still getting the "can't connect" error if I try to download my profile inside the emulator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dug out my old 360 and it could sign into Xbox Live when 2fa was enabled.</p>

<p>Please keep 2FA enabled on your account and create an App Password on <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a> to make your account secure again.</p>
<p>Then use the newly created app password instead of your regular password on the Xbox 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell us, what country you are from, as a few weeks ago, people from the Ukraine and Iran had trouble connecting to Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the emulated Xbox 360 tries to contact servers that are blocked by a country-wide firewall, or other local issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also while you're on the Proofs managing page, check that your security proofs (like alternative email addresses and phone numbers) are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the Xbox One try to clear the Xbox 360 storage again in the Xbox One settings under storage, and restart your console by holding the power button for 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>Make sure the Xbox One shows a green boot screen during startup. If not, hold the power button again for at least 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after the console finished starting, launch any Xbox 360 game again, press both the Menu and View buttons on the controller to bring up the Xbox 360 guide, and choose to "Download Profile".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide your email, and the App password you created instead of your regular password.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay, my Xbox One ended up losing a fan and wasn't operational for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out the problem was a bit more simple. The firewall on my wireless network is more strict than the wired network and I had forgotten that I was on wired the last time I had used backwards compatibility. As soon as I moved my (now working) Xbox back
 to the wired network, I was able to download my profile and resume RDR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all for the suggestions and help.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hey R3demption,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>The error message indicates that the backup file could be missing some of the files required restore the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.<br />
</span><span><span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is there a way you will be able to create the backup again from your old computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you create another backup and then try to restore. However, I suggest that you post your question at the Call of Duty Community for a better response for your
 question. Here is a link I found to post your question:</span></p>

    <title>Questions about Apple Earbods for Voice Chat on the Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord nazo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Questions about Apple Earbods for Voice Chat on the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Is it even possible to use my Apple earpods for voice chat on the Xbox One? I've looked at a lot of tutorials showing how to do it and how to fix some screeching sound that occurs when plugging the earpods in. However, some people are saying that the Apple
 earpods don't even work for voice chat or that they can only hear the audio and that you need the Xbox One Stereo Headset adapter. I'm not sure if this is true because some people say it does work by using the adapter while some say it doesn't. So now I am
 at a total loss. I need a straight answer to this question: Would using my Apple earpods allow me to talk to other people in voice chats or would I need the Xbox One Stereo Adapter for them to hear me, or would people not be able to hear me regardless?</p>

<p>Hi there. You would need the adapter if your controller doesn't have a built in mic port on the bottom. The Apple ear buds are wired to different spots on the pin. You'll want to find a CTIA compatible headset, a OMTP to&nbsp;<span>CTIA</span> adapter.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            new xbox one s controller has just stopped working with the headset.</h2>
                    <p>Bought the Xbox one s on the 3rd Dec 18 and the controller and headset were working fine together for about 2 weeks then the mic indicator on the screen suddenly just crossed out and we couldn't hear or be heard through the headset. The controller still
 works in every other way. The headset still works when used in my laptop and in other controllers.</p>
<p>I called Microsoft 3 times and 3 times after explaining everything to them the line went dead. I got as far as being told that we need to troubleshoot. No one has ever called back and I'm so fed up of going through their automated system I thought I'd send
 an email. However this is the closest I've come getting help, Ive asked a gamer an they were no help an email address would be nice. I can not take the thing back to the shop as I don't have the receipt until next week when my mother gets back from holiday.
 Plus the fact I don't have a car and don't fancy taking a&nbsp;(Mod Removed)&nbsp;xbox on my bike #notgonnahappen.</p>
<p>I saved up for ages to get this for my son and it's been nothing but trouble, which isn't all Microsoft's fault but they don't make contacting them very easy.....</p>

 cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

<p>Whats up! We can try a couple trouble shooting process so far. First what kind of headset is it? If nots not Microsoft support headset it will not work. Here are some troubleshooting steps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug the headset into another controller and see if it works(If it does, the controller possibly needs to be sent in to Xbox to be serviced or replaced @ support.xbox.com)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One power down the controller completely and unplug the headset then turn it back on and plug it back up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work direct connect the Xbox Controller to the Xbox with a USB cable and go to settings&gt; Kinect &amp; Devices &gt; Devices &amp; Accessories &gt; press the three dots . See if the controller needs an update to the firmware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previously stated, the wait is due to our team looking for root causes to then be able to fix this to get everyone using their headsets again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative provided to the community as we do understand communication is important when it comes to games, is to invest in an
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One stereo headset adapter</a></strong>. The description for this device is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>The Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter lets you plug a compatible chat or stereo headset into the Xbox One Controller so you can control your audio experience without taking your hands off the controller.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an alternative option that is available as opposed to waiting this out for our fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the time in waiting, we understand that these processes can be frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>I dont understand, sorry a few weeks ago i knew nothing about xboxs, his headset is already plugged into his controller, ill googled it. As i understand this has been an issue with headsets for a while. If an alternative cant be found then the consol is
 faulty. I will look into your suggestion though and hopefully itll work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ich had die selbe Frage im englische Support-forum gestellt, aber ich kann den post nicht mehr finden. Entweder er wurde gelscht, oder es liegt daran das die Such- und Verwaltungsoptionen hier miserable sind. Naja. Falls es an mir liegen sollte - kann mir
 jemand sagen, wie ich von mir selbst erstellte threads finde?</p>
<p>Aber zurck zur ursprnglichen Frage: Ich habe keine Kreditkarte, aber ein verifiziertes PayPAL-Konto. Laut dieser Seite:</p>

<p>...sollte das eigentlich gengen. Aber wenn ich meinen PayPAL-Account als Zahlungsoption angeben will, komme ich direkt zu einer Seite, auf der ich aufgefordert werde eine Kreditkarte anzugeben.</p>
<p>Der PAyPAL-Support selbst sagt dazu folgendes:</p>
<p>[quote]<span>Es handelt sich bei der Verknpfung mit dem Microsoft-Account um eine sogenannte Abonnementzahlung bzw. Zahlungsvereinbarung. Diese kann nur mit einer Kreditkarte eingerichtet werden.[/quote]</span></p>
<p>Also, wenn letzteres stimmt, warum kann das Microsoft nicht klar und deutlich angeben? Und falls es nicht stimmt - warum funktioniert es dann nicht?</p>

<p>Bei mir hat es geholfen, ein paar Euro auf mein PayPal Konto zu berweisen. Gemeint ist hier natrlich nicht das Girokonto. ;-)</p>
<p>Hier ist mal die Antwort (Auszug), die ich damals vom PayPal Support bekommen habe:</p>
<p>Um die Zahlung sofort abzuschlieen, wird Ihnen alternativ die Zahlung per Kreditkarte angeboten. Sollten Sie keine Kreditkarte besitzen, knnen Sie Ihr PayPal-Konto auch vor der Zahlung durch eine berweisung aufladen. Dies dauert ein bis zwei Arbeitstage.
 Danach knnen Sie die Zahlung erneut einleiten. </p>
<p>Und so zahlen Sie Geld auf Ihr PayPal-Konto ein.</p>
<p>1. Loggen Sie sich in Ihr PayPal-Konto ein, und klicken Sie auf "Geld einzahlen".
</p>
<p>2. Whlen Sie "Geld von einem Bankkonto berweisen". </p>
<p>3. Jetzt einfach unsere Kontonummer, die Bankleitzahl und den Verwendungszweck notieren und die berweisung bei Ihrer Bank abgeben oder online durchfhren.

Did you upgrade to <u>Microsoft</u> Update from <u>Windows</u> Update? I had the same problem. The solution (until Microsoft come up with a patch) is to deactivate Microsoft Update and go back to Windows.</p>
<p>When you open up the Update via shortcut, if it says Microsoft Update, go to the left hand pane and click on
<em>Change Settings. </em>Scroll down to the bottom and click the box to deactivate Microsoft. Exit Internet Explorer, open Control Panel, Click Automatic Updates. At the bottom of the window there should be&nbsp;a
<em>Windows Update</em> link in red. Click on it.</p>
<p>When the Update page appears again it should now say Windows Update. Click High Priority update first, there may be quite a few.</p>
