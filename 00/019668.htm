<h2>            MS Word VBA&#58; how add a tab&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found the following macro and it works great to de-subscript endnotes and add a period. But it's missing one thing: I also need to put in a tab before the endnote number (so that the numbers get right-justified). How can I do that? Thanks!</p>

            Hi Megan,<br />
<br />
You may turn off the display of summary tasks by de-selecting Summary Tasks on the Format ribbon in the Gantt chart view.<br />
<br />
However, it sounds like you'd like to show just Milestone tasks.&nbsp; The default Milestones Filter does display summary tasks, but you can either edit the filter or create a new one.&nbsp; To create a new "Milestone without Summary" filter:<br />
<ol>
<li>View Ribbon, Filter drop-down and select "More Filters" to open the More Filters dialog<br />
</li><li>Find the Milestone filter in the list and click the Copy button to open the Filter Definition dialog.<br />
</li><li>Give the filter a new name.</li><li>De-select "Show related summary rows".</li><li>Click OK to close the Filter definition dialog and return to the More Filters dialog.</li><li>Click the Apply button to apply the new filter.</li></ol>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Julie<br />

    <title>Microsoft Security Essentials real time protection getting turned off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> engrjpo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials real time protection getting turned off</h2>
                    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> I discovered that my Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) real time protection gets turned off, and I don't know why. I have been using MSE since July 2011 and this behavior only showed up since the last week of May 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How the issue happens:</strong> When I first boot up and login using an Administrator account, it works fine, and the real time protection is enabled and confirmed by the presence of a green icon for MSE. I then do a "switch user" to an account that
 is not an Administrator and surf the Internet for a while.&nbsp; The MSE in this account is okay.&nbsp; When I switch back the Administrator account I discover that real time protection of MSE is turned off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I tried already:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Prior to discovering the workarounds, I tried turning on real time protection per the button to turn it on, but MSE just seems to hang, so I just log-off the account.&nbsp; When I also check the Setting tab I see that the option for real time protection is
 still checked despite MSE reporting that it's turned off -- this is confusing because the settings show it's checked but somehow not enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I have tried scanning my system using MSE; no viruses were found.&nbsp; I have tried scanning using MalwareBytes (MBAM, on-demand version only, not the one with real-time protection); no viruses were found. I have tried scanning using the stand-alone rootkit
 remover version of MBAM; no viruses found. Notes: (1) Per further research I saw from
<a href="http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx</a>&nbsp;that MBAM shouldn't conflict with MSE. (2) Prior to the last week of May 2013 I have not encountered MBAM and MSE conflicts.&nbsp; I highly doubt there
 are conflicts between these two anti-virus scanners, especially since MBAM is not giving me real time protection unlike (supposedly) MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I have tried restoring my system to a point before this issue came up, but it still does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Temporary solution:</strong> To date I have discovered two workarounds to turn it back on: (1) Log-off and re-login to the account, and (2) Run a quick scan, which somehow forces real time protection to be enabled again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other particulars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x64 bit with the latest Patch Tuesday updates (May 2013) installed.</li><li>AV: MSE (latest engine and virus definition files); MBAM (latest engine and virus definition files).</li><li>PC clock is set to automatically update to correct time.</li><li>Windows Firewall is turned on and set to defaults.</li><li>All third party software like Adobe Flash, Adobe Reader, Java and Quicktime are the latest versions.</li><li>I have scheduled back-ups of my data files, and I create system images after every Patch Tuesday run.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Worst case scenario:</strong> I will switch to another anti-virus solution like Avast, however this obviously will not answer the issue of MSE's real time protection suddenly getting turned off, and just avoids it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In checking the various forums posts I've seen a number of people having a similar issue but none that has any satisfying answer, at least not in my particular case.</p>

            <p><strong>Updates as of this writing:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been six days since I reinstalled MSE, and all seems to be working as normal since I haven't seen the issue recur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only regret that I wasn't able to pinpoint the root cause of this.&nbsp; It's possible I just missed something in Process Monitor or in the Event Log.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm hoping this issue doesn't come back again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A friend told me that my daily scheduled Quick Scans is not enough, that I need to do regular Full Scans also because over time as new or updated software is introduced in the machine, MSE is not able to regularly go through them, and thus will think it's
 inefficient.&nbsp; Honestly, I don't understand how this could be the explanation as to why real time protection would turn itself off just like that, but the advice to do regular Full Scans sounds good and is something I plan to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Real time protection in MSE turns off suddenly.&nbsp; Investigation via Process Monitor didn't show anything significant that could cause this; hopefully someone eventually finds out why either using this tool or some other tool.&nbsp; Recommended solution continues
 to be to uninstall and reinstall MSE to correct the problem.&nbsp; Regular Quick Scans and Full Scans are recommended to ensure MSE is working and that the system is free from malware.</p>

<h2>            Insert image in Table Cell &#124;&#124; Copy image into Table Cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue. I'm creating a report-template with a very stylized Table of Contents. For the ToC I'm using&nbsp;a COMAddin (C#).</p>
<p>Every item in the ToC consists of a Textbox. And every Textbox contains a Table (for alignment-purposes). And in a particular cell in this Table I want to have a picture (a circle with an arrow in it -&gt; it will get a hyperlink to the Chapter).</p>
<p>Because I don't want to do a lot of FileSystem-copy-or-insert-actions I thought I'd place the image hidden in the Header of the firtst section of the template, and from there on I'd copy the image and paste it into the Table cell, only I can't seem to get
 it working.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me on this one? Is my thought-pattern-proces any logic? Is there any other way to achieve this stylized idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Bert</p>

<h2>            When will Windows fix the &#40;Code&#58; 0x80240439&#41; quite alot of people are having.</h2>
                    Hey, I'm unable to use Windows Update and Windows Store. When trying to use these features/Apps I get an error code.<br />
I think it relates to having a gigabyte motherboard but I'm not sure. Anyway so many people are having this issue especially Insiders (like me)<br />
and I'm concerned that it won't be fixed even though I've paid money to enjoy windows 10. Maybe the fall update will fix this?<br />

<h2>            Mailing Labels in Word 2013</h2>
                    I have created mailing labels in Word 2013. I never had a problem in Word 2003. Yes I made a big jump. When I use the Merge Wizard and I review my labels I am getting something weird. I have 116 names and addresses in the excel spreadsheet I am using.
 When I update all labels in the merge I am getting 116 pages. The first page prints the first name from the spreadsheet first and then names from the next 29 rows (rows 1-30). My Avery sheet has 30 labels per page. But the second sheet in the merge has the
 second name first and then the names from rows 3-31. The third page rows 3-32, and so on until one name is one page 116. I can't figure out what to do to fix this. Help please.

    <title>Problem Downloading app on Nokia Lumia520 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem Downloading app on Nokia Lumia520</h2>
                    <p>I need to download a Lewei drone X Pro app from the Microsoft store on my Nokia cell phone.&nbsp; When I find the app showing on the Nokia, I login to my account.&nbsp; Then I am asked where to install it with the only options provided are two of my PCs.&nbsp; My Microsoft
 account lists the Nokia phone but when I select on the Nokia to list other alternatives than the PCs, no Nokia is provided as an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do to include the Nokia as an alternative installation device to install the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>So you initially indicated you wanted to install the "<span>Lewei drone X Pro app from the Microsoft store". I believe it is "Le Wei" and I did a search on my phone (950XL) and found two which appear to be the same. I did install one and it did
 install. See the screenshots below to see the name of each.</span></p>

<p>93tid is probably correct John as much as I hate to admit it. They are not making any new ones and support is slowly dwindling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>So as soon as I read your post I went to the store on my 950XL and both apps were there as seen by my screenshot below:</p>

            <p>Yeah...maybe someone else should help you.</p>
<p><strong>If I have a text box with 'words' in that text box and I select any of those 'words' I can insert a hyperlink.</strong>
</p>
<p>I admit I don't see the difference, but I will bow out and let someone else who understands the difference in how you are using "words" and 'active hyperlink' as you don't seem to be willing to explain. Good luck...color me done.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
1. Were there any changes( hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div>2. Does the issue occur only with Internet explorer? </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong> : Perform the steps from the article mentioned below and check whether the issue persists.
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303091</a>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2 </strong>: Create a new user account and check if the issue occurs,if the issue does not occur in the new user account then you can fix the corrupted user account.<br />

<p>Bear in mind that changing form S60 3rd FP1 to S60 3rd FP2 device. I only remember on one occasion taking microSD from one S60 3rd FP1 device and transferring to another similar S60 3rd FP1 one where applications pre-installed on memory card worked. You
 may well have to re-install them in your situation unfortunately.</p>

Seems like I just have 1 issue. I downloaded the ISO from Insider Advanced and installed it. I'm signed in and have tried everything I can think of.
<br />
<br />
Sign in, sign out. <br />
<br />
Ran <br />

"sfc /scannow"&nbsp;<br />

Reset all settings to default. Turned off updates and BITS. Turned them back on. <br />
<br />
Ran <br />
<br />
"rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN"&nbsp;<br />

Even tried <br />

            I have clicked it. No response. Admin acct is logged in under activation. Still using default theme. No store corruption. No issues found with sfc scan. I cannot seem to find anything being wrong. Signed in on a local acct, still the same. I have even
 removed the admin acct and readded it. Nothing seems to help.

<h2>            Audio Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was teaching a class today via Skype. I played an audio file, but the person on the other end could not hear it. I had headphones on. I tried getting into my settings at the time and it wouldn't let me click on anything regarding "audio." He could hear
 me just fine. It is when I tried to play an audio track that he could not hear it. This may be a really easy fix but I don't know what to do. Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Lost all local Word documents on 365 for iPad - help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottfdickson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost all local Word documents on 365 for iPad - help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have just gone into Word for iPad on my 365 subscription. I was asked to sign in, which I though was odd. I have not done anything odd to my iPad, like restoring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed in and all of my documents, saved locally, have disappeared. I tended to save docs locally to the iPad rather than to the cloud drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where have all my docs gone? The last time I used Word on iPad was a couple of weeks ago and all my docs were there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I tried to post to the Microsoft tech support but gave up because the serial number finding options did not cover the iPad version. Makes we wonder if Microsoft is really interested in the iPad products.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have had exactly the same experience. &nbsp;I restored my new iPadAir from my old iPad2 and upgraded the App. &nbsp;When I opened it - nothing! &nbsp;The iCloud back up boxes are all ticked but nothing. &nbsp;I looked at my old iPad to see how to transfer them but like you
 it prompted my account details and then no documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft 'Engineer's' comments are not at all helpful. &nbsp;Surprised he didn't ask if there was anything else he could help you with! &nbsp;My Apple support sub ran out last August - it costs £25 a time to call them.</p>

            <p>Hi Dudley,</p>
<p>I'm sorry for your experience. Please try the following approach and see if those files can be recovered.</p>
<p>1) Can you see the documents inside the 'Recent' tab on your iPhone/iPad?</p>
<p>2) Have you attempted to use any backup recovery app? For example, using iExplorer(on both Mac and Windows) you can access to the app container, then you can see a Document folder underneath that which stores all your local files. If you haven't reset the
 app, chances are you may find it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference, I would strongly recommend you to store files to the cloud. Not only because they can be easily recovered, you can also exploit other advanced features such as roamed recent(files stored to cloud will show up in the Recent tab for your
 Windows/Mac/iPhone/Android apps) and better collaboration experience.</p>

            Yes this is possible in the N70 :) You may find that the MP3 file has to be stored in the directory E:\Sounds\Digital but other than that it should work no problem.<br />

            They are very similar. The most obvious difference is the user interface. The 2013 ribbon has been "dumbed down", it uses fewer colors and shades than earlier versions.<br />
<br />
Whether you go 2010 or 2013 really depends on your context. If you are working with others, say in a company, you may want to go with the same version they have.&nbsp;
<br />

How many machines do you want to use your license to install with? 2010 "retail" (one-time purchase price) license allows 2 computers, 2013 allows only 1.&nbsp; But 2013 / 365 rental license allows you to install on up to 5 (one article I read calculated the "break
 even point is using it on at least 4 machines).<br />

Microsoft execs aren't yet ready to talk Office 15 packaging or pricing specifics. In fact, there are lots of specifics about all the different components of the next Office release that won't be disclosed in full today at the San Francisco Office 15 unveiling.
 Little will be shared on July 16 about the new <span>Office Marketplace, for example, officials told me, though they will be discussing the
</span><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-office-15-whats-an-agave/12459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 1, 1)">Office 15 add-ons codenamed "Agaves,"</span></a><span> and now known officially as

 details on all the apps and services through August and into the fall, Kapner said.</span></p>
<p>
Microsoft also won't be talking delivery dates today. But my sources -- who were right about the public beta of Office 15 hitting in July -- have said Microsoft's goal remains to release to manufacturing the final Office 15 client, servers and services before
 the end of calendar 2012, possibly around November.</p>

On the usefulness front, you can now import a PDF directly into Word, edit it as a Word doc, and then save it as either a Word doc or a PDF. Not only do imported files retain all of the original documents' formatting--including headers, columns, and footnotes--but
 elements such as tables and graphics can be edited in Word as such.</p>
<p>
When you're collaborating with other people on a document, being able to track the changes that each person makes is critical. This becomes much easier to do in Word 2013, thanks to a new feature called simple markup view.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/259287/microsoft_word_2013_hands_on.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/259287/microsoft_word_2013_hands_on.html</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
Normally when I fire up Word, it just opens a blank document, but Word 2013 it takes you to a landing page. The page is similar to what you'd see in Word 2010 if you start a new document from a template: In a pane on the right, it hosts various thumbnail images
 illustrating the different templates; and in a smaller pane on the left, it lets you select from recent Word documents or open other existing files.</p>
<p>
Microsoft is pushing users strongly to work with the cloud. Win8 encourages users to log in with a Microsoft ID, as opposed to a local Windows account; the ID connects you to your
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/257173/sync_any_folder_to_your_skydrive_account.html?tk=rel_news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
associated SkyDrive storage</a>, and enables your Microsoft programs to sync settings and information. In Word 2013, you can choose to save files locally--or wherever you want--but SkyDrive is the default storage location.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/first-look-microsoft-office-2013-197802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/first-look-microsoft-office-2013-197802</a></p>
<div>
<p>
The Status Bar at the bottom of each Office app has been restyled to match the general Metro look of the suite. Not bad, but as is often the case with Microsoft products, some familiar elements have been arbitrarily yanked. The shortcut to Draft mode in Word,
 for instance, isn't there anymore. This was annoying for me since I use Draft mode constantly with most documents.</p>
<p>
When you switch to the File tab and elect to open a document, you're given not only a list of recently opened documents but a list of locations (folders, network paths) where documents were recently opened. For someone like me, who's constantly squirrelling
 around in the same directories for different files, this is a godsend.</p>
<p>
the new Design tab is where all the document-theming controls live now. These used to be jammed into a subset of the Page Layout tab and were consequently hard to find.</p>
<p>
One widely touted feature in Word 2013 is the ability to open and edit PDFs -- which amounts to Word having a native filter that converts PDFs to Word documents. It's useful, but limited: The simpler the PDF, the more likely it is to survive the conversion
 with its formatting intact.</p>
<p>
I fed Word a few book-length PDFs just to see what would happen. They were mostly preserved, but certain kinds of formatting elements -- the positions of page breaks, the lengths of lines with tabs, and headers and footers -- were regularly mangled.</p>
<p>
In the run-up to Office 2013's preview release, speculation flew fast and far about how much the new Office would be beholden to Win8. Most widely argued was whether or not the suite would be Metro-centric, or at least have certain elements deployed on top
 of Metro.</p>
<p>
Microsoft decided not to go that route, and the reasons seem twofold. One, all signs hint that Win8 is not going to displace the existing market for Win7; instead, the two OSes will sell side by side (shades of Windows XP and Windows Vista). This means making
 any significant amount of Office functionality Metro-only would be a mistake.</p>
<p>
Two, Metro is an environment designed for what others have called "lean-back mode." It's a consumption environment, not a production one.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Microsoft has given Office 2013 a Metro-style makeover without making it an actual Metro app. The word "Metro" doesn't even appear in the reviewer's guide handed out for testers of the beta. Microsoft also added a few key touch-centric features --
 again, just enough to make Office useful on a touch system without forcing people to rely on it.</p>

Office 2013 Public Preview: Office On Demand</p>
<div>
<p>
you can trigger a web-based install of Office 2013 and start using any one of the applications in under two minutes? It sounds incredible, I know. But it’s true.</p>
<p>
The key to this engineering feat is a new feature called Office On Demand. It’s really an improved version of the Click-To-Run technologies Microsoft employed in Office 2010, and like Click-To-Run, it uses Microsoft virtualization, “computer within a computer”,
<span>&nbsp;</span>technologies and Internet streaming to blast Office onto your PC at speeds that will leave your head spinning.</p>

    <title>Office Lens no longer able to save PDFs to OneDrive, but clearly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office Lens no longer able to save PDFs to OneDrive, but clearly states it does</h2>
                    <p>The email address Microsoft agents pointed me to in order to get help does not even work, only returning an error message (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office Lens version 16.0.11601.20080 for Android on a Samsung Galaxy S8 along with my OneDrive account under *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Office Lens for years now without issue up until now.&nbsp; I would always scan in Document mode, save it as a pdf to my OneDrive, and it would automatically put it in Files/Documents/Office Lens as a PDF.&nbsp; Easy, quick, efficient.&nbsp; Further,
 within Office Lens even now, under Settings/Help and Support it states "Photos saved as Word files, PowerPoint files, or PDFs will be in your Documents folder in OneDrive".&nbsp; Note clearly:&nbsp; "PDFs will be in your Documents folder in OneDrive".&nbsp; This is exactly
 how it USED to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone bricked and I recently got it repaired.&nbsp; After setting things up and trying to use Office Lens, there is no option to select how to save a file, only where to save it.&nbsp; When I select OneDrive, as I ALWAYS had in the past, it now instead saves a
 JPG in a new folder at Files/Pictures in my OneDrive.&nbsp; It does not save it as a pdf, it does not save it in Documents, it does not follow what it literally says it will do in the Help and Support section.&nbsp; The only way I can figure out how to get it to save
 as a PDF is to select the option to save it locally as a PDF, then email it to myself, then move it to my OneDrive&nbsp; which is obviously absurd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Lens worked properly before, but now not only does it not work as before, is doesn't even follow the statements in the Help and Support section.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft and was transferred around to 4 departments of over an hour this morning, everyone saying it's not their job.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what's going on with this?&nbsp; Next step I'll try to find an old apk to install to negate Microsofts "updates".</p>

            I scanned the qr code and it said 'share' . I already have it installed. Unsure of what else to do as I don't think a reset will make any difference. I have not heard of anyone else with this problem. I definitely have the 1308 update. I can only hope
 that if there is another update it will fix this before I run out of memory as the free storage shrink apps do not work

Since the release of Windows 8, many of these editions have been consolidated to more specific devices and form factors. In addition to SKUs, Microsoft also provides Windows specific architectures that target the CPU (brains of your computer) in what are known as 32 and 64 bit versions. The capability is determined specifically by how much memory your computer is able to address. The more memory, the more programs you can run and the more tasks you can complete at the same time.

</p><p>So, to be on the safe side, its best you ensure you have a valid genuine Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 license installed in order to qualify for the final release. Company officials have noted though if you join the

<h3> azertyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronize 2 Tables &#58; update the calculated Table when the source data Table is updated</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a simply question even though I didn´t find the answer anywhere :</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a large Table containing the source data (table 1 : 45000 lines 30 columns). From this Table, I made a smaller Table ("table 2") containing only 2 columns (equal to 2 columns from "table 1") +10 calculated columns. The aim is to use this smaller "table
 2" as a basis for a pivot chart. (then pivot chart extend automatically when data are added to the Table).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-&gt; How can I synchronize "table 2" with "table 1" so that when data are added to the source data table 1 , "table 2" extends automatically ?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pivot tables with calculated columns don´t work because calculations are too complex and I can´t add my calculated columns to the source data Table because this Table is also used by other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea ? It would be super great..! I´m running out of inspiration !</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance, have a nice day</p>

            <p>If you decide to play around with the VBA solution, the code below will get you started.&nbsp; For this example, I assume you have "Table1" on "Sheet1" and "Table2" on "Sheet2" - change those names in the code to match reality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two parts to the code.&nbsp; The first part uses what is known as a Worksheet Event to determine when "Table1" changes in some way.&nbsp; The code below checks to see if the number of rows of data is different between "Table1" and "Table2".&nbsp; If so, then
 the number of rows in "Table2" is adjusted to match "Table1".&nbsp; If you set "Table2" up correctly, and you add rows to it, Excel has a neat trick - it will automatically extend any formulas you have in the Table's cells to the new rows.&nbsp; The second part of the
 code is the routine that updates the size of "Table2".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the code below, right-click on the "Sheet1" tab (or whatever your worksheet with "Table1" is named)&nbsp;and select "View Code".&nbsp; Paste the code below into the window that appears.&nbsp; Save the file as a ".xlsm" file.&nbsp; Now try making changes to "Table1".&nbsp;
 Then go look at "Table2".&nbsp; It should automatically adjust to those changes.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion would be to maintain just your source data source and create a Pivot chart directly from there thereby obviating the necessity to maintain another table.&nbsp; If your formulas are complicated and you think they cannot be accommodated in the Pivot
 Table, then may be we can write those formulas in the Power Pivot instead (a free add-in for MS Excel 2010 and higher versions).</p>

<h2>            Office Mac 2011 Serial Identification</h2>
                    I had Office 2011 Home &amp; Student for Mac which is valid for three machines. I have three Macs, each with Office installed and working. My problem is that one of the machines was installed using a previous single machine license I had. I now want to have
 all machines using the triple machine license but can't remember which one used the old serial.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know you can't (easily) extract the serial code to find which one was used, but is there some other way to identify it? For instance with the Product ID or something similar.&nbsp;</div>

            The simplest solution is to remove the license file from all the machines and re-enter the license on each.
<div><br />
<div>Locate this file: /Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.office.licensing.plist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Move it to the Trash (do not empty the Trash yet) and restart your Mac.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Launch any Office for Mac application. You should be prompted to enter your license. Once you've done this for each machine then you can empty the Trash.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

</p><p>Microsoft Content is a pre-installed option that can be seen from background apps, which is actually part of the phone's software functionality. There's not much told about it specifically, but we would suggest not touching it.
</p>
<p>To free up or improve your phone's memory, here's what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear Edge's Cache and Browsing history.</li><li>Save/back up files to OneDrive.</li><li>If not used, uninstall Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps.</li><li>Get an SD card with higher storage capacity.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it works.</p>

    <title>How can I delete a Skype account that shares the same e-mail address - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I delete a Skype account that shares the same e-mail address with another Skype account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I re-installed Skype in my computer (Windows 10), it created automatically my Skype account based on my Microsoft e-mail address.</p>
<p>But I already had another Skype account linked to that same address.&nbsp;<span>Since the account delete process is linked to the e-mail address.</span></p>
<p>Can I delete the recent account without affecting the oldest one?&nbsp;</p>

            Since Skype is now part of Microsoft product, deleting Skype account will be the same with deleting a Microsoft account. If you haven’t updated or migrated the Skype account you want to delete to a Microsoft account, then you will need to go through it before deleting the account. You may use a different Microsoft account (Dummy email address) if you don’t want your Microsoft account to be deleted. However, if it’s already updated to a Microsoft then there’s no option to unmerge it and it will delete the Microsoft account as well.
