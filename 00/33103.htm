                    I have an ACER Model G185H monitor that is attached to my Laptop Win 7 and I use as the second monitor and it works well.&nbsp; I recently purchased a Laptop Win 10.&nbsp; The same ACER monitor is not detected by Win 10 Laptop.&nbsp; The monitor says "Cable is not connected"
 when in fact the cable is firmly in place.&nbsp; Please provide solution.&nbsp; Thank You

            Hi Kami.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Make sure you follow this setup how-to:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-connect-and-set-multiple-monitors-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-connect-and-...</a>
<br />
<br />See here for second monitor not detected:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-your-second-monitor-not-being-detected-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-your-sec...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-cannot-detect-second-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-canno...</a>
<br /> <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt-detects-second-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in Device Manager if the second monitor has a driver and if not open and on Driver tab choose to Update driver Automatically.  This queries Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 Game DVR crashes computer. &#36;Thread stuck in device driver&#36;</h2>
                    <p>Just what the title says. Almost any game I try to record using Game DVR crashes my computer with the "Thread stuck in device driver" Error report. I used to be able to record just fine and I'm&nbsp;not sure what happened. I also tried updating drivers but that still didn't&nbsp;work.</p><p><br />I'm&nbsp;not sure what to do about fixing this or if its' even possible. I can live without it but its' nice to be able to use that feature. :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 shuts down on random then restarts to a &#34;Recovery&#58; It looks like Windows could not load properly.&#34; screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Dell laptop, Inspiron 15 5576 I believe. I got this computer for Christmas and three days after first turning it on, it froze completely and forced me to hard restart, where I then had to wait four restarts as it had trouble booting up and gave
 me the ":(" screen each time. Three days later, it happens again, then the day after that. I gave in and did a factory reset, which DID fix the problem for about two weeks. Being careful, I decided to wait that long before reinstalling my Steam games. After
 installing one and playing it, the issue returned. Now it no longer freezes, but shuts off completely on random and restarts in a similar fashion, taking me to the Recovery screen. Instead of choosing the repair option, I go with "Continue to Windows 10",
 which saves me the hassle of it restarting multiple times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been told many things: It could be my motherboard, my memory, or Windows 10 itself. I'm sick of the issue and don't know what to do as it is far too late to return it to the store I bought it from and work out an exchange. Considering how new this computer
 is, it should not be having these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing power settings to never sleep as suggested by some online threads, but it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ANYONE has had the same issue as me and knows a solution, please, PLEASE respond as soon as possible!</p>

<p>Hi Radney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding quickly. I don’t know what I am looking for when I go to troubleshoot, that is the problem I am having. I don’t know what is causing the issues to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I performed a clean boot, didnt know what to troubleshoot, so I continued the restore process and restarted again. I’ll post an update if the issue happens again.</p>

            <p>Hi htpoutlet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, we are limited in what we can do to help with lost or forgotten passwords by Microsoft Policy that applies to everyone who answers questions here on penalty of being banned from the Forum.</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189126</span></a><span>.<span>
</span>But there are some options to try:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you have another Administrator account where you know the password that you can login to make the password changes to this account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, make sure that you don't have the CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK keys activated - this can change what you think you are typing into something else (different case or a number versus a letter) and cause the system to see what you entered as being wrong.
 Try using a blank for the password.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Second, if you have another keyboard you can use with the computer, try doing that. It may be that one of the characters in your password is not working properly on the keyboard or the keyboard is inserting extra spaces or something else that's making
 what you think you are entering not be what you are actually entering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Third, see if a System Restore can resolve the problem per instructions in:</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can enable the built-in Administrator account in Safe Mode, but this will work only if there is no administrator account on the system (in which case one can access the built-in Administrator account through Safe Mode) or you know the Administrator
 password. Try a blank as many who setup computers disable this account and use no password (to prevent this very thing). If there is more than one administrator account on the system, you can use one account to fix problems with the other one or even create
 an entire new profile if required for that account. If you have only one Administrator account on the system and it is the account with the password problems and the above didn't help, then you have a serious problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, if that doesn't work in this situation the only option we can suggest is to restore the system to factory conditions (or do a clean install). Though too late for this time, next time create more than one Administrator account so you
 have a backup in case something like this occurs again. A clean install will create a new Administrator account. Use it to make a few backups to prevent this from happening again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hopefully, you've been doing full backups and not complete image backups because if you've been doing images, they will retain the lost password information during a restore and will not resolve the problem AND trying to recover just the data from
 an image backup is challenging to say the least (if it can even be done depending on the software and method used). If you only have an image backup, then the best bet is to backup the data manually as follows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can use Knoppix </span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span> with a good ISO copier like:</span><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a></span><span>
 along with a blank CD. Boot to the CD. This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way - but if you have another account on the system this disk may not be necessary - I'm not 100% sure if you can make a backup as a standard
 user - if not, then you will need to use the disk because while you could copy/paste, you won't have access to everything you want to save whereas that won't be an issue if using the disk) to backup your important data. If using the disk, you won't be able
 to backup to disks unless you have a second CD/DVD drive, so you'll need to consider where you are going to backup to - depending on how much data you have, perhaps an external USB HDD or maybe a high capacity flash drive or even an external CD/DVD burner.
 If that doesn’t work, try slaving the drive to another computer and recovering the data using that other computer to access the disk (in which case you can perhaps backup to that computer's drives if there is enough room and you have a way to access them once
 your computer is up and running). You may need to play a bit with permissions.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Installation Disk or the Manufacturer's Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps since you don't have the disks and can't make
 them, to get recovery disks which will be quite a bit less expensive than buying a new retail product if you can even find one these days - though more than just shipping and handling).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with many updates pending,... You may also need to re-activate the product
 (it depends on the method used, the Recovery Disks sometimes but not always automatically take care of it - if using an Installation Disk, you will definitely need to re-activate).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once this is complete (or rather, during the process), you will create an Administrator account. Although the password should be safe and secure (the best is at least 8 digits using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols)
 but at the same time easy for you to remember (you don't want this to happen again). Soon after you are up and running, create a standard user account for daily use and another administrator account or two for backup and emergencies (to try to prevent this
 from occurring again by having some alternatives - and it's also good in case something happens to your administrator account like corruption (then you have backup administrator accounts to repair the problem, or again you may be in the same boat as here but
 for a different reason).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice given to anyone who has any phone calls like this about Malware, License Expiry, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have errors and warnings&nbsp;in our event viewer, which is another ploy they use to scare you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You ran a Program&nbsp;on your Computer which found errors, but you do not say if you gave them Remote Access to run it or if it was a command&nbsp;you used..</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>

<p>I did not give them remote access fortunately. The caller just told me to hit the window and r key gave me a code that brought me to a popup that said I had a lot of errors on my computer. That was all that was done. Hopefully nothing to harmful and I reset
 my PC to hopefully deal with any issues.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Xbox 360-Version - Upgrade auf die One-Version</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hallo, der Support hat keine offiziellen Informationen dazu, dass Minecraft 360 Version Käufer das SPiel auf die One für 5€ kriegen, bei mir wird nämlich nur noch 18,99€ angezeigt. Aber hier ein Video
 von dem offiziellen XBOX YouTube Kanal, dort wird es gezeigt:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbddTrt0i_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbddTrt0i_c</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/qbddTrt0i_c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/qbddTrt0i_c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></span></p>
<p><span>Da der Support ja nur die xbox.com Seite öffnen kann.</span></p>
<p><span>Und hier ein Link zu der offiziellen Mojang Seite, die es auch released hat:&nbsp;<a href="https://mojang.com/2014/09/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-now-available-hoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mojang.com/2014/09/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-now-available-hoo/</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Könnt wenigstens Ihr mir weiter helfen? Wurde hier in das Forum verwiesen.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>das war wohl ein zeitlich begrenztes Angebot das Ende letzten Jahres endete. Warum sie das nicht dauerhaft anbieten, kann ich aber auch nicht ganz nachvollziehen !</p>
<p>Übrigens, wenn dich der Telefon Support an das Forum verweist, dann ist damit das
offizielle Support Forum gemeint. In den regionalen Foren sind nur Spieler wie du und ich unterwegs, die versuchen sich gegenseitig zu helfen.</p>
<p>Du könntest das ja dort mal nachfragen, warum sie das nicht dauerhaft anbieten und auf das offizielle Video verweisen. Dort sollte man allerdings auf englisch schreiben. Ich denke, daß das
Unterforum 08 das richtige ist. Viel Glück !</p>

<p>Das Angebot war (meines Wissens nach) nur ein zeitlich begrenztes Angebot. Besitzer der 360 Version konnten bis (glaube ich) März 2015 die One Version für 4,99€ kaufen.
</p>
<p>Das Angebot ist also leider ausgelaufen, und du müsstest den vollen Preis zahlen.
</p>
<p>Die Seite hat damals automatisch erkannt, ob es Dir erlaubt ist, den vergünstigten Preis zu zahlen. Dazu musstest Du entweder mit demselben Account das 360er Minecraft digital gekauft haben, oder bis zu einem bestimmten Stichtag die Disc Version online gespielt
 haben. </p>
<p>Wenn diese Bedinungen zutreffen (Aktion noch nicht abgelaufen, Spiel digital gekauft oder zumindest vor einem Stichtag online gespielt), hast Du für diesen Account das Spiel eben günstiger bekommen.</p>

            Are you saying, the Cruzer Blade 8 GB is encrypted by BitLocker and thats where you stored the 48-digit key ID? 
<br />
<br />If thats the case, I'm sorry to tell you, but will have to format that drive in order to make it usable again if you can't remember the password. 
<br />
<br />Or are you saying the 48 digit key is on it and you want to known how to unlock your computer using it?
<br />
<br />If thats the case, you need to plug it in before you start the computer.

This is a very common bugcheck.&nbsp; Usually the exception address pinpoints<br />
the driver/function that caused the problem.&nbsp; Always note this address<br />
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.<br />
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.&nbsp; This means a hard<br />
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted<br />
/NODEBUG.&nbsp; This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have<br />
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...<br />
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the<br />
system is booted /DEBUG.&nbsp; This will let us see why this breakpoint is<br />
happening.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: ffffffffc0000005, The exception code that was not handled<br />
Arg2: fffff8800678961a, The address that the exception occurred at<br />

    <title>Do I have to Reinstall Windows 7 if I put a new motherboard in my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredwada  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I have to Reinstall Windows 7 if I put a new motherboard in my desktop.</h2>
                    I recently bought a new motherboard and I installed it just fine...My Windows 7 will start to launch but then fail, then blue screen, then reboot..I have tried many things including a factory reset on my boot drive and system restore and still can't get
 it working. The only thing I haven't tried is reinstalling my Windows 7.. I would have tried that but when I bought my computer it didn't come with an installer disk. Please Help.<br />
<br />
Additional Information: if I put my old mother board back in, Windows launches just fine and everything works perfect. I bought my computer at Sam's Club, and it came as an all in one.(as in Desktop,Monitor, Keyboard,Mouse,ect.)<br />
Specs:<br />
CPU: AMD Athlon II X4 quad core. Clock: 2.900<br />
New Motherboard: GIGABYTE 990XA-UD3<br />
Graphics Card: Nvidia EVGA GeForce GT 520<br />
Ram: 12Gbs Corsair <br />

<p><span>Windows is not designed to be moved from one motherboard to another. Sometimes you can simply change motherboards and start the computer, but others you have to reinstall Windows when
 you replace the motherboard (unless you buy the exact same model motherboard). You will also need to reactivate after the reinstall.

            You have not given the model number for your computer. You can search for your model number on HP site and see its BIOS update. Download from there and update and then update.

<br />Most probably this would be the link.

<br />To see whether you are on 0.45 version of BIOS or not

<h2>            NO CONSIGO LOS LOGROS DE HALO&#58; REACH</h2>
                    
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-7.gif" />Tengo un problema: Cuando me conecte por primera vez a LIVE en REACH me pidio que entregara 40,000 Cr (aproximadamente) y me bajaron mi rango. Al jugar LIVE todo iba bien hasta que
 me desconecte de LIVE, pero cuando me desconecte y empeze a jugar la campaña me empezaron a dar 50 Cr por cada mision de la campaña.
</p>
<p>Y Ademas no me dan los logros de la campaña este o no este conectadoa LIVE.</p>
<p>Aunque lo de los Cr en campaña no me preocupan, me preocupa no recibir los logros de la campaña (me refiero a los de :limpieza total, no pisar vehiculos en la segunda mision, destruir los motores de la nave en&nbsp; menos de 3 min., entre otros.)</p>
<p>¿Alguien sabe por ue me paso eso?</p>

<h2>            How do I format DVD for Creating a Windows 10 Meadia Creation disc&#63;</h2>
                    I know I have to format a DVD with a GPT Partition Scheme and FAT32 File System in order to burn a Windows 10 Media Creation disc that will work without error. I have tried Rufus 2.11 and EaseUS Partition Master Pro 11.5, but neither one finds the CD/DVD
 Burner Device. **** clue where to go from here.

            <p>If you use Media Creation Tool and Windows 10 and just burn to DVD you do not have to format as the burning program does all that is needed.</p>
<p>The Far32 and Rufus are only for the bootable USB stick.</p>
<p>When you do the download of the ISO and then want to do a DVD just insert a blank DVD into the drive and follow the instructions to burn the DVD.</p>
<p>Note the bootable media saves nothing on your System (C:) drive.</p>

    <title>Worst experience with xbox support EVER - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the scrappy88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst experience with xbox support EVER</h2>
                    
<p>Just wanted to post to tell everyone how terrible this experience with xbox has been.</p>
<p>1st let me start by saying all I wanted to do was renew my xbox gold. I had an icon come up on my xbox saying your gold is going to expire so I clicked it and it says renew now. So I clicked that and it offers 1 month for $1 3 months for $24.99 and 12 for
 $59.99. So I'm like 1 month for $1 good deal! So I click it and after clicking my card it says something went wrong. I'm like hmm. Try the other 2 options it says something went wrong... hmmm. So I forget it for now. And bought the new star wars movie and
 watched it with the kids. A few days later I decide to try again. Something went wrong. Gave up and went to walmart. Bought 7 months for 34.99 pre paid. Tried to enter the code, Something went wrong. Try the Web site 1 month for $1 option there too. Something
 went wrong. Other 2 options, Something went wrong. Pre paid card, something went wrong. At this point it was Friday last week and I decide to call xbox support. 1st lady says that 1 month offer is expired? Now 1st thing why is it on the Web site and the xbox
 and how about the other options or the card? She says oh you can't stack subscriptions. Huh? In 7 years that's the 1st I've heard of that. So I ask to speak with her supervisor. She puts me on hold and gets her. Supervisor says the same 2 lame excuses in which
 I ask to speak with HER supervisor. After a 20 min wait she comes back and says they are in a meeting and will call me back within the day. So Monday rolls around still no call. I decide then I'm going to call them back. 1st lady refuses to let me speak with
 a supervisor and hangs up on me. 30 min in line to wait for 2 guy ( best employee they have by far) asks if he can try a few things in which I say sure. 1 hour in still can't figure it out. I say ok man thanks can I have a supervisor now he says yes sir. 2
 hours later on the phone with the same guy (3 hours now on the same call) we finally get a supervisor. 2 hours just waiting for a supervisor after an hour of troubleshooting! At this point I am very angry but had to first praise the ONLY guy at Microsoft who
 at least tried to fix my problem. Then spent 45 min with the supervisor who still couldn't figure it out. So he says looks like an account issue I'm going to get someone on it right away and I will personally call you back! My reply was what happens when you
 don't call me back. He says there is no when I dont. I promise I will PERSONALLY &nbsp;call you back. So earlier today I was working and my phone rings. Not the supervisor though a regular CSR who then says I know the problem you have to wait until your current
 subscription expires or we can cancel it now instead of the 19th and renew it now and I will give you a free month for your troubles. ?? A free month? I would lose 14 days and you would give me a month? I then explain to this guy I don't want his free 16 days!
 I want this fixed and I want to speak with his supervisor! I was lied to AGAIN! So he says his supervisor will call me in an hour. No he didnt. So I call back after I get off 5 hours later and speak with ANOTHER supervisor who says the guy who called me is
 right. Only he wants to give me an extra month for my troubles. ?? DOES MICROSOFT REALLY THING A MONTH AND A HALF OF LIVE ( like a 15 dollar value) MAKES UP FOR ALL THESE PROBLEMS? I told the guy I don't want his free stuff. I want to have not had to deal
 with this in beginning! I just wanted to post and share this with everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, BaseSquid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only ones who can help in your situation are the xbox support team, you need to contact them directly and inform them that your account has become compromised. They should then lock your account pending an investigation and after securing your account
 will provide you with details on how to recover it. Please be patient as the investigation could take some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope it gets sorted ASAP. Good luck!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi BassSquid,</p>
<p>With regards to what the support team mention you. If they say that they will lock the account, they will lock it. But the thing there is, they will lock it and prevent it from any purchases or redeeming codes. They don't have a way to fully lock the account
 to be unusable because if they do that, they have nothing to investigate if they can't monitor the usage of the account itself.</p>
<p>But I hope they can wrap everything up sooner the better so you could gain back your account.</p>

<h2>            cannot run a program</h2>
                    hi, <br />
I'm trying to run Adobe Photoshop CS3 on windows 7 but it doesn't allow me. It says "Adobe Photoshop CS3 has stopped working" " A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."<br />
I have try&nbsp;all compatibility options on properties but still doesn't want to run. I was running this program on a windows xp on an old computer and i passed the Adobe Photoshop to a flash drive and then i dragged it and dropped it to the desktop of my new computer
 with windows 7 OS. Please any help...

            You can't install a program by copying its program folder to a new computer. I assume that's what you mean by "passed the Adobe Photoshop to a flash drive". You need to install Photoshop CS3 (after first checking with Adobe to make sure that version is
 supported) from its installation CD or from an installable executable downloaded from the Internet.

            Please note that the free upgrade offer has ended officially and unofficially-So you would have to most probably pay for a license.
<br />As far as time is concerned, there is no timeout error in Media creation tool though I suggest downloading the ISO once and then upgrade offline.
<br /> You can use any of:
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the two methods:

<p>Note: Windows 7 Ultimate and it has the license.</p>

            Apparently, even though Microsoft says it has expired, users have still managed to upgrade to Windows 10 from activated Windows 7 and Windows 8 licenses and have it activated.

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Starting the Upgrade
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:

<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One installiert saubere CD nicht&#33; &#40;Fehlercode&#58; 0x87e00064&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hallo,</strong></p>

<p>ich habe mir vor ein paar Monaten das Spiel : <em>"Battlefield Hardline"&nbsp;</em> gekauft. Nach vielen Spielstunden, musste ich jedoch es jedoch deinstallieren, weil ich meinen Speicher für Gta V gebraucht habe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jetzt wollte ich wieder Battlefield Hardline spielen, und hab das Spiel eingelegt, jedoch bricht die Installation bei 31 % ab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Es erscheint die Fehlermeldung :<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">0x87e00064&nbsp;</span>(Möglicherweise ist die CD zerkratzt oder verschmutzt).</p>
<p>Die CD ist aber sauber, und hat keine Kratzer.</p>
<p>Ich habe die Xbox schon auf die Werkseinstellungen getan, es hat aber nichts gebracht. Auch Offline und mir der Blu-ray-App habe ich es versucht.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wisst ihr vielleicht eine Lösung ? :/</p>
<p><em>Lg. Kevin H.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Was bei mir auch bei "Phantomstaub" oder "Phantomfingerabdrücken" (wie ich das nenne) hilft, wenn meine Dreamcast meine pfleglich behandelten, und eigentlich sauberen Discs nicht liest:</p>
<p>Die Disc mit der silbernen Seite kurz unter handwarmes, laufendes Wasser halten. Dann mit einem Tropfen MILDEN Spülmittel die silberne Seite spiralförmig mit nassen Fingern und LEICHTEM Druck einseifen.
</p>
<p>Das Spülmittel wieder mit reichlich handwarmem Wasser abspülen.</p>
<p>Mit einem fusselfreien weichen Tuch von dem mittleren Loch nach außen hin die Disc trocken reiben.
</p>
<p>Dann die Disc nochmal probieren. </p>

<p>Was Du eventuell mal versuchen könntest:</p>
<p>Trenne die Xbox Konsole vom Internet (Netzwerkkabel ziehen, oder in den Netzwerkeinstellungen das WLAN trennen).
</p>
<p>Installiere dann das Spiel von Disc. </p>
<p>Falls das nichts bringt, musst Du Electronic Arts kontaktieren, und eine Austausch-Disc verlangen.
</p>
<p>Achtung! Gefährliches Halbwissen: Einige Publisher gewähren innerhalb 90 Tagen eine Garantie auf die Datenträger.
</p>
<p>Wenn der Datenträger oberflächlich betrachtet nicht defekt ist, tauscht EA den glaube ich kostenlos bzw. lediglich mit Kosten für Porto und Verpackung aus.
</p>
<p>Oder frag einen Freund, der das Spiel als Download gekauft hat, ob er zu Dir zu Besuch kommt, das Spiel installiert, und Du das Spiel dann mit Deiner Disc freischalten kannst.

<p>Abend, </p>
<p>ArminatorX, habe auch schon versucht das Spiel Offline zu installieren. </p>
<p>Ich war heute im Media Markt mit der CD, und habe gefragt ob ich diese in eine Xbox One legen dürfte. Habe das Spiel eingelegt, und nach einer halben Stunde war die Installation abgeschlossen. Es muss leider irgendwie an der Konsole liegen.
</p>
<p>Weißt du vielleicht was ich noch an der Xbox machen kann ? </p>

<p>Auf <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/article/electronic-arts-warranty-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
dieser EA Support Seite</a> heißt es, dass nutzer ausserhalb der USA und England in der Verpackung nach den Garantiebediungungen für den Datenträgeraustausch schauen müssen.</p>
<p><br />
Schau also mal entweder auf einem Blättchen in der Packung oder das Kleingedruckte auf der Rückseite des gedruckten Covers.

    <title>CPU Clock speed locked at 0.79GHz - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CPU Clock speed locked at 0.79GHz</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an i7-4500U CPU and for the last few months my system starts at full speed (2.39GHz) but as soon as the CPU goes below 30% utilisation after startup, the system locks the clock speed to 0.79GHz even when the fan is off.&nbsp; The CPU temperature is
 around the 50degree C mark, therefore should be allowing the processor to go up to full clock speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed the power settings to set the minimum clock speed to 50%, but that has made no difference.</p>

<p>For issue with CPU, it is better to check it with Intel first.</p>
<p>There is possibility that software you are using to check status of CPU is not showing correct result.</p>

            Hi MalcolmHide,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />Have you check for BIOS update on your manufacturer site?
<br />You can try to follow this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Processors" (CPUs)
<br />4. Right click on your intel i7-4500U
<br />5. Click on "Uninstall device"
<br />6. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon)
<br />7. Reboot your system.       
        </p>

<p>Hi, the software to detect CPU performance is windows task manager.&nbsp; It shouldn't be wrong as it replicates what I'm seeing.&nbsp; With the clock speed reduced, I'm getting a lot of lag in response to high demand activities such as large spreadsheet calculations
 and opening large files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the CPU temperature I'm using CPUID, which is usually a reasonable indicator.&nbsp; in most cases when it is showing the CPU is hot, the fan does turn on.</p>

<p>Hi Stefano, tried this and it didn't improve the situation. Tried looking for the speedstep control in the registry and could not find it.</p>

            Then I suggest you to look on your BIOS settings, if there are CPU limitations.. Also check on your motherboard manufacture's site if there are BIOS update
