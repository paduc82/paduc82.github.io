<h2>            Word 2003 how to remove all captions from a document</h2>
                    Created a Word 2003 document which includes text and multiple images. Somewhere along the way I did something wrong so that captions no longer match images/pages. It is a mess. &nbsp;Spent many hours trying to fix without success.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to remove all captions?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Kindly assist.&nbsp;</div>

Before you go to the extent of removing the captions, try pressing Ctrl+A and then F9 to update the fields in the document as that may correct things.</p>
<p>Failing that the captions are made up of SEQ fields so you could use the Select Browse Object (Ctrl+Alt+Home)&nbsp;utility at the Bottom or the scroll bar so that it browses by field {a} and then use the arrows to browse through the fields in the document.</p>
<p>As for creating a macro to remove the captions, exactly what is that you want removed? Everything?, the label? the number? the caption text?</p>

            Thank you, Mr. Robbins
<div><br />
<div>Some progress after following your suggestion (update fields). It realigned the captions. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I would like to remove "the label, the number"; leave the caption text, if that can be done.</div>
<div>Or, if that cannot be done without affecting captions, then remove captions.</div>

<h2>            screen background color in full screen view&#47;edit mode</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to implement a feature on Office 2010 for Windows which is found on Office for Mac 2011.&nbsp; In full screen mode (ie the document appears with only a tiny menu bar at top), in Office for Mac, I can choose from a variety of screen background colors
 and patterns, such as wood grain.&nbsp; In Office 2010 for Windows, the default is gray.&nbsp; Can't seem to find a way to change it.&nbsp; (I'm not referring to the background within the document, but the screen color or pattern on both sides of the document).&nbsp; Help!</p>

    <title>Updating MS Office - impossible&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Updating MS Office - impossible&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm still using Office 2010 which is pretty good - except that Outlook keeps crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started looking to update the Office version - and my findings are very unpleasant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> A desktop version ONLY.</strong>&nbsp; I NEVER use the Cloud, never have and never will. NEVER save anyting there.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; once it's in the Cloud it is effectively in the public domain regardles of all "security" measures.&nbsp; Just like there is no such
 a thing as private browsing or private email.&nbsp; Once it's out there - it is out there. If you believe it's safe and secure- good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong> The FULL suite of software:</strong> Word, Excel, Outlook, Publisher, PowerPoint, Access, Skype ( unless and I can keep using the one I already have installed).&nbsp; Don't care about OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <strong>One off payment</strong> - none of that "subsctiption" nonsense.&nbsp; I want to own it and use it for as long as I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. <strong>For 2 computers</strong> - my PC and my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. <strong>A sensible price </strong>(under AUD$200)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found out, unfortunately, is that MS is forcing everyone to get Office 365 by limiting the programs in the desktop version and to only 1 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So even if I get it for 1 PC (and keep using 2010 on my laptop),&nbsp; Office Personal 2016 (desktop) doesn't have Publisher (which I use extensively) or even Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rang MS Support to have my Outlook fixed, the agent suggested that I update to Offfice 365 and wanted me to do that straight away - but when I was probing him for more information about Office 2016 and how will the upgrade fix my corrupted Outlook
 profile, he was extremely coy about it.&nbsp; Now I know why.&nbsp; That's because there is NO OUTLOOK in Office 2016!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANd it also saves and edits files IN THE CLOUD only - which I will NEVER do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is my question to Microsoft - WHY are you so mean???&nbsp; Why can't I have a desktop ONLY version, with the full suite of programs?&nbsp; I'm so disgusted with your mean attitude that I'm seriously considering switching to MAC and Apple software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or I could upgrade to Office 2013&nbsp; for the time being - which is ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will NEVER see me saving or editing my documents in your CLoud storage - ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anyone in the MS community have any useful suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that you have misunderstood my message.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have Office 2010 (Professional Plus) and am seeking to upgrade to a higher version to fix the persistent Outlook issues and to have a newer version.&nbsp; With no suitable option for me with Office 2016, I will be getting Office 2013 which meets all
 my criteria.&nbsp; Not the&nbsp; current version - what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired Outlook many times, the issues keep coming back so will just get rid of it with the 2013 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointing that you haven't addressed my point of MS being mean by restrictng the 2016 desktop version.&nbsp; Not everyone is prepared to store all their personal data in the Cloud which is essentially a public domain that anyone can get access to&nbsp; (for those
 who still don't get it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I will get Office 2013 Professional Plus and will take it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

<p>An upgrade is extremely unlikely to fix a persistent OL crash you need to determine the cause.</p>
<p>Start off by running this MS Diagnostic Tool to see if it finds any critical problems.</p>

<p>365 is a subscription license type, that currently uses 2016 components, nothing "is in the cloud" unless you use OneDrive as your default doc save location.</p>
<p>Office 2016 various versions are available as lifetime license versions. Home &amp; Student versions do not include Outlook</p>

<p>thanks for the tip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and run the diagnostic tool which showed several issues, none about a corrupt profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It found however that I'm <strong>missing several updates</strong> for Outlook and Word which I have now downloaded - but this now begs another question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>how come these updates where not downloaded by my Window Updates? &nbsp; I always install all important updates&nbsp; so I didn't miss anythng.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many other important updates I could be missing?&nbsp; that's really of concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will see if Outlook has been fixed now - if not, I will have to buy Office 2013 from an online retailer as MS no longer offers it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to buy a license and have to renew it every 12 months.</p>
<p>

<p>Running the MS tool didn't help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS tech support via phone were unhelpful to say the least and clearly not sufficiently trained.&nbsp; The quality of the telephone line between Australia and your centre in Asia (the Phillipines or India?) is terrible (and has been for years) - impossible to
 hear and understand each other, especially that your agents there speak with a very heavy accent and have poor command of the English language.&nbsp; So communication with your Support Centre is a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out the process for creating a new Outloook profile which I successfully set up and which has solved the problem to about&nbsp; 95%. &nbsp; Still, every so often Outlook will crash or repeat some of that old bizarre behaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could it be caused by the
 OLD profile which I still have on my computer? Should I delete it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Now I have a different MS issue - with a particular (and important) Windows Update which has an error in it causing a fatal error on install and aborting it.&nbsp; So far I have spent several hours over the past week talking to MS support online trying to
 sort it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I am getting is a sledge hammer solution to kill a fly which I'm reluctant to implement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the fun with MS products never stops.</p>

<p>Hi, this is getting complicated.&nbsp; First you can purchase Office 2016 one-time-payment.&nbsp; You do not need to use OneDrive if you do not want to.&nbsp; You can purchase&nbsp; Office Home and Business 2016 (Which includes Outlook) or you can purchase Office Professional
 2016.&nbsp; See <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/store/b/office?invsrc=search&amp;OCID=AID620866_SEM_WhLZEwAAAHdCbCPY%3a20180119100245%3as&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4249!3!230547961404!e!!g!!microsoft+office+2016&amp;ef_id=WhLZEwAAAHdCbCPY%3a20180119100245%3as&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=tab:business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            PS: Not sure why you about storing your document 'in the cloud' OneDrive is just like storing you documents on a very&nbsp; large Microsoft Computer hard drive.&nbsp; It is definitely more secure than your computer.&nbsp; There are millions of documents stored there.&nbsp;
 Also, you can have your documents stored on your computer as well as linked to the same document on OneDrive.&nbsp; In other words OneDrive acts as a backup for your files as well as allowing you to access them on the move and from another computer.&nbsp;

    <title>MS Access-PDF File Generation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cami_123  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access-PDF File Generation</h2>
                    <p>I am working with MS Access to generate certain reports. The access db is synced with a SharePoint site. The reports are always generated in pdf format. But due to some reason, one of the reports is formed in xps format . As a result, the report is not available
 from the SharePoint link too.</p>
<p>I am able to see the xps report in the location where all pdf reports should be generated.
</p>
<p>Can you tell me the reason this might be happening and how to fix this?</p>

            <p>How are you generating the reports? Are you using the Ribbons methods, or doing it in VBA? If you're doing it in VBA, you'll have to show us the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using the Ribbon, then I'd suspect something wrong with your installation of Office. Be sure both Office and Windows are fully up to date.</p>

            Generally you create a PDF using the OutputTo command. Or manually from the ribbon. I suspect you are using the Outputto command and its coded incorrectly for XPS instead of PDF.

            <p>I am generating the reports with VBA. This is happening only for a particular report while all the others are working fine. Code is same for all. Is it possible that due to size or orientation of the report pdf is not able to generate? I am not sure.</p>
<p>Anyway,this is what the code looks like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function GenerateNewReport()</p>
<p>'declared all the variables</p>
<p>'open form to get reporting criteria</p>
<p>DoCmd.OpenFrom"Form name",acNormal, , , ,acDialog</p>
<p>If IsLoaded("Form name")=True Then</p>
<p>'form values feed the variables</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>'close the form</p>
<p>DoCmd.CloseForm acForm "Form name"</p>
<p>
</p><p>varX=False</p>
<p>varPath="&lt;pathname&gt;"</p>
<p>For n=1 To 10</p>
<p>Select Case n</p>
<p>Case 1</p>
<p>If varX=False Then DoCmd.OpenReport "My new Report"</p>
<p>varRepName="Reportname.pdf"</p>
<p>varFileName=varReportName&amp;".pdf"</p>
<p>
</p><p>'same code for all cases-different reports</p>
<p>
</p><p>End select</p>
<p>Based on the Report Type and the month of the year, a bunch of functions are carried out where files are copied from source to destination folders.(using Call FileCopy here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>then using objShell.Run("site name") the reports are uploaded to the sharePoint site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I was able to explain the issue.</p>

            <p>Then I don't see how you are generating a PDF. The OpenReport method, just prints a report. Unless your default printer or the specified printer for the report is a PDF writer, I don't see how this code generates a PDF.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As ScottGem mentioned, unless your default printer is a PDF printer then there is no guarantee that the report would be output as a PDF. If you want to insure that, use OutputTo as suggested by ScottGem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoCmd.OpenReport "YourReport", acViewPreview, etc etc</p>

            <p>Just to test, I tried to generate the same report using the ribbon. </p>
<p>I got this message "the section width is greater than page width, and there are no items in the additional space, so some pages may be blank". The pdf was blank with no data in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I&nbsp;open the&nbsp;report in design mode, I get this pop up "This document was previously formatted for the printer Microsoft XPS Document Writer in XPSPort,&nbsp;but that printer isn't available.</p>
<p>Do you want to use the default printer send to OneNote 2013?"&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Then as ScottGem said, open the report in Design view, click Page Setup, and modify the printer to match the reports that print correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That may also correct your "section width" error, but if not, you'll have to insure that the your report is properly formatted for the printer. The "section width" error generally means that your report is too wide, so you'd have to either narrow the report
 a bit, or decrease the Margins somewhat. Note that decreasing the Margins can cause odd printing behavior at times, so be careful with that.</p>

            It looks like the report may have been designed on a PC with no printer installed (only virtual printers like XPS). So it was set up for XPS. So you should be designing on a machine that has a printer that you users will be using. Another thing you can
 do is install an HP LJ 4 as a "phantom" printer. It is a standard and should enable you to format correctly.&nbsp;

                    I tried to follow the Outlook directions of highlighting the message and clicking on Actions/Resend but there is no such command.&nbsp; I finally copied all of the sent message and pasted it into a new message and sent.&nbsp;

Isn't there a simpler way to resend a message?<br />

            Double click on the sent message so it opens (not just highlight it&nbsp;in the left pane)&nbsp;and then look for Actions/Resend.&nbsp; If it doesn't appear there it probably needs to be added to the toolbar.

<h3> daemon3003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 joke start menu.</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Windows 8.2, sorry I mean 10, first thing I noticed was Metro is now fully integrated onto the START MENU. When I click the start menu I am presented with a whole range of Metro apps that I do not now nor have ever wanted, when I unpin
 them from the start I am left with an ugly big empty box, I clicked the resize button on the upper right hand corner of the start menu foolishly thinking it would make it less messy, to my absolute surprise, it brought up the Windows 8 Metro screen minus the
 apps. I feel l do not want a windows 7 style start menu with its links to folders and places that are used constantly on a desktop, instead I am thrilled to have a totally useless start menu that takes up a quarter of my desktop with nothing usable on it.
 I felt a warm glow when I saw the new icons on Windows 10, I can imagine how the preschooler felt when Microsoft elected to use his or her designs, perhaps we could all get our grandchildren to submit designs for icons to Microsoft the best ones being used
 in the new operating system. I feel perhaps Microsoft hit its peak with Windows 7, a tablet is a tablet, a phone is a phone, a desktop is a desktop.</p>

            <p>yeah its pretty horrible, i couldn't agree more</p>
<p>and now theres a wonderful new feature, when ever you search in the start menu, looking for something local, you get useless web search results from BING, isnt that nice?, yep even with cortana turned off, i cant tell you the<em> joy</em> it brings me knowing
 that all our local searches for our local files are now being recorded by BING servers god knows where, so microsoft can SELL all our info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the best part is that you cant turn it off</p>

            You are absolutely right about the Start being a degraded version. The worst thing is that Microsoft has been tryoing to follow Apple and create OSes for dummies. That's would have been fine, on condition they maintained the option to configure various
 features. For example, in all of the previous versions you could edit the Start Menu by organizing your apps in groups for better orientation and for eliminating a long endless list of apps. In this version editing the Start Menu is no longer possible. The
 list of apps, marred by colors disturbing the readability of the text, is one of the most useless features in this seemingly new OS.<br />

            Yes agree fully, if we have been forced to have these apps, the least Microsoft could do is to place all the apps in a single folder in the start menu so they are out of the way. This will go a long way towards tidying up the menu, Now if only we can convince
 them to return the links to the right hand side of the start menu for desktops all will be well. I am still deeply suspicious that windows sidebar was removed due to being unsafe, this being the case, why replace them with metro apps that are potentially much
 more of a security risk, as they all seem to ask for permission to use your location.<br />

            <p>I still cannot see the benefit of upgrading to Windows 10 from my XP/7 :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still has jumble of inefficient UIs (like Windows Search, Ribbon, Tile UI, TaskView, white notification icons, complicated Control Panel, etc. etc.) started from Vista, and Microsoft doesn't seem to care OS devours our time in office.</p>
<p>And now, Cortana and Store-based start menu. laughable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to Vista, any operation takes just few steps, without visual contact.</p>
<p>Now, I have to click, click, type, click, drag, click, and another click to get what I want to be done!</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Problem with that theory, my friend, is that Microsoft will not be able to monetize your every click, they want the ad revenue, they want advertising $ involved with every aspect of Windows Os. It would be AWESOME to have win2k/WinXp brought back from the
 grave, but it just dont meet the MS-apple model!!</p>

            <p>Our site is currently hosted on Office 365(***). I am trying to re-direct it to GoDaddy by altering the A Record to point to Goddady webserver. But when I want to alter the A Record, there is not option (only new TXT record is an option). One of the articles
 I read says to switch the domain on Office 365 back to the original domain given for our account（which is ***）. Will this affect the email or anything else in Office 365 or only our website?

            <p>Hi BryanSpangler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use GoDaddy website and your domain is managed by Office 365, you can use the following URL to log in and check if you can add an A record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><a href="https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx?switchtoclassic=true#@/Domains/DomainEdit.aspx?DomainEditLayout=DomainDnsManagementPanel&amp;domainName" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx?switchtoclassic=true#@/Domains/DomainEdit.aspx?DomainEditLayout=DomainDnsManagementPanel&amp;domainName</a>=your</span>domain.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then choose <strong>New &gt; A (Address) &gt; input your A record information &gt; Save.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can’t see the option of A record, please capture a screenshot and send it to us for further investigation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to your question is yes. Switching domains may have an effect on users’ mailboxes if you are going to change users’ account name. Could you share the article with us so that we can understand your situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates. We have received and checked the domain from our side.<br />
<br />
Please currently follow the below steps to modify the domain settings in Office 365.<br />
<br />
1. As Lynn mentioned above, go to the below page.<br />
<br />
https://portal.office.com/Admin/Default.aspx?switchtoclassic=true#@/Domains/DomainEdit.aspx?DomainEditLayout=DomainDnsManagementPanel&amp;domainName=<em><strong>yourdomain.com</strong></em><br />
<br />
2. At the "DNS management " section, click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Click here when you're ready to start</span>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d01f1b3f-ddc9-40e7-a664-24d65b84c0f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d01f1b3f-ddc9-40e7-a664-24d65b84c0f8" /></a><br />
<br />
3. At the "Do you want us to set up DNS records for Office 365 for you?" page, select
<br />
4. At the "Change the nameservers for yourdomain.com", directly click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Okay, I've changed the nameservers</span>.<br />
<br />
5. Click Finish.<br />
<br />
6. Go back to the page at Step 1 to see if you can add new A record.<br />
<br />
During step 4, please make sure <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/client/results?Shownav=true&amp;lcid=1033&amp;ns=O365PROADMIN&amp;version=15&amp;omkt=en-US&amp;ver=15&amp;services=SWAY%2cOFFICE_PRO_PLUS_SUBSCRIPTION_SMBIZ%2cEXCHANGE_L_STANDARD%2cSHAREPOINTLITE%2cMCOLITE&amp;HelpID=O365P_ManageDNS_SwitchDNSMgt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
your domain's NS record has been changed</a> to the below value.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;First nameserver: ns1.bdm.microsoftonline.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Second nameserver: ns2.bdm.microsoftonline.com<br />
<br />
If you indeed need to modify the NS record, please expect that the your email system in Office 365 would have down time until the DNS is set up correctly.<br />
<br />
Please feel free to post back for any updates and we will follow up on your case.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />

<p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll have to isolate your case since it involves two applications, (OneDrive and Office 2016). It is possible that plugins or add-ins installed in Office are causing this. Run one Office application (ex. Word) in

<p>Hi Erika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried opening Excel and PowerPoint in Safe Mode and neither would respond when I attempted to open a file. Have used the repair function from both locally and the internet a couple of times with no improvement. I have gotten the error message that the file
 APLZOD.dll could not be found. I searched the computer and could not locate it. I believe that I deleted a program the have the word "apple" in it when I was attempting to eliminate apple software. Can APLZOD.dll be reloaded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also mention that at the same time my contacts have all disappeared from my local Outlook but I can see them on One Drive, However they cannot be accessed. I get the error message that"MAPI was unable to load the information service Program-2\Common-1\Apple\INTERN-1\APLZOD.dll.
 In an attempt to reload APLZOD.dll I downloaded iCloud and did see a version of "APLZOD" but I still couldn't get access to the contacts in iCloud when queried through Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I think I'll need to reload Windows 10 if APLZOD.dll can't be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ray</p>

 flowed right in. &nbsp;No idea why that worked, and when I was chatting with Microsoft support they specifically had me reset it as POP3 and not exchange. &nbsp;But it works so I'm going with it.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m experiencing a very long delay in receiving Skype Messages and Outlook Emails</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and for some reason I am experiencing a very long delay in receiving Skype messages and outlook emails. I always have Skype running in the background but&nbsp;I only receive the Skype messages when I open the window back up. I also don't receive
 any indication on the icon that I've received a new message. It's becoming quite tedious to have to constantly open, minimise and reopen the program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a delay on my Outlook emails too but it's more sporadic. The odd email may have been sent yesterday but it's only received to following day. I know that it's a problem with my device because the last time it was sent to an email group and I was the
 only one who received it late.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you Ken.&nbsp; Your sample allowed me to rework my code and get it up and running properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I am faced with one last little issue to finish this task once and for all.&nbsp; As you can see by the code above, I am looping through the form's recordset to get the data to pass to the Word Document.&nbsp; The issue being that the form contains a number
 of calculated fields (so they aren't part of the recordset).&nbsp; How can I access their values in VBA?&nbsp; I was hoping not to have to recalculate everything in my VBA code as it would uselessly duplicate things and make thing worse to maintain moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would you recommend?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            More Help - Lumia 520 8.1 Update issues</h2>
                    
<p>OK, I have tried everything I can think of and even spoken to Support but my problem remains unresolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have two Lumia 520 Win 8.1's in our household, one updates perfectly and has updated to "8.1 Update" version and mine is stuck at 8.1 - they are both Lumia Cyan.&nbsp; Now, phone 1 has now got Cortana installed but phone 2 (mine) stubbornly refuses to update
 and remains deprived of the wonderful Cortana!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have backed up, re-set and reinstalled the phone twice now.&nbsp; I have attempted to download and install the update that keeps popping up and begging to be dealt with about 20 times now.&nbsp; I get the 8018830f error telling me the download cant be installed
 each and every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a desperate attempt to get round this I have registered for the Preview for Developers and downloaded app, re-run the Phone Update ..... Nothing, it will not update and I still don't have Cortana.&nbsp; Apart from pretending to be in the USA what more can
 I do?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to repeat our OTHER Lumia 520 has the Cortana app and it's working fine and this is the UK!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please and ideas, solutions or other helpful info?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some differences in the phones specs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Phone 1(With Cortana)</u> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win version&nbsp; 8.1 Update</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Phone 2 (without Cortana)</strong></u></p>

<p>Hi Craig Wong,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your issue, I’d like to confirm what app you want to open online. Is it the Booking app? If so, can you open it before?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I suggest you try to clear the cache of your browser or switch to another browser and try again to check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Chrome &gt; At the top right &gt; click <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/369e732d-ed35-4597-83dc-3a27859e5b4b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Click More tools and then Clear browsing data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can provide us a screenshot about the loading page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any emails older than 90 days are not visible in my Office 365 inbox. According to the retention policy of my organisation, it's supposed to be archived after 90 days. But the archive folder in Mail of Office 365 is empty as well. How do I gain access to
 my old emails?</p>

<p>Hi MAUSMY,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have posted under the Outlook category, my understanding is that you are currently using the Outlook client for your Office 365 account. If so, please firstly make sure that Exchange caced mode "mail to keep offline hasn't been set to be less than
 3 months, ie, 1 month or 2 months"). About this, you can go to "FILE"&gt; "Account Settings"&gt; select your mailbox&gt; Change&gt; Exchange cached mode (mail to keep offline)&gt; there if it is "1 month" or "2 months", you can set it to be "3 months" or latter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if the above setting has no problem, it is recommended that you try searching the email older than 90 days to see if it can be searched. This step is to check if the mail older than 90 days has been moved to other folder of your Outlook. Please be
 noted that you should select the "current mailbox" or "all Outlook items" while searching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, since you are not very sure about whether your organization's retention policy is "emails older than 90 days will be archived", I suggest you re-confirm this with your admin. In addition, each mailbox can be assigned with a single retention policy (for
 example, it can be "move the emails older than 90 days to the Deleted Items folder or permently delete). You can also check this point with your admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Alan</p>

<h2>            OneNote notebook on OneDrive visible on one machine but not others</h2>
                    <p>I use OneNote under Office 2013, 2010, and 2016, from various machines, with notebooks stored on a directory called OneNote Notebooks on OneDrive.&nbsp; Typically everything works just fine.&nbsp; However, one of my notebooks only is visible on a single computer,
 running Office 2013 -- the files are where you would expect on OneDrive, the directory is correct when I check the location, and there is a *.onetoc2 file just as there should be.&nbsp; When I navigate to that location from any other computer, on whatever version
 of OneNote, I cannot open that notebook.&nbsp; Has anyone seen this, and how can it be fixed?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Perhaps&nbsp;I wasn't sufficiently clear.&nbsp; The problem I am having is not a sync problem.&nbsp; The problem I am having is that OneNote either does not offer the notebook as something that can be opened, on another machine, or if I navigate to it manually, it refused
 to open, despite the notebook having the requisite .onetoc2 file and working fine when accessed from a single machine.&nbsp; The notebook files are indeed on OneDrive, so the other machines do have access to it.&nbsp; But, unlike my other notebooks, this single notebook
 is behaving badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a standard way to regenerate a corrupted .onetoc2 file?&nbsp; It used to be that opening a notebook via the web version of OneNote would often fix such issues.&nbsp; However, in this case, even the web version of OneNote will not open the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why are my attachments disappearing when I forward an email from my &#34;sent&#34; box&#63;</h2>
                    Why are my attachments disappearing when I forward an email from my "sent" box?<br />
<br />
Example: I send some photos to Friend A.&nbsp; Later, I want to send the same photos to Friend B.
<br />
I go to my "sent" box, open the email I'd sent to Friend A, and select "forward."&nbsp;
<br />
But the forwarded email doesn't include the photos. Why is that? <br />

Please read through the below for a<u><b> possible</b></u><b> <u>reason.</u>.. </b>

<div>
<p>If you have a new Outlook.com account, some of the features might be turned off to help thwart spammers. The features will be available once you’ve used your Outlook.com account for a few days.
<b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>To turn on the features right away</b>,<b> go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=259452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add a phone</a><span>&nbsp;</span>page to verify your account with a mobile phone number.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here are some of the features that might be turned off for new accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sending automated vacation replies (auto reply option)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email signature</p>
</li><li>
<p>POP aggregation (use Outlook.com to send and receive email from any address)</p>

<p>Reply-To address (receive replies to Outlook.com email at a different email address)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Send-As address (send email in Outlook.com from other email addresses)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Features might also be turned off for older accounts that have been detected as compromised (hijacked).

            Hi, I'm sorry but this is not helpful -- my Outlook is not a few days old, it's been a month or more. And the issues you list have nothing to do with my question. And then you end with "please go to forums for help" -- um, that's where I started!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Peter J., </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion.&nbsp; I understand that you want to know why attachment disappeared when you sent it the second time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the active view was set to hide previews.&nbsp; I need you to check this the email/s that is in question&nbsp;then&nbsp;click
 the arrow besides active view and see if the attachment is still there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way also to check if&nbsp; you successfully attach a file to the emails that was sent is to look for the clip button,&nbsp;once the clip button is visible it means that the email contains attachment/s.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if&nbsp;the issue still persists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Update pop-ups in Windows 10 bypass the lock screen</h2>
                    <p>I noticed something odd about the windows update notification in build 100049.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I locked my screen with windows key + L went for some coffee and noticed a windows update pop-up.</p>
<p>I clicked on the update pop-up and told the computer to reboot now and apply updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Directly after I pressed apply I got a critical exception message and the computer asked for my credentials to unlock, I unlocked the computer and the computer started rebooting instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn`t expect a windows update pop-up bypassing the lock screen seems a bit unsecure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did someone else notice this?</p>
