            <p>What do you mean by Fixed Width White space, are you referring to space available in the slide after you compose a paragraph in PowerPoint?</p>
<p>Who is currently inserting 'White space' in the PowerPoint slide?</p>

            I'm not sure what the original author meant, but what I am looking to do is insert a checkbox content control at the beginning of a line in a paragraph with justified text, but to have the space after the box stay the same so the first word after the checkbox
 lines up. I'm not using, and would prefer not to use, a hanging indent or tab, as the text is in a table cell. I seem to have found one in a document I'm working on. When I Alt-X to get the code, it comes up F020, but when I look up that character code in
 Symbols for the font (Arial), it comes up as the letter Eth. Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>Do you really want a checkbox content control, or do you just want a square character that somebody can write a check/X into?</p>

<p>In justified text, the spaces between words adjust from line to line, as they do in this post, so the text extends to both margins. What I want is for the space AFTER the content control to have a fixed width so the first word after the content control (there
 are several lined up in the first column of a table along with the text) in each cell lines up down the page. I'm including a table with sample text so you see what I mean. (The "X" in the cell represents the box. I want the space after the X to be the same
 in both cells&nbsp;regardless of justification in each cell. Tabs in cells aren't impossible, but problematic, and I think hanging indents look awful in cells. I bunched the text together in the second cell so you could see the effect I'm trying to avoid.)</p>

            <p>John Wilson: My apologies for posting a response in the wrong forum. My search was "fixed width space Word," and this post came up as a hit. I should have looked closer at the bread crumbs. I have the problem resolved for now. Thank you.

<p>And a note to the Webmaster: My post with the table in it was set for justified formatting, but it looks like it didn't come out that way.</p>

<h2>            Word - Create field to link sequential cells from excel</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm creating a travel itinerary in word based in an excel table containing:</p>
<p>Day 1, Date, Activity</p>
<p>Day 2, Date, Activity</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea is to create a quick part option that let us insert the first row of the excel table in word.</p>
<p>Then type additional info and when done, click again to the quick part option and insert the following row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's fairly easy to do this with sequential numbers, by creating a SEQ field, save it as an autotext quickpart and then everty time you insert the quick part the numbers are created sequentially. I wonder if t's posbbile when linking to an excel table. As
 the excel table will change from itinerary to itinerary I don't want to link to a specific cell (ex: A2, A3...) but something along the line of linking the first cell A2 and then use a SEQ code or something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>If you're keeping all the data you need except for the material in the first two pages in the Excel sheet, then Mailmerge is certainly a viable option. All you probably need to do is create a Directory merge, and put the material you want in the first two
 pages inside a field code like this at the beginning of the mail merge main document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ IF { MERGESEQ } = 1 "your page 1 image and page 2 text" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If you have any special characters such as double quotation characters in your text you would need to deal with those specially).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the idea is to add text in Word after data from each Excel row, I just don't think the Mailmerge route is particularly straightforward. In fact, I don't think having Word LINKs or DATABASE fields is a particularly easy way to go, either, although
 I certainly think it could be viable for a relatively small number of records in your Excel sheet. I would personally prefer to have some mechanism where the user inserted some sort of placeholder where they wanted Excel data from a single record, then have
 a VBA macro that maintained the text in the placeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That said, for a field-based approach along the lines of your original post, you could download the .zip filefrom&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/Wu83C2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://goo.gl/Wu83C2</a>&nbsp;. Put the .dotx and .xlsx in a folder on your local
 drive (e.g. C:), open the .dotx, select all the text and update the fields. Then skim the content (you should be able to test without reading every detail) and try inserting some links to rows. It's a .dotx because it contains some AutoText entries that you
 can insert using e.g.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At1 followed by F3, At2 followed by F3 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that a decision on an approach is highly dependent on precisely what you need to achieve, who is going to use it and how much support you can give them. If you use examples to pin down your requirement a bit more, so much the better.</p>

<p>OK, now I understand what has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on how you try to open the .dotx, Word will either actually open the .dotx, or create a new document based on the .dotx (which is actually how .dotx templates are supposed to be used). You have a new document based on the .dotx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Delete the field codes that you inserted</p>
<p>&nbsp;- save that document in the same folder as the .xlsx</p>
<p>&nbsp;- click ctrl-A, then F9 to update all the fields again</p>

            <blockquote>I thought IFERROR was 2007 and beyond?<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>That's correct. For Excel 2003 and earlier you would have to use =IF(ISNA(<i>&lt;formula1&gt;</i>), IF(ISNA(<i>&lt;formula2&gt;</i>), "Not found",&nbsp;<i>&lt;formula2&gt;),&nbsp;</i><i>&lt;formula1&gt;</i>)</div>
<div>... which effectively doubles the length of your formula since each <i>&lt;formula?&gt;</i>&nbsp;has to be written twice.<br />
<br />
<div>You noted that you were using Excel 2007 in your original post but failed to mention the need for backward compatibility. It helps to mention these things from the start. Is there anything else that should be determined from the start?<br />
<br />
<i>Edit:</i>&nbsp;note that another backward compatibility problem you will likely run into is the limit on a length of a formula and the number of nested IF()s you are allowed (since you are trying to cover 20-odd IF()'s).<br />

<p>1. Bluetooth Connection - In previous versions, I could easily connect my phone and PC via Bluetooth, not having to manually open any programs or plug in my phone via USB, my Outlook would sync automatically with my phone and update my calendar and anything
 else I set, to the desired time every 1, 2, 3, 4hrs etc.</p>
<p>Now I have to stop working, plug in the phone via USB, close down any pop up errors, make sure it selects PC suite on my phone, go back into PC suite and make sure its synchronizing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TOO MUCH EFFORT ! ! ! ! !&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time at work is precious, we can not afford to stop and sync our phones manually. Make it work Nokia -&nbsp; Simplify it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was working fine previously !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Check Your Proxy Settings - Having this message pop up everytime I open Nokia Suite is really annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Now the program is shutting down automatically due to errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If problem still exists could you try install the BETA Nokia suite version?</p>
<p>Check if you have disconnected device during installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Go to Program and Features or Add remove in Control Panel<br />
- Click Nokia Suite<br />
- Click UnInstall</p>
<p><br />
UnInstall also:<br />
- Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver</p>
<p>- PC connectivity Solution</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then restart computer.<br />
- Download and install latest beta version of&nbsp; Nokia Suite version (v 3.4.21) from
<a href="http://betalabs.nokia.com/apps/nokia-suite-beta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> ... To download the installer, you need to log-in with the SAME credentials that you use on this Forum..</p>
<p>- Restart Computer again<br />
- Connect the device, do not open Nokia Suite and wait for all the driver to be loaded by windows.<br />
- Once done then launch Nokia Suite.<br />
- Check for the issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Zune software on new machine freezes entire PC EVERYTIME it tries to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshjiggler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune software on new machine freezes entire PC EVERYTIME it tries to load.  Error given &#34;Where&#39;s my Collection&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently rebuilt my computer, and after installing all the windows updates I finally got around to (trying) to install the Zune software. I'm running XP updated to SP3, and with all Microsoft updates installed.</p>
<p>Here's my problem: Zune software installs, seemingly correctly, but when I go to launch the program I get the following error. "Where's my collection?: Everything's right where you left it. Zune is recovering from an error and needs to reassemble your collection.
 You'll need to reconfigure your device relationship, sync groups, and podcast subscriptions (if any). Sorry for the inconvenience." And with that, my PC freezes to the point that only a hard reset will get it back up and running.</p>
<p>Since setting the PC up, I have never even gotten the program past this point to even build the collection in the first place. Like I said, I have downloaded all the updates (Windows and Microsoft), I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program a few times
 (following Microsoft's own guide), and even used the program to reset the collection information. All of this to no avail. I've even unistalled and reinstalled WMP 11 and its runtime files as someone on another forum thought it might be a problem with those
 dll's.</p>
<p>While this is a new computer, and fresh install of XP, I'm only running one program (Stardock's Fences) that wasn't being run on my old computer. My old computer never had any trouble loading the Zune software, and it was an old Pentium II with only 256M
 of RAM. I would hope a dual core 3.2 with 4 gigs of RAM would be able to run this software better than that old piece of junk. My PC runs much more advanced software, and programs that tax the system much more than the Zune Software ever should; they never
 freeze my system. So what is it with the Zune software that's causing this? Could I try a legacy version of the software (were I able to find one...), and still be able to sync my zune with the latest firmware installed? The primary function of my Zune is
 for podcasts, and without the Zune software, I can't download any to my Zune. I'm running out of options here. Due to Microsoft's decision to make the Zune software the ONLY way to sync to their device I may have to go back to an iPod or some other cheap MP3
 player, which I really, really, really don't want to do. I love my Zune and want to go on using it. As it stands right now, though, I can't use it as I normally would.</p>
<p>I'm at my wits ends. Any help you guys could offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Except for the advertising-supported Microsoft Word Starter 2010, Word has never been free except as part of a limited-time trial of Office. When the trial expires, you cannot continue to use Word without buying either Office or a freestanding copy of Word.</p>

            Assuming that you have installation media and a product key, you can run Office 2010 without problems on Windows 7. Note that this doesn't apply to OEM installations, which are tied to a particular computer.
<br />

<p>Office 97 isn't compatible with Windows 7. That has nothing to do with whether MS will 'allow' you to install &amp; use it (both of which

            <p>Apologies my comment should have read Office Pro 97 and Office Standard 2002</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my point still remains </p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased these products as I have migrated through Microsoft's Operating Systems through the years</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently run Windows 7 and other than a stripped down version of Office Starter 2010 I find that once again&nbsp;I'm expected to either rent or buy&nbsp;a whole new suite of office 365 if I want full functionality</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I did chose to do so how long before windows release yet another operating system and I'm back to square one</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can bet I'll think twice next time;&nbsp; I change computers if it will be a Microsoft Platform I chose</p>
<p>; so much for being a long standing user of MS Products and Platforms</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Jay Freedman suggested the only answer is to go open office (luckily I already own an original version)</p>

</p><p>Thanks Suzanne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>appreciate the reply : if you uninstall Office Starter 2010 from Windows 7 it reverts back to Word Viewer</p>
<p>
</p><p>but that still doesn't give me the functionality I have come to expect from MS Office &nbsp;the last version I purchased was actually Office Standard 2002 better known as Office 2003</p>
<p>
</p><p>excuse me for being a little fed up having to buy new software every time Microsoft Brings out a new Operating System</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly since I have been a loyal customer since they bought out 3.1; I also own a full version of Sun Office otherwise known as Open Office</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I stated in another thread will be thinking twice before I chose a Microsoft Platform next time I upgrade</p>

<p>
</p><p>Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply&nbsp; but no I do not have a product key office Starter 2010 comes bundled with Windows 7 : I also do not have Windows 7 on Disk; but than you should know that</p>
<p>
</p><p>simply put Microsoft bring out a new operating system I upgraded from XP to Windows 7; and pretty much most of my old software ends up in the bin</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue revolves around the fact that twice now 1st when upgrading from 98 and 2nd to Windows 7</p>
<p>previously purchased MS Office software costing a considerable amount of money are now reduced to little more than shiny drink coasters</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite frankly if this is the loyalty Microsoft show its long time users; they can expect me to be just as loyal next time I buy a new platform</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my MS Office suite; hello open office: here It come....</p>

<p>
</p><p>" Excel found unreadable content in ( File name .xlsm) Do you want to recover contents of this workbook? If you trust the source of this workbook click yes"</p>
<p>After clicking yes and running &nbsp;a repair file , the spreadsheet opens and works fine. Problem starts when I save the workbook (Macro Enabled) and then open file again the macro's dont want to work and gives me following message. I doubled checked macros
 are enabled.</p>

<h3> fdh8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add payment options</h2>
                    Am trying to extend my Office 365. Seems impossible, as system keeps saying 'your area code is invalid': system keeps saying I'm in the Netherlands, while I'm in Germany. Impossible to change, somehow (? even though account profile clearly states GERMANY...).
 Fine, I'll add a payment option then, to add my business bank account there. Seems impossible as well, because now, the system keeps telling me that the name used to sign does not match any bank account. Uhhh, yes it does, it's the exact name under which this
 bank account operates. (Tried initials and abbreviated name that I use for the Microsoft account, but to no avail. Tried different browsers too, etc. etc., as well as completely useless support section, to no avail...) Any suggestions?

            Unfortunately, that does not help: when I create an Xbox Account, the country code is automatically Germany. Which is wonderful, because I am in fact in Germany, but the payment thingy still says "You're in the Netherlands" (seriously no idea why, never
 filled NL out as country of residence) (so I can't change the Xbox account region to Germany, as it alsready has Germany as my region. Only the payment option thingy insists on the Netherlands...)

            This is extremely ABSURD. I have added my GERMAN Paypal account as payment option. Hurray. Then I try to pay, and the system gives me only 1 option, namely, 'add payment option'. And adding the GERMAN Paypal account from there is impossible, as there,
 the system, again, insists I am in the Netherlands. ****.

            <p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span><b>1)</b></span></p>
<p><span>The log is automatically create by Excel itself.</span></p>
<p><span>This situation is well-explained in this web page:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxpert.com/docs/excel.en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.foxpert.com/docs/excel.en.htm</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>where it says:</span></p>
<p><span>«Debugging Excel file is an art of its own. Fortunately, Excel provides some guidance when the file format is wrong. Unfortunately, this might be less than you expect. Excel creates a log file every time you open an invalid document. This log file
 contains all errors and on Windows XP is stored in</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\Content.MSO</span></p>
<p><span>On Windows Vista and Windows 7 you’ll find this file in the following directory:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.MSO
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(…). The error log (only) specifies the tag and, if applicable, the attribute or the value that caused the problem. (…).»</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this link</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/emeadcrmsupport/archive/2013/05/16/quot-worksheet-setting-quot-error-in-microsoft-excel-when-opening-an-xml-file-exported-from-dynamics-crm-2011.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/emeadcrmsupport/archive/2013/05/16/quot-worksheet-setting-quot-error-in-microsoft-excel-when-opening-an-xml-file-exported-from-dynamics-crm-2011.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>at point 2&nbsp;you can see the dialog window (indeed a section) which refers to the log file, located in …. Temporary Internet Files\Content.MSO\&lt;logName&gt;.log</p>
<p><span>Window that Excel shows whenever the Xml Spreadsheet is “malformed”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><b>2)</b> The log is in text format, editable by a simple Notepad.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>---------------</span></p>
<p><span>I have already tried to open the Xml Spreadsheet (*.xml) with Excel and then I have already tried to access these log files: the log file is created by Excel itself as soon as the XMLSS is opened. And strangely the log is always Blank using Excel 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have tested this circumstance with 3 pcs which had installed Win7 and office 2013. While the same Xml Spreadsheet (*.xml) opened with Office 2012 (in the same version of Win7) the log has the informations that it must have.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please tell me if you need that I attach the xml file: or better, I could share to you with some cloud web service like Mediafire, in so far as I think here I cannot attach a file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance, and sorry 4 my bad English</span></p>

            <p>Hi<br />
<span>I have shared</span> <span>a trivial example</span> of a malformed Xml spreadsheet
<span>in the</span> <span>link at the</span> <span>bottom of the post</span><span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I repeat</span> <span>my problem</span> <span>in short</span><br />
<br />
<span>I have a</span> <span>xml</span> <span>(</span><span>XML</span> <span>Spreadsheet</span><span>)</span>
<span>generated</span> <span>by an application.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Sometimes,</span> <span>the application generates</span> <span>the</span> <span>
xml "</span><span>malformed</span><span>", </span><span>that is</span> <span>with an error.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If I use</span> <span>MS Excel</span> <span>2013 to</span> <span>open it,</span>
<span>a dialog box</span> <span>appears</span> <span>that</span> <span>states that there is</span>
<span>a mistake, and</span> <span>so far everything is fine</span><span>.</span> <span>
The</span> <span>dialog box</span> <span>indicates a</span><strong> <span>log</span>
<span>file</span></strong> <span>that</span> <span>you have to see</span><span>, <strong>
but it is</strong></span><strong> <span>empty</span></strong> <strong><u><span>and that's</span>
</u></strong><span><strong><u>not good</u></strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The exact same</span> <span>process</span> <span>with Excel</span> <span>2010 (</span><span>dialog box</span>
<span>etc</span> <span>...</span><span>) leads to</span> <span>a log</span> <span>
with the error</span> <span>reported correctly</span> <span>inside of it</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Meanwhile,</span> <span>thanks advance!</span><br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>as I wrote in all my previous posts,<strong> it is <u>percfetcly normal</u> that you cannot open it</strong>.<strong>I have done so expressly</strong>.
<u>The problem is not that</u>. <u><strong>The problem is that, when the dialog box appears indicating a log, the log is Empty when you try to open the Xml spreadsheet file in Excel 2013,</strong></u> while the log has the correct informations in Excel 2010
 (and 2003 too).</p>
<p>I hope I have explained well the fact.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>It sounds like you have Office starter and a purchased full copy of Office both installed. Correct? That is OK. You are running into a common problem.&nbsp; For some reason, Windows seems to favor Starter over full editions of Office, "forgetting" to reassign
 the file associations to the Full version. Here are several techniques for assigning the default file associations to the "right" applications.</p>

<p><b><span>If that doesn't work, try:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
Re-register the application
<p><span>There are several different ways you can reset the proper file associations. Word itself provides a way to do it. Open a command prompt window
 and, at the command line, enter the following:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>winword /r</span></p>
<p><span>Nothing seems to happen when you press
<b>Enter</b>, but Word will reregister itself back in Windows. In the process, it resets the file associations for the files it uses, such as DOC and DOT files. You can close the command prompt window and double-click on a document; Word should start right
 up.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If that doesn't work, try:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Alternate Re-register the application</span>
<p><span>Close the app. Open the Run Window: &lt;WIN&gt; R, use the following command (<b>Modify the Path to match your specific installation)</b>:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /unregserver</span></p>
<p><span>The quotes are necessary, but you may need to change the path so it reflects the location of the winword.exe file on your system. (You can
 use Windows’ Search tool to locate the path to the winword.exe file.) The /unregserver switch “unhooks” all the references to Word in the Windows Registry.
</span></p>
<p><span>You should then, immediately, use the following command:</span></p>
<div>
<p>
<span>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\winword.exe" /regserver</span></p>
<p><span>This command causes Word to rewrite all its Registry keys and to reassociate itself with document and template files. Now you can double-click
 a document file and see if Windows starts Word and opens the document.</span></p>

<h3> joeycheunghoyin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search terms are not highlighted in the &#34;Conversation History folder&#34; in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook 2010, when I perform a search in the "Conversation History" Folder (which has saved all of the conversation history from the "MS Lync 2010"), the search terms were not highlighted.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I perform searches in all other folders, no such problem exists and the search terms in the results are highlighted properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Highlight search terms in the results" in the "Search" section under "Outlook Option" is checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering are there any ways to let me have the search terms to be highlighted in the results when I perform searches in the "Conversation History Folder"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>The columns AA (Year, first year - last year), D (TargetArea,&nbsp; TA-1 - TA-m) and F (Type, Type-1 - Type-n) have in each case differently many items. The combination of all these actual possibilities (not the theoretical possibilities) should be copied in
 the sheet "Totals" with the result.<br />
I could fancy a solution as follows:<br />
uniques - Year, uniques - TargetAreas, uniques - Type<br />
In an nested loop these three are processed and the result is transferred into the sheet "Totals".</p>
<p>I would be rather grateful for help. Also for another solution proposal which leads to a comparable result.<br />

</p><p>At first, this is an international forum, please write your post in English only. Otherwise, fellow readers are not able to understand the posts. I read the German version of this forum too, you also get an answer of your posts there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, you are talking about a data structure in sheets Totals that you want to keep... I'm afraid that is critical, I need to see your file with some sample data and some sample results that the macro should produce.<br />
<br />
Please look in my profile for my mail address and instructions and send me your file.</p>

            <p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Welcome to Microsoft Community forum and we apologize for not being able to answer your query in a timely manner.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Based on the description you've provided, I can see that your font settings suddenly changes to a very small and that your mailbox got another extra column.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">If you want to change the general viewing in your mailbox, the easiest way to do this is in your browser's Zoom In function.
<span><font color="#000000">For example, in IE,<font color="#333333"> these keyboard shortcuts will adjust the zoom:
</font></font></span></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></font></span></p>
<p><b><span>CTRL</span></b><span> + <b>+<span> </span></b>Zoom In</span></p>
<p><b><span>CTRL</span></b><span> + <b>-</b> Zoom Out</span></p>
<p><b><span>CTRL</span></b><span> + <b>0 </b>Set Zoom to 100%.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using Internet Explorer you may click&nbsp;<b>View</b> (on Command Bar) then
<b>Text size</b> then select the text size you prefer. </span><span>The above will work with some other web browsers and email programs too.
</span><span><font color="#000000">You can also try holding <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Ctrl</span> while
down </span>using your <span style="font-weight: bold">Mouse wheel.</span></font></font></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if you think that there is an extra column was added in your mailbox, it is possible that the
<strong>Reading page setting</strong> is set to <strong>Right</strong>. To check this, just click
<strong>Off. </strong></font></span></p>

<h2>            Alignment issues when creating PDF documnets from Word 2007 files</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>I am using office 2007 which is up to date with all the service packs and updates.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The document has pictures and hyperlinks setup within the file.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue is when I try to create a PDF document the word document loses all the alignments that have been set up and the hyperlinks show the following error:</span></span></p>
<p><span>E</span><span><span>rror! Reference source not found.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I get the same result when creating the PDF from within word and when creating it using CutePDF.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The "Error Reference Source not Found" message is standard and indicates that the destination of the link has been deleted from the file or the linked file moved.</p>
<p>The message is appearing because in the Print Options the box for "Update Fields" is checked.</p>
<p>Before PDFing again, I would select the whole document (Ctrl+A) then F9 to refresh all links and references and then use Find (type in Error) to go to all the occurences of this Error message and correct them as required.</p>
<p>You can uncheck the box for Update fields so you don't get the error message but the problem will still be there in the PDF, that is the link will not work in the PDF as it is still broken.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense :-)</p>
<p>All the best</p>

<p><span><span>Thanks for your assistance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I tried what you recommended and once you press F9 it shows the error messages within the Word doc.<span>&nbsp;</span>I then recreated the hyperlinks but still
 had the same issue when creating a PDF file.<span>&nbsp;</span>The thing is the hyperlinks are not pointing to external files but to locations within the document i.e. pictures or graphs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It's as if just before the PDF file is being created the word document refreshes itself which displays the errors but then creates the PDF file with the errors in.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I did check if the update field entry was checked which it wasn’t.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you have any other ideas?</span></span></p>

<p>Hi JohnBman</p>
<p>Oh, dear...</p>
<p>Several things comes to mind:</p>
<p>1. "hyperlink" do you mean these are Cross-references to the captions of the picture/graphs, created via the Reference tab? Or are you using Insert Hyperlink method?</p>
<p>2. What happens after you recreate the link and press F9 on that specific link? If this goes to error there is something basically wrong with the creation of the link in the first place.</p>
<p>3. If the link does not Error after second F9, there maybe something wrong with the PDF process which I cannot test here as I have 2003 and Adobe Acrobat Pro. Can you check the settings for the conversion in your PDF software?</p>
<p>Come back, ye hear.</p>

            Hi BillO528
<br />
<br />Are you trying to RIP CD's with Power Media Player 14?
<br />
<br />If so, that app does not have that functionality at all, it is just a Player . .. 
<br />
<br />If you have no other app loaded on your PCfor Ripping CD's, you could use Windows Media Player to Rip your CD's - click your Start Button, type wmp and hit Enter

            <p>I realize now that this happened in conjunction with adding my boss's Hotmail account to Outlook.&nbsp; It simply made the rules disappear.&nbsp; I know this because it happened to me yesterday when I added my Hotmail account to Outlook.&nbsp; Fortunately, I was ahead
 of the game because I exported my rules to a file before doing this.&nbsp; I figured that it was adding the account that was the source of the problem.&nbsp; I was able to import that file after the Hotmail account was added and get my rules back.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I
 didn't have this knowledge at the time I did my boss's account, so couldn't protect his rules.&nbsp; What caused this and can I get them back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also didn't answer my question about rules limitations.&nbsp; Are there any?&nbsp; Does the fact that my boss has over 1,000 rules (or had) cause issues with the rules functioning properly?&nbsp; His rules were a total nightmare.&nbsp; They wouldn't always work properly
 and I just had no way of fixing them.&nbsp; That's why I'm asking if there are limitations in this area.&nbsp; I'm almost hoping there are so I can tell him to stop!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will review the articles you sent, but I don't think they will answer my questions.&nbsp; I have setup his Outlook file to be in a special Outlook folder in his My Documents folder so I can l access it easily.&nbsp; I am familiar with how these files work.&nbsp; I'm
 not as familiar with the Rules file, however.&nbsp; You didn't answer my question about where the Rules file is located, if there is one that even exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your response.&nbsp; I just need it to be more in line with what I'm asking.&nbsp; I'm not a novice user.&nbsp; I have opened and closed data files many times, and I have also imported data into an Outlook .pst file.&nbsp; It's the rules I'm not as knowledgeable
 about.&nbsp; If you can direct me more on that, I would be very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time...</p>

            Does the lack of response mean there's no answer to this??&nbsp; I have even tried Microsoft Chat and no one seems to be able to answer me about this.&nbsp; Nothing that anyone has presented has fixed this problem.&nbsp; I just need to know that there is no resolution
 and that these rules are gone for good.<br />

<h2>            SharePoint 2013 limit session</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working on SharePoint 2013 project and i got a requirement where in i need to restrict/limit user only for one session. Example:</p>
<p>One user should have one session at any point of time either in the different browser in same machine or when he logged in any from other machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he login from another browser in same machine or login in another machine i should show them an appropriate message as you already have one active session please close the session to continue..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an Intranet environment where i cannot enable FBA and Session management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request the community to provide the correct and suitable approach ASAP....</p>
