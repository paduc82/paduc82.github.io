<h2>            Desktop icons double-spaced</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I have a problem that seems to be quite prevalent, yet none of the documented fixes work for me.&nbsp; I have Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit and the icons on my desktop have become double-spaced along the y-axis.&nbsp; This is really annoying as it leaves
 a huge space underneath and leaves me short of one icon space (I like to have all my shortcuts along one column).&nbsp; I have tried changing the setting in Window Colour and Appearance, but it has no effect until I hit 37 pixels gap, but that is too little.&nbsp; What
 I mean is, 43 pixels is the standard gap, but I try to adjust it below that and it stays the same until I hit 37 pixels.</p>
<p>I have tried many fixes, such as rebuilding the icon cache and deleting some registry entries relating to the desktop, but all to no avail.&nbsp; I did have this problem once before, but I can't remember for the life of me how I fixed it.&nbsp; I think I started after
 I tried a desktop theme using Stardock's MyColours, but I cannot remember whenm it was I did that and I have done too much work on this computere since them to warrant using System Restore to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In this case system restore is the best troubleshoot method to fix the problem. Using registry cleaners and deleting/changing values in registry will bring trouble soon or later</p>
<p>The registry is a database in <span>Windows</span> that contains important information about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of theuser accounts on your computer.<span>Windows</span>
 continually refers to the information in the registry</p>
<p><strong>You should not need to make manual changes to the registry</strong> because programs and applications typically make all the necessary changes automatically. An incorrect change to your computer's registry could render your computer inoperable.<strong>Registry
 Editor is a tool intended for advanced users.</strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you back up the registry before making any changes and that you only change values in the registry that you understand or have been instructed to change by a source you trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use system Restore to restore your System to a previous state when it was working fine<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
1. Click "Start", type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click "System Restore" under the Programs section.<br />
<br />
When you are prompted by the User Account Control feature, click "Continue".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2.Do one of the following<br />
<br />
* If there is a recommended restore point, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
* If there No recommended restore point listed , simply click Next to continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3.Select a restore point at which you know the operating system was working, and then click "Next".<br />
<br />
<br />
5. On the Confirm your restore point page, click "Finish"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>As I stated in my message, System Restore is not an option here as it would wipe out what I've been doing over the last few months and I regularly clear out my Restore Points to conserve disk space, so the only one I have is from last night.&nbsp; Also, I'm Microsoft
 certified, so I think I'm qualified enough to modify the registry; the entries in question are automatically rewritten to defaults by Windows anyway.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you could suggest?</p>

<p>Check Disk can fix issues caused by corrupted C: drive or bad sectors. <br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start Button, type "cmd" (without quotation marks) in the Search bar.<br />
<br />
2. Right click on the search result listed upper and click Run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
3. In the open command window, input the following command and press Enter Key after it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Please type Y and press Enter.<br />
<br />
5. Please restart the computer and let the tool check the C: drive on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please run <span>sfc /scannow ( </span>System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) ) to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong> , click<strong>All Programs</strong> , click
<strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> . If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong> .
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</li></ol>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</p>
<p>If sfc found corrupted files that could not be fixed , we may need to perform an inplace upgrade to repair them</p>
<p>I would like to explain that the In-place Upgrade is a tool to repair the system. In-place Upgrade can help refresh the whole system and clear the unnecessary or corrupted information. Meanwhile, the system performance should improve as well. Through the
 special upgrade process, we will be able to repair the system. The In-place Upgrade will not affect settings like photos, movies, documents, etc. that are saved on the computer.&nbsp; However, it is recommended to first backup your important information and files
 to other partitions or other disks. After that, we can follow the In-place Upgrade steps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 1: Turn off Windows features before performing an In-place Upgrade<br />
<br />
================================================<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, and click Control Panel.<br />
<br />
2. Click Classic View on the left pane, and double click Program and Features.<br />
<br />
3. Click "Turn Windows features on or off on the left" pane.<br />
<br />
4. In the Windows Features dialog box, uncheck all of the check boxes, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now, let's perform the following steps to repair the corrupted files:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 2: In-Place upgrade<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
1. Start the computer.<br />
<br />
2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive after Windows Vista start up successfully .<br />
<br />
3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.<br />
<br />
• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp; Click the Start button, type Drive:\setup.exe in the Search Bar, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.<br />
<br />
b.&nbsp; Click Install now.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4. Click Do not get latest updates for installation<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. When we are prompted to input the product key, please click Next without inputting any key. The setup wizard will prompt and ask if you agree to install Windows Vista without the key. Please choose to confirm.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6. When you reach the Which type of installation to you want? screen, click Upgrade to repair Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note 1: if the Upgrade is disabled, please do not click Custom(advanced).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note 2: While performing the In-place Upgrade, the system will restart automatically (several times) to merge the files and programs. Please leave the computer alone and do not configure it until In-place Upgrade is completed. The system will start Windows
 Vista once it is upgraded.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When the In-place Upgrade finishes please restart the computer and check the issue again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>Since you did not specify, I'll assume you are using Vista, not XP. Procedures are quite similar though.<br />
<br />
Right click on an open space of desktop &gt; Personalize &gt; Windows Color and Appearance &gt; near bottom right side,<strong>Advanced</strong>&gt; under<strong>Item</strong>, use the pointer to scroll to<strong>Icon Spacing (Vertical) not Horizontal,</strong> click it
 &gt; under<strong> Size</strong>, use the down pointer to decrease the #. &gt;<strong>OK</strong> &gt;<strong>Ok again</strong> &gt; wait for initialization.<br />
Note :<br />
(Mine is at 43 with 9 icons lined up vertcally.) The higher the #, the less icons allowed in the verical column. You will have to repeat the above steps&nbsp;with different&nbsp;numbers in order to find the missing vertical space.</p>

<p>t-4-2, if you read my message properly, you would have seen that I stated that I was using Vista and that I had already tried that method and it didn't work.&nbsp; The setting don't take effect until I get below 37 pixels and that is too small a gap.</p>
<p>mohdrafi, I'm sure a reinstall of Windows would fix my problem, but I'm afraid I can't do that right now.&nbsp; I was asking if there was any other solutions apart from the obvious (reinstall Windows, change the setting in Window Colour and Appearance, etc).&nbsp;
 This is a well documented problem, and the only responses I've gotten so far are either cure-alls that are of no help to me or things that I have tried already.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Please understand that inplace upgrade is not a complete re-install of your windows based system. I have explained/suggested what it is in my previous reply based on the situation subject to my best knowledge</p>
<p>Still if you are not satisfied with our reply please wait here, A microsoft support agent will help you with this</p>
<p>Iam sorry i couldn't be of much help</p>
<p>Bye and take care</p>

<p>Here are my suggestions, more like speculations.......<br />
1. Can you go back to Windows Vista Basic Color Scheme, if you are presently not.<br />
2. Do you think if you change DPI scaling will help ? Smaller scale fits more information than larger scale.<br />
3. Suppose doing a mix-match between DPI and pixel ?<br />
<br />
Sorry if I am throwing wild guesses to you. Ignore me if you think I am crazy.</p>

    <title>File History - Missing Folders - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File History - Missing Folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 8.1 - fully updated. During the backup stage, File History is excluding large amounts of my data. &nbsp;My laptop is set up with a C and D drive. &nbsp;I keep the C drive for system files and use the D drive for data storage. My D drive has 26 different
 folders. &nbsp;However, during the backup stage, File History is processing only 6 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History's Data Folder shows my C and D drives and a folder labelled $OF which currently has approximately 1950 sub folders and about the same amount of files which are in the missing D drive folders. &nbsp;However, when I try to simulate a restore using
 File History, I am offered only the data from the 6 out of 26 D-drive folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate it if I was not offered a "canned" response. &nbsp;I have read all of the articles offered in the responses offered to others who have experienced this issue and none of them seem relevant. &nbsp; I have tried completely renewing my File History
 setup on a newly formatted external drive, but still I still have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            <p>I think I've solved the problem myself. &nbsp;Having noticed that the File History screen states it will copy files from Libraries, Desktop, Contacts and Favourites, I further searched the web and discovered that these locations cannot be changed. &nbsp;So I created
 a Library location for my D drive and voila, all my folders are now being backed up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions arise:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Why can't the File History Settings be changed so that a user's chosen file locations can be included?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Why aren't these location constraints explained more fully by Microsoft in their instructions etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Wouldn't it be something if somebody were to tell you how to check and see what version of Synaptics driver you have now, where to get the correct one and then if you update the driver how to tell where to look to be sure the driver update took effect
 and is the correct version number (not by year only).<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with the Compatibility<br />
Center (for device compatibility)?</p>
<p>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor &lt;-- please run this now<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center (for device compatibility)?<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Check with the System and Device makers for updated drivers and many have special instructions<br />
to help with upgrading to Windows 7. Also check with their forums if any.<br />
<br />

Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<h2>            Weather Information missing from Calendar App</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 machine at work which shows weather icons and temperatures in the Calendar app in monthly view for today and the next four days. I have a Windows 10 machine at home with the Calendar app which doesn't show any weather icons or temperatures.
 Both machines have the latest Windows updates. Why am I not getting Weather Information in my Calendar App at home? (The only difference between the machines is that one is Windows 10 Home and the other is Windows 10 Professional)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks ...</p>

<p>I've installed the <span>SDK (Software Development Kit) that comes with it, so I can use the

<p><span><strong>I am using Vista Ultimate as OS.</strong></span></p>

            Hi Drew,
<div><br />
<div>yes, I found the answer in the end... it's critical to have the corespondent SKD version with your FSX and service pack version ...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had FSX SP1, but I've installed the default SKD only, for FSX only... as soon as I've installed the SDK for FSX SP1, all works properly... now, in fact I've upgraded to FSX SP2 and installed the correct SDK for FSX SP2 and works fine... it would be fair
 to say it works the same for FSX Acceleration, with SDK for FSX Acceleration</div>
<div><br />
<div>(I'm not sure why nobody from the Microsoft support team pointed me to this simple solution - maybe they don't know it either...)</div>
<div><br />
<div>for you and anyone else out there&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;the same problem or similar problems, the best resource guide with helpful members willing to help - unlike Microsoft - is in fact outside Microsoft</div>
<div><br />
<div>find more details here</div>

<div><br />
<div>I hope that helps</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>P.S. I'm sorry Microsoft guys, I was a big fan of Microsoft back in '92 and '95 when you&nbsp;revolutionized&nbsp;the world with the transition from DOS coding to a user friendly GUI in the form of Windows OS... those days and that kind of enthusiasm is&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;long
 gone for Microsoft...</div>

<p>Good evening, Bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've no problem at all. And you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that my Windows 7 Professional Edition 64-bit OEM seems to run ok, but suddenly it asked me for a "new" validation and Microsoft seems not to have the solution for that [which is very awkward, because I bought my AZUS laptop with that operation
 system previously installed by the manufacturer].</p>

<h2>            What is the best way to sync one-way to an external hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    I transfer a lot of large files and I want to copy them to a backup hard drive periodically (manually) without deleting anything on that hard drive. The problem with just dragging and dropping is Windows will copy over already-existing files, just taking
 up unnecessary time (I would be OK having them copy over if the files changed).&nbsp;Does Windows XP have smarter functionality built-in somewhere?&nbsp;tried SyncToy but it's too buggy. Is there a better tool I can use? Maybe I should write my own in C++.

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are some settings that need to be applied to be able to have your remote desktop set up. In most cases, it is related to permissions. That being said, to get the correct configuration we suggest that you have your concern raised to our

            Hi Douglas, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />The first thing I'd try is to plug the drive into another PC, if you've got one available. This will let you know if it's a problem with the drive or with your PC.
<br />
<br />If the drive works in another PC, then plug it back into the original PC and see if it shows up in Device Manager. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- See if the drive is in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<br />Some external drives when plugged in show up as an "Initio" device, something you could check - the following link is for external optical drive but the same issue has occurred with external hard drives

            I am seeing the local C:\ drive in the Parallels VM, not your external drive. 
<br />
<br />This suggests, your external drive is likely not formatted as compatible with Windows. It could be in HFS+ or NTFS file format. 
<br />
<br />Is the external drive accessible in macOS? 
<br />
<br />If so, press Command + Spacebar
<br />Type: disk utility
<br />Double click it 
<br />
<br />Click on the thumbdrive on the left side.
<br />
<br />Click on Info

<h2>            Page fault in non paged area ntoskrnl.exe - New build on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really hoping that someone could help me with a problem on a fairly new built PC (the computer was built by myself at the beginning of December 2016). I have noticed a couple of weeks ago, that I had a blue screen with the non paged error. After looking
 through even viewer, I can see that it has happened numerous times since the PC was built, so I assume it seems to happen mostly when the computer is idling/in sleep. Using bluescreenview, I can see that the error is coming from ntoskrnl.exe with a bug check
 code of 0x00000050. I have also tried using whocrashed, but the report states that it is most likely a driver, but cannot say which driver it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running memtest86, which showed no errors. I have also checked windows is up to date, and have tried my best to ensure I have all the latest drivers for all components. As I can see the majority of other users have done this, I have uploaded
 a copy of the minidump file to my google drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-qaSTZrtKEOemlsRGJBbFRIRDg</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone with a lot more knowledge than me could analyse the dump file, and give me an idea of what could be wrong, that would be most appreciated :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. The PC is a self build, where I am using a Gigabyte GA-B150M-DS3H motherboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As requested, I have generated both the Driver view and System information reports, and have placed them into the same folder as the file from my previous message. Here is the link again for convenience.</p>

            <p>Thanks again for the response. I have checked through the device manager, where I have made all hidden and ghosted (if there was any, I'm not sure) and there is nothing that ha any warning symbols next to them. The only section that has any remarks is 'Other
 Devices', where there are some things for SDL router, Spotify etc (I have included a screen dump, and saved it into my Google drive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-qaSTZrtKEOemlsRGJBbFRIRDg</p>
<p>
</p><p>So do you believe that the 7034 event above could be the cause of the problem with my computer crashing? Could it be an issue with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help has been much appreciated :-)</p>

<p><span><span>On Skype, conversation history will no longer be translated, you can only translate the message you will send or receive on an active conversation. Since
 you will need to start the option for the translation first.</span></span></p>

            Hello Amelia,
<br />
<br />First We will repair the system files with SFC and DISM.
<br />
<br />1- Right click on Start Button, then select "Windows PowerShell (admin)" or "Command Prompt (admin)"
<br />2- Now repair any damage in the system files, by running this commmand 
<br />sfc /scannow 
<br />3- Then restore the System Health by running this command 
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />This command takes at least 10 or 15 minutes to complete.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, repair Office from the Control Panel
<br />First, run Quick Repair (takes 5 to 10 mins)
<br />If not better, run Online Repair (can take 30 mins to 1 hour)

<p>Well, the suggestion to disable anti-virus software was to check if there was a conflict between the update and the Anti-virus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you <span>to manually <span>reset the Windows Updates Components</span>. Refer to the steps below to
<span>reset the Windows Updates Components:</span></span></p>
<div>
<ol>
</ol>
<p><span>1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the&nbsp;following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It's part of Python for Windows <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/</a>. Python is a programming language that is used to write computer languages. It will have been installed by a Python application you have installed.
<br />
<br />
It might help to reinstall it, but it could be that the program in question (the Python program you are running, not Python) has a bug.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Hans<br />

            I have made an earlier post, last week I believe, regarding this nightmarish update issue and I think my problem is similar to yours; however, my cum update numbers are a little different.&nbsp; For instance, my initial problem stemmed from not being able to
 successfully install updates (v1709) numbered KB4088776 and KB 8058043 plus an update for Adobe flash player KB 4088785.&nbsp; I have spent untold hours on the phone with Microsoft level 2 tech support and this issue is still unresolved.&nbsp; Then, tonight, to add
 insult to injury, I got a notification that there were 4 MORE updates which supposedly downloaded and needed installing with a restart, which I did, and 3 out of 4 of these failed!&nbsp; WTF!!!&nbsp; So I still have a big RED X on the Windows Defender Shield down in
 the system tray.&nbsp; So here's my question:&nbsp; Can anyone solve these update problems in easy-to-understand steps in layman's terms, or not?

They don't read their customers' response. Mostly, it is just volunteers who are given titles for kissing Microsoft's a__. You'll never get a response that will be helpful to your question.

<h2>            DirectX Won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I recently decided to check my Directx version, and saw it was at version 10, so I decided to download DirectX 11. from any site that provided the download for free. As I did this, and completed the downloading process, and I was at the installation field,
 where it would then say, I have a newer or more equivalent version of DirectX, I am running windows 10, so I don't know how to get it to install directx 11 when i'm running 10, why does it think that 10 is a newer version?</p>

            <p>What graphics card or integrated graphics does your machine use ?</p>
<p>I have the impression that Win10 may have changed the way DX is reported.</p>
<p>Instead of reporting the most recent version that comes with the OS, as was the case in the past,</p>
<p>it is looking like Win10 may report what the graphics card is capable of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- It's a common misconception that Win7/8/8.1 has only DX 11, and Win10 has only DX12.
</p>
<p>Win7/8/8.1/10 all have&nbsp; of DX - 9,10 and 11.<br />
<br />
- The following is a list of the Direct X .dll's you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
Go to the <em>Windows / System 32</em> folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit). &nbsp;<br />
They are in alphabetical order and will start with d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43 &amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 these come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;43.<br />
- Win10 currently has only two d3d 12 files. One in System 32,and SysWOW64 .<br />
<br />
There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's<br />
<br />
If your Windows has all the files above it may be a file, or files, are corrupt. </p>
<p>In this case it is best to use the full DirectX Redist (June 2010) installer package as this will overwrite all the DX files.</p>
<p>btw - It is best to download any MS software from the official MS site, where they are also free.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download unpacks files to a location of your choice. You then open the folder and find the
<em>DXSETP.exe</em></p>
<p>and run that to reinstall DirectX.</p>
<p>Once the reinstall is complete you can delete the folder the files were unpacked to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A base install of FSX runs fine, it is when I apply SP1 and 2 that I get the message directx is incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean install of retail Windows 10, fully up to date, DX12, plus runtime library installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many users have FSX+service packs running on win 10, so it is not a game specific issue.</p>

            <p>You don't have the same problem as <em>Lavelbristol</em> and would do better to start your own FSX specific topic.
</p>
<p>I don't have experience with any version of FS (except the early cfs2, which runs fine on Win10).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Having similar issue. FSX will not start because directx incompatible."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue may appear to be related to DX , but unfortunately, error messages are frequently inaccurate.</p>
<p>eg - incompatible hardware is often flagged as a DX problem, which in some respects it is.</p>
<p>There are no other DX files. What you see is what you get. If they have been reinstalled that rules out</p>
<p>(or should) a corrupt file, or files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your real issue is to do with FSX .&nbsp; Possibly&nbsp; to do with your specific Win10 setup and other software</p>
<p>you may have installed. Some graphics hardware has become redundant with Win10 as well.</p>
<p>I have seen (but not read)&nbsp; many posts regarding issues with various versions of FS, on Win10 and Win7/8/8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Clean install of retail Windows 10, fully up to date, DX12, plus runtime library installed."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>DX12, at this point in time, is irrelevant to any game. There are no games yet that use DX12.
</p>
<p>Games use specific DX files.&nbsp; eg- d3d9_36.dll, d3d10_42.dll, etc. They do not use the latest versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Many users have FSX+service packs running on win 10, so it is not a game specific issue."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it's not a Win10 issue either. There is something else in your system that is different</p>
<p>to what the more successful Win10 FSX users have.</p>

            <p>It was not an FSX issue, and here my solution may help others with general DX old game issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the runtime library 2010 installer many times and all the files you listed were always present in the syswow64 and system32 folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just decided to try removing all the d3d9_xx.dll files from both folders then run the installer again. Now the game starts straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always ran the installer as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having the dll files already was maybe preventing Win10 from somehow reporting it had them installed? Anyway, maybe this feedback can help with a future win10 update.</p>

            <p>I did all what you told me, I checked to see that I indeed had those Dll's, and they were there. I downloaded the redist to ensure any corrupted files were renewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For sometime now my graphics card has been playing a major issue in me not getting a majority of things, maybe I need a newer laptop. But I have an Intel(R) HD Graphics card, my system is an Inspiron N4030, I have tried to update the HD Graphics for sometime
 now, using various methods, all to no avail, my first method was device manager's update option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second attempt was drivergent, scan all out of date drivers, as the scan showed up that my HD Graphics were indeed out of date, where as device manager told me it was up to date, however, drivergent requires a credit card which I do not have access to, as
 i'm only 15 years old. So if you have any suggestions on how I can update my driver for free, please feel free to tell me. ( I went to dell's website and found nothing )</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I missed any of your steps please feel free to remind me. ( I do not know how to get the Directx 11 from Microsoft's site, so if you could provide a link I would very much appreciate it, thank you. )</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is old, but believe it or not, these are the most recent DX9,10 and 11 files .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If there are suitable Win10 drivers for your Intel HD graphics you would download them from DELL.</p>
<p>Laptop drivers are always best downloaded from the machines mfg.</p>
<p>However, with GMA Integrated graphics, you should have never been sucked into 'upgrading' to Win10.</p>
<p>The 370M cpu (with integrated graphics) was released in 2010 with 'end of life' (translate to end of support)</p>
<p>Oct. '12, with last shipment&nbsp; April '13.</p>
<p>Driver support&nbsp; will only get worse over time (if that's possible).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before Monopoly$oft started redirecting the DX&nbsp; Web Installer page to the Win10 download page, for reasons</p>
<p>unknown to us mortals, deleting specific DX files, when they were listed in an error, was a good method of</p>
<p>replacing a corrupt file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I had not previously heard of the Runtime installer (June 2010) not properly replacing corrupt files, which</p>
<p>is what must have been the case here, as it overwrites (or should) all DX files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the&nbsp; old Web Installer did not overwrite existing files, it only installed 'missing' files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Cheers.</p>
