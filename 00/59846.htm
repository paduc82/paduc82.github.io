<h2>            Xbox One X Low Framerate</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello everyone. About 1 year ago I bought an Xbox One X to increase the performance of many games and have a better gaming experience, and it was like this until about 2 months ago when I realized several problems and crashes that occurred in my xbox.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>At first I noticed only a few minor problems such as the volume that was sometimes isolated from the games and was not played, then there were numerous crashes of games and apps that made it impossible for me to play.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought they were small problems that could happen sometimes, but a short time ago I started to notice small drops of framerate in many games, mainly in those optimized for xbox one x, being only some decline of framerate I did not give them weight,
 but now most of the games start and continue very slowly, both in the gameplay and in the animations, it does not seem to play in an xbox one x.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Having noticed these numerous problems I called the microsoft service and sent my xbox one x, still under warranty, to a repair and control center in Frankfurt, Germany.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After 2 weeks the xbox returned, with her there was a note saying that a factory reset had been made and nothing more, because no problems were found in the console.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I tried to turn it on and after reinstalling some games I found that nothing had changed and that the games were still slow and the numerous problems continued to exist, the last case I found is with Jump Force, which is also optimized for xbox one
 x, in which the slowness of animations and gameplay is impressive with continuos scary drops of framerate.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I find myself stunned and I do not know what to do, I do not feel like sending the xbox to do another check because I do not think it would be useless.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>So I was wondering if someone else had ever get to this kind of situation and if maybe someone could help me or if it was possible to get a change, of the xbox, from Microsoft (even if I think the latter is not possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot to everyone in advance for possible answers and help, unfortunately I had to write a lot to better describe my situation at the time.</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Sorry to hear that the issue was not fixed when you sent it in for repair. You may want to consider contacting
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
your nearest Microsoft store</a>. Set up an appointment if they allow the exchange of consoles. Keep in mind, your console would still need to be under warranty to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Surface Book goes to sleep after 30 seconds after upgrade to Build - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book goes to sleep after 30 seconds after upgrade to Build 17763</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a newly unboxed Surface Book (it is a spare we have not opened for over a year).&nbsp;Using the Media Creation Tool, I upgraded Windows 10 on the machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From System Information, it is now running Windows 10 Pro, Version 10.0.17763 Build 17763</p>
<p>
</p><p>It goes to sleep after 30 seconds every time I start it or bring it back from sleep. I have timed it with a stopwatch and this is very consistent. This is very annoying since I cannot do much diagnosis of the machine when it goes to sleep every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in a different post that I could uninstall the display adapter. However, in the Device Manager, there are two display adapters: Intel HD Graphics 520 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M. If the solution is to uninstall the display adapter, I have four questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Which display adapter (Intel or NVIDIA) should I uninstall? Or, should I uninstall both?</p>
<p>2) This is a simple question, but, I figure I should ask: If I uninstall a display adapter, does that mean the display will no longer work?</p>
<p>3) To uninstall a display adapter, should I select "Uninstall Device" from the Drivers tab of the properties for the display adapter?</p>
<p>4) What do I do after uninstalling the display adapters? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

            Hi Don
<br />
<br />I would not uninstall the driver yet, try this first:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit 
<br />
<br />Restart then check if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display adapters
<br />
<br />Right click the Intel display driver
<br />Click Rollback
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the super quick reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried powercfg -restoredefaultschemes&nbsp;and then restart. Unfortunately, that did not fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Device Manager, there are two display adapters: Intel HD Graphics 520 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 965M. Neither display adapter has a "Rollback" option. So, per your instructions, I will have to "Uninstall". But, which display adapter should I install,
 the Intel or NVIDIA display adapter? Or both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

            Usually its the Intel Display driver that is the culprit, so uninstall that first.

<p>Hi again Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Intel Display adapter and that did not help. Actually, I uninstalled it twice. For some reason after uninstalling it and restarting, the Intel Display adapter was still there. So, I uninstalled it again.</p>
<p>Then, I uninstalled the NVIDIA adapter and that did not help. Again, I also uninstalled this display adapter twice since it was still listed after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting note is that when I restarted the machine, during start up, the word "Surface"&nbsp;is displayed and at the bottom of the screen is the following message: "Please wait while we install a system update" even though during the 30 seconds of uptime,
 there were no updates that I know of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the only display adapter listed is "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem still exists. The Surface Book still goes to sleep every 30 seconds. What can I do now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

            Hi Don
<br />
<br />I recommend you check Windows Update again and download the latest updates. There might be a pending firmware update you need to install.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates
<br />
<br />Download and install any pending updates.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I discovered something. I noticed that both batteries in the Surface Book show that they are not charging and the batteries are at 0%. This might be because even though the machine is new,&nbsp;it has been&nbsp;sitting unboxed for a bit more than a year. I
 removed the clipboard/tablet (I had to do it manually with a paper clip since the detach button was not working) and attached it to the base/keyboard of another Surface Book. Now, the machine does not go to sleep after 30 seconds. It seems that the "sleep
 after 30 seconds" problem is related to the batteries being at 0% and not charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I will do all of the Windows Updates while it is attached to the other base/keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a new problem has to be solved: Why are the batteries of a brand new Surface Book&nbsp;not charging? Perhaps I should post this as a separate question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

            Hi Don
<br />
<br />It could be a manufacturers defect, I would return the device or take it to a Microsoft Store so they could further diagnose or replace it with a new one.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the super quick reply. Does the Surface Book have a battery issue that is a well-known manufacturers defect that is like the one I described? If so, what is the chance the Microsoft Store will replace it with a new one if the machine has
 been sitting as a spare for more than a year?</p>

</p>
<p>^^ What this means is this was likely NOT caused by software, but an IRQ request or another hardware related issue did. Essentially there was a bus communication issue (CPU, RAM, video card itself, etc).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is only so much you can do with a bugcheck like this until it comes down to a faulty processor that will need to be replaced. Start from 1 and work downward. Before doing so however, two things to make sure of is that your RAM and video card are not
 faulty:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Run Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):<br />
<font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>Memtest86+:</font></p>
<p><br />
<b><font>Download Memtest86+ here:</font></b> </p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff"><font><span><u>http://www.memtest.org/</u></span></font></font></a>
</p>
<p><br />
<b><font>Which should I download?</font></b> </p>
<p><br />
<font>You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).</font>
</p>
<p><br />
<b><font>How Memtest works:</font></b> </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font>Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font>The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps
 because of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font>Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that
 memory performance is error-free with these faster settings.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font>Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.</font></p>
<br />
<p><font>This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font>Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:</font></p>
<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<b>2.</b> If Memtest is clean, Furmark to test your video card under stressful conditions:<br />
<br />
<p><b><font>Furmark:</font></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font><span>FurMark Video Stress Test - free from here: </span></font><a href="http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff"><font><span><u>http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/</u></span></font></font></a></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>FurMark Setup:</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>- If you have more than one GPU, select Multi-GPU during setup</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>- In the Run mode box, select "Stability Test" and "Log GPU Temperature"</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>Click "Go" to start the test (Looks like it's "BURN-IN test" now)</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>- Run the test until the GPU temperature maxes out - or until you start having problems (whichever
<br />
</font></p>
<p><font>comes first).</font></p>
<p><font><br />
</font></p>
<p><font>- Click "Quit" to exit</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><u><b>---------------------------------</b></u></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your RAM and video card respond positively to diagnostics, follow the below steps:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<b>1. </b>Ensure your temperatures are within standard and nothing's overheating. You can use a program such as Speccy if you'd like to monitor temps -
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/speccy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/speccy</a><br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Clear your CMOS (or load optimized BIOS defaults) to ensure there's no improper BIOS setting -
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>Ensure your BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
<b>4. </b>The <i><b>only</b></i> software conflict that can usually cause *124 bugchecks are OS to BIOS utilities from manufacturer's like Asus' AI Suite. If you have something like this software-wise, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. </b>If all of the above fail, the only left to do is replace your processor as it is faulty.<br />

            <p>Hi R e i,</p>
<p>Unfortunately you cannot save the
Sticky Notes, however you may open it through
Start Menu Search. To do so follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b> and type
<b>Sticky Notes</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now save the “to-do list” and don’t X’ed out the Sticky Notes</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b>Close the Sticky Notes from Taskbar menu by right clicking on Sticky Notes.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>The next time you will open the Sticky Notes through Start Menu Search, it will open the Sticky Notes you had saved last time.</p>
<p>You may also refer the link provided below which has the similar issue.</p>

<h2>            Summon signs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm about 15-20hrs into the game, and I have seen ZERO summon signs. &nbsp;Lots of ghosts and messages, but never the chance to join anyone's game. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've played as both Hollow and Human. &nbsp;Are the summon stones dropped anywhere? &nbsp;Or am I supposed to be looking
 in certain places? &nbsp;(eg, by the Gargoyles). &nbsp; I have not put down my own summon stone yet, is that the reason?&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, first, you need an item that allows you to put down signs and summon people to your game, just like the orange soapstone that allows you to put down messages.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You need the white soapstone. If you know where the red dragon is, the dragon where you get the drake sword from, right after you defeat the tartus demon on the bridge, you head the opposite direction the dragon is at on that same bridge.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Say, if the dragon is forward on that bridge, you go backwards on that same bridge to the very end.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>There's a knight with white armor, talk to him and he will give you the white soapstone.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With that item, you can summon others and be summoned. To summon others, you just have to be alive and look for the summons signs on the ground, trust me, if you see it, you'll know what it is. it's bright and you can see it from a far distance too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>and for others to summon you, you have to be hallow(dead) and you have to physically use the stone to put your sign on the ground. Your sign will appear in other peoples games in the spot you left it at. so use it in a spot that seems like it would have
 heavy traffic.</p>

<p>and it also helps to be in the same covennt as other players since the game will be more likely to par you up and show the signs.
</p>
<p>and you wont really find any signs in an area where you have beaten a boss already, or are more the 10 levels appart from other players</p>

<p>I have a summoning stone, I haven't dropped my own yet. &nbsp; &nbsp; So if I drop a stone, someone can summon ME? &nbsp;Correct? &nbsp; However, I have not seen anyone else's summoning sign, whether I'm Hollowed or Human.</p>

<p>You'll never see summon signs when you are Hollowed. &nbsp;Also, when you put down your own Summon Sign you may have to wait a bit for someone to summon you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So how often do you guys see summoning signs when I haven't seen ANY? &nbsp; Is this a problem with users not putting down stones? &nbsp; Or is this a problem with all the random servers the game uses to try and prevent us from playing with our friends? (thanks for
 nothing Namco Bandai, btw!) &nbsp;With all the hype and emphasis I've heard about how important co-op is to this game, it seems to be a real kick in the pants that co-op (for me) is non-existent.

<p>Well another big thing is the level difference thing. &nbsp;You'll only be able to summon/be summoned by people who are around a relative level you yours (last I heard, it was within 10% of your level and not the previously announced 10 levels)</p>

<p>10% . &nbsp; Wonderful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And N-B answered part of my question with this:</p>
<p><em>The area boss (Taurus Demon, Bell Gargoyles, Moonlight Butterfly, etc…) in the host’s world must still be alive. A client can still be summoned even if the client has already defeated their own area boss....</em></p>
<p><em>The host must not have placed down a summoning sign. Summoning signs from other players will not appear in a host’s world if the host also has placed a summoning sign down. This is to prevent a network conflict of the host joining
 someone else's game world while the clients are trying to join the host's game world.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, you must be either actively looking bring in someone who placed a stone, or place my own stone and have someone call me up? &nbsp;Correct? &nbsp; Still, after 20ish hours, most of which were in the Undead Parish I should have seen some summoning signs?!?!
 &nbsp; The Bell Gargoyles are still alive in my game.</p>

<p>Correct. &nbsp;You have to either want to summon someone as a Human, and not have down your own sign to be summoned, or put down a sign yourself as a human/hollow and wait for someone to summon you. &nbsp;Also, that level requirement thing comes in to play as well
 as there being more than one server right now I think. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds to me like the number of servers reducing the the pool size of available players is the largest factor here. Perhaps even more so than the level restrictions, which are already pretty draconian.

<h2>            Printer Spooler Stops</h2>
                    I&nbsp;am trying to get my printer to print. I keep getting an error the local spooler service is not running.
<br />
I went through steps to restart the spooler service (below). But it immediately stops again when I try to print<br />
<br />
1. Click START<br />
2. Type 'cmd' (without quotes). Right click the result (there should only be one)<br />
and select 'Run as Administrator'<br />
3. Type net stop spooler and press enter<br />
4. After it confirms the service has stopped, wait 10 seconds<br />
5. After 10 seconds, type net start spooler and press enter<br />
6. Wait 10 more seconds and then check the printing que again, it should be gone

</p><p><span><span>- Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
Not that I can think of, as it was a while back that this has started happening and I thought it was a Windows 10 bug, but realised it was something else when it still wasn't fixed after I updated to the latest version.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Do you see any error message on the screen?<br />
No error messages other than the ones listed in the event log (as posted in the OP).</span></span></p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<h2>            Where are the settings for the Action Centre please&#63; Win10</h2>
                    <p>I'm using my laptop more often than I'm not so I'm pretty much up to date with&nbsp;what's happening, especially in threads in the forums here. I'm bombarded with notification emails but I'd prefer that to not receiving them so what I don't need is also to be
 bombarded with Action Centre notifications about the email notifications.&nbsp;And should one arrive when I'm reading or typing, the size of the&nbsp;notification often interferes with what I'm doing. This one didn't as I'd moved up this reply to leave a huge space
 as I was expecting it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/448abf9b-e414-4b6b-a87a-73e81b771efa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/448abf9b-e414-4b6b-a87a-73e81b771efa" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked via Start but can't find any reference to Action Centre; a search of the Community found nothing that was relevant. Are there settings that we can change please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS My Action Centre showed the last 10 messages - for some reason that's now 20. Were these Action Centre notifications changes to do with Creators Fall WU?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Recovery, Restore, chkdsk and sfc failures - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andywhite1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Recovery, Restore, chkdsk and sfc failures</h2>
                    <p>Sorry in advance for the long post. I have tried many things over the past several days and wanted to document as much as I could remember/reproduce.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past few days, my Surface Book has encountered the BSOD every time within 5 minutes of logging in. The error message is always the same "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log in without issue and use the computer for ~2-5 minutes before encountering the BSOD. I have tried safe mode and a minimal boot configuration but it still blue screens after 2-5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled Bitlocker as it was causing issues with me trying to access the drive from the recovery console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is a hardware bug but I'm not sure if it's the SSD or the RAM. Since it's a Surface Book, I cannot swap them out to isolate the issue. I have tried the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool which passes the standard test. However, the 'extended' test
 hangs at 21% which is a common problem reported by others. I let it run for 8-10 hours so I think I gave it enough time (only 8GB of RAM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to Restore/Recover/Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Reset this PC' -&gt; 'Remove everything' -&gt; "There was a problem resetting your PC."</p>
<p>Once, after selecting 'Reset this PC', the computer rebooted but yielded the following error at 2%:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd787b9f-aadc-448b-9ef0-1bc471a9a8ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd787b9f-aadc-448b-9ef0-1bc471a9a8ba" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>'Recover from the Cloud' stays on 'Downloading 0%' - left over night and no progress.</p>

            This is a hardware defect. The recommendations when it comes to Surface hardware when it starts demonstrating these problems is to take it back and try getting either a refund or exchange.

<h2>            Game &#40;Rocket League&#41; Crashes When Entering Online Match</h2>
                    <p>Game (Rocket League on Steam) minimizes and maximizes when i click on something (e.g. options, change training etc.) and window completely crashes when i start game.<br />
<br />
This never happened before i factory reset my laptop.<br />
<br />
I have tried&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-valitidating the game files and to no avail.&nbsp;<br />
-reinstalling the game<br />
-run as administrator<br />
-updated my graphics card<br />
-troubleshoot compability<br />
<br />
My laptop specs are as follows<br />

<p>Thanks for the information.&nbsp; I am using Skype for Business 2016 on my desktop.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am disappointed that there is no option to delay or set specific times on when the notification will disappear.&nbsp; Perhaps future versions will be more user friendly.</p>

<p>Hey krchat,</p>
<p>With what reference are you asking this question?</p>
<p>There is a similar command i.e debug rpc for debugging <span>
remote procedure call (RPC) </span>activity. Hopefully that's what your command indicates. However, we need more information as asked above. Please provide the required details so that we can help you further.</p>

            How about adding a PIN on that same page?  This may get rid of the buggy Hello errors.
<br />
<br />If not can you try removing your Microsoft Account by signing into another Admin account on the PC, remove the MS account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users, restart PC, then add it back again in the same place.
<br />
<br />If you don't have another Admin account then see if you can change to a Local Account at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info at the link below the email address to Sign in with a Local Account.  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />After a few restarts you can add your MS Account back again in the same place:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>

    <title>Network Card not connecting after waking from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yommot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Card not connecting after waking from sleep</h2>
                    After waking my computer from sleep my computer's network card does not reconnect to my router. It works when I uncheck the box "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" or when I disable and re-enable the network card (this is a nuisance).
 The problem that I am having is that the checkbox "Allow the computer......" keeps checking itself. Any idea on how to completely disable this?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Professional. It was working fine in Vista. Thanks for you help!

<span>,</span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows 7 Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to gather some more information to help resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I know whether it&nbsp;is a wired or wireless network?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Modify the default power saving power plan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modify the default on-battery power setting for the wireless network adapter. Configure the wireless network adapter to use the
<strong>Maximum Performance</strong> setting when Windows Vista or Windows 7 is configured to use the
<strong>Balanced</strong> power plan or the <strong>Power saver</strong> power plan. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><span>,
 type <strong>Power Options</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>Power Options</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.</span></p>
<p><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><span>If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Change plan settings</strong> under the power plan that is selected. For example, if the
<strong>Balanced</strong> option is selected, click <strong>Change plan settings</strong> under
<strong>Balanced</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Power Options</strong> dialog box, expand <strong>Wireless Adapter Settings</strong>, and then expand
<strong>Power Saving Mode</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the list that appears next to
<strong>On battery</strong>, click <strong>Maximum Performance</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Use the "High performance" power plan</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the computer is running on a power plan other than the
<strong>High performance</strong> power plan when you connect to a wireless network, manually change the power plan to
<strong>High performance</strong>. To do this, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type
<strong>Power Options</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then click
<strong>Power Options</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list.</span></p>
<p><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span><span>If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You can also right-click the battery icon in the notification area to access the
<strong>Power Options</strong> command. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>High performance</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can create a new user account</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open User Accounts by clicking the
<span><strong>Start</strong></span> button, clicking <span>
<strong>Control Panel</strong></span>, clicking <span><strong>User Accounts and Family Safety</strong></span>, and then clicking
<span><strong>User Accounts</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>Manage another account</strong></span>.<span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>Create a new account</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            may be one of two issues i have come around. not isolated to windows 7, yet <br />
just about any OS<br />
<br />
one of two situations i have seen:<br />
<br />
1:) the oldfix for this issue was to update the <strong>motherboard chipset driver</strong><br />
<br />
specifically the <strong>AGPmini<br />
Accellerated Graphics Port</strong> driver within <strong>Device Manager(System Devices)<br />
</strong>install the motherboard update from the motherboard manufacturers website<br />
ENSURE YOU HAVE THE CORRECT UPDATE for your motherboard model<br />
for most systems, without this, your video card will run in PCI-Mode (<em>very slow</em>)<br />
<br />
2:) a setting in your CMOS(BIOS configuration) should allow to change the AGP rate<br />
take note of setting, and change as needed (most newer vidcards go 8X-16X)<br />
you can access your CMOS at system power-up (usually ESC,DEL, or F2)<br />
<br />
note: <strong>dont get too fancy in the BIOS as you can make your system unable to boot</strong><br />
ask your administrator or a friend that knows what they are doing in there<br />
<br />
PS: you may even get lucky and try to update it <strong>directly from Device Manager</strong> (worth a shot)<br />
but overall you should choose the latest chipset drivers for you motherboard as it should<br />
give best results

    <title>Cannot send emails through outlook express OR Outlook 2007 but can - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roberttowns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send emails through outlook express OR Outlook 2007 but can receive them</h2>
                    <p>Strange one - here we go.</p>
<p>Am on Optusnet Cable connection, working as usual. Discovered that I couldn't email someone, Outlook 2007 (on Win7 Pro 32 Bit)
</p>
<p>When sending it reported "auto blocked due to excessive mail" and i forget the error number now, as that seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>After much discussion with Optus it seems I ended up on a Blacklist - probably due to me sending too many messages to a mate with a hosting issue and getting a lot of rejections. I found this hard to believe since i probvably sent him 5 test messages at
 most...</p>
<p>Anyway, optus won that argument since they could not be reasoned with.</p>
<p>My usual mail configuration that has worked for years is:</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>smtp and POP3 servers both mail.optusnet.com.au</p>
<p>Popping the optus mailbox.</p>
<p>My domain emails are simply redirected to the ISP mailbox. Simple and has worked for years with no issue.</p>
<p>By then I had managed to get rid of the "excessive mail" error as Optus tell me I'd falled off the list after a timeout was lifted.</p>
<p>HOWEVER - I'm now stuck with the below when testing the mail accounrt</p>
<p><span>"Send test e-mail message: Cannot send the message. Verify the e-mail address in your account properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The server responded: 451 4.3.2 Please try again later"</span></p>
<p><span>When sending a test message I got the following
</span></p>
<p><span>"Task
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Sending' reported error (0x800CCC78) : 'Cannot send the message. Verify the e-mail address in your account properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The server responded: 451 4.3.2 Please try again later'"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ISP suggested I connect the PC straight to the cable modem bypassing the router etc. By God it worked. Much scratching of heads...</p>
<p>Desktop mentioned above is on the Optus cable internet, so I pulled out my trusty WinXP Lenovo laptop and tried Outlook Express and Outlook 2007 on the WiFi which is Optus cable...</p>
<p>Same issue on both Outlook 2007 and OE.</p>
<p>Pulled out iPhone (Optus 3G) and connected to laptop, turned off WiFi, all works fine.</p>
<p>So - the PC also works fine when connected directly to the Optus Modem (no router)</p>
<p>So.... Since I'm running a Linksys WRT54GL with DD-WRT firmware I thought I'd do the factory reset. It powered up, new Subnet, renewed address etc and got on internet fine. Outlook 2007 still had the 451 4.3.2 error.</p>
<p>Conencted to Modem again, problem gone.</p>
<p>Connected router back, updated to latest DD-WRT firmware - factory defaulted, - issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm buggered - do I have to buy a new Router - this is stupid!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else got any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>To solve the issue, I tried to delete the files in the family settings folder per another person's suggestion, but they won't delete because they are "in use by another program."</p>

            Hi Jacques, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. &nbsp;<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please answer the query below:</div>
<div><br />
•&nbsp;How do you monitor the family account activities?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to login to the Administrator account and the child should be signed out of any monitored account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to the corrupted files. I suggest you to delete those corrupted files and check, if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Make sure the child account is signed out of any monitored accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Sign in with an administrator account and find the folder that contains the corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;There are two ways to do this. The easiest way is to enter the complete file path:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the search Quick access bar under This PC Window, type <strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’d rather open each folder individually, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;Type This PC on the Search box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Tap or click on This PC tab. Open C: open the Program Data folder, open the Microsoft folder, open the Windows folder, and open the Parental Controls folder.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Delete all contents of the Parental Controls folder.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
If you wish to monitor the family account activities, When you add your child's Microsoft account to your family and turn on Activity reporting, you'll get regular activity report emails summarizing how much time they spent using their devices, the websites
 they visited, the games and apps they used, and the terms they searched for on search engines like Bing, Google, or Yahoo! Search.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The email summary gives you a lot of info about your child's activities on their devices. To see even more detail, and to change their permissions and other settings, go to their Recent activity page in the family area of the Microsoft account website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can monitor the webpages browsed on the child account from this link below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/?refd=windows.microsoft.com#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://account.microsoft.com/family/?refd=windows.microsoft.com#/</span></a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, try to refer to the link below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Monitor your child's device use with activity reports:</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/monitor-child-device-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/monitor-child-device-activity</span></a></div>
<div><br />
Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you.</div>

            <p>To answer your question: •&nbsp;How do you monitor the family account activities?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a child account under my account. Then I go the family settings at https://account.microsoft.com/family?refd=familysafety.microsoft.com#/ and click on my child's profile and view the various items and links thereunder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They've been empty lately even though she is on Edge all the time browsing. There's also a message in red:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">"It’s taking longer than usual to refresh this list. We haven’t lost any info, and we’ll update it here as soon as possible."</span></p>

            <p>I have had the same issue with my 3 kids on 2 different devices for the last few weeks.&nbsp; All of a sudden activity reporting stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an online chat with MS and they were not able to solve the issue, and I was fairly sure it's a problem at their end, not mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then today, (&amp; since installing a windows update), I&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;the red message "It’s taking longer than usual to refresh this list. We haven’t lost any info, and we’ll update it here as soon as possible." and I'm starting to see activity again!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think they are working on the issue, and it's slowly being fixed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit surprised that Microsoft employees don't have any access to this kind of internal information though.&nbsp; Seems their internal communication is as bad as their external.&nbsp; If someone could provide even the slightest acknowledgment of a problem on their
 end and a timeframe of when it might be fixed, I think that would appease many users!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, they make you run troubleshooters that don't work and delete files that have nothing to do with the issue.&nbsp; Not to mention the&nbsp;delay tactic of "asking what system" you're using and other useless information.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems clear from the reposnse to your question that the person replying has pasted in a cookie-cutter response and has no knowledge of the situation behind the scenes.&nbsp; (Although I'm sure they do so with the best of intentions)</p>

            <p>Yeah, I just had a terrible experience with tech support in regards to this whole issue (several hours worth I might add). &nbsp;Tech support tried to "fix" Windows 10 (which is not broken btw) by downloading a Windows 10 repair utility and then told me the reason
 I was having issues was because my "hardware" was not compatible because the manufacturer didn't have Windows 10 as a driver option. &nbsp;That's because Windows 10 wasn't even available when I purchased the machine. &nbsp;The manufacturer shows that the specs for this
 hardware is supported and so do the minimum requirements from Microsoft - yet the tech was argumentative and insistent that she was correct and the hardware was not compatible and the reason for the Family Safety not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Folks - THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HARDWARE - IT IS YOUR FAILED HOSTED SERVICE!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support I have gotten from Microsoft hasn't changed in the last 20+ year - crappy! &nbsp;You need to hire people who don't read from a script and actually know the product! &nbsp;The service does not work, my machine is working fine. &nbsp;With all these other people
 having the same problem, you need to actually take a look at your service - not keep having your user community run-around in circles doing stupid, unrelated activities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No wonder OS manufacturers like Apple and Linux are taking the market away from you. &nbsp;Your support is pathetic.</p>
<p>

            <p>Useless reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first link doesn't apply to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second link just goes to family monitoring. I know how to get there. It's just not listing websites visited on Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for&nbsp;copying and pasting useless advice and wasting my time.</p>

            <p>Antony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;The information you provided me is from 2013 and applies to OS versions prior to Windows 10. &nbsp;However, just as a quick follow-up, I started to see activity (although not completely accurate) start to show-up in the activity reporting
 2-days after I created my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is most upsetting to me is that someone in Microsoft support not only gave me the WRONG answer, but was aggressive and argumentative (belligerent???) that they were correct in their assessment of needing to re-install my operating system and that my
 hardware was not supported, and yet as you can plainly see - was not the case at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These types of support issues is one of the reasons why I left using Microsoft as a primary operating system and I would have thought that the company would make better strides to improve this, but apparently not. &nbsp;I know that it is very challenging to find
 decent support staff, but unless Microsoft does something to train their techs to be a bit more intelligent in their troubleshooting assessments, they will continue to be low on the totem pole for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, I talked to 3 support people and they ALL gave me different answers, and the last one (detailed above) was the worst.</p>

            Dealing with the incompetence of Microsofts supposed tech support is the most frustrating part of this experience. I have troubleshooted this to death. It is clearly an issue with Microsoft not our devices. My children's account were working beautifully
 until one day they stopped functioning(both their phones and PC's). I have reset phones deleted and created accounts. Nothing I do changes the fact that Microsoft has a shoddy product and service. Its no wonder Windows 10 was free.

            I wasted more days of my precious life trying to resolve this issue that I care to admit. I just can't stand Microsoft and sorry I'm stuck using so many of their products. They've robbed me of so much time.
