<h2>            OpenReport action was canceled - Error 2501</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a routine behind a command button that opens a report.&nbsp; And, of course, a 'cancel' event in the 'On No Data' property.&nbsp; The purpose for the report is to display data to the user, based on who is logging in to the database (the report) before the application
 displays the Main menu.&nbsp; So, obviously, there are two paths to go down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Path 1:&nbsp; The report indeed has data to display for the user logging in.&nbsp; It displays the report &gt; user closes the report &gt;&nbsp;opens the Main Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Path 2:&nbsp; No data for the user logging in.&nbsp; In this case, the message is displayed (from the 'On No Data' property) as intended.&nbsp; When the User clicks the OK button to clear the message box, the Main Menu&nbsp;is displayed (again as intended).&nbsp; However in this
 case, the Error Message pops up with the standard End/Debug options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QUESTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way for me to ignore (and/or suppress) that error message dialog from popping up.&nbsp; It is&nbsp;'scary' to the casual users, and an annoyance to others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in&nbsp;advance.&nbsp; And, as usual, if there is&nbsp;simply a keyword you can use to&nbsp;'point me' - I am happy to chase an answer from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After stupidly trying this over and over, thinking I must be doing it wrong or the next update would provide the ability to add a straight line divider. A straight line divider! What! Unheard of! Who would want that! Crazy people? I just got stupid and did
 the following...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, as far as I know, the only way this can be done is by inserting a single row table, try to get that the way you want with mysterious, ghostly commands - because you can't set table, row or cell padding or margins, because you can't...or the commands
 are buried so deep you have to ask about it on a forum, or it can be done so mindlessly simple you can't see it because you expect it to be impossible - who knows. But whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You use a table and remove all visible borders except..here it comes...the bottom one! Boom! A miracle, except it will take up too much space or something. I've found that if the line spacing becomes so completely wacked or it just sits there too ridiculously
 tall, make it a two row table and put your copy or paragraph in the first row. Or put iOS Word in there and crush it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then spit.</p>

            <p>Hey. Hi. To which straight line are you referring?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've &nbsp;seen this answer in other replies to 'straight line' questions. I am referring to iOS Word. There is no 'straight line' mechanism in iOS Word &nbsp; unless you are referring to the line height of the empty space in a table row where you have put a border
 on the bottom of the row. Or, I guess, you could use a single column, one row table and put a border on one side or the other, but I don't see how you would collapse the width of that column to nothing but the border, and so the one column, one row table would
 interfere with content unless you can put it on top with no wrapping. But maybe you do want some kind of wrapping on a vertical line, but then the uncollapsable width and margins you can't control would prohibit positioning it where you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you are speaking of Word on some other platform or there is a new version of iOS Word, which would be great, because I auto download App updates. Or maybe there are settings for controlling dividers I have never found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably know you can't use a line shape because you can't keep it straight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you know about line options for iOS I don't know, please advise.</p>

            <p>Since this bit of forum section is for Office for iOS, that's what I thought you had in mind when you replied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I misunderstood your reply. I assumed you were referring to the iOS version of Word. Because my previous post was about being unable to use the line shape to put a straight line on the page (it always ends up slightly angled, a bug I think), that's what
 I took your reply to be about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I see you are referring to table cell padding. Since you're not familiar with iOS Word, you're probably shocked to learn that you can't control padding or margins on tables or table cells. Anyone who uses desktop or cloud Word would just assume device
 versions would include the same ability, because — because then why use tables at all if you can't control them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just odd. From some other forum posts I've read I understand these things (straight lines; cell padding) are low on the developers' priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.<br />

            <p>Nowhere has Doug mentioned table cell padding or anything else except line shapes. Doug doesn't have an iPad; neither do I. So please answer these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you draw a line shape in Word for iPad at all?</li><li>If so, having drawn the line, can you format it? That is, when you select it, do you get something like the
<strong>Drawing Tools | Format </strong>tab shown below?</li><li>If so, the way to get a straight horizontal line is to set its height to 0; for a vertical line, set the width to 0.</li></ol>
<p>In desktop Word 2013, these controls are shown on the Ribbon this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df0ab325-c97b-4663-b16e-eb68f7261817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df0ab325-c97b-4663-b16e-eb68f7261817" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows the 0" setting for a horizontal line. If you click the dialog launcher in the bottom right corner of the
<strong>Size</strong> group, you get this dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e73639-d297-4a34-a388-49ab32feb59d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3e73639-d297-4a34-a388-49ab32feb59d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have anything comparable to this in Word for iPad?</p>

            <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi I have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On iPad, you place lines and shapes with your fingers to make use of the tablet functionality (note this is NOT the same as MS Word on a Surface or other tablet PC - the iOS version is different!) When moving a line end point, it seems to jump to an invisible
 grid, however always at different grid lines to the other line end point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I suggest that moderators get an iPad to be able to follow the issues reported here? This whole discussion is pointless if the issue cannot be replicated by the forum moderators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is clearly a bug and it is annoying and from what I have seen, it has been already reported a year ago and no fix ever since, despite of several updates. Can it be that difficult?</p>

            Moderators are all volunteers and can't be expected to replicate every technology that users have. While there are probably other users in this forum who have iPads, perhaps they haven't yet seen this thread. Meanwhile, you haven't answered the question
 I posed to webwerker about whether there were any dialogs on the iPad similar to what is found in the desktop version.

            <p>Hi. The answer about options available for lines, shapes, tables, etc. in iOS Word is: there are none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is why we we are talking past each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In iOS Word there is a library of shapes. A straight line is one of those shapes. When added to a page it appears with a control point on each end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The height of the line cannot be specified. I suppose it is a pixel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can touch and drag the line to move it. As you do, it moves content out of the way. The margins or space above and below the line cannot be controlled although the line-height of surrounding text can be controlled somewhat which can help with layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The control points on either end can be used to angle the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no other line controls or refinements. The bug we're referring to is that it is impossible to use the control points to produce a flat, horizontal line. When attempted, one end or the other will jump up or down a few pixels so that the line is
 always at an angle. It's like playing with a see-saw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround I mentioned is adding a single row, single cell, full width table and selecting the table design option (options which are also limited and can't be modified) to add a line to the bottom of the table.</p>

            <p>The same bug affects lines in the desktop version of Word, and the only solution is to adjust the height/width using the Format Shape controls. If there are no such controls in iOS Word, then your workaround will have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the bottom line is that the full panoply of Word features is available only in the desktop version; Word Online is very basic, and the tablet versions are apparently only one step better. Despite the obvious convenience of tablets, and despite commercials
 that make it look like you can substitute a tablet for a laptop, a tablet is basically a toy--good for many things, but not up to the requirements of Word power users.</p>

    <title>Crashing on browsing for or saving a new document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Crashing on browsing for or saving a new document</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone. I keep encountering a grievous error wherein I can't browse for a file inside Word for it will immediately crash upon pressing browse OR if it will open it will open and when I click on a folder like Documents, it will crash. Or if I start
 a new document and click Save As it will crash when browsing for where to save it. I tried repairing, uninstalling and reinstalling but it still happens. I don't know if it has anything to do with recent autorecovered files but that's when it started was an
 inability to save a recovered file. I can open files fine from Explorer and save that specific file as well. Its just as soon as Word starts to use file explorer to browse for a file it will crash. Or rather hang indefinitely and I have to end the task in
 task manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Problems with Thai language font</h2>
                    <p><strong>:) :) </strong></p>
<p>When I open a Thai language Word doc that someone has sent me from their Windows OS computer, the Thai font doesn't show up. All I get is blocks where the Thai language should be. Funny thing is that I can type in Thai, even on the doc from someone else,
 it's just that the Thai language font doesn't show up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On March 21, 2012, joefromthai gave this answer to MichaelMcMullen but I'm guessing Michael had a different situation / problem.
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/outlook-will-display-thai-characters-but-word-wont/a34ae4b6-814b-45a1-a5b3-717976f3ae35">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mac/forum/macoffice2011-macword/outlook-will-display-thai-characters-but-word-wont/a34ae4b6-814b-45a1-a5b3-717976f3ae35</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>He said to download the fonts here, which I did, then to follow the rest of the directions, which I did. Still, opening a Word file in Thai doesn't give me Thai language.

<div>- Expand the archive.</div>
<div>- Open Font Book application, select File-&gt;Add Fonts...</div>
<div>- Add the fonts in the expanded archive.</div>
<div>
<p>- Reopen Word 2011, then select the fonts that you just added. &nbsp;Thai will work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's of any use, I've got a Macbook Air, early 2015 model, running Yosemite 10.10.3, and Word for Mac version 14.5.0.

            <p>If you return your Mac for a Windows PC to be able to read and write Thai with out a hassle, I completely understand. Or maybe you meant return Microsoft Office in exchange for LibreOffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for my own curiosity and for other users, I'd like to find out how to solve this problem. Fonts have different encodings. This is why a Unicode font can display characters that an older font can't. This is why the Internet solution you found is so popular,
 because the fonts will display a Thai Word for Windows document on a Mac in legible form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open the document where the text appears as blocks, use Edit&gt;Select All, then use Format&gt;Font to change the font to one of the new Thai fonts you just installed, does that change the text to something you can read?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Account Not Needed to Use OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Not Needed to Use OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 ships with OneDrive installed and fully integrated into the operating system. Not only that, if I want to change OneDrive settings, I have to sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested in using OneDrive, but I don't want OneDrive to be integrated into Windows. Rather, I want OneDrive to behave like a typical application that I can open and close as I choose. And I don't want to have to sign in to Windows with a Microsoft
 account in order to change my OneDrive settings. To be frank, I want to avoid signing in to Windows with a Microsoft account as much as possible. So I tried this experiment in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely removed OneDrive. Then, I went to the OneDrive website and downloaded the OneDrive installer (for Windows 7 and 8) to my local account. I ran the installer and, guess what, it installed just fine and I was able to configure my settings from
 my local account. Of course, in order to sync my files I had to sign in to OneDrive. But I'm doing that from my local account. That's a lot different from signing in to Windows with a Microsoft account. Now I'm in control: I choose when to launch OneDrive
 and close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the use case that Microsoft has in mind for OneDrive. Microsoft prefers that we let OneDrive launch at startup and sync automatically in the background. If that's how you want to use OneDrive, well and good. However - and at the risk of being
 labelled a control freak - if you like to have control over what starts with Windows and runs in the background, and/or if you're not comfortable with sharing your activities with Microsoft, it's good to know that you can sync to OneDrive on your own terms
 and you can make this choice from a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there other people out there who prefer to use OneDrive like a typical application? Are you using the method I describe here?</p>

</p><p>- Assign Category window so that I can choose the righ category</p>
<p>- Assign "Follow Up" so that I can determine when to follow up&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I would like to have the same with sent emails.</p>

                    We'd downloaded MS Office for my daughter while still at school and used her school email to get the licence - she left school last year and we forgot that the email account was linked and that would cease when she left High School. We've just got a new
 laptop for her to use at Uni - how can we download the same version that we've already subscribed to when the email address no longer exists? I have the product ID and the old email address plus the device ID that Office is currently running, she just wants
 a copy on the laptop before Monday!&nbsp;

 from the Programs menu. I logged into my account and it only shows Project. How do I get Office 365 back?

<h2>            Outlook for Andriod</h2>
                    <p>After the Feb 22 2019 update user of the Outlook for android app on a Motorola G6 is having problems with the App.</p>
<p>The app keeps asking for them to sign in to their account and does not update the mail in the app.</p>
<p><br />
I have checked the users account (E3 office 365 account) and it works fine on OWA and desktop Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Strength Coach Template with &#39;Main Training&#39; Sheet and &#39;Input&#39; Sheet</h2>
                    <p>I am a strength and conditioning coach and I am trying to create a template in which I can utilize an input sheet and then have the values show up on my main training sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what my main training sheet looks like. Each exercise is represented by a box. The size of the box (# of rows) represents how many sets of each exercise. For example, if the deadlift box were 6 rows deep, that would indicate 6 sets of deadlift. Some
 of my rep schemes remain the same, such as 3 sets of 5 box jumps, but I want to be able to change the number of reps within each set. If you look at Day 1 Week 2, I have 3 total sets of deadlift, but set 1 is 5 reps and sets 2 and 3 are 4 reps. The dashed
 line in between the two exercises represents that these are to be performed as a superset: that is one right after the other. If the line was solid, it would represent that they are two main exercises and are to be performed one at a time. If i wanted to add
 a triset, I would have another dotted line underneath the box jumps and a third exercise underneath that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b52d01bc-4a07-4830-bec7-4ed7256068c3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what my input sheet looks like. Both of these sheets are in the same workbook. The way that I would want this to work would be that I would type in an exercise on the far left under 'Main Exercise', 'Superset', or 'Triset' and have those values appear
 under the Day 1 column to the right. For each main exercise, there may be a superset and a triset, just a superset, or it may be just the main exercise. I would also want to type in the number of reps per set under each week (W1, W2, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/586f1d5e-5a9c-42aa-a7b8-1464fb489f71" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So my main question is this: is there a way to resize the main exercise box in my training sheet that corresponds with whatever I type into my input sheet? I want all of my exercises complete with their set and rep schemes to appear automatically
 based on what I put into my input sheet. I understand that I would have to play around with shading and borders within my training sheet later, but&nbsp; want all of the exercises and corresponding sets and reps schemes to appear automatically. How would I go about
 doing this?</strong></p>

            If you want to have a cell on the training sheet reflect the value of a cell on the input sheet, on the training sheet type = then click into the cell on the input sheet you want as the source value.

            This sounds more cumbersome I would do it differently.
<br />
<br />I would have a one record table in each database with a date field. I would then run a SQL query like so:
<br />
<br />UPDATE tablname IN(d:\foldername\filename\) SET fieldname = datevalue
<br />
<br />Then your default form would include code to read and set the caption in the On Open event.

            You can change the label caption but it won't "stick" once the form is closed. I'm not sure what you actual objective is. If you want to save the label caption, the form will need to be in design mode. 
<br />
<br />If you plan on doing this regularly, the value should come from a table where it can be changed without ever going to design view of an object.

    <title>Office 365 Cutover with Azure AD Connect afterward - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -duf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Cutover with Azure AD Connect afterward</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am trying to nail down the last steps in our Office 365 migration using the cutover method, followed by enabling Azure Ad Sync for password sync.&nbsp; I have already successfully created a migration batch, had it successfully provision mailboxes and import
 mail for our users. (currently Exchange 2010 on premise)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to establish the final order of steps to complete the migration as I am seeing conflicting information online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I assign licenses in O365 before or after I turn on AD Connect?&nbsp; I read somewhere that if I assign licenses before turning on AD sync it will create duplicate user accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once AD connect is turned on, am I able to rerun a migration batch to resync mail one last time after DNS records are changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the final things that I need to do yet are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final migration batch sync</p>
<p>Assign licenses</p>
<p>Change DNS</p>
<p>Enable Azure AD sync for password sync</p>
<p>Delete migration batch </p>
<p>Decommission on premise Exchange 2010</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can definitively confirm the correct order for these actions I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>
<p>

            i dont use pictbridge, but i found your question as i am looking for doing a similar thing with a N95, on my Nokia E90 I set up LPR mode, than the correct que name(id) for the wireless device and the correct ip address on the router for instance 192.168.1.244
 Try seeing what setup functions you have on your mobile.. Meantime Ill look at pictbridge . Have fun.

Because it isn't designed to.<br />

It'll print using the PictBridge protocol, either using a USB cable or via bluetooth. Period.

<p>I've printed from a N95 8GB to an HP PhotoSmart C7280 this way...&nbsp;(Though not all network printers support the UPnP or the newer DLNA standards).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key steps I remember in setup were:<br />
- Ensure my WiFi router&nbsp;had UPnP support enabled,</p>
<p>- Connect the phone to&nbsp;the same home WiFi network that my printer was connected to</p>
<p>- Allow sharing of my photo media files&nbsp;over the network from the Nokia N95.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once set-up, when viewing a photo, choose the "Print" command.&nbsp; I think the phone looks first for a PictBridge connection. Hit cancel to move on and look for WiFi UPnP printers (or hit cancel again to look for Bluetooth printers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            screened messages&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I bought my Mum a nokia 2310 for christmas.<br />
<br />
She is using it well, but she has one problem.<br />
When her sister from Switzerland sends her a text message, it goes straight to the Screened Messages folder, without letting her know it has arrived.<br />
Is there a way that we can change this, so that she will be alerted when a message comes through.<br />
All other text messages are received in the inbox as normal, only her sister's is not.<br />
<br />
Advice would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thank you Xx

            It has nothing to do with your mother's mobile phone or its settings. The full screen message is some special type of message. This is being defined by the sender. On some internet sites where you can send free Text messages you can choose whether to send
 a normal message, or a full screen message.

            Menu / Contacts / No.screening<br />
will bring you to the "Number screening" list. Scroll down to the number you wish to delete from that list, then press Options, and then Delete.<br />
<br />
Somehow the Switzerland number was entered by mistake onto the "Number screening" list. Calls received from that number do not ring or vibrate; but can be answered if you happen to be looking at the phone and see on the screen that a call is coming through.
 Messages from that number are put into the "Screened messages" folder, instead of the usual Inbox in the messages section.

<p>Is there a setting on my Nokia 1208 that I can use to prevent incoming messages&nbsp;received&nbsp;in my&nbsp;screened messages box instead of my normal inbox or any alert?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what happened to me: I was texted about a death in the family in July 2010 and only&nbsp;came upon&nbsp;it by chance in my "screened messages" yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any solution?</p>

            yoshi---01 - You obviously have totally misunderstood the question! This is about screened messages, nothing to do with the screen!! Screened messages means you can censor certain incoming messages so that they do not appear in the regular Inbox!

            The default is&nbsp; 1.15 spacing. This is part of the normal <a href="http://addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
style</a>.<br />
<br />
Modify that style or set a different style as your default. (I use Body Text.)<br />
<br />
It's default settings are for:<br />
Font: (Default) +Body, Left, Line spacing:&nbsp; Multiple 1.15 li, Space After:&nbsp; 10 pt, Widow/Orphan control, Style: Quick Style<br />
<br />
To <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/defaultfont.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">change this in your normal.dotm</a> template so that it will be the default for you in the future:<br />
<ol>
<li>Start a new document.</li><li>Click the styles pane drop down (bottom right on styles group of home tab)</li><li>Right click on normal and choose Modify.</li><li>You can click on the icon for single spacing.</li><li>Then click the radio button at the bottom of the Modify dialog box to have this apply to "New documents based on this template."
</li><li>Click OK</li><li>Close Word. <br />
</li><li>If you are asked if you want to save changes to the document, say no.</li><li>If asked if you want to save modifications to Normal.dotm, answer yes.</li></ol>
Restart Word and see if this worked. If it didn't, write back, because you have something preventing changes to normal.dotm.<br />

It is the same this as pulling your battery (on devices
 where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ant Yeung,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for replying to my private message. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Given the screenshots, the Office suite is from Office 365 Home plan. As reinstallation and reactivation may be required during troubleshooting, we suggest you post a new thread in our
<strong>Office&gt;Word&gt;Windows 10&gt;Office 365 Home</strong> category for further investigation. The Office suite in Office 365 home plan has different installation and activation method from Office applications in Office 365 for Business plans.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, you may try the following options and sharing the results in the new thread (the video link is also helpful).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option1</span></strong><span>. Perform clean boot. It will let us know if the issue is caused by some conflicts on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Option2</span></strong><span>. Open other Office applications, check if
<strong>Insert&gt;Picture</strong> function works well. And then check if <strong>Picture&gt;Picture</strong> works well in WordPad. When we click<strong> Insert&gt;Picture</strong>, it will open the file explorer from Windows. So, the issue may be related to the operating
 system. In this situation, you may post a new thread in our Windows 10 category for professional support.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tim</span></p>

<h2>            IE 11 uses HTTP 1.0 for CONNECT requests instead of HTTP 1.1</h2>
                    <p>I'm running into a performance problem with Internet Explorer 11 and HTTP CONNECT requests going through a proxy server. &nbsp;Here is the environment:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 SP1, plus all patches via Windows Update as of August 28, 2014</p>
<p>Latest version of IE 11, specifically version 11.0.9600.17207</p>
<p>IE HTTP settings are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Use HTTP 1.1 (checked)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections (checked)</p>
<p>Proxy: &nbsp;Blue Coat ProxySG 300 running SGOS version 6.5.4.5; No authentication and no SSL intercept</p>
<p>Other browers, such as Firefox v31 or Google Chrome 36.0.1985.143m or 37.0.2062.102m use HTTP 1.1 with the CONNECT requests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a similar post <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_other/how-to-force-ie-to-use-http11-over-ssl-through/360eca2d-e290-4078-ad37-7665bec706c4">
here</a>, but the post is five years old and not relevant because I'm not doing any authentication with the Blue Coat proxy. &nbsp;The same proxy config with non-IE browsers going to the same websites yields CONNECT requests being made with HTTP 1.1 instead of HTTP
 1.0 requests. &nbsp;This appears to be an Internet Explorer bug that when IE uses a proxy server and goes to an HTTPS site, it will only use HTTP 1.0 requests instead of HTTP 1.1 requests. &nbsp;Is there an IE patch that addresses this issue? &nbsp;Or are there any plans
 to fix it in an IE 11 patch or in the next release of IE?</p>

 resetting the internet, checking the script debugging boxes in internet options, running internet explorer without add-ons, disabling google toolbar, troubleshooting, managing add-ons, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not just certain web pages that have the script errors.&nbsp;I recently
 purchased a new computer loaded with windows 10, and that's when the problems started.&nbsp; I had windows 10 on my old computer and had absolutely no problems with unending script error pop ups.&nbsp; Between the scripts errors and slow loading web pages, it is nearly
 impossible to get anything done in a timely manner.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; This problem seems to be a frustrating issue with so many people.&nbsp;

            Do you have Google Toolbar installed?&nbsp; If so, try disabling it (and then shutting down all IE windows before rerunning IE).&nbsp; If that fixes the problem you might consider&nbsp;chiming in on<a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/aQTKsZg1kWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Link goes to a problem report in the Google support forums.">
 this thread </a>in the Google forums.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first post mentions a trick using Duplicate Tab that sometimes works for avoiding the problem.

</p><p>Thanks for your response. <strong>Will you escalate this issue to your higher official or take this as a suggestion</strong>. Because, not only me Most of the office workers are need one note app without using Microsoft account. For my personal computer,
 i'm using one note with my Microsoft account.It is user friendly too. But my office system, I can't. If it not possible means, I will go to another software application to finish my work.&nbsp;</p>

Still to this day... I have visited hundreds of these question pages in this site....and not one has been given a proper answer. EVER.<br />
- A proper answer here would be to provide the reg key needed or file and data required to stop OneNote-App(not office 2016 to any foolish people ready to reply like a 12 yr old) for requiring the internet to activate **BECAUSE** Onenote-App is capable of working
 offline/locally.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Afterall, it comes pre-loaded on a windows10 machine.. like the massive amounts of other bloatware.. but you're unable to use them without internet ?&nbsp;<br />
- can't use them..can't easily delete them...<br />

<p>The Onenote App from the Windows Store is designed for "cloud only". Its ability to work offline is just a nice feature to enable changes in your notebooks while temporarily without Internet connection. To use it permanent this way is hazardous; you risk
 a complete data loss because your notebooks are only stored in a cache. A reset of the App kills it. You can find many stories about that in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW:</p>
<p>You can uninstall it:</p>

            In our office we use Office 2016 desktop (on premise) and I just click the X in the upper right without signing into any account then it proceeds right into OneNote. Or did I misunderstand the question...

<p>I know I can edit the layout of the pages (changing # of pages in layout) when I go to the print options, but there are still spaces (which are the margins) in the middle of my text and it's hard to find an appropriate format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

 to the new computer and follow the PST import process to import it into Outlook 2013 tasks on the new computer. Following this process will merge your Tasks PST file with the current Tasks in Outlook 2013 and not erase them.

<h2>            Bug in MS Excel &#40;Office 365 Pro Plus&#41;. Distorted table copied from MS Word to MS Excel.</h2>
                    <p>Tables copied from MS Word are losing their cells arrangement when pasted in MS Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce the bug:</p>
<p>1. Create a table like this in MS Word.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8892118-e8f7-4550-ab64-986bd520c18a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8892118-e8f7-4550-ab64-986bd520c18a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Copy this table and paste this in MS Excel.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d9e308c-67d6-4097-a0c1-9abb9bc87fde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d9e308c-67d6-4097-a0c1-9abb9bc87fde" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that columns near the border of "Efficiency" and "Remarks" columns are stretched or maybe one extra column is getting added because each named column has four sub columns except "Efficiency" and "Remarks" columns.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you granted Skype access to your video camera?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<span>Skype for Windows 10 (version 14)</span>:&nbsp;<br />
- Go to&nbsp;<span>Start</span>, then select the&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>gear
 &gt;&nbsp;<span>Privacy&nbsp;</span>&gt; then select either&nbsp;<span>Camera&nbsp;</span>or&nbsp;<span>Microphone</span>.
 Under both, make sure that Skype is toggled&nbsp;<span>On</span>. Restart Skype and go to your
 Skype&nbsp;<span>Audio &amp; Video</span>&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>to
 verify the correct device is selected within Skype.</li></ul>

            I thought as Alexandra has SKYPE as part of his name he was talking about the Skype application not Windows. Anyway I've followed your suggested sequence but both the camera and microphone were already marked as ON for Skype. The microphone works fine
 but Skype says there is no camera. The product is over 5 years old - I think I'll buy a new one tomorrow. Thanks for your help
