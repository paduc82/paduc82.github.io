<h2>            Word 2003&#47;2007 - help with identifying paragraphs with mismatched quotation marks</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Word 2003 (but can upgrade to 2007 if it helps) to process electronic books into the format I need for my electronic reader.</p>
<p>I am starting with copyright-free plain text from locations such Project Guttenberg and I have already built quite a few simple macros which will do much of the desired formatting for me.</p>
<p>One of the outstanding problems I have is that occasionally I get paragraph breaks in the middle of a quotation (identified by " at the beginning and end).</p>
<p>I'd appreciate some advice on building a macro which would process a document and identify where a paragraph contained an odd number of double quotation marks (") indicating that the paragraph was probably accidentally split and needs to be rejoined to the
 previous/next one to reconstruct the full original paragraph.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of a macro that stopped at each example of such a paragraph - but one which inserted a piece of predefined text at the end of all suspect paragraphs so they could be reviewed with 'find'/'find next' would be just as suitable - or any other suggestions
 as to how this problem could be tackled would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - John Stafford-Langan</p>

<p>Running a macro containing the following code will remove the paragraph break at the end of a paragraph that contains an odd number of quotation marks.</p>
<p>You will need to run it a second time if the paragraph that follows the first paragraph that contains an odd number of quotation marks contains two quotation marks (split quotations spread over three consecutive paragraphs)</p>

<p>Thank you both very much - I will set them both up and play with them on a test document and see how I get on with them.</p>
<p>I appreciate the fast response.</p>

<p>I couldn't get either of these macros to work on either Word 2003 or word 2007 - but I'm still playing with them so I&nbsp;should get there eventually.</p>
<p>The first one from Doug deletes the paragraph mark from the end of any paragraph with a " rather than one with just an odd number of ".&nbsp; I have worked around with it a bit but not managed to get it to work properly.</p>
<p>The second one from Peter doesn't do anything - I spent a bit of time looking at the regular expression but the difficulty is that with the " being a special character it makes the regex particularly difficult to get my head around.&nbsp; I have tried playing
 with&nbsp;it to use a different character to&nbsp;get the logic right &nbsp;(for example the trivial case of identify paragraphs with an odd number of 'a' characters) but when I do this and run the macro on a suitable test file it still does nothing and finishes immediately

<p>There is nothing special about double quotes, except that VBA-strings are also included in double quotes. Therefore double quotes in VBA-strings must be escaped by doubling.<br />
</p>
<p>Please replace each occurence of "" within the pattern with "a" (without the double quotes) and make the pattern case-insensitive. Like this:<br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.Pattern = "^(([^a]*a){2})*[^a]*a[^a]*$"<br />

<p>Doug,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am curious that we appear to be seeing different behaviour.&nbsp; I started from scratch again with your macro and created it in Word (working on 2003 on this system)</p>
<p>Here's the macro cut from my normal .dot (in case something got lost along the way) :</p>
<p>Sub AAA()<br />
'<br />
' AAA Macro<br />
' Macro created 6/18/2010 by 801907<br />
'</p>
<p>Dim arange As Range<br />
Selection.HomeKey wdStory<br />
Selection.Find.ClearFormatting<br />
With Selection.Find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While .Execute(FindText:=Chr(34), Forward:=True, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MatchWildcards:=False, Wrap:=wdFindStop, MatchCase:=False) = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set arange = Selection.Paragraphs(1).Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arange.Start = Selection.Start + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If InStr(arange, Chr(34)) = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arange.Start = arange.End - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arange.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Collapse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Move wdParagraph, 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my simplified test data :</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- a "b".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- c "d".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- e "f</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- g "h", "i".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- j "k", "</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>l".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- m</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The required paragraphs begin with a - character&nbsp; a is fine, c is fine, e is split, g is fine j is split and m is fine.</p>
<p>But the macro produces :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- a "b".- c "d".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- e "f".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- g "h", "i".- j "k", "</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>l".- m</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The a paragraph looses its end - despite having mached "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e is fixed&nbsp;&nbsp; g looses its end so the partial j joins it and the tail end of j looses its
 end and m joins it.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Essentially each paragraph with any number of " odd or even looses its end mark (the joined on text doesn't get processed) - after which the process
 moves on to the next paragraph.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Running the macro iteratively continues this process and again the 'new' -a paragraph above is fine so should not be affected but is :</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- a "b".- c "d".- e "f".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- g "h", "i".- j "k", "l".- m</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>and again&nbsp; (where the new a paragraph now has a matched set of 6" ) :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- a "b".- c "d".- e "f".- g "h", "i".- j "k", "l".- m</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>So the question I now have is am I missing some basic option which is making these macros run differently on my systems (one with 2003 and the other
 with 2007)&nbsp; or did I just describe the original problem badly.</span></span></p>

<p>Peter,</p>
<p>As with my answer to Doug above I am seeing different behaviour from you.</p>
<p>I started again from scratch - I set up the macro again - I replaced the regex with the version that looks for a characters.</p>
<p>Here's the macro cut from my normal.dot (in case something got lost in the process)</p>
<p>Sub IdentifyParagraphsWithMismatchedQuotationMarks()<br />
'<br />
' IdentifyParagraphsWithMismatchedQuotationMarks Macro<br />
' Macro created 6/18/2010 by 801907<br />
'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim p As Paragraph</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With CreateObject("VBScript.RegExp")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Pattern = "^(([^a]*a){2})*[^a]*a[^a]*$"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .IgnoreCase = True</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each p In ThisDocument.Paragraphs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .Test(p.Range.Text) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.Range.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>I created a simple test document with the following&nbsp;paragaphs :</p>
<p><span><span>bbbabbbb</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>bbbabbbbabbb</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>bbbabbbbabbbabbbb</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>bbbabbbbabbbabbbbabbb</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;I also created a version with this same text but with each paragraph seperated by many empty paragraphs so they were each seperated by several pages
 on the display.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I place the cursor in the home position and ran the macro - in both cases it completes immediately -&nbsp;I tried following it with debug and it just jumps
 straight through and completes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I just don't get how this code is working (or not in my case) - I'm missing how the regex gets linked to the paragraph so I just don't see what how the
 'for each p' incorporates the regex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>However, my lack of understanding notwithstanding, if it runs for you on your system and doesn't run for me on mine (again two systems one with 2003 and one with 2007, both on XP pro) then there must be something I am missing that
 at a&nbsp;general level that is causing the problem.&nbsp; I have lots of Word macros - they are mostly quite simple, made by recording and then editing them to repeat steps etc.&nbsp; I have been working recently with simple VB macros which use message boxes to check the
 user wants to continue or which offer simple choices so I can build several tasks into a single macro and let the user choose which one to apply etc. And all these simple macros do exactly what I created them to do - so I don't understand why these two macros
 should appear to work differently on my system from yours and Doug's</p>
<p>But I must be missing something&nbsp; (besides the obvious neuron shortage).</p>
<p>Thanks, John</p>

<p>- e "f".</p>
<p>- g "h", "i".- j "k", "</p>
<p>l".- m</p>
<p>The a paragraph looses its end - despite having mached "&nbsp; &nbsp; e is fixed&nbsp;&nbsp; g looses its end so the partial j joins it and the tail end of j looses its end and m joins it.</p>
<p>Essentially each paragraph with any number of " odd or even looses its end mark (the joined on text doesn't get processed) - after which the process moves on to the next paragraph.</p>
<p>Running the macro iteratively continues this process and again the 'new' -a paragraph above is fine so should not be affected but is :</p>

<p>Here is our problem. My macro is in ThisDocument, not in Normal.dot. I should have mentioned that. That is why your macro has not found anything. It has been looking in the wrong document. I apologize for the mistake.<br />

<p>Please keep the macro where it is (in normal.dot) and change the following line<br />

            <p>Using integrated AV with outlook can cause issues, and you dont need it, as any decent AV will detect any&nbsp;problems using its default on demand scanning process.</p>
<p>Uninstall your unknown version of symantec AV, use their tool to completely remove, reinstall symantec without the OL integration</p>

<p>I had my E63 phone in my pocket - when I took it out to use it - I discovered that I could not use it as the unlock and function key would not be recognised. I tried taking the battery out and putting it back in - but everytime the phone will not unlock
 - the only key that works is the red off button to start the phone whne battery has been taken out and put back in. Then if I press it when on - says unlock and press function key - which does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you've already tried removing the battery and placing it back, I'm guessing that there is a problem with the keypad (or some keys) of your phone. I therefore suggest you to go to a local Nokia Care Point, to have this fixed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since I downloaded 9926,&nbsp;my Office 365 requires re-activation. It asks me to activate the software by internet only, without the option to activate by phone. It begins to connect&nbsp;but fails, saying 'something went wrong, we are unable to do this right now.
 Please try again later.' The error code is 0x8004FC12 - which I haven't seen listed on other forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visited 365.com and reinstalled - my accounts page says I'm registered on Windows 10</li><li>Tried temporarily turning off the firewall, and looking to see if its blocking connection.</li></ul>

<h3> nrk-31  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to install ONLY Word, Excel &#38; Powerpoint from Office Pro Plus&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a full, legal copy of Office ProfessionIal Plus 2010, and a brand new netbook.&nbsp; I can install the entire Pro Plus 2010, but I really want ONLY Word, Excel and Powerpoint on the netbook.&nbsp; When I started the installation, I did Custom install, but
 it installed everything!&nbsp; I thought I was installing just the 3 programs, but&nbsp; the entire package was installed.&nbsp; Surely there is a way to just install and use the 3 programs....&nbsp; I have the full installation on my desktop, and just need Word, Excel and Powerpoint
 on the netbook for school and travel use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for any and all advice!

    <title>Bing image search middle mouse button not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cire44wolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing image search middle mouse button not working</h2>
                    When image searching on Bing the middle mouse button will not open any of the related search topics in a new tab like it should. Instead it just acts like a left mb click and directs the current tab to that search topic. The middle mouse function works
 properly anywhere else. In an open space on the page it toggles the free hand slide scrolling. On any other link, even on a bing page, it opens in a new tab. This only happens with bing image search related topics.<br />
<br />
Also I use G Chrome browser which is up to date. This is purely localized to these specific links on bing.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. <span>&nbsp;</span>You seem to have an issue with opening images on BING by clicking the Mouse middle button (Wheel).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Opening the images from the BING images in a new Tab/Window depends on the content provider. Let’s diagnose the issue by referring to the following suggestion.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps and check the issue status.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>BING</strong> home page.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>Gear</strong> icon (<strong>Right top corner – Next to user account name</strong>) of the BING home page.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Web</strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Check for the <strong>Open links in a new browser Window</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>save</strong> the changes.</span></li></ol>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>Try to open the images from the BING (<strong>Web</strong> search) and check the issue status.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open the BING home page.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Search for the content which has images (<strong>Web</strong> search).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click on the images using Mouse middle button (Wheel) and check the issue status.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To understand BIING images settings better, you can refer to the following suggestion.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to BING images, you can right click on the image, you will be able to choose “Open in a new Tab”. If you select “Open in a new Tab”, you will get a Window, which you get by double clicking the image (Image appears on same
 Window).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can send a feedback by clicking a <strong>
Feedback </strong>option ( right bottom corner) of the BING home page. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hope this helps. Please do let us know if you need further help.</span></span></p>

            I had the same problem: in various ways the phone simply refused to connect to my laptop via Bluetooth (C7 w/Nokia Anna + Windows 7). Finally I went to the laptop vendor's (Lenovo) site to seek for an updated Bluetooth driver and performed the driver update.
 Then I initiated the Bluetooth pairing process from my C7 and the magic happened: my phone is now natively visible for my Windows 7 laptop and also Nokia Suite is now able "connect" with it.

<h2>            OneNote 2013 &#40;desktop&#41; won&#39;t stop sync&#39;ing...</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Send to OneNote print dialogue for a big PDF file of notes containing 226 pages. &nbsp;Though the conversion took awhile, it was successful and created an approximately 60 MB local ".one" file in my OneNote Notebooks folder under My Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that once I copied the imported pages to a notebook residing on OneDrive (the notebook was created using OneNote Metro version), during sync the Shared Notebook Synchronization pop-up box shows that it never finishes. &nbsp;As shown below, it's
 stuck on "1 syncing" forever (5+ hours now...)<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffbad402-4cc3-4929-b1d1-ba5ec3c396a0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it seems to continuously upload data even after I press the Close button. &nbsp;Curiously, after I press Close and then re-open the box by right clicking the notebook and selecting "Notebook Sync Status..." it changes to show &nbsp;"0 up to date, 0 syncing,
 1 not connected." &nbsp;This is after 5 hours of waiting and 1.9 GB uploaded according to a metering program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite this strange behaviour, when I open OneNote Online in Chrome, it shows that the sync worked; all the pages are there. &nbsp;So what is OneNote uploading that makes it 1.9 GB and why won't it stop when the online version shows the changes made? &nbsp;This happens
 every time I try to sync this notebook now.</p>

            <p>I did this several times. OneNote was unresponsive for the 3-4 times that I tried to reopen the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I closed the notebook and opened it from the OneNote web app. Now it seems to work, thanks.</p>

    <title>Can I set the file synchronizer to folder level&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lapstam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I set the file synchronizer to folder level&#63;</h2>
                    I've created a "My Documents" folder on the memory card and also have the default folder with the same name on the device (wm6.1). It looks like the file synchronizer in Vista's mobile device center is clever enough to synch both those folders without
 any input by me - at least I cannot recall any settings somewhere which allow me to decide which folders on the units should be synched. Does it make sense? Is it possible to set rules for synching, or excluding subfolders?
<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            As far as I know, when you ask the syncing software to sync documents, everything in the My Documents folder gets synced.&nbsp; There's no way to set rules to sync only specific folders and subfolders within the My Documents folder.<br />

<h2>            XV6800 - Not Receiving Reminders and Alarms</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings! I am having trouble getting alarms and reminders to work on my phone. I am able to set the alarms and I set reminders for appointments, but the phone does not wake up to deliver the sound notification. I have checked all of the setting
 I know to try and still it does not work. I went under Settings / Sounds &amp; Notification anh have checked the settings there. I have checked the settings under Clock &amp; Alarms and have set several alarms, but it still does not wake up the phone to sound the
 alarms. Also, my Outlook reminders provide no notification whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm rather frustrated with this, because alarms and reminders are a big part of why I bought this device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is the possibility that some piece of software has it disabled somehow.&nbsp; If you have checked the sounds, verified that there is sound from your device and you are sure the alarms are set right, then I might consider doing a hard reset to bring it back
 to factory defaults.</p>

    <title>Office 365 Personal Won&#39;t activate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siennapemberton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Personal Won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased Office 365 Personal for my laptop. I installed it but when I went to use it it said I had to activate it. However every time I try to activate it it says that the email I'm using isn't associated with the product. I know it's the email used
 for the account it was bought with and when I log into my account it says I have the product but that I haven't used any installs. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling it, resetting my password and trying my other emails just in case another one would
 work but nothings working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*12/05/17 Opened Word today and this time when I tried to activate it it worked. So maybe mine just needed a little to finish processing or something. Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            Synching multiple email accounts on my Blackjack II</h2>
                    
<p>I have a single computer (Vista) and single mobile device (Blackjack II).&nbsp; I have two email accounts (.hotmail, .live) pointed at my local outlook on my pc.&nbsp; The .live account is&nbsp;actually&nbsp;a private domain name (my business) which&nbsp;I&nbsp;set up&nbsp;in the past two
 weeks or so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Problem: while the .hotmail account synchs with the mobile, the .live (aka, private domain) account --with mail and calendars-- does NOT.&nbsp; I have searched and can't find a solution.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Using POP, how do I mark a message as unread on the server&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikej25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using POP, how do I mark a message as unread on the server&#63;</h2>
                    How can you, using POP with Outlook 2010, make it so you can mark a message as unread and it does so on the server as well? I know it is possible, because my friend has done it for a long time. However, they recently had to reinstall Outlook 2010 and the
 settings are now lost and I am trying to help them figure out how to do it again.<br />
<br />
I realize I could use IMAP, but for whatever reason they want to keep it as a POP account. So if anyone knows how to solve this dilemma, it would be most appreciated. Thanks!<br />

The email account was created via HostMonster, and is associated with a domain hosted there. It used to be hosted on a GoDaddy server, and it was after the change that we could not make my friend's account work again.

<p>Hello DEBJANI CHAKRABORTY,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better know about your issue, I’d like to confirm, whether this team group you want to join in is existed in your organization? Login Teams Web App to check if you can join in the group.
 At the meantime, try to update Teams desktop app. Please also collect a test group link then try to join in this test group to see if issue follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, for caa20004 error, this kind of error often occurs when user tries to sign-in Teams, to better look into this issue, I’d like to collect

<p>Hi DEBJANI CHAKRABORTY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your information, it seems that your account failed the ADAL authentication. I need to involve more resource to analyze this log hence it may take some time. If there’s any updates, I will post
 back to let you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, from my checking, I noticed that there’s an error:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d like to con firm with you whether your organization is federated and enabled SSO? And your account is managed on –premises? Please check this article to see if it matched your situation:

<p>You may contact your admin to confirm it as I found there’s SSO related entries in logs and your domain seems federated. From the article, your situation is similar, however, you encountered this error when
 trying to join a group. May I further confirm with you whether this error displayed when you sign in Teams app? If you try Teams Web Version, whether issue follows?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Debjani,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We noticed that there’s also an error “Modern authentication failed here, but you’ll still be able to sign in. Your status code is 4c7”. Microsoft Teams requires Forms authentication. By default, when your
 organization deployed ADFS, Forms Authentication is not enabled for the Intranet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better help you, I suggest you need to contact your organization admin, and let him refer to this article to enable it:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4041047/modern-authentication-failed-here-status-code-is-4c7-when-signing-in-t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4041047/modern-authentication-failed-here-status-code-is-4c7-when-signing-in-t</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, please check whether there’s any error or warnings when sign-in to Teams App and whether you can join in the external group.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue still persists, we need to collect fiddler log to further checking it, please check my private messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am trying to do a mail merge and every 3rd envelope, Word crashes and I have to start over. Very tedious. I generally like Windows 8, but I am going to have to use my laptop which has Windows 7 installed to finish this project. I hope that Microsoft will

            You did not show us enough code. Do you have anything changing the StartDate value? If not, then that is the only date that will be found. I'll point out in case you it is a typo, but you are setting rStartDate (note the leading 'r' character), but searching
 for StartDate (no leading 'r'). If you post your code, we may be able to search down your problem for you, otherwise we can only take wild guesses.

<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; rStartDate is a range and StartDate is a Date value.&nbsp; I am searching a range of dates to find the cell that holds the date.&nbsp; I have done some small tests and I have found that VBA will not find a date in a range if that date is in&nbsp;its
 cell by formula.&nbsp; That was a surprise.&nbsp; I went back to my original file and wrote some simple loop code to enter all the dates (about 400 consecutive dates) without formulas and now my search code works just fine.&nbsp; Does VBA NOT find a date when that date is
 in a cell by formula or am I missing something?&nbsp; Thanks again for your time.&nbsp; Otto</p>

<p><br />
I think you are missing something. It would be easier for me to tell if you just posted your code. Without seeing&nbsp;your code, here is my guess. The value in StartDate is a String value and the date in the cell is a real Excel date. Dates in Excel and VBA are
 not what you see; rather, they are floating point numbers that get displayed looking like a date for the convenience of the human user. The whole number part of the date's underlying value is an offset from "date zero" and the decimal part is the fraction
 of a 24-hour day represented by the time. So, ignoring any time considerations, today's date (February 17, 2011) is seen as 40591. So, if you stored something like "2/17/2011", you would be asking VB to find that string of characters in values that looked
 like 40591. So, Excel will never find 40591 if you tell it to look for "2/17/2011". Store a real date in StartDate and I think all will be well. For example, change the data type of StartDate to Date and then make this assignment...</p>
<p>StartDate = Date(2011, 2, 17)</p>
<p>then try your Find function.</p>

<p>Rick</p>
<p>I appreciate your patience with my problem.&nbsp; Here is what I made to show you the problem.&nbsp; I start a new blank wb.&nbsp; In A1 I place the header "FormulaDates".&nbsp; In C1, the header "RealDates".&nbsp; In A2 I enter the date 1-Mar-11.&nbsp; In A3 I enter the formula =A2+1.&nbsp;
 Using the fill handle I drag this formula down to A6.&nbsp; I now show dates from 1-Mar-11 to 5-Mar-11 in A2:A6.&nbsp; In C2 I enter 1-Mar-11.&nbsp; Using the fill handle (no formulas) I drag this date down to C6.&nbsp; C2:C6 now shows the same dates as A2:A6.&nbsp; I name the respective
 date ranges by their headers.</p>
<p>In B1 I enter 3-Mar-11 (the date I'm searching for.)</p>
<p>I write the following code:</p>
<p>Sub FindDate()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim SearchDate As Date, rSearchRng As Range, rFoundCell As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SearchDate = Range("B1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Set rSearchRng = Range("FormulaDates")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rSearchRng = Range("RealDates")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rFoundCell = rSearchRng.Find(What:=SearchDate)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox rFoundCell.Address(0, 0)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Note that there are 2 lines that start with "Set SearchRng".&nbsp; You remark out one of them so that you are searching either "FormulaDates" or "RealDates".&nbsp; If you search "FormulaDates", the Msgbox line will error out with "Object variable or With block variable
 not set".&nbsp; If you search "RealDates" you get C4.&nbsp; My question is why is that error produced?&nbsp; I again thank you for your time.&nbsp; Your time is the most valuable thing you can give me.&nbsp; Otto</p>

            <p>While the document is in Design Mode, select an option button and click the Properties button. In the Properties dialog, assign a value to the GroupName property -- for example, use Q1 as the value for question 1, Q2 for question 2, etc. Put the same value
 in the GroupName for all three option buttons in the same question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option buttons that share the same GroupName behave as a group; clicking any one of them puts the black dot in that button and removes it from any other button. Each group is independent of all other groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've created one group, you can select the three option buttons, press Alt+F3, and save the selection as a building block. The Gallery setting in the dialog determines what kind of building block it will be, and thus which gallery (if any) it will
 appear in. Good choices would be either AutoText or Quick Parts. When you insert the building block, you still will have to visit the Properties dialog of each option button and change the GroupName to make them a separate group.</p>
