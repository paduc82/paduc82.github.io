<h2>            I can sign into Outlook, but I cannot send or receive emails. What&#39;s the problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In addition to not being able to send or receive emails, I cannot select any Folder other than Inbox. I can select Contacts and other functions,&nbsp;&nbsp;I can generate a new message; however, when I try to send the message, I get a continuously rotating circle
 of dots before the word 'sending' on the blue Outlook bar at the top of the email screen. I also see&nbsp;a line of dots running across the top of this blue bar.</p>
<p>I have had this problem on both my computers since at least 4 pm today and on Wednesday evening. One computer has Windows 7 installed, the other has Windows 8 installed. On Wed. I was finally able to send and receive emails after 9 pm on both computers.
 No such luck so far tonite. </p>
<p>As far as I know Outlook has worked well since I installed it several weeks ago other than on these two occasions. I noted that an Outlook&nbsp;problem with POP aggregation was corrected earlier today.
</p>
<p>Your timely attention to my problem will be greatly appreciated. Thanx!, hugh</p>
<p>PS: I use Internet Explorer and have checked all settings. None have changed from when I was receiving and sending emails with no problems. I routinely clean/delete my browser files&nbsp;after each use.

<h2>            location of OneNote files and file types</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need to be able to teach a OneNote workshop and there is a question that I cannot get clear on:&nbsp; How are OneNote files stored on the computer?&nbsp; In the image below, I see a file with extension .onepkg&nbsp; &nbsp;When I double click on this file to open, it is the
 recent file that I have been working on, however the date modified is listed as 2012.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aaff813-a0fd-4814-9d75-a888d6fa3cca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aaff813-a0fd-4814-9d75-a888d6fa3cca?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I look in the backups folder, I see the separate file pages with extension .one, but where is the main file?&nbsp; Which file extension should the main file have?&nbsp; What is a .onetoc extension?&nbsp; I've tried googling, asking co-workers, and poking around in Windows
 Explorer, but I can't get clear on where and how OneNote stores files.&nbsp; I appreciate any explanation that will help me explain this to a student when the question is asked.</p>
<p>

<p>First statement:</p>
<p>We talk only about so called <strong>local </strong>notebooks. <strong>Local </strong>
notebooks are stored on your computer, not in the cloud, aka OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second statement:</p>
<p>A local notebook&nbsp;is implemented as a <strong>folder </strong>within the Windows file system, which contains at least one or more sections, the
<strong>.one </strong>files, and a <strong>Open Notebook.onetoc2 file</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments:</p>
<p>In your first screenshot one sees the content of a notebook named <strong>Personal
</strong>(this is the containing folder with the name of the notebook). There is no "main file" !</p>
<p>A double click on <strong>Open Notebook.onetoc2 </strong>does what its name implies ... and the sequence of your sections in the GUI is stored in it.</p>
<p>The .<strong>onepkg </strong>file is a compressed complete notebook which is in the wrong place, it should be outside the notebook Personal's folder.</p>
<p>The structure of <strong>Backup </strong>in your second screenshot&nbsp;is similar to&nbsp;the structure of&nbsp;<strong>OneNote Notebooks
</strong>in your first screenshot. <strong>Intro to OneNote </strong>is the name of the backed up notebook. The folder
<strong>Working with ... </strong>is a <strong>section group </strong>which should contain one or more section files. The .one files are the backed up sections, including the backup date in their names.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth tile in action centre does not update when connected to a second bluetooth device</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lumia 950 and today I received build 10586.420. However, I still have a&nbsp;problem with the bluetooth tile in the action centre not updating correctly. I am using a Microsoft Band 2 and a Wireless charger (dt-903)&nbsp;with my phone. Both are connected
 at the same time. That works fine. However, that is not displayed on the tile in the action centre. It only shows the device that is connected first. It should however change to ''connected (2)'' when the second device is also connected. When going into the
 bluetooth settings, both are displayed as being connected in the list of bluetooth devices.&nbsp;To illustrate, here is an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am outside with my Lumia 950 and the Band 2. The bluetooth tile in the action centre now correctly displays the name of the band on the tile.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Tile is updated</span>. When I am home, the wireless charger also connects to my phone. The tile in the action centre however still shows the band is the only device connected.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It is <strong>not </strong>updated</span>.&nbsp;If I would shutdown the Band (and thus disconnect the bluetooth connection), it gets even worse. Then, the only device really connected is the wireless charger, but the tile
 still says the Band is the device connected to the phone!<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Again, tile is
<strong>not </strong>updated</span>.&nbsp;When I cut off the power of the wireless charger (and thus also disconnect the bluetooth connection), there are no more devices connected. The tile then correctly says ''not connected''.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Tile is updated again</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the tile in the action centre&nbsp;only updates when the first connection is made and when the last device disconnects the bluetooth connection.

JesseS930</a>! Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About your concern, wireless charging does not use the Bluetooth technology. <span>
It uses an electromagnetic field to transfer energy between the charging pad and the phone.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Band 2 is the only device that is connected through Bluetooth, it is correct if the tile does provide you with the information that it is connected with the Band 2.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello there! Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to say you are true, but unfortunately you are not. The dt-903 is a wireless charger that is also connected via Bluetooth to control the led that is beneath it. Therefore, the text on the tile of the Bluetooth in the action centre is wrong,
 as both my wireless charger and band are connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is solved in the redstone builds fortunately. So, the problem is solved after august 2 for everyone.</p>

    <title>A personalization issue that has been around since the Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A personalization issue that has been around since the Windows 8 preview not fixed yet&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why has Microsoft neglected to fix this issue of the title bar and a dark theme yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the screenshot. Windows 8 still has this issue.. can you see the problem if you do not want a bright fruity color? This is also a present problem with drop boxes in areas of the modern apps. choose black or a dark color and the dark grey of
 the title bar fonts and the min / max / close glyph's start to blend in. In fact, depending on the display, Iv seen them total disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it not be logical to have them show as white?</p>

            <p>Yes.. every version since it was released. It is a major complaint among my friends who are also testing Windows 10 and have seen the same issue in windows 8 /8.1. Should it not be fixed? Try setting your theme to black and open an explorer window or some
 other non modern app program. You will see this reproduced on your machine as well.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Balloons&#34; is greyed out in Word 2013.</h2>
                    I have a document in Word 2013 that's only showing comments in-line.&nbsp; When I click the "Show Markup" dropdown under the Review tab, the "balloons" option is greyed out - I can't select it so I can show revisions in balloons.&nbsp; (And, yes, I've also selected
 "All Markup."&nbsp; This problem is isolated to two documents sent by another person - all my other documents are fine.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks! <br />

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the balloons option is grayed out only for two of the documents. Those documents must be corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us perform Open and Repair and check if the option appears. Follow the steps from the following article and check if it helps:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> The steps in the article is similar to Office 2013.</p>

<p><br />
The fact that copying to a new document worked suggests that the original document was corrupt. More precisely, copying everything but the final paragraph (¶) often does the trick with corrupt documents.<br />
<br />
To show/hide paragraph marks, as well as other nonprinting marks, click the ¶ button on the Home tab (or on the Standard toolbar in Word 2003 and older versions).</p>

            On the View tab, make sure the document is not in Outline or Draft views, since both of those disable comment balloons.&nbsp; It's likely the copy/paste method worked because the new documents were already in Page Layout view.<br />

<h2>            How to batch delete rss feeds outlook 2010 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason syncing feeds with Outlook 2010 and IE9 is a one way street from the later to the first.</p>
<p>Problem is, only a few feeds were actually synced so i decide to delete them in both.</p>
<p>You can batch delete IE9 feeds (this doesn't sync to Outlook though) but i haven't found one for Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't feel like deleting my Outlook feeds one by one (no option to select all), so is there a way to batch delete the Outlook feeds?</p>

<h3> nicktorres  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 365 - Breaking a link does nothing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have a several sheet excel workbook and I guess by some random preset of excel when I copied and pasted a lot of information from another workbook into one of the sheets I created a link to the other workbook. Now, every time I open the workbook it prompts
 me to either edit/update/ignore links.&nbsp;I have tried everything in my power aside from deleting and starting a new workbook (which wouldn't work anyway because I need so much information from another workbook I'd have to copy/paste it in) trying to figure out
 how to get rid of this link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing in conditional formatting, there are no links within formulas and breaking the link does absolutely nothing. I don't even understand why it has the option to break the link when actually doing so does nothing. It suggests that this will
 "permanently convert formulas and external references to their existing values".. yet almost all of the cells that I copy and pasted in contain formulas and breaking the link as I have said makes no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I simply want to be able to open my workbook without it prompting me to deal with some imaginary links that do nothing but annoy the #%$k out of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming this won't end up helping me as I've already sifted through hundreds of forums with the same problems and haven't found anything that works, so this is more or less just venting. Microsoft you're one of the most successful companies ever, why
 can't you make your **** work. SHAMEEE.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure what steps you're taking, but breaking the links works fine here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the dialog that appears when you open the file:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Edit Links</strong> button</li><li>In the <strong>Edit Links</strong> dialog, select the links(s) then click <strong>
Break Link</strong></li><li>Confirm the action</li><li><strong>Close</strong> the dialog window</li><li><strong>Save</strong> the file</li></ol>

                    I can scroll vertically with my mouse, but when I try to scroll horizontally, it doesn't move.&nbsp; It works in older versions, and other 2010 office programs, but not excel or word.&nbsp; The scroll symbol pops up, like when i scroll vertically, but nothing happens.
 Does anyone know how to solve this?&nbsp; I've gone to my mouse properties, etc. all is well there.&nbsp; I open excel 2003 and 2010 at the same time; I can scroll horizontally with 2003, not in 2010??

            PC Suite does not offer video editing possibility, you need to look for other softwares. I do not have n80, but to my understanding there is some version of Adobe Photoshop available in the sales package CD, I wonder if that some some video editing support
 ?

    <title>Office 365 Outlook mail keeps returning after deletion - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook mail keeps returning after deletion</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and Outlook 365 2016 version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I delete emails, empty the deleted files, empty the junk files, and they keep coming back to my in box. This will happen two or three times a day. But when they come back they are always unopened emails, not the opened ones I read and deleted. The junk emails
 do not return after deletion, just the deleted ones. I save good emails to my computer in sub files set up for specific customers, not the server, and they never reappear only the ones in the deleted files folder.</p>
<p>Help anyone as this is getting extremely frustrating. </p>

            <p><span><span>Hello John,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I am sorry that you are facing as issue with deleted emails returning back into the Deleted Items folder in Outlook 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the type of email account you have setup in Outlook 2016 for which this issue happens? For example POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync (EAS) or Microsoft Exchange.
 To check the type of email account configured in Outlook 2016 click on <strong>File &gt; Info
</strong>&gt;<strong> Account Settings &gt; Account Settings</strong> drop-down. EAS account refers to Hotmail.com, Outlook.com or Live.com email accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In case you are using an IMAP or EAS account and this issue happens to emails deleted from the Deleted Items or Trash folder on the IMAP or EAS account, then login
 to the IMAP or EAS account’s webmail and check if the same issue happens when emptying/clearing the Deleted Items or Trash folder on the webmail.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have a Microsoft Exchange account then you may contact you’re the Administrator who manages the accounts and check with them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above suggested step does not help then try re-creating your email account in a new Profile in Outlook 2016.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Create a new Outlook Profile following the steps from the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829918</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Setup your email account in the new Outlook Profile. Test if you are able to delete emails normally from the Deleted Items or Trash folder without the emails returning
 back. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To setup your email account/s in the new Outlook Profile you may refer to the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758902</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above information helps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Delete Word&#39;s default templates &#40;Brochure.dotx, Flyer.dotx, etc&#41;</h2>
                    For Word 2016 for Mac, how can I permanently delete Word's built-in templates (such as Bold Cover Letter, Bold Resume, Brochure, etc.)? &nbsp;I removed them from the en.lproj folder (at Applications/Microsoft Word/Contents/Resources), but they still appear
 when I choose the New from Template option, so where else are they stored? &nbsp;I write templates for a law office and since the folder structure is now gone from the New from Template window, I only want users to see the custom templates I've created for the
 firm and not any of Word's built-in templates.

            <p>AFAIK, you've set yourself an impossible task. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial location of the templates is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Applications/Microsoft Word/Contents/Resources/en.iproj</strong> (for U.S. English), as you suspected, but then copies are also stored
 in <strong>Users/YourUserName/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Caches/1033</strong> (for U.S. English) in a series of folder starting with
<strong>TM</strong> and ending with a number. You can delete these files, but as soon as you restart Word, the cached files are regenerated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In addition, every time you apply a Word update, the Application package is replaced and the templates reappear in the
<strong>Resources/en.lproj</strong> folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Even if you could get around these, a user would only have to switch languages to another English variant to see all the same templates again.</span></p>

<p>Same for me. Since last Sunday, Ovi Store 2.08 does not work at all. Whenever I click on "my account", it remains forever loading. Same thing happens when I try to open any app description page.</p>

            i have worked out that you can install free apps.<br />
<br />
you have to not be signed in. then i am able to browse ok, if i then go to install a free app it signs me back in and the screen hangs on loading, but in the background it still installs the app.<br />
<br />
it's shocking though. you wouldn't get this with the app store.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exactly the same issue on E7-00, and the issue started around same time as Arie9525 posted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-summarize:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- problems started after updating Ovi Store a couple of weeks ago</p>
<p>- Ovi Store working fine when not logged in</p>
<p>- when logging in (f. ex. for installing application) the store is no more responding when the issue is if sw has already been installed to the phone (i.e. installed software list under own account is loading for a very long time / stuck on loading, and
 rarely it prints out error that list can not be fetched; additionally browsing software descriptions is impossible as the store tries to load something - most propably the information if it is already installed)</p>
<p>- when trying to send support request under own account, the error is that server can not be reached</p>
<p>- and again: when NOT logged in (f. ex. after logging out), Store seems to be workin fine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to me that some major issue on Ovi Store application. Please solve this or give a workaround how to downgrade to previous version, thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- P</p>

 it's safe, and it's worked fine every time before. Help please!

    <title>Outlook 2011 Displaying the wrong name in the To field - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david bartholomew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2011 Displaying the wrong name in the To field</h2>
                    Our client just requsted information as they recently noticed this in Outlook 2011 for MAC OS X:
When we write new emails, or reply/forward emails to people, the display name is always matching with the sender's name, despite the address that it is being sent to.&nbsp; It seems that it happens only for those people in contacts which I also have their shared
 calendar open. 
&nbsp;
Recreating:
Start or address a message by typing a name, such as "Sean" into the To field.&nbsp; The list shows my name "Erik&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"&nbsp; and the To field will display the name "Erik" but will send the email to Sean's email address.&nbsp; The list will have several folks listed all with the name Erik being displayed.
In addition, when the user get's their email it shows from "Erik" with a different email address in the braces i.e. &lt;
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;&gt;
&nbsp;
I have some example screen shots but do no

            David,
<div><br />
<div>look for the entry in the address book with the "wrong" name (Erik in your case) -- use Spotlight to find it, it's the local address book, not the one in Outlook. Then, remove all the additional E-Mail addresses there, and leave just Erik's address --
 that's it.</div>
