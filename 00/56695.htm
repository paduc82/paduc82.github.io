                    My address book in Maximizer CRM will not work after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; That is a loss of 20 years of data.&nbsp; Can this be fixed?

<p>windows 10 is currently a low quality product, i helped beta test as an insider and Microsoft pushed it out forcefully onto people before it was even done, its literally half baked, with lots of bugs and problems, it should have never been released,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think your best bet is to roll back to windows 7 and HOPE that your important data comes back, windows 10 IS KNOWN to delete both data and programs without peoples permission, it also does a number of other nasty things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>these boards are filled every day with everyday </p>
<p>people like you who can no longer use their computer for its intended function because of windows 10</p>

            <p>I upgraded from the Microsoft website.&nbsp; I lost the function of the program Maximizer.&nbsp; That meant that even though I had all the addresses stored on a memory stick, the program would not work so the data could not be entered and used.</p>
<p>The Maximizer technician said the problem was that I had an older version of Microsoft sequel on my computer.&nbsp; It was 2008.&nbsp; By upgrading to SQL 2012 that would solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 18 it took nearly two hours with the technician on the line and
 on remote control of my computer.&nbsp; Microsoft SQL 2012 was installed and miraculously Maximizer started working again.&nbsp;It was a great relief.&nbsp; I paid $165.&nbsp; Then on Monday November 23, Maximizer stopped working again.&nbsp;

            I was using Maximizer CRM 12 Entrepreneur edition since it is a stand-along license.&nbsp; When I upgraded to Windows 10 it no longer worked.&nbsp; Even tried going online as per their instructions and input my license but still does not work.&nbsp; I then called Maximizer
 and was told it may or may not work with Windows 10.&nbsp; Even if I paid for a new license he said he was not sure it would work. They tried to get me to get their latest edition for a mere $1,800 plus pay their monthly fee.&nbsp; I don't use it enough to justify the
 cost so looking for another CRM that is still a stand-alone license.&nbsp; Good luck if you get yours working.&nbsp; Mine does not.<br />

</p><p>I abandoned Maximizer.&nbsp; I started using Handy.&nbsp; It is so much better than Maximizer.&nbsp; Easy to use, inexpensive to buy, fast and with lots of features.&nbsp; Maximizer went over to big paying corporate clients a long time ago and ignored small users like me.&nbsp;
 The problem was getting my 2000 names and addresses out of Maximizer and into Handy.&nbsp; I paid CRM Consulting to get Maximizer working on Windows 10.&nbsp; It worked for a while and then stopped opening.&nbsp; The only way to transfer the data was copy and paste.&nbsp; I did
 this for a while until Maximizer stopped opening.&nbsp; Recently I asked CRM Consulting to get it opening again.&nbsp; The problem was solved but I received a large bill for the few minutes it took.&nbsp; I have now been working diligently at copying and pasting before Maximizer
 stops working again.&nbsp; I am down to the M's.&nbsp; </p>

                    I've had cs5 adobe premiere pro on my computer for years now and a few weeks ago it stopped working.&nbsp; A pop up appears and reads the following (adobe premiere could not find any capable video modules.&nbsp; Please update your video display drivers and try again).&nbsp;
 I cannot even get java to work or download simple vids or mp3's at all anymore.&nbsp; My computers says all updates are current so how do I find a driver that is corrupt, out of date, or not working?

<p>
</p><p>Many incompatibility reports from the buggy GWX app are incorrect.&nbsp; If you want to be sure, then here's how to do a test install to see how it starts up and what drivers are delivered immediately afterward via Windows Update to get possibly better resolution.&nbsp;
 The Standard VGA or MS display driver may provide good enough higher resolution but rarely allow Sleep or Hibernate to work, so you want to see what is delivered after install by Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try right click Start button to open Disk Management, click on C partition, right click to Shrink, shrink it by a minimum of 50 gb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then follow <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a> to boot the media provided to install to the space you created.&nbsp; As long as you double-check that you've selected the space you shrunk and not C, it will configure a Dual Boot which you can spend as much time as you need setting
 up and testing your install.&nbsp; It explains in the link how to import drivers and everything else needed to get the best possible install.&nbsp; The install will activate and give permanent Entitlement to reinstall Windows 10 on that PC if you decide to keep it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the test install proves itself then you can either ask back here for help to remove the old OS and recover the space, or install again to the whole drive deleting all partitions this time to get it cleanest.&nbsp;

<h2>            Window flashes on and then off screen too fast to read , causing running app or game to minimize</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While on the desktop there is a window or some sort of error message that flashes on the screen periodically--it's too fast to read--If I am running a game when this happens , the game is minimized to the taskbar. It does NOT crash. If I left click
 on it from the taskbar , the game pops right back up and picks up right where I left off. It does not just happen once-it continues periodically.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried shutting down processes that I thought might be throwing an update message or an error message--Windows Defender &nbsp;, antiviruses , updaters , etc. . This hasn't helped at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've also tried many solutions thru the forums that looked similar in description but applied to Win 8 or earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have seen this mystery Window pop up and disappear several time while typing this--however it did not minimze the page...</p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi--Thanks for quick response--Fortunately I solved It myself. It turned out to be malware named Arcade Twister.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was able to take a video of my screen with my cellphone and watch for the flashing window that caused my games to minimize {it was almost any game I was playing). Where the window/message popped up in the video I froze it and zoomed in on the
 address bar of the nasty window. I was able to read the info in the command line and saw "arcade twister" , went into control panel and there it was in the uninstall programs list. It took a couple of tries but it finally uninstalled and PROBLEM SOLVED! &nbsp;YAY!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Apparently not everyone can get rid of it so easily--there appear to be tools to remove it if you cant uninstall it</p>
<p>though.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again thanks and I hope this info can help someone else............:)</p>

 is there anyway this can be fixed without having to unlock everything again.</p>

<h3> tcsandlund  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2007 won&#39;t work completely</h2>
                    A few days ago I suddenly started having problems with Microsoft Word 2007, and I am not sure why.&nbsp; I can do most things...but I can't click anywhere on page or highlight words.&nbsp; I can still make changes, but I have to use the arrow key pad on the keyboard.&nbsp;
 Also, when I go into Word Options, none of the links on the side work...so I can't get to the "advanced" tab or "resource" tab...etc.&nbsp; Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint and the others work fine.<br />
<br />
I have already uninstalled office 2007, and reinstalled it...plus did the updates.&nbsp; That didn't work.&nbsp; My office 2007 is already activated as well.<br />
<br />
Also, when I close Word 2007...an error box pops up and tells me Word quit working...and then it starts it back up again.&nbsp; Same thing happens if I close it again...but then it doesn't reopen...it just closes.<br />
<br />
Any ideas of whats going on?&nbsp; Any help at all would be amazing!&nbsp; Thanks!

    <title>Windows 10 cannot switch user from local account to microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xuesonglan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 cannot switch user from local account to microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>The problem is about the account. I can say now everything about account in my Windows 10 is crashed, such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. At first, The system cannot recognize my fingerprint, Then I find that I cannot verify my microsoft account, or add finger print, or add pin, when I clicked the button it just flashed and got no response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Then I tried to add a local account, it succeeded indeed, but when I tried to switch from local account back to microsoft account, again the only thing I got is "flashed and no response."</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Up to now I find that everything included family account, other account, or my microsoft account are unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I've tried some methods such as "powershell restore" or check the status of "Windows License Manager Service", but not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't ask me to reinstall the system or restore, there is no restore point in my system, and I cannot afford to reinstall this computer making all files and programs lose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>=========================Important Info Below========================</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The following methods are NOT helpful</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;You may run the Microsoft Account troubleshooter and check.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>STATUS:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I tried to use the Account Troubleshooter but just told me that "You need a Microsoft account to sync your settings" which I cannot do because I cannot switch
 from my local account back to Microsoft account.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>To make sure that the Microsoft account services are up and running, go to the Service status webpage.</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://status.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://status.live.com/</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>STATUS: services are up and running.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: to create a local account and check if you are able to create a pin for that add finger print.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I cannot create a new Microsoft account, because everything I wanna do in the "Setting-Account" just flickering and failed, such as switching to Microsoft account, Adding an account or others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's a system failure.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 won&#39;t let me update AVG or ITunes</h2>
                    When I attempt to update the virus definitions of AVG Free, or Itunes, either the download, or the install fails. &nbsp;Usually after getting about 70% complete. &nbsp;I am also unable to uninstall either of these applications. &nbsp;The error message seems to be the
 same, "an update is already in process", "wait until it finishes and then try again".

<h2>            Running Vampire The Masquerade&#58; Redemption on Windows 10 64 bit Pro</h2>
                    <p>I own a retail version of this old game (Windows 98/95 &nbsp;, 2CD's) and I would like to play it but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 gets in the way, either by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 'This app cannot be run, contact the....'-error (while at times Win10 will allow half of the install - it goes wrong on the CD-swap. It seems that there are two installation procedures running. The setup.exe from the game which runs successfully and one
 that eventually interrupts the other completely)</p>
<p>- &nbsp;Compatibility Troubleshooting refuses to test the program&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or workarounds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the necessary files are installed and I can get to the menu screen, adjust the display settings, watch the credits, etc.</p>
<p>Yet when I try 'new game', Win 10 says 'a problem occured'...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility mode manages to start up the game but when I click 'new game' there's another error message.</p>

            <p>I've had this game on the shelf for years, and didn't know why I didn't still have it installed.</p>
<p>I guess I found out. I won't run on a 64bit Windows. It looks like the last time I had it installed
</p>
<p>must have been on XP , because I am dual booting with Win7 and it won't even load on that.</p>
<p>- I tried Win98 compatibility (forces the cpu to use a single core) because the game was released in 2000
</p>
<p>and this compatibility has helped with two of my games from 2000 &amp; 2002, but no luck with Vampire Redemption.</p>
<p>It will install,&nbsp; and if you don't tap any keys, it will run the opening video after you click on New Game,
</p>
<p>but that's as far as I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an odd quirk with installing, and it is odd that both disks have a Setup.exe.
</p>
<p>I had to Open the disk and double click on the <em>Autorun.exe </em>...&nbsp; <em>Not</em> the
<em>Setup.exe.</em></p>
<p>- I may have made a mistake in installing the Unofficial 1.2 patch as this is apparently meant to be used only</p>
<p>if you install two mods, but don't know if this is what broke the game (can't be bothered reinstalling)</p>
<p>The official 1.1 patch should be safe to use though.</p>
<p>- I tried the game on Nvidia and Intel HD 4600 graphics. No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I noticed the games executable is the same as Vampire Bloodlines ( Vampire.exe ) but renaming it</p>
to didn't help either.
<p><em>- </em>The installed games did not show in Programs and Features, but it did create some Registry entries</p>
<p>(which I also exported to Win7), which I have now deleted along with the game.</p>
<p>Currently this game rates a Win10 fail ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - If you have Vampire Bloodlines you will need the Unofficial patch v. 9.4 (or higher) for it to run</p>
<p>on Win10. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>.</em></p>

            <p>Hello BossDweeb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and sharing the info.</p>
<p>I ran into the same problem with the setup.exe-file and managed to get as far as the intro like you did and that's about it. Another AbandonWare game I suppose, though it was a classic at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But good to know there's a Vampire Bloodlines AND a patch, I might just try that one for a change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 error is a bit off the mark though: 'This app doesn't work. Contact the software publisher for a 64-bit version'.</p>
<p>It's not the publisher's fault nor its responsibility. Microsoft's Windows 10 simply doesn't take old software into account, and that's a choice not a coincidence: &nbsp;these old games used to run on Windows 95/98 until Windows 7 as far as I know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's burn all the books that weren't written in the 21st century ;-)</p>

            <p><em>"The Windows 10 error is a bit off the mark though:"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Error messages are almost always off the mark. They tend to reference the last part in a chain</p>
<p>of events that leads to a crash, not the source of the crash, but this Windows compatibility message is
</p>
<p>a new one I hadn't seen previously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Redemption is on the borderline for compatibility. Anything from 2000 back is likely to have issues, some</p>
<p>can be fixed to run on Win7 &gt; 10, but others require an emulator such as Virtual Box, or for older DOS based</p>
<p>games, DOS BOX. </p>

</p><p><a href="http://dfendreloaded.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">D-Fend Reloaded: Overview</a>&nbsp; ( an interface for DOS BOX, which is included with D-Fend)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- I forgot to mention that you can get a download version of Vampire Redemption from
<em>Good old Games.</em></p>
<p>GOG fixes old games to work on modern Windows and removes any DRM , which is one of the big issues</p>
<p>with many older disk based games. Their DOS based games install with DOS BOX which is also handy.</p>
<p>Redemption is currently $6- USD, but if you wait for a sale you can pick it up for half that.</p>
<p>[Edit : Oops. I see they don't mention Win10, but&nbsp; have no games that ran on Win7 that I have not</p>
<p>been able to run on Win10, but&nbsp; some of them have required a new trick or tweak.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also have Bloodlines. This game is quite a bit different to Redemption, and they have jacked the price up a bit,</p>
<p>but on sale it would still be good value. This is the first game I played that I would tag as 'adult - R'.
</p>
<p>(along with a lot of other games vs a couple of years ago - probably in response to MS introducing DRM Blocking
</p>
<p>to Windows when the released Win10. More on that in my post at&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">

<p>- In case emVY is getting notifications....</p>
<p>I was curious as to what a wide screen fix suggested by Adan when he revived this thread had to do with</p>
<p>making the game run on Win10,&nbsp; so I decided to reinstall it. </p>
<p>I haven't bothered with the wide screen fix yet, but the 1.2 patch does apparently break the game, as I had suspected.</p>
<p>[ EDIT: Have the wide screen patch now as well ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled, and only used the 1.1 patch this time and the game runs fine ( Win10 1703 ).
</p>
<p>You do need to use the <em>Compatibility</em> option - <em>'Override high DPI scaling behavior... '
</em>or the game</p>
<p>will not fit the screen properly.</p>
<p>I'm currently using the 1600x1200 res ( 27" monitor with 2560x1440 res). <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT:<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; "it goes wrong on the CD-swap"</em></p>
<p>Sometimes the timing between changing, and waiting for the CD to spin up,and clicking</p>
<p>on the continue button can be critical. ]</p>

<p>Good to see you're still watching. I was thinking the disk issues was at the swap rather than after</p>
<p>the second disk had started being read.</p>
<p>If it stops at the same point each time the second disk is probably faulty. </p>
<p>Try copying the contents of the disk to a new folder on your desktop.</p>
<p>If it fails to copy all files, the disk is corrupt, but if all files do copy, go ahead and copy the files from disk 1</p>
<p>to the same folder as well. Then run the setup from there. This folder can be deleted once the game is installed.</p>
<p>You may have better success this way.</p>
<p>- Fortunately this game does not do a copy protection disk check (at least not with the 1.1 patch), so you don't</p>
<p>need the disk in the drive to launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the disk is borked you can still get the game from GOG for a couple dollars if you wait for a sale.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey BossDweeb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disc 2 is totally faulty + the level.nob file gives the following error: &nbsp;"Can't read from the source file or disk".</p>
<p>Even my CD drive doesn't seem to like the CD. The sound coming from is like it's burning a CD/DVD....</p>
<p>So that's it I guess, but many thanks for keeping watch and helping out!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll pay a visit to GOG :)<br />

            Hi Tahreem
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps and locate the Photos app in the list
<br />
<br />Select that, click Advanced options and then choose Reset
<br />
<br />When that completes, check the functioning of that App . . .

<br />
<br />Also, point to one of the JPEGs, right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, click Change
<br />Choose Photos
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Click Apply then OK

<br />
<br />Give this a try then:
<br />

            Hi Tahreem.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try to Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try re-registering the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Bluetooth Keyboard is Unresponsive After Being Idle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jolly general  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Keyboard is Unresponsive After Being Idle</h2>
                    I just bought a brand new, fully functional bluetooth keyboard for my Acer W700 running windows 8.1. However, I have had the persistent problem of initial keyboard lag and general unresponsiveness following a brief time period of not using the keyboard.
 If I have been browsing a webpage (or doing anything for that matter that doesn't involve the use of the keyboard), the keyboard is completely unresponsive for between 3-5 seconds before any key strokes are registered.<br />
<br />
I believe I have narrowed down the issue to power management. I believe the OS is disabling the keyboard if it is not in use, in order to save power. I am encountering the very problem shown in this video:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHyXq3mvHkw<br />
<br />
However, the proposed solution of preventing the OS from disabling the keyboard isn't possible because my "power management" tabs in the control panel are missing. Thanks for any help given.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the Bluetooth keyboard?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may face this issue if the Bluetooth Radio is not resuming from a low power state correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Bluetooth mouse or keyboard fails to reconnect after being left idle</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to update the Bluetooth drivers and check if you can view the "power management" tabs in the Device manager.</p>

<h2>            unable to log in to Windows 10 administrator account</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 on a desktop computer.&nbsp; I established a new administrator account (new admin) and then changed my normal user account to a standard account.&nbsp; Now, I can't log in to the new administrator account so I'm unable to make certain changes
 to my computer (e.g., installing new software).&nbsp; When I type in the password for my administrator account, I receive an error indicating the "User Profile Service service failed the sign-in.&nbsp; User profile cannot be loaded."&nbsp; Suggestions?

    <title>Problema con Red Dead Redemption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ironskies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema con Red Dead Redemption</h2>
                    
<p>Salve a tutti ragazzi ...sto avendo un problema o almeno cosi credo con il gioco "Red Dead Redemption" praticamente sto quasi per completarlo sono al 91% ma ho notato una cosa sia se vado nel rifugio sia nell'accampamento non mi fa cambiare piu il vestito,
 praticamente la X non esci piu mentre la Y di salva esce. Ora mi chiedo chi la gia finito se e normale oppure e un bug del gioco, da premettere che mi mancano ancora 3 vestito da completare. Questo problema se presentato quando ho fatto la prima missione al
 mio rank, e ora sono rimasto con il vestito di quando lavoro al mio rank, ovvero al rank di John marston. Grazie.</p>

                </div>

<p>Se ha sempre funzionato dev'essere un bug. Controlla se il disco è graffiato (specialmente vicino al cerchio argentato) e strofinalo piano con un panno soffice. Poi riprova.

<p>Sembra che il gioco sia danneggiato... Non credo tu possa fare tanto.</p>

<p>La cosa strana e che il gioco nonostante questo bug funziona bene...e solo che non c'e piu la x che ti fa cambiare vestito...pero ho notato che se carico un salvataggio precedente mi ritrovo la x per cambiare vestito..solo che il salvataggio e molto dietro
 da dove sono ora, e solo il pensiero che dovro affrontare di nuovo le ultime missioni mi sento male...hehe!!....sempre perche ho il vizio di fare un solo salvataggio...grrrrrrrrr!!! Vorrei essere sicuro che si tratta di un bug che si e presentato prima di
 riaffrontare di nuovo le ultime missioni, non vorrei che arrivo al punto dove sono ora e si ripresenta il problema perchè il gioco e cosi, ecco perchè sto chiedendo se si tratta di un bug.</p>

<p>Se inizio una nuova partita e tutto apposto, il tasto c'e, e mi fa cambiare vestito....la stessa cosa me la fa anche se carico un salvataggio molto precedente dalla posizione che sono ora. Stamattina mi sono messo a giocare e ho concluso le 3 missioni che
 mi rimanevano e all'improviso sono tornato al rifugio e come per magia mi faceva cambiare vestito finalmente questa maledetta "x" e uscita, quindi devo dedurre che le missioni nel rank di marston si dovrebbero fare in successione visto che sono le ultime del
 gioco, e dopo queste missioni (non vi svelo la sorpresa) ti fa continuare a giocare e ritorna tutto normale. Spero che qualcuno che l'ha gia finito mi possa dire se anche a lui se presentato questo passaggio, giusto per togliermi il dubbio.</p>

<p>E' passato un po' di tempo ma spero che la memoria mi assista.</p>
<p>Durante la parte "pre-finale", quindi mentre John Marston è impegnato nelle missioni al ranch, non c'è possibilità di cambiare abiti.</p>
<p>Passate quelle missioni, sia nel finale che nel free-roaming successivo (una volta terminata la storia puoi cmq continuare a girare per il mondo di gioco e dedicarti a sfide e missioni secondarie che hai eventualmente tralasciato), la possibilità di modifica
 degli abiti viene ripristinata e torna a funzionare come prima.</p>
<p>Suerte! :-)</p>

<h2>            Microphone mutes itself</h2>
                    Using a USB microphone in Windows 10 Pro, latest update installed tonight. The microphone continues to self mute after approximatley 30 to 45 seconds. Have tried all the supposed fixes posted on the web, nothing works. This is the second microphone I have
 used, same problem. Does anyone know the fix for this problem. Malware Bytes scan is not a fix for the problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that this is due to an improper sound setting or incompatible audio drivers. For us to better assist you, we'd like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter the issue?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps that you've tried so far to resolve the issue?</li><li>Is the issue confined to a single device? Have you tried using the USB microphone on a different PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

<p>After purchasing USB microphone. I have deleted and updated drivers for USB and audio, run scans for virus and malware. Ran scan disk, no problems found. I did find the mic worked on another computer without issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is isolated to this computer though I do not know what else to check, any ideas would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I located these posts prior to reaching out on this format; they did not resolve the problem with the microphone muting itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated drivers for the sound card, the USB ports, I have run scans including Malware Bytes and Microsoft's MRT program. Have plugged the USB mic into all the USB ports on the computer and changed settings in the speech recognition program; the mic
 continues to self-mute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 updated several days ago and since this update the Realtek Sound Manager is gone, though the self-muting problem existed prior to this update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching through posts on the web I have found posts regarding this problem that go back to Windows 7, though there are no solutions posted that have solved my problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This does not work either!! How would it work?!!! The troubleshooter finds the same exact thing we all have been dealing with!! The device is MUTED and then it unmutes it for you and thinks it solved the problem!! I can go in and unmute it myself, but seconds
 later it's MUTED AGAIN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling with this issue and have done extensive research online looking for any help at all. I cannot believe you suggested the troubleshooter.</p>

<p>Hi Melanie,</p>
<p>I had exactly the same problem and while I doubt the typical forum answer: "there is malware on your computer". This time that seems to be right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed Malwarebytes and it quarantined 'ADVANTAGE.EXE' located in '%APPDATA%/Local/advantage/' and it solved this exact problem for me. This was suggested in: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/256d46ea-2bca-4922-a4b2-a38b420763c7/windows-automatically-muting-my-microphone?forum=w7itproperf</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Regards, Stefan</p>
