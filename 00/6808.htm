<h2>            Am I being scammed.</h2>
                    <p>Was contacted by a man named Rocky( 516 899 8999) telling me that a lot of my microsoft systems had stopped running and that I had only a few days to fix this problem. I also spoke to a man named Sam from People Connect (800-690-3683) who said that they
 were from Microsoft. Rocky wanted to sell me a fix or my computer for $99 because he said that I had to buy the Microsoft licensing which was about to run out on my new laptop computer(3 months old). I told him this was outrageous. He said my laptop would
 stop running without this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can't be legit!!! please help.</p>

<h2>            Need to uninstall MS Office Single Image 2010 32-bit in order to run Office Pro 2010 X64 purchased version&#39;s 64-bit Setup.  Also need to uninstall MS Office Professional Hybrid 2007 32-bit. </h2>
                    
<p>Error message from OfficeProfessional2010_64bit_Setup (running from Download library) says to uninstall MS Off Single Image 2010 and MS Off Professional Hybrid 2007 before rerunning X64 Setup.&nbsp; Neither of these programs is listed in&nbsp;Control Panel "Uninstall
 or change a program".&nbsp; Win 7 Search on these 2 program names does not return any hits.&nbsp; I am running X64 Win 7.</p>
<p>I read the TechNet article that covers&nbsp;the architecture for 32-bit or 64-bit installation, but this is too general for my problem.</p>
<p>I got in this mess by activating the Office 2007 trial suite preloaded on my computer (Lenovo W700 laptop), then downloading Office 2010 Professional trial X86, THEN purchasing and downloading full Office Professional 2010&nbsp;X64.&nbsp; I've already uninstalled
 all Office 2007 programs listed in Control Panel "Uninstall or Change".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not wish to cop out and drop back to Office Pro 2010 X86 (very large documents).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to submit this problem to online MS Office chat support; it said it couldn't find my program key automatically.&nbsp; It also said the program key I entered was not valid (this is not true).&nbsp; When I tried to go the charge-my-credit-card path, it said
 sorry the tech support staff is having problems, and they're working on these problems,&nbsp;and I should&nbsp;submit my request later.&nbsp; It said this to my requests for paid chat, for paid email, and for paid telephone support.&nbsp; (That's a lot of keying in of billing
 address info, only to be told each time at the end sorry we're busy.)</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2011 will not leave message on the server.</h2>
                    Bought Office for mac last year. Loaded it up all working fine until last week. Outlook started to remove messages from the server. Got the ISP to restore the messages as soon as Outlook started to send and receive the messages were down loaded and removed
 from the server. The Outlook is configured as an imap account Yahoo is pop.

            <p>Yes but what I was looking for was the instructions to enable IMAP server-side (i.e. in the Yahoo account).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be enabled by default because I recall a few years back, it needed to be enabled with in the Yahoo account (similar to Gmail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OP already has the account setup as IMAP so one would presume he is already using the info provided in your link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think in this case, the answer to his issue may lie server-side, such as a setting that is allowing emails to not be retained on the server (which is rarely done these days due to large mailbox sizes being offered).</p>

 am finding it extremely slow to make Saves to Excel documents, and, if I go to the Edit Menu and Select "Open Recent" there is a lag, or delay, of several long seconds before the list of documents appears.&nbsp; I have run the Apple Disk Utility on my Mac Pro and
 also TechTool Pro 6, and neither indicate any problems.&nbsp; Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated, as this is most annoying!</p>

            Hi again Bob.
<div><br />
<div>I went through the above procedure, twice, and it seemed to help a little bit, but not significantly. &nbsp;I then decided to live dangerously and carefully went through the very long list of installed Fonts, one-by-one. &nbsp;I disabled all of those that I never
 use, which was quite a few. &nbsp;Every once in a while a Font disable would bring up a dialog box indicating that that particular font was used by the system software, so I then did NOT disable that Font. &nbsp;I then went through and removed all of the fonts I had
 deleted and put them into a new folder which I copied onto another hard drive (which is also in the same Mac). &nbsp;I then followed your above procedure and I also "cleared" the "Open Recent" Menu and that seemed to have done the trick. &nbsp;Thanks very much. &nbsp;This
 ability to help others is one of my favorite benefits of the internet age.</div>

<h2>            Switching MS Office Licenses</h2>
                    In the past I've had my own personal MS Office 365 subscription for personal use, but I began a new job and have gotten access to the business version, but I can't get my license ownership to switch from me personally to my new employer. I'd also like
 to keep my personal version activated on a separate user on my Mac, and use the business subscription/license only on another user. Is this possible?

<p>I'm having the same problem and I guess since no one responded to your question, it's not possible. Atleast not without buying an application like Mobile Master which doesn't seem to work for me either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the phone itself, it's a great device, however in terms of software availability and support, it lacks in every way!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thunderbird with lightning and sunbird are both being used by a large group of people but it's hard to make it work with a Nokia mobile. Same goes for Google's calendar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then again, imo, windows lacks programs like Things - <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://culturedcode.com/things/</a> which looks far better than any agenda available for windows and is available for the iphone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes me want to buy an iMac along with an iPhone</p>

<p>Yes, it's really a pitty. I just don't use the calendar of my mobile phone anymore because it is so much better with google calendar and thunderbird. And as I'm sitting at the computer almost the whole day my thunderbird will always remind me. For the crucial
 appointments I let me send a SMS by my google calendar. But Nokia could make me and a lot of other people very happy if they would realise bi-directional thunderbird synchronisation.</p>

            have you done any research on this forum on how to reset the updater? you will find lots of posting about your type of problem. as this is not a support site it's a peer to peer site for testing of newer builds of Windows 10.

                    Hi all, Not too sure if anyone can help me out with this, I copied all the photos from my phone to the pc (didn't delete them) using the pc suite and usb cable. The photos were deleted from the pc and now the pc suite won't let me copy them again as it
 says that there are no new files to upload. Is there anyway I can get around this? Thanks

            Very little information given here (nothing bout what phone, what PC Suite version, what Windows etc.). With limited information my advice is only that open PC Suite - File Manager - locate the phone icon in windows explorer view, select for example memory
 card under phone (use the "view folders" view so that you can see the folder structure at the left hand side in Windows explorer) and you should see your images. Highlight them and move to PC by copy paste.

            I imagine the problem is that the photos were deleted from the phone. I think the default is to delete the phone copies after copying them to the PC - does ask you for confirmation before it does it, of course.

<h2>            n97 Nokia Messaging Widget</h2>
                    I admit i'm a total spazz at some of this stuff, but here's my question: I downloaded Nokia Messaging and it installed perfectly. However, the widget on my home screen, when pressed, takes me to the regular messaging menu. To get to the installed version,
 I have to go to apps and locate the big pink e. Is it possible for me to somehow get the downloaded nokia messaging onto my emal widget. Sorry if I'm missing the obvious here, and any help would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!

            you would have to select the email provider that you chose for the nokia messaging, like : gmail, yahoo or other and then it will show up as nokia messaging. it actually works. you might need to refresh your widgets and or turn your phone on/off if you
 don't see that in the widgets menu as an option.&nbsp;

            Thanks very much for the advice. Actually, I do get my hotmail account (the one I signed up with at Nokia Messaging) to show up in the home screen widget, but when I open it, it shows what i assume is the preinstalled messaging UI. The hotmail UI on the
 email app in my apps folder looks different (and much better) and it's that one I'd like to go to when I press on the homescreen widget to check my hotmail account. Any ideas? Not possible? Thank you.

<p>For mine I get the following two choices: "Yahoo" or "...@yahoo.com"</p>
<p>The "Yahoo" one is for the default messaging and the email address "...@yahoo.com" is for Nokia Messaging.</p>

<p>If you have this as well, try selecting the choice with just your email address.</p>

<h2>            Windows Mobile Sync</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 laptops both run Vista home Premium and Windows Mobile 6.0.&nbsp; One has Office 2003, the other Office 2007.&nbsp; The Office 2003 syncs perfectly, no problems.&nbsp; Office 2007, however, will not sync.&nbsp; It tries but
 I get 2 error messages: the desktop has encountered a problem, and secondly, reduce the size of your mailbox.&nbsp; I don't utilize Outlook e-mail in either system.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Microsoft does have "pay for" help but possibly you might be able to work it out here and that is free.&nbsp; Just remember that we are all users and doing the "users helping users" thing to work out issues.&nbsp; On occasion a Microsoft employee jumps
 into the forums .... but as a general rule it is just us users.</p>

    <title>Booklet Fold Page Numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevenpdx1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Booklet Fold Page Numbers</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
I'm aware that Word:mac 2011 has no booklet fold feature. I have formatted my document as 8.5x11 inch landscape with two columns to simulate a book fold.
<br />
<br />
Word considers that a single page and gives it one page number (e.g., Page 1). In truth, those two columns represent Page 1 on the left and Page 2 on the right. Is there any way to play with the formatting so that Word sees each column as a separate page number?
 While I can simulate the format of a an 8.5x5.5 inch booklet, the page numbers don't work, which is a big drawback.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />
<br />

            Try: <br />
<ol>
<li>create a custom Page size in Page Setup.</li><li>type in 8.5&nbsp; width</li><li>type in 5.5 height</li><li>set orientation to Landscape.</li><li>save as two on one.</li><li>now select two on one as your page setup</li><li>Create you document and add pages to footer</li><li>next open printer and click on button below the boxes for number of Copies.</li><li>Choose Layout</li><li>Click pages per sheet choose 2</li><li>click on desired order in the boxes below</li><li>Now choose print.</li></ol>
<br />
<br />
If you have more than two Pages you can choose double sided.<br />
<br />
If you choose double side the lay out is even more important. you ca set up four pages so that you fold lengthwise first then in fold up on itself and have 4 pages in proper sqeuence and proper orientation in that case you would have to create another custom
 page setup of 8.5 x 2.75..<br />

            This technique really just uses the { PAGE } number as a sequence number, which is why it's only easy to make it work in simple situations (e.g. where you don't need to create a Table of Contents that references page numbers)
<div><br />
<div>That said,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can get i, ii, iii by changing the fields to be as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>{ ={ PAGE }*2-1 \*roman }
<div>and</div>
<div>{ ={ PAGE }*2 \*roman }</div>
<div><br />
<div>(for I, II, III you would need</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>{ ={ PAGE }*2-1 \*Roman }
<div>and</div>
<div>{ ={ PAGE }*2 \*Roman }</div>
<div>)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can restart the page number at any section break via, e.g., Insert-&gt;Page Numbers...-&gt;Format, but depending on exactly where you need the break, you might also have to change the fields a bit in each section.</div>

            I would suggest pre-processing all of the documents that are being merged by attaching the same template to all of them and using the "Automatically update document styles" facility to standardize on all of the styles in the documents before merging them.

                    I installed Word 2010&nbsp; yesterday, then last night it started downloading updates.&nbsp; When I looked at it this am, it was still on updating 10 of 19.&nbsp; It seemed to be in some type of a loop so I shut it off.&nbsp; Now how do I fix this?<br />
<br />
Now what do I do, as it says some things are not installed (drivers)???<br />

            I (re)installed Office 2010 over the weekend. I had 25 updates in the first pass, and 4 or 5 after that.<br />
<br />
Shutting down during updates is a "<span style="font-style: italic">bad idea</span>".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If it took all night to download and update, either your computer or internet connection is very slow.<br />

<p>Windows Update often offers updates for programs that you think you do not have installed. The link above gives 3 reasons why this happens and some possible solutions. Another reason is that the updates are often not for the single product
 in the description. </p>
<p>Updates are often bundled for more than just the app identified in the label. More than one program or bundle may be using the same compenent.</p>
<p>For me, the short answer is, just let Update do “it’s thing” because it has better insight into the deep details of your system than you do. The only control I sometimes exert is limiting the number of update I let it apply at one time.
 For example, when installing Windows or an application Update may find very many updates so I limit it to 5-10 at a time.

<p><span><span>Hi Mrs. joybarua, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been brought to our attention that our website and services have been blocked by the ISPs in the United Arab Emirates and
<strong>Qatar</strong>. That means you won't be able to use Skype in the United Arab Emirates or Qatar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is very little Skype can do about this situation. The best course of action would be for you to speak to your ISP and ask why they are blocking Skype and request that they unblock our
 site and services</p>
<p><br />
This has been published on Skype's FAQ:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA391/&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact us back.

    <title>Office 365 install 32 &#38; 64-bit fails - stuck or error message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcdc888  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 install 32 &#38; 64-bit fails - stuck or error message</h2>
                    Tried both installs for Office 365 University, but the small installer for 32-bit and 64-bit either gets stuck or shows an error message on my new Lenovo Z580 Win7 64-bit that has a pre-installed version of Office 2010 on it (that can be activated with
 a key but has not been yet).<br />
<br />
Already spent a bit of time going through the usual steps to diagnose issues and such, but seriously? Spent over an hour thus far without getting anywhere.<br />
<br />
Oddly, the streaming Word, etc. run fine - slow, takes a few minutes to stream and run - but works for the short edits.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Obviously, the downloader for Office 365 doesn't work well, so is there an offline installer (ISO, etc)? It's so pointless to even start the Office 365 University trial for 3 months to see how good it is, or even subscribe, as it stands because it'll take longer
 than the 10-15 minutes to buy a 2010 key or install my copy of 2007, 2003, or XP.
<br />
<br />
Why would I even waste my time hunting for an answer to this problem when many others continue to post the same issue here week after week? Maybe a bit of curiosity, but if an easy answer isn't forthcoming about an offline installer, guess Office 365 goes in
 the trash next week.<br />

    <title>An error occurred while attempting to sync this section or notebook. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bianca_mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            An error occurred while attempting to sync this section or notebook. &#40;Error code&#58; 0xE401065D&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a shared notebook and made this available on a team SharePoint site. This notebook has 19 sections, 15 of which synch without any problems. The remaining 4 always return the above error whenever i try to synch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't use Skydrive so find previous responses to this error unhelpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't even work out what might be causing the error so it's difficult to know where to begin to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>You can navigate to one such notebook and hit Shift-F9 - which will force a sync and sync should work from now on.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also you can create a new notebook and move your sections to it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To avoid the problem:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1) Use a short name for the notebook</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2) Avoid using sections groups</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3) Use short names for sections</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4) Do not have too many sections</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>It is not the "size" of the notebook that causes problem, it is the total size of the filenames stored on the server.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Unfortunately this hasn't helped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i press Shift-F9, the notebook tries to resynch but i get the same error as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to create a new notebook and move sections to it, i've tried splitting the notebook in 2 so there aren't as many sections, i've tried renaming sections so there is less space taken up by filenames but i still get the same errror.</p>
