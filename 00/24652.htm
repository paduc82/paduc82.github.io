<h2>            Appointments created on device not syncing with Outlook on desktop</h2>
                    
<p>I've searched&nbsp;these forums and others, my IT dept. has worked on this, and while I've&nbsp;found many supposed "solutions" none&nbsp;have worked. Here is my story:<br />
<br />
I have an HTC Tilt from AT&amp;T running Mobile 6.1. My&nbsp;PC is running&nbsp;XP and Outlook 2007. I'm syncing via Exchange Server.<br />
<br />
E-mail, notes, and tasks are all syncing correctly, and appointments I create on the PC sync with the device. BUT, if I create an appointment on the device, it does not sync with the PC. The error message I receive is an "Attention Required" link on the Active
 Sync screen on the device, and when I click on that it reads:<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
<br />
The following appointments failed to synchronize from the device:<br />
<br />
1. Subject: Test<br />
Time: 2/3/09 3:00 p.m.<br />
Duration: 60 minutes<br />
<br />
Last synchronized:<br />
Today 8:30 a.m.<br />
<br />
Last attempt:<br />
Today 8:30 a.m.<br />
<br />
<br />
The above is a plain-vanilla appt. - no recurrence, no attendees, no notes, no reminders - and still it won't sync. Other weird things have happened during this time. Two appts. that would not sync, suddenly synced for no apparent reason or any effort on my
 part. A test appt. that I deleted from the device continued to attempt to sync. Eventually, ActiveSync gives up on trying to sync any of the device-created appts. and I get no error message at all, but the appts. remain on the device and do not appear on the
 PC.<br />
<br />
Here are some "fixes" that I read about in forums and have tried.<br />
<br />
I've done the "DST fix" where I change and reset the time zone on the device, which worked until midnight of that day. I've unchecked "Calendar" in the ActiveSync settings on the device, wiped the device calendar clean, and resynced the calendar with the PC.
 I and my IT dept. have been researching and working on this for weeks, then decided to try a hard reset, which did not solve the issue.<br />
<br />
I'm ready to take this back to the AT&amp;T store and demand a replacement (it's still under warranty) but there's no guarantee the new device won't have this issue (judging from the discussions I've seen here and elsewhere, this issue is occuring on various device
 models, using various methods of syncing either USB or Exchange Server).<br />
<br />
So, Minds of Microsoft... any words of wisdom?</p>

That is certainly what I would have tried.&nbsp; I am guessing it is an Exchange issue so I'll ask Eric if he can offer any thoughts (I do not use Exchange).<br />

            I had discussions with some fellow employees who have the same phone with AT&amp;T, and they are experiencing the same issues. There are others who are using the HTC Fuze with AT&amp;T and they do not have this issue. Not sure how this fits into this problem,
 but it might be worth considering that the HTC Tilt itself is the issue, but I have called HTC support. They are aware of the issue and offered the same DST solution that I have already tried.

            I suggest you download SKTools from http://www.s-k-tools.com/index.html?sktools/m_feat.html There is a Database Maintenance tool in it. Use it to delete the ghost appointments on your device. This might solve your issue.

            Hello Jack,
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea either. I made a search on the forums. Check this reply from Sharon Dahan to a similar issue in the thread below. Manipulating the dst on the device seems to solve this problem.</div>

            I went to check on HTC's website and found a couple of updates there. but nothing about a DST fix. Maybe TMCcool may want to check if his device has the latest ROM.

tmccool, by any chance are you traveling between different timezones?

<p>&nbsp;When I called HTC (not their website), the support tech said he was aware of calendar sync problem, and that the DST timezone switch was the solution. When I told him that I had already tried that more than once, and that it fixed the problem only for one
 day. After I told him that, his only response was to download an old DST hotfix and try that. Since I had already done a hard reset to the device, I saw no harm it trying it, but it had no effect good or bad.<br />
<br />
No, I don't travel between timezones.<br />
<br />
I checked the ROM update on HTC's website and I have the most current ROM version. However, I saw the backlight fix and I'm glad to find that. Thanks for the unintended help with that!<br />
<br />
I've decided that no one has the answer to this problem. I am going to try the SK Tools suggestion because I'm open for anything at this point. But there seems to be no explanation or solution for this problem from anyone at Microsoft, AT&amp;T or HTC. It's something
 I will just need to live with and learn from. Thanks!</p>

            I have found a work-around here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://mobilitysite.com/2009/01/have-an-att-tilt-running-wm61-and-your-calendar-entries-are-not-syncing-over-the-air-to-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mobilitysite.com/2009/01/have-an-att-tilt-running-wm61-and-your-calendar-entries-are-not-syncing-over-the-air-to-exchange/</a><br />
<br />
This has worked for me for more than 24 hours (at the time of this posting, it has worked for four days). This solution is different from the other timezone switch solution that did not include turning off the automatic time change function and worked for only
 24 hours or less. The downside is that whenever I travel to a different timezone (luckily that is infrequently) I'll have to manually change the time on my phone. I don't know what will happen when the DST time changes this spring. Time will tell.

            I would also like to add that when I tried to install SKTools, I received a warning that it was not compatible with Windows PocketPC edition. So I didn't try it.

<h2>            How can I get outlook to only download new email&#63;</h2>
                    I have very limited space on my computer but plenty on my email server. &nbsp;I want to keep my primary email storage on the server for now but use outlook to read new messages. &nbsp;I don't want large .pst files taking up space locally. &nbsp;Is there a way to make
 outlook only download unread messages? &nbsp;If not, what about updating just the inbox and no other email folders I keep on the server?

            <p>Are you using a POP account?&nbsp; With POP, there is no such thing as read or unread mail, only old and new mail, with the server telling Outlook what's new or not.&nbsp; If you want Outlook to download only messages that you have not read, then log into your mailbox
 on the server, create a folder other than Inbox, and move those messages to the other folder.&nbsp; If they're not in Inbox, Outlook can't see them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your server supports it, employ an IMAP account, although that could lead to a PST large enough to hold all the data in the Inbox as well because Outlook will echo all server messages on the local PC as well.</p>

            I am also having the same problem, I haven't received any new e-mails since December 23rd. I usually receive around 10 e-mails a day but none are coming through. I put it down to it being christmas but still nothing and haven't received an e-mail that
 I was told had been sent.

            Hi<br />
I have been experiencing the same problem. Please tell me microsoft have solved it, this is so frustrating as there are no phone numbers for support. I am recieving sporadic emails after a message was sent from outlook telling me that my account was growing
 too fast and that i needed to delete old emails. <br />
The little advice I have recieved so far has taken me to a dead end and I can't even do online chat as it comes up with error has occurred. I'm begining to think they have a glitch in thier system that they can't find, as I see on this forum so many people
 have the same problem.<br />

<h2>            Why am I FORCED to change my PASSWORD&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that Microsoft has decided what is best for ME! Just like the new Light Bulb act for 2014 and the Toilet Act, I once again have someone telling me what is best for me. Just think, I survived these 66 years on this earth on my own. I made it through
 the Marines and Vietnam, even figured out how to drive and turn on and off my TV. Did this all on my own. Now, like some<strong> "Big Brother" of 1984</strong> I am being looked down on. For my own protection. I liked my old password. Had it for well on 5
 years, even got it to a point that it was used on other accounts. Like, GMAIL,YAHOO, IPHONE and IPAD. Now this is all changed for my protection. I donâ€™t like it, and I am not sure how to stop this over concern for my well being..................</p>

<h2>            Excel 2008 - Problems with Date Format when moving from old Macbook White to new Macbook Pro</h2>
                    I'm in New Zealand. We use the date format dd/mm/yy or dd/mm/yyyy
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found that opening existing spreadsheets created in my old "Macbook White" on the same version of excel, the date changes from the NZ version to the US format in the new MacBook Pro recently purchased.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both computers are using OS X 10.9.1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even after changing the cell format to the NZ date, the cell shows the date as US format.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Consulted with Apple who confirmed that my settings were correct for NZ. They suggested that the software MS Office 2008 for Mac is somehow overwriting the date parameters that were set up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me?</div>

            The only thing I can offer is to tell you that Excel gets its date information from the system preferences when it opens. Changing the system values after excel is open will not affect that instance of Excel. So if you need to change the system parameters,
 quit excel, change them and restart excel.<br />

            I don't want to hijack topic. <br />
I'm facing the exact same situation on other side of the globe (Europe, Romania). MS Excel from Office 2008 for Mac keeps the US date format, regardless of the local setting in OS X.<br />
OS X version is 10.9.1, Macbook Pro Retina dec 2013.<br />
MS Office 2008 for Mac version is 12.3.6. <br />
Consulted with Microsoft suport here in Romania, opened technical claim no. 1234969648, closed with answer: "Tried everything, nothing worked. No solution" We tried all available version of MS Office 2008 from 12.1.0 to 12.3.6. (complete uninstall, restart,
 install, restart).<br />
They suggested me to buy MS Office 2011, but there is no price for Upgrade from 2008, I have to pay full price again. No happy at all, I'll not do it.<br />
Maybe someone here will find the solution.<br />

            <p>Iâ€™ve got exactly the same problem with Excel 2008. The date format was the correct international dd/mm/yyyy format by default on my Macbook 2009. When I moved to a Macbook Pro 2012, Excel for some reason decided to use the annoying American mm/dd/yyyy format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried changing the system language and date formats, tried everything, cannot find how change it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprisingly in MS Word, it does use the international format, as do all other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely someone somewhere knows how to fix this?</p>

            <p>There were problems with this in early versions of Excel 2008. Are you sure your copy is fully up to date?</p>
<p>Again, make sure Excel is CLOSED when you are changing the system date. Try changing it to something else and then change it back to what you want. Then restart Excel and try again.</p>

            <p>I tried with every version of Excel 2008. Microsoft support, via remote, tried all available versions of Excel 2008. We (me and Microsoft support via remote) installed first version, then we applied each update one at the time and we replicate the error
 in each version of Excel. We always waited for Excel to be closed (cmd+Q) and out of memory before any change to the system. The problem was never solved in any of the updates.</p>
<p>I bought a new licence for Office 2011, but I'll be happy to find a solution to use old 2008, because I like it better. I hate that I had to pay twice for the same product.</p>

            <p>I am in the UK. This problem has just appeared on my iMac, I suspect with the upgrade to OS10.9.2. Current versions OS 10.9.2, Excel 12.3.6. Date and International preferences have not been changed and are correct. If I re-boot to a cloned version of the
 mac with 10.9.1 everything is OK. The bizarre thing is I have two other macs both on OS 10.9.2 and Excel is working correctly with the UK date format. If I open a known "good" file on the suspect mac dates look OK however if I add a new date it is in US format.
 Also the formula bar always displays US format despite a UK date in the cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect some flaky OS/Excel interaction whereby Excel is not picking up the International system settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As previous posters I have tried removing and re-installing Office with appropriate restarts.</p>

            <p>JamEton, same here, desktop working fine but new laptop will not go to UK format. Have reloaded system software 10.9.3, fresh load of 2008, all service packs, ticked on and off 1904 date format, ensured changes made then closed excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use spreadsheet when travelling and this effectively stops me working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tudor2000 was that the only way to solve by buying new software?</p>

            For me, the only solution was to buy Office for Mac 2011. I wasn't happy at all to be forced to pay the full price again. In the future I will no buy MS products unless I have no alternative.

<p><span>Hello Clive,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on my knowledge, the short answer is yes. This required an Azure tenant and Office 365 tenant. Office 365 uses the cloud-based user identity and authentication service Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
 to manage users. If you have an Office 365 subscription, you have a free subscription to

            <p>Hi 18876955438,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not feasible to insert a plain table when you report the Data-Model.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I suggest you try the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Report the Data-Model.</p>
<p>2. Copy the table which reported the Data-Model.</p>
<p>3. Paste to the sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you repeat a CELL in a Word 2013 table like a table header row when it crosses across more than 1 x page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm putting together a simple table of Terms with detailed notes. I have several "Terms" that have several pages of "Details Notes". The Header Row repeats on the following pages as it should. What I'm looking for is to have "Cat" repeat on each page so
 I know what I'm looking at as a scroll through the table (I have about 60 pages of notes, so this would make it easier to find information)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>You don't mention if you are trying to do this via VBA automation so I will assume you don't want to use VBA coding and in that case the answer is... change your table row setting to not allow it to break across pages.</p>

<h2>            cursor sometimes disappears in Review Pane</h2>
                    We use Word 2010 to edit documents sent to us by people at other institutions (so the files are rarely created by us, although of course we do an initial "save as" rather than editing the original). Files are a mix of .doc and .docx. In these files, particularly
 those with many comments and changes, we've noticed a problem with Word 2010 that we didn't see in Word 2007.
<br />
<br />
With the Track Changes option "Final: Show markup" and using the Draft view, I can click on a callout in the text for a Word comment that then takes me to that comment in the Review Pane. If I then try to click inside the Review Pane to edit that comment, the
 Review Pane shows part of the document (as seen in the main part of the Draft view), the cursor is nowhere to be found, and I can't begin typing anywhere. I have to close the Review Pane and click back in the document in order to get the cursor back, but I
 can't edit the comments at all.<br />
<br />
A partial solution is to edit the document in Print view rather than Draft view, which allows Word comment editing in the balloons in the margin. However, if there are many comments, or if a comment gets very long, Word will automatically open the Review Pane
 during comment editing. I can usually continue to edit the comment, but if the comment is long the cursor again disappears, similar to the problem in the previous paragraph. And then if I try to switch to a different comment or if I switch to the document
 and then back to the Review Pane, I get the problem in the previous paragraph.<br />
<br />
Is there a simple fix that we're missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

    <title>nokia 6700 slide&#58; time text massage was sent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kk_munich  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia 6700 slide&#58; time text massage was sent</h2>
                    
<p>The text messages/SMS on my new nokia 6700 slide only show the time when they arrived on the phone e.g.. when it was switched on, not when the message was sent.</p>
<p>All my phones before this one showed the sending time. Which makes perfect sense - in case a message like "I'll be there in 30 min." is not delivered directly.</p>
<p>Even the message details only show the time the message arrived on the phone.</p>
<p>I cannot believe this.</p>
<p>Has anybody found a solution to this, yet?</p>

<p>Unfortunately (and unbelievably) it does not. It only shows the time the message was received on the phone not the time the message was sent (even in options / message details). The time the messag was sent is the information needed though, in cases the
 phone was off or in a dead spot! Is there anything I can do about it?</p>

<p>KK_munich, I'm sorry to tell you that it is not possible to view the time at which a msg was SENT.&nbsp; For some reason this is also one of the features that you'd get in a very very basic phone such as 1100 (out of production) but not in the later models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an additional info, you can see when your msgs get delivered by checking the timestamp in the delivery report.</p>

<p>There are a quite a lot people like you (including me) who think on those lines. We have to live with it. Or go for some other third party app. Not sure if a software update would include this functionality. Only Nokia can comment on that</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having the same problem which is really frustrating especially as I have had this phone for 7 months now and it has only just started to stop showing me what time messages were sent.&nbsp; It is also delaying my text messages so I am not receiving them until
 a day later which as you have stated is not good especially if it is an urgent text.&nbsp; I have tried updating my phone only to be told no updates available.&nbsp; I really am at a loss as what to do.&nbsp; My phone is still under warranty so am going to take it back to
 the O2 shop where it was purchased although I am afraid they will just tell me there is nothing they can do.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind if I had had the phone for a long time but as I said I have only had it 7 months (my old phone I had had for three years and never
 had a problem with that!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions please???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi I have just bought a c2-05 and am pleased with it but it too records the time a text was received and not sent. I live in a poor reception area so that is really not very good. I wonder if anybody managed to find a solution?Thank you. It would also help
 if this problem was listed in the tech details when choosing a phone.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> berndhanke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook 2007 unresponsive</h2>
                    My Outlook 2007 has become unresponsive. I can open it but I am unable to perform any action. My suspicion is that this is because my stored e-mails have become too large. However, since Outlook is unresponsive I seem to be unable to delete any old e-mails.
 Is there a way of deleting e-mails outside of Outlook?

<h2>            Sort rows, but keep data together across worksheets</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.&nbsp; I am not sure how to word this.&nbsp; I am having trouble with linking cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 7 tabs/worksheets for each class workbook.&nbsp; Each workbook is one class:&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the tabs:&nbsp; grades, attendance, seating, info, proj, pp lss, behavior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On each tab I have the last name and first name of the students in common.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue. I am concerned that if a sort the students on grades and I have linked them to a cell on attendance that the students will end up linked to the wrong data.&nbsp; I was wondering if there was a way to tie together the last name and first name one each
 worksheet so they can sort and stay together.</p>
<p>I do not know enough about excel or databases.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I am trying to learn.&nbsp; I have been trying to work out this issue for over a year on my own with no luck.</p>
<p>Basically, I have a grade program that I love, but it is missing a section on behavior.&nbsp; I want everything in one place, so I have been trying to create my dream gradebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don't link to a spcific cell - use VLOOKUP functions keyed on unique names to extract the data of interest.&nbsp; For example, if you have two columns with Last names and First names, create a third column where you use&nbsp;formulas like this, on each sheet (and
 then copy down to match your table)</p>
<p>=A2 &amp; " " &amp; B2</p>
<p>to create a cell with first and last name combined, then use those cells for the VLOOKUP, like</p>
<p>=VLOOKUP(C2,Behaviors!$C$2:$G$100,3,False)</p>
<p>to pull values from the Behaviors worksheet. If you sort the Behaviors sheet, make sure that you sort the entire table, including the names. Use help to learn more about VLOOKUP, or post back if you have problems.</p>

</p><p>If the Windows Mobile device that you're using is locked to a specific network, it will not be able to read the SIM card from a different service provider. You will have to get in touch with your network service provider and request for the code that would
 unlock your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your phone is SIM unlocked, you can now use other SIM cards and the phone settings should be able to read the phone number from your SIM card.</p>
<p>

    <title>Nokia 920 release date Belgium&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivlo---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 920 release date Belgium&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As it already released in Germany and UK, I am wondering when the Nokia 920 will be available in Belgium ?</p>
<p>Can't seem to find any info anywhere ... buying it in Germany is not really an option, as I would like to buy it as a package deal with a subscription in Belgium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            You need to contact Networks and retailers in Belgium for an answer to that. Due to high demand in some countries release for others has been delayed.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Nokia does not announce country release dates through this support forum.

            If you cannot find anything locally, you may be able to import one from another country's online retailer website, as such. If you are able to find an unlocked, carrier-free variant, then you will be able to use your subscription in Belgium.

<p>Hi MayankShukla3,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if you're trying to upload a custom app and add it as a tab in Teams?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/647f5894-dbfa-42be-b919-14779834b6f1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/647f5894-dbfa-42be-b919-14779834b6f1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that you built an app or bot and would like to add to Teams. If so, it would be better for you to post the issue in
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/home?filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN forum</a>,&nbsp;which is designed for developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if it's convenience, you can share the detailed steps with us in the post. I'll help you check if I can reproduce the issue in my test environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

            Hi Marvin,<br />
<br />
Thanks for reaching out to me,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Yes, we are trying to upload a custom app and add it as Tab in Teams.<br />
It was working perfectly fine a week ago, but now when we upload a custom app and try to hit the Save button to save the Tabs configuration it return the error "<span>Unable to save the configuration for xyz Tab".<br />
<br />
I just want to know, if there any changes in the parameter that manifest accept at Microsoft teams side.<br />
<br />
Tabs configuration is given below:<br />
<br />
<div>microsoftTeams.settings.setValidityState(true);</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnSaveHandler(saveEvent =&gt; {</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; const origin = window.location.origin;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; const contentUrl = `${origin}/teams/index.html`;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; microsoftTeams.settings.setSettings({</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; entityId: 'com.dev.teams',</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contentUrl,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suggestedDisplayName: 'Dev1 Knowledge Cloud',</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; websiteUrl: 'https://www.xyz.com',</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; });</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; saveEvent.notifySuccess();</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; });</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; microsoftTeams.settings.registerOnRemoveHandler(removeEvent =&gt; {</div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>MayankShukla3,</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried to create a custom app with your manifest.json file and upload to Teams, but it's your organization resource that I don't have permission to access. So you can see the Save button is disabled.<br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3835c677-454e-4418-bb74-62b33bf66ef0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3835c677-454e-4418-bb74-62b33bf66ef0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official article</a>, the manifest schema for Microsoft Teams doesn't have parameter update. In this scenario, you can refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/troubleshoot/troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot your Microsoft Teams app</a>&nbsp;to check if it helps. Meanwhile, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-app-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
App Studio</a> is a new tool to develop apps for Teams. You can also use the tool to check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, since the issue is related with app development, you can also post the issue in

<p>In addition i could read video in IE on the video tab from the Bing result. Video preview can read quiet well but unable to watch the video from the bing page. Is it &nbsp;there any way i can fix this myself of it depend on the quality of Windows 10?

            <p>Thanks you for your prompted reply. here is what happen. </p>
<p>When i click on the video i can only see a black screen stand until i chose to go back. After adding bing to the compatibility view settings i saw a white windows instead of the previous black.
</p>
<p>So i pasted the same link into Google Chrome and the video read; the same as Firefox browser.
</p>
<p>I am using HP Pavillion TouchSmart 14 Sleekbook. </p>

    <title>Excel 2016 Box-and-Whisker Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kohizeri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Box-and-Whisker Errors</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to make one of the new Box-and-Whisker charts in Excel 2016 for some Likert scale data I keep running into some confusing errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I select up to 6 rows of my data, with labels, it will successfully create a box-and-whisker chart but will not have the appropriate labels on the horizontal axis (I can get them in a Legend, though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Example shown below: If I select <strong>more</strong> than 6 rows of data, the chart fails to be created properly and I am instead left with just a plot of my data points (horizontal labels&nbsp;<em>are</em> present now, surprisingly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how I can get Excel 2016 to create a box-and-whisker charts for selections of more than 6 rows of data at a time? Also, how to get it to display horizontal labels when selecting smaller data sets?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I know that some of my data sets don't have the same number of entries. I tried removing those already, but it did not alleviate the issue.</p>

            What sort of answer is this?&nbsp; B&amp;W plots are very touchy, and misplot when you specify the label row.&nbsp; There has not been an answer for this since it came out two years ago?&nbsp; Shame on MS for this poor support

<p>Hello Kohizeri,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was having the same issue and other issues with the Box and Whisker plot.&nbsp; So with your issue about only the data point showing up.&nbsp; Simply select 4 rows of data and then create the chart.&nbsp; When the chart is created click on the chart to select it
 then right click and go to select data.&nbsp; Once you do that you can then select all of your data and the chart will begin to take shape. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; My issue with this chart is that the boxes are damn near on top of each other so applying data labels is out of the question. &nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            Ok so if you want to spread out your plots select one of them and then edit the Gap Width to 0%.&nbsp; You still do not get more room between them but at least now if you center your data labels the numbers aren't on top of one another.

    <title>Editing Excel 2013 pivot tables in Excel 2010 - compatibility issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesp_ar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing Excel 2013 pivot tables in Excel 2010 - compatibility issue</h2>
                    <p>I have created an excel workbook in 2013 from scratch that has several pivot tables. &nbsp;When I shared it with a co-worker using 2010, he could not change the filters or update the pivot table in any way. &nbsp;He received this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;"This PivotTable was created in a later version of Excel and can't be updated in
 this version.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To update it, click OK, and then open the workbook in the version of Excel it was
 originally created in."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched all the forums I could find and found this article addressing built in data modeling in 2013 that, if used, render workbooks incompatible with 2010:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Version-compatibility-between-Power-Pivot-Data-Models-in-Excel-2010-and-Excel-2013-188f44fd-3cfd-4aa7-b4e6-a9402653cbf3?CorrelationId=44cff400-acdc-4dda-aff3-1f88653399fc&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#__error_messages_in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Version
 compatibility between Power Pivot Data Models in Excel 2010 and Excel 2013</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is still puzzling me is that I created the pivot tables just as I would have in Excel 2010 or 2007 - no relationships between tables, no data modeling. &nbsp;I don't think I used any features unique to 2013. &nbsp;Was is it just the fact that the pivot table
 was created in excel 2013 that causes it to error in 2010? &nbsp;Frustrating.</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I did not check the box "Add this Data to the Data Model" in the Pivot table dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I went to File &gt;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check for Issues &gt; Inspect Document &gt; and checked the Data Model. &nbsp;The document inspector said "No embedded data found in the Data Model".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, your comments did prompt me to also run the Check Compatibility tool. &nbsp;What I figured out through the compatibility check is that the Timeline feature (new to 2013) uses the
 "whole days" check box when it filters dates. &nbsp;Well, the "whole days" option isn't available in excel 2010 or prior and you can't un-check it and still use the Timeline feature.</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So
 the problem wasn't data models but my Timeline, which isn't available in 2010 or prior, and it rendered the whole pivot table and chart read-only.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I delete the timeline entirely, all the other features now work for 2010 users as expected. &nbsp;Thanks for your help.</span></p>

            <p>I just did some research on this. Selfie sticks that plug into the headphone jack just do adjust the volume and therefore only work with phones that allow taking a picture by pressing the (phone's) volume button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lumia 640 (similar to many other Windows Phones) does not offer that. Moreover, Windows Phone seems not to let apps know when the volume button was pressed, so there are not even third-party apps which could help you there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems your only option currently is a bluetooth selfie stick (as opposed to the ones with a headphone cable). This should work with the "Lumia Selfie" app if you are on Windows 10. See the description in the Windows store https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/p/lumia-selfie/9wzdncrdzz4p</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Andreas</p>

            I just tested a selfie stick with Bluetooth 3.0 on w10m (Lumia 640XL) and it still does not work, same problem as with a jack, the photo shutter does not turn on, only the audio volume that increases! Thanks for coming to vote to correct this in a next
 build please: HTTPS://AKA.MS/G8XSW7
