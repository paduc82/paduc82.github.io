<h2>            SD Card contents are showing up under Others folder memory</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am facing a weird issue with my Lumia 620. Last week, I formatted my SD card&nbsp;from my Phone(formatted from the "Phone Storage-&gt;SD Card-&gt; Format SD Card"&nbsp;option in Lumia 620). From then onwards, what ever I&nbsp;store in SD card is getting added in "Others" folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For e.g., I have selected my SD card as the default place to store my pictures and Music+videos. If I take a snap using my phone camera, the Image is not getting displayed in Camera Roll. However, I am able to see the picture when I connect the phone to
 my laptop.&nbsp;Also, "Others" folder memory in Phone Storage-&gt;SD Card&nbsp;is increased.&nbsp;The same is happening when I copy any of the image, mp3 or video files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soln Tried: </p>
<p>1. Reset the SD card by connecting to a desktop</p>
<p>2. Tried using another SD card in my Lumia 620</p>
<p>3. Tried updating the phone s/w to Amber update</p>
<p>4. Copy the contents to SD card using a Card Reader, Windows Explorer, Windows Phone App</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing helped me. Is there anything I can do other then the above soln?</p>

                    I am struggling to connect to Teams today. The error switches between a 500 error or this: "AADSTS9000411: The request is not properly formatted. The parameter 'login_hint' is duplicated". I have tried clearing my Credentials in the cred manager and restarted

    <title>Lumia 950XL oleophobic screen coating rubbing off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael.nichols  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950XL oleophobic screen coating rubbing off</h2>
                    <p>I've had my 950XL for two months and the oleo phobic screen coating has come off in the upper left-hand corner of the phone where it appears to have rubbed up against a 10 pence coin in my pocket&nbsp;(you can just barely make out under the right light a 'coffee-stain'
 like pattern which matches up perfectly with a 10p coin; the primary - noticeable -&nbsp;wear though is a very small area up at the upper-left hand corner where it appears to have worn through to the glass).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The coating is also covered with micro-scratches (which started happening&nbsp;within a day of&nbsp;getting the phone), much more so than my previous Lumia 930 (significantly more than the 930) or any of my iPhones.&nbsp; I have been simply living with the micro-scratches
 as wear-and-tear for the phone as you don't notice them whilst using it and they're going to happen with a device you take in and out of pockets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that may just be unlucky with how I've used the phone, but would like to know if anyone else has had the coating come off under what they would consider normal use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ordered a screen protector, which I prefer not to use, but may give me some peace of mind given that this wear-and-tear has come out of nowhere over a short space of time.&nbsp; Thankfully, the wear is not on the viewing area itself which would be really
 annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've probably just been unlucky and put it in a pocket that I shouldn't have, but still for the coating to wear down to the glass like this doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is not a dig at Microsoft, and despite any issues I'm having I'm still looking forward to the next iteration of the Lumia to be released.&nbsp; Surface phone?&nbsp; That would be cool.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm finding it very difficult to find the 'coffee stain' coin pattern, if at all this morning, it might only be visible under the right lighting (if it is there at all now).&nbsp; Also, the small area where the coating has come away is still there, but you really
 need to look for it.&nbsp; Still a concern that the coating has come off.</p>

            <p>The coin pattern is visible when sunlight hits it at an angle.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
And it's possible that what looks like a coin pattern could be a thumb, however there is no sort of fingerprint.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As I do use hand lotion,&nbsp;maybe I&nbsp;got some on the phone. &nbsp;I admit that I have only started using lotion in the last couple of months and so my other phones would not have been exposed to it like the 950XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then if it was hand cream, you would think I would have marked up my Surface Pro 4 at some point, and yet there are no blemishes on the Surface whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now that the initial shock has worn off, I've accepted that by going without a screen protector I've chosen the acid-wash look.&nbsp; The first blemish is always the toughest, and I accept that the phone is no longer 'new'.&nbsp; The blemish does make the phone look
 old, but it isn't horrendous.&nbsp; With a few more blemishes it will have some real character.<br />
<br />
I have a screen protector on the way, and will give it a try, but in the end, I will likely opt for going naked with the phone and adjust my expectations on screen wear-and-tear.</p>

            <p>I've had my 950 XL for about two months today and I've experienced the problem all over my screen. Micro-scratches and all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scratches were off-putting at first but they aren't horrendous so I just let it be. But down the middle of the screen, from the top to bottom, you can see that there is something that was once there and no longer is. I've had this problem with&nbsp;both of
 my 1520's (one was stolen üòû) as well, but nowhere near as fast as it's happened with my 950. There are even spots on the bottom directly over where the navigation bar buttons line up. Through the middle of the screen and the nav buttons are the most common
 places I touch the screen on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;also found myself comparing the screen quality to my friends' iPhones or other smartphones to see if theirs have gone through the same things but nope. They've even had their phones 3x as long as I have. Usually with a lot of elbow grease and a good
 microfiber cloth, I can temporarily hide the "stains" until I get the screen dirty again. The best solution would be to get a screen&nbsp;protector, because&nbsp;it seems as if the Gorilla Glass doesn't hold up too well on these&nbsp;coated phones.</p>
<p>If anyone knows a way to completely remove the coating and could send some knowledge my way, that would be much appreciated!</p>

<h2>            N73 Problem &#40;nsu&#41;</h2>
                    Hello Nokia community!<br />
<br />
I got a new handy some days ago (Nokia N73) and installed the complete software package on my PC.<br />
I ran the NSU (Nokia Software Updater) which told me to update my handy.<br />
Step1, Step2 no problem but then i had to reconnect the Datacable (usb connection) and after that the handy is deleted completely.<br />
I tried so many times to get a connection to it again but i have no ideas.<br />
Unknown Hardware found is what my PC is telling me all the time and also the NSU cant find it on the other side of the USB cable.<br />
<br />
Is there a chance to write a new software to the phone?<br />
<br />
I ask because i have no garanty on the product (older then 24 month) and i dont know whats the prize for a new software.<br />
<br />
I hope someone here can help me.<br />
<br />
PS: Sorry for my bad english, im from germany.

            In Germany you might find help in the store where the phone was bought (at least from the same operator: Vodafone, T-Mobile etc...). They might send the phone to the NCC for or have another solution to make it work again. Even though they might charge
 you more than the NCC.

Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
Yes, when you add additional Office 365 Personal subscriptions to your existing account, the subscription period (years) would stack up as many as licenses you purchase.<br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have further questions related to this, please let me know.

<h2>            Does Skype Open the url links that I send in a IM chat window&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our company has a quote system which lets us know whenever someone opens one of our companies quotes... and what we notice is that whenever we send a quote link via skype, this message tells us that someone or thing at these URL's viewed our quotes. I checked
 who owns these IP's and it seems to be Microsoft... I don't really have a problem with it as long as I know it is Microsoft or Skype... and not someone else. Please let me know what is happening... it only happens when we send a link through skype. Thanks

            Most of these types of error are caused by faulty Internet Explorer add ons, Lets check if thats the same for you by opening Internet Explorer in a special "no add on" mode.<br />
Please click start --&gt; all programs --&gt; accessories --&gt; system tools --&gt; Internet Explorer (no add ons) and see if you still get the error.<br />

<h2>            Amber Update still not available on my Lumia920</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a Nokia Lumia 920 (I think is unbranded) and I still didn't received the update</p>
<p>Manufacturer Name: RM-821_eu_france_267</p>
<p>Mobile Operator: 000-FR</p>
<p>Configuration ID: 150675</p>
<p>Label ID: 1232.5957.9200.10211.142</p>
<p>And the current firmware version is: 1232.5957.1308.0001</p>
<p>And I'm currently on Portugal...</p>
<p>But france and portugal have Country Variant already available</p>

<p>France even have Orange Available</p>
<p>Why I can't update? I've never flashed my phone... So it's still an original ROM.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes sence that the Nokia Software Updater is detecting that update for my phone since is unbranded (000-FR) and the Firmware Version matches the ones on the country variant on the country where I'm living now, Portugal and where i bought the Phone,
 France. What doesn't make sense it's that simple fact that I can't get the Update via OTA</p>

<p>You will be able to get the update once it is available _TO YOUR PHONE_ which is currently is not (yet). As it seems the update has been made available for your phone's product code it would seem it won't be long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where you live has no bearing on when you get the update, The product code of the phone has.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try looking up the word patience in a dictionary. If you have such an urge to get the update have your phone updated at a Nokia Care Point (will erase everything)</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've got the same issue here. Mine's label ID is : 1232.5957.9200.10211.142. It's also an unbranded phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it'll roll out to my 920 soon.</p>

<p>Exactly the same problem here. I bought the 920 in the phone house in France (mobile operator 000-FR) but I live in Belgium. Everyone here who isn't in France seems to miss the update so maybe your location IS important if you want the update. I looked at
 the french forums and no one complained about not getting the amber update. At other fora, all french said they received it and were very happy about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update availability is variant related had nothing to do with location. Have a look at the link below. I see that as of today, a few of the French variants already have their updates but your SFR variant is still awaiting approval.</p>

<h2>            IE10 Won&#39;t Retain Cookies</h2>
                    When I go to a website and log in, selecting "remember me" normally IE will retain the cookie so when I go back the login information&nbsp;is retained. Out of the blue mine stopped doing that. My settings on security and privacy are default at medium and medium
 / high so retaining cookies shouldn't be a problem. THIS IS NOT AN AUTOFILL ISSUE. I don't use autofill and never have. This is only about IE remembering the cookie. All my other W7 IE10 computers are fine. Any ideas?

            Hi Swassociates,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to make sure Delete temporary files, cookies, save passwords, and web from information is unchecked. I would suggest you to try the following steps to check if it is unchecked.<br />
<br />
a. Open Internet Explorer.<br />
b. Click on Tools.<br />
c. Click on internet options.<br />
d. under browsing history, make sure delete browsing history on exit is unchecked.<br />
e. Click on Apply and OK.<br />
<br />

<div>Yes, you should be able to do so through the Organizer/Calendars tab and using the Rename button. But if the calendars are at enterprise level in a Project Server environment, you will need administrator rights to change the name.</div>

<p>As for the <em>why</em> I can only guess that it is because web apps are nowhere near as robust as desktop applications. Also, that is a macOS-specific keyboard shortcut, not one that is internal to Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a standard full-size keyboard, try using the <em><strong>del</strong></em> key in the navigation key group. If you have a laptop or condensed keyboard [such as an Apple Wireless] try using
<em><strong>fn+delete</strong></em>.</p>

            <p>What I mean is that when I open Access, if I try to do anything (besides click About Access - which tells me Access 2000 (9..3821 SR-1)), a message comes up: "An error occurred and this feature s no longer functioning properly. Would you like to repair this
 feature now?" If I say yes, it tells me to insert the 'Microsoft Office 2000 SR-1 Premium'&nbsp;disk. Unfortunately, as hard as I have looked, and I continue to look, I can't find my disk. When I&nbsp;click OK it tells me to "try to find the installation package 'DATA1.MSI'
 in a folder from which you can install the product Microsoft Office 200 SR-1 Premium." When I search for a file by that name nothing is found. When I click OK, I'm back to Insert the disk. So I click cancel. After a couple of messages saying it needs the disk,
 it tells me, "Microsoft couldn't find the file 'system.mdw.' This file is required for startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have gathered, .mdw has something to do with security, but the databases I need have never had any security attached to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The databases were working fine until I let the Windows 10 update happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I revert back to Windows 7 will everything work again?</p>

            <p>The MDW file is not just for security. It also controls record locking. It sounds like your Office install is in need of repair. Without the disk you might be out of luck. There might be some available online but you run the risk of buying a pirated copy
 that won't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2000 should run on Windows 10, but we're talking about a really old version of Office so there is no support for it. You might be okay if you can revert back to Windows 7 but that won't fix the broken Office install. I hope you have done system backups
 and have a good image to revert to. Otherwise you will have to install some version of Office. Your 2000 database should open okay in a later version of Access.</p>

            <p>Probably not. Workgroup Security - the part of Access that uses .mdw files - was removed from the program several versions back (in Access 2000 I believe); some versions would recognize the .mdw file and use it but not allow new security to be set up. But
 I'm pretty sure that with 2013 (and 2016) the feature is no longer available at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably need to open the database in a version that supports the Workgroup Administrator and set the default user to Admin, with a blank password. This will remove security and the need for the mdw file. But I don't believe this can be done in
 2013. I'd be happy to learn otherwise!</p>

<h3> mike_884  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export and&#47;or Backup all Office 2013 settings</h2>
                    Office 2007 included a tool to export all settings. That has gone. AFAIK only the toolbar/quick access bar can be exported (file/options/toolbar, right bottom button).<br />
Per application, i.e. Excel.exportedui, Outlook.exportedui and so on.<br />
<br />
How to save allll the other settings ?<br />
(Apart for buying a yearly subscription on a tool)<br />
<br />
Is there absolutely no other way than to create screencaptures and of each and every settingspage and compare those with the new settings after a fresh install (new pc, new hdd) ?<br />
<br />
Maybe this question has been asked a zillion times.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. How do you configure the application to send email? Do you configure it via
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn554323(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>?</span></p>
<p><span>2. If yes, what method do you use, SMTP submission, direct send, or SMTP relay? Please tell us the detailed settings.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Where did you include the setting?</span></p>
<p><span>4. By saying ‚ÄúI can only send emails to the same domain only and thats is mine‚Äù, if you send emails to other domain, do you receive any NDR (non-delivery report)? If yes, please send us the complete
 NDR for analysis.</span></p>
<p><span>To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect the information. You can click the following link to access the PM:</span></p>

<p>"Clear recent call from logs" helped. but it absolutely inappropriate behaviour. I lost all my recent calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;How log memory can be full if I have so big phone memory and it almost empty. Nokia you should fix this... I even do not know how to call it, "cheep", "kids" bug.</p>

            Please note that the reset codes has an asterisk (or star), " * ". The soft reset code is STAR-HASH-SEVEN-THREE-SEVEN-SEVEN-ZERO-HASH ( *#7370# ). And you don't have to press the call button in order to effect a reset: the phone will prompt you to enter
 the lock code as soon as you type in *#7370#.

<p>had the same prob go into menu/log/options/settings and set log durration to no log hit yes, then set it back to 30 days.</p>
<p>that should work, if not update your&nbsp; firmware by typing *#0000# options/check for updates.</p>

<h2>            My Lumia 535 is not functioning.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Lumia 535DS with Windows 10. It so happened that the phone memory somehow got exhausted and since then it has got stuck somewhere, it means that i can't access the tiles or the Start Menu, can't access the apps installed. I can access
 the settings, can receive the calls. Tried Soft Reset but was unsuccessful. What should i do? Please help me as I don't want to loose all my apps and data.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't want to change my microsoft name, but the name for my user folder from C:\Users\(my name) back to what I said above; how do I do this; as it seems to be using my last name as my user folder name</p>
