<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may disable the other DVD ROM from device manager. Thereafter, check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer:</span></b>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to manage devices in Windows XP</span></a></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>If possible, connect the Philips DVD8701 RW drive to a different computer &amp; check if the issue reoccurs.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to internet with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetinnj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to internet with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 Home on my Windows 7 laptop on Thursday using the Media Creation Tool and free upgrade. &nbsp;Everything seemed to go smoothly. &nbsp;I am able to access internet with my Chrome browser and I can get my mail with Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can't access the internet AT ALL on any of the Windows 10 apps. &nbsp;Here is a run down of what's going on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store: &nbsp;"Check your connection." &nbsp;Error code 0x80072EFD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge: &nbsp;I put in a URL and I get "We can't reach this page." &nbsp;This happens no matter what I put in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search Bar &amp; Cortana: &nbsp;"We can connect to web search right now, but you can still search for your stuff. &nbsp;Make sure you are currently connected to the internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Activation: &nbsp;My Windows 7 computer WAS activated. &nbsp;When I try to check activation for Windows 10, it says "Unable to reach Windows activation servers."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't enter the product key that I have. &nbsp;Says "very embarrassing. &nbsp;Our activation servers are down."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows can't activate right now. &nbsp;Try again later. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, contact support. &nbsp;Error code 0xD0000272."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son was here on Sunday and tried to get it going. &nbsp;He did some troubleshooting stuff, but couldn't get an answer on what's causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a repair upgrade. &nbsp;Made a DVD using MCT with the Windows 10 files. &nbsp;Ran setup. &nbsp;Everything went smoothly (again), but still can't connect. &nbsp;When I ran the repair, I shut my firewall, disconnected from internet and uninstalled my anti virus.
 &nbsp;This was one of the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son suggested that I do a refresh. &nbsp;But I see that will uninstall a lot of my programs. &nbsp;If that happens and the refresh doesn't work, my Chrome will be gone. &nbsp;How would I connect to internet to download programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also.....I can't access Windows Update, so there is no way for me to update Windows 10. &nbsp;This is what bothers me more than the other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please, please, please help me?????&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks very much for your suggestions. &nbsp;I followed the instructions, got through to activation. &nbsp;I thought it would take a few minutes. &nbsp;It seemed to be going well, &nbsp;but had problems with automated system. &nbsp;Got live person. &nbsp;Something failed and he sent
 me to tech support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent an hour on the phone with Rea. &nbsp;She accessed my computer remotely and ran all kinds of tests and checked various things. &nbsp;Outcome is that apparently, my Dell laptop is NOT one of the ones Dell tested for Windows 10. &nbsp;Everything I checked before installation
 indicated my computer was good to go. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, my two options were to reinstall Windows 10. &nbsp;I have already done that with same result. &nbsp;Other option was to revert to Windows 7 for now. &nbsp;I opted to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She got the reinstall started, said it would take 45 min - 1 hour. &nbsp;When computer restarted, I would be back at Windows 7. &nbsp;Computer restarted and I'm still in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I will be back with tech support tomorrow. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for your help. &nbsp;I appreciate it.</p>

            <p>I contacted tech support again on Wednesday, March 30. &nbsp;I spoke with Jude, who was very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, when I installed Windows 10 the second time (which I thought would be a repair install), it deleted the windows.old file which is needed to return to Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She said I had to get a Windows 7 Recovery Disc from Dell. &nbsp;I thought the whole purpose of backing up my computer and creating a repair disc for Windows 7 before I did the 10 upgrade was so I could return if something went wrong. &nbsp;But that is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She told me to call Dell and get the disc (actually it's a flash drive). &nbsp;She was going to e-mail me with some info. &nbsp;She also said to reply to the e-mail when I got the drive and we could set up a phone appointment so she could personally help me. &nbsp;I never
 got an e-mail from her.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Dell. &nbsp;Since my computer is out of warranty, my options were the flash drive ($28.87), phone tech ($129), one year service contract ($250). I went with the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has not arrived yet. &nbsp;Hopefully, today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for asking.</p>

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker--&#62;Save Movie File--&#62;Throws off timing. What&#39;s up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I made quite the video on Movie Maker. It's a music a video of sorts with cuts of the band playing (both live and the music video) mixed with video of certain things from the Civil Rights movement. It all ends with a bang where the last minute is a cascade
 of pictures timed perfectly to a constant drum beat during the last minute. I worked for 6+ hours and I was finally satisfied with the timing and ready to save it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where the problem arises. The timing has been thrown off ever so slightly. It seems to have been a tad sped up. The transitions weren't perfect in Movie Maker, but that's what gave it the timing I wanted (I should add I didn't manually insert any
 transitions. I'm simply referring to the natural transition between clips). The saved file has cleaned the transitions up a bit to the detriment of the timing. I don't want to go back in a manually change the timing, because I'd go mad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a total amateur at this. Is there a setting that just translates the exact Windows Movie Maker product to a movie file?</p>

                    <p>We have been using all win7 home&nbsp;premium 64bit computers for several months in a new startup conpany. We have the need now to create a domain and join these computers but we do not want individuals to lose any of the data they have on these computers - just&nbsp;move
 their document folders to the server. Problem is we have purchased a number of volume licenses only to now find out we cannot use them to upgrade Home Premium.&nbsp;My question is: &nbsp;how&nbsp;do you&nbsp;upgrade windows 7 Home&nbsp;Premium with a volume license, and which edition
 should we choose?</p>

            Windows 7 volume Licenses are upgrade licenses, which means, the computers must be running a qualifying license such as Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate. Consumer editions of Windows 7 such as Starter and Home Premium do not qualify for volume license
 upgrades. <br />
<br />
Your option to remain compliant with the license is to upgrade the Home Premium licenses to Windows 7 Professional, then you will qualify for the Volume license upgrade. If you don't have a qualifying license installed, then you will need to get a Genuine Windows
 License Agreement from Microsoft. An audit might be required. <br />
<br />
Even when you get the Genuine Windows License, you will still have to do a custom install, because there is no upgrade path from Home Premium to Windows 7 Volume License Upgrade. The best work around is to upgrade licenses to Windows 7 Professional using Anytime
 Upgrade, then upgrade to Windows 7 Volume License upgrade. <br />
<br />
From Microsoft <br />
<br />
Sometimes companies will use volume licensing to install Professional edition software on more PCs than are allowed.&nbsp; For instance, Windows volume licenses require an existing qualifying operating system pre-installed as a pre-requisite on each PC. In most
 cases, this means a Professional-level operating system is required. Companies often acquire PCs with Windows Starter or Home editions pre-installed and mistakenly then apply a new Windows volume license for Windows 7 Professional.

<div>If you think this might be happening within your business or organization, Microsoft and our trusted partners offer easy, economical ways to help ensure that the software installed on your PCs is properly licensed.</div>

    <title>System Recovery Uses a LOT of Disk Space - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System Recovery Uses a LOT of Disk Space</h2>
                    <p>I have nothing loaded onto my laptop (because there's no room!!!) yet 72.9GB (of 110) is allocated to System Recovery. When I search for answers I'm pointed toward system restore points and setting max disk space. You can see that I've set max disk space
 at 2% but that's certainly not reflected in the TreeSize pic; are they two different things?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help as to how to reduce the space used by system recovery AND tell me how to keep just one
 restore point? I should just need to keep the 3/14/19 one right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            OK I see now it isnt' the Recovery partition at issue, but the System Recovery folder on C is bloated. 
<br />
<br /> That folder can be installed by Dell System Recovery and will go away if you uninstall Dell System Recovery factory bloatware - what better example of why we call it that!   In Dell Alienware PC"s it's called Respawn.  
<br />
<br />Full discussion and discover of it is here:  <a href="https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/system-recovery-folder-huge-and-growing.2688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windows10forums.com/threads/system-...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope that helps.  I'd delete the Dell System Recovery in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.

            Hi lalffgz
<br />
<br />You must be running a Dell or Alienware PC
<br />
<br />Uninstall Dell Backup and Recovery, or on an Alienware, uninstall ReSpawn
<br />
<br />You do not need that running on your PC, Windows has a built-in recovery option
<br />
<br />Dell Backup and Recovery is well known to eat up your hard drive, if left running on a PC, it is best to remove it!

<h3> _sbsb_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 is &#34;corrupted&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. I have a Lenovo Thinkpad x61. I know, it's an old laptop. I had Windows 7 Ultimate on it. It worked fine for a long time, when suddenly, the laptop no longer runs Windows, and instead shows a blue screen saying that the Windows file is corrupted.
 I tried to use the Product Key on the back of my laptop to try and get another windows&nbsp;7 file, but it didn't work. so basically, I have a defective laptop and I am unable to do any sort of work on it until it is fixed. (I refuse to get a new laptop (probably
 because I lack the financial resources to do so)) Please help!

<h2>            Windows 10 apps - Edge, Mail, Weather, Calendar, Search - not working</h2>
                    <p>Yestreday my screen started flickering while I was not working, and the only solution was to restart PC.</p>
<p>Today (maybe yesterday too, but it was late, I didnt checked), none of the mentioned apps are not working. Edge, Weather, Mail&amp; Calendar start for a second or two, and than Window just dissapear.</p>
<p>Search option on Start menu is not working at all. Before, I could just start typing letters while start menu activ, and windows search would done the job. Now ,I type letters, but nothing happens.
</p>
<p>Finally, my feeling is that system is littlebit slower than yesterday - pushing windows button on the keyboard need second or 2 to start the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for the replies.</p>

<p>To my knowledge voice chat is not recorded unless you setup something with an AV receiver to a recording device and that you would need to ask the manufacturers of the recording device not us here.</p>
<p>You can broadcast and talk but the other players chat will not be included in the broadcast</p>

                    <p>Good Morning All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am new to this forum, hope am clear in what i am asking here if not clear please update me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to upload bulk photos in to Outlook 2010 using a script which i used to run in Powershell ( Exchange Management Console). However it was working earlier form past couple of days the photos were not uploading as it throwing some error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">error : "&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>The operation couldn't be performed because object 'AgnihoDi.' couldn't be found on 'FC-****-DC10.ind.FC.LOCAL'.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + CategoryInfo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : NotSpecified: (0:Int32) [Import-RecipientDataProperty], ManagementObjectNotFoundExceptio</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When i checked with my server team i got an update that the photos am using are saved in ".JPEG" format which exchange will not accept so we have to save the pics with ".JPG" extension. &nbsp;Is that correct MEC will not allow .JPEG format? is so earlier i can
 able to upload the pics with .JPEG.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping will get a quick comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />To navigate through your conversation history: if you have username and password these are the steps
<br />
<br />1-  Under Contacts or Recent, click the contact or group you want to see the conversation history for. Your instant messages and call history with that contact or group are displayed in the main window.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2-  If you can’t see the person or group in the Contacts or Recent list, type the name into the Search box, or scroll to the bottom and click Show earlier messages.
<br />
<br />
<br />- If you do not have the username or password, you should contact Skype support so I can help you
<br />

    <title>Broken Windows Store and Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frozen.k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Broken Windows Store and Apps</h2>
                    <p>I've been having issues with the windows 10 store and it's app (some of them at least, Mail works) not opening. Every time I try to open said programs the window would open for a split second before closing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on, I did some research into this and followed some advice to try to use the
<strong>windows 10 store troubleshooter, </strong>which said that the store cache and licenses may have become corrupt. Proceeding with the troubleshooter to reset the store gives me the error-</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>m</strong><strong>s-windows-storePurgeCaches</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Following even more advice I used a command prompt to use the<strong> SFC /scannow</strong> function which showed the store being corrupt and claimed to be downloading the file to replace the corrupted ones. after downloading and rebooting as instructed,
 windows 10 had become corrupted on a major level as I could no longer get past the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each log in (using the correct password/pin) would welcome me and open up to a dark screen where the login page would fade in again. This would happen infinitely no matter how many times I entered my password (it did acknowledge incorrect passwords as being
 incorrect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on from there, I held shift whilst pressing the restart option in the power options on the login screen to boot into the safe mode(?) and used the startup repair option in the troubleshooting to hopefully correct what went wrong, where it instead
 reset my C: drive (I thought it was just refreshing, not being reset) which leads me to where I am now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is the windows 10 store and it's apps <strong>still do not work</strong> even after a
<strong>full reset of the C: drive.</strong>&nbsp;So I leave it here for some more advice on how to fix this. (Bolded important information to help troubleshoot)<br />

            After trying all the fixes from Microsoft reps, none worked. &nbsp;Here's what did. &nbsp;Right click start, click run and type in services.msc. &nbsp;Even though you likely have another anti-virus program, Windows Firewall must be running to download programs from the
 Windows 10 Store. &nbsp;Find Windows Firewall in the list, click Properties, then click either Manual or Automatic and then click Apply. &nbsp;Then click Start. &nbsp;This will fix your problem downloading and updating Apps from the Store. &nbsp;Since it will conflict with your
 third-party anti-virus program, go back in to services.msc and disable Windows Firewall after downloading /updating apps. &nbsp;But you will have to turn it back on again to update or download Apps from the Windows 10 Store. &nbsp;Windows must have put this in one of
 their updates.

            <p>Apologies for the several days later reply, was without internet for the past week. Back on topic:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the steps KevinQuail provided there was no change. My <strong>windows defender firewall</strong> was
<strong>running</strong> the entire time so it wasn't a matter of it being stopped. For arguments sake I tried disabling it and checking the store with it offline to no avail, and then restarting it and checking again without luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the steps you provided using <strong>powershell in admin</strong> and entering the commands had
<strong>no issues</strong> but had <strong>no effect</strong> either. As far as I could see, the packages were being downloaded just fine with no errors at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to say the problem still persists.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification, Teri.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to check the speaker you're using if it's recognized by the Skype application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Skype application, select your <strong>profile picture </strong>&gt; Scroll down to
<strong>Audio &amp; Video Settings </strong>&gt; Under <strong>Speakers</strong>, check if your preferred device is recognized by Skype.</p>

    <title>Unable to login to Skype Desktop on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to login to Skype Desktop on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm using a brand new Dell Laptop with Windows 10 Version 1709.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been unable to login to my Skype Desktop App with my Skype password. However, the same username &amp; password works fine when i login to any of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>web.skype.com</p>
<p>My Skype account on www.skype.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-installing the Skype Desktop App (which I finally managed to do after several tries on the Windows Store).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Skype Classic is no good - while I was able to install it properly and login to it, I'm unable to see all my Skype contacts and previous Skype chats. Hence this won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Ayush</p>
<p>

</p><p>I tried both your steps, and tried logging in, but it kept giving me the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i tried logging in with my other hotmail account, and that worked! Bizarre. So for now looks like I'm set. I'll just re-add the few contacts that I regularly Skype with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven't had any actual errors with ntdll.dll but I have reason to believe there might be a problem with it. I've tried to several times to run a malware scan using spwyware doctor's malware detective scan, but every time I do, it stops when scanning C:\Windows\system32\ntdll.dll
 and fails to ever progress past that point. I realize the problem may lie with spware doctor but is there a possibility that I have a problem with ntdll.dll? And if there is can anyone help? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hello ASkyeValentine,</span></p>
<p><span>We would not recommend using third party software. However, you can use it at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to use Microsoft Security Essentials.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Some malware/spyware/virus that is out on the Internet, will also change system settings, corrupt data, and log invalid registries that will also make annoying
 errors, as like the ones you are encountering.&nbsp; You can try a virus scan. Just keep in mind that if your system does contains a virus, the active virus can try to keep the system from installing/using the virus scan correctly. Online Virus scans (sometimes)
 will not have that problem.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com</span></a> &nbsp;- OneCare is Microsoft's Virus Scan.&nbsp;
 You can attempt using the OneCare Safety Scanner. That is OneCare's online Scanner. Sometimes it will not launch properly if your system is not under a specific ordinance.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the below link to perform an online full service scan on the computer:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, I suggest you to run SFC scan to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 7 system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted, changed, or damaged.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and&nbsp; select Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 should see the following on-screen message:</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></p>
<p><span>Verification % complete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the KB article for more information:&nbsp;</span></p>
