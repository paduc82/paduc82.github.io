<h2>            TOO many Phones, TOO Many cables TOo MUCH Incompatibility.</h2>
                    If you will take a comment from a technician: When are we going to get some interfacing standards going? Hundreds of cables, fit hundreds of phones and very little is compatible. As a radio engineer I cart around about 100 kilos of cables and adaptors
 so I can interface from every know cable adaptor top every known transmitter and receiver. My mobile phone a Nokia cheap 1112 is **bleep**, it can't be heard on loud noisy environments and I can't get a cable to upload new ringtones to ity that I can hear.
 I am not goign out to buy a mobile phone just to fit a mobile cable. The industry needs to take a cold hard look at itself and come up with a serious data interface standard so that as techs we dont need 50 cable adaptors to talk between devices.

They have standardised the chargers so the data cables will use the same port, on many different brands of mobile phones.<br />

<h2>            Cleaning Up an Access Database for the first timer</h2>
                    Ok, I'm hoping someone on here can provide me with a go to directions or simply give me some simple instructions on how to clean up an Access database.&nbsp; I have a database that has been used for around 8 years and I've deleted small things, but it's getting
 way to lost in all the tables, quries and reports.&nbsp; I know I don't use many of them anymore, some only being done for a one time info needed project.&nbsp; It's a little overwhelming looking at all the info and trying to start weeding through.....is there an easier
 way? Like to see exactly what all is linked together? Or some report of showing dates of last time used?&nbsp; Any suggestions would helpful. It's my first time trying to clean up an Access database.

                    I am trying to export my slides as JPGs, but when I get the dialogue box, the size ratio is locked. When I change the width, the height changes, too. How can I unlock so that I can enter the values I want?

            I'm not trying to skew the images at all. The presentation is set up in 16:9 format, and the export is changing it to a different aspect ratio, and when I tried to change it to 720x405 in the sizes at the bottom, it changed the ratio. Very strange, because
 I just tried it again, and it is performing properly. Never mind, I suppose.

<h2>            Minecraft on Amazon fire 8</h2>
                    We bought minecraft from amazon for $6.99. Its on 3 amazon fire 8 tablets. The one tablet my 8 year old plays we cant get minecraft to load. It opens for a min. Has a white screen that says minecraft then goes right to the tablets homepage. I have called
 amazon they took over and helped uninstall and reinstall. Then we had to factory reset (TWICE). Once again its doing the same thing. I do not want to keep messing around. It is only the minecraft app on (1) Tablet that is doing this. Please help. Mojang is
 not getting back to me.

<h2>            HTC HD&#38; running windows phone 7.8 OS not detecting parrot minikit&#43; bluetooth speakerphone</h2>
                    <div>Hi. i have been using a Parrot Minikit+ bluetooth car speakerphone with my HTC HD7 phone running Windows Phone 7 Mango. I was able to make and receive calls, use Windows Phone's voice commands to answer calls, reject calls, and send and receive text messages.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently updated to Windows Phone 7.8 OS and now the phone is not detecting the parrot minikit+. i have updated the firmware on the bluetooth speaker to ver 1.24, but that has not helped either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even if i restart the phone, toggle bluetooth off and on, it does not detect the parrot speakerphone. i have tried resetting the speakerphone, clearing the contacts from its memory, but i have come to the conclusion that the windows phone update is buggy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>kindly help me resolve this problem as soon as possible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The parrot UK website says that this phone is compatible with their device and should support</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
Receive calls</li><li>
Make calls</li><li>
Caller identity</li><li>
Automatic phonebook synchronization</li><li>
Bluetooth stereo (A2DP)</li><li>
Bluetooth stereo player control (Play/Pause/Next/Previous) via Bluetooth</li><li>
Bluetooth streaming restarts automatically after a call</li></ul>
</div>
<div>
<div>Pairing both devices</div>
<div>From the phone:<br />
* Go to MENU / SETTINGS / BLUETOOTH&nbsp;<br />
* The phone will search for available bluetooth devices<br />
* From the list tap the Parrot Product<br />
* Enter the Bluetooth PIN Code then select DONE<br />
* Your device and Parrot Product are now paired and connected<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT!<br />
When pairing is performed from the Parrot Product the phone must be in Bluetooth menu to be discoverable<br />
From the phone:<br />
* Go to MENU / SETTINGS / BLUETOOTH</div>

            <p>Hello Ajay:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having pairing your phone with your bluetooth device.&nbsp; I have seen at least one other reported issue with the Windows phone pairing with Parrot devices.&nbsp; That customer was able to get this resolved
 with a little trick.&nbsp; Please let us know if any progress is made.&nbsp; If not, please provide additional details regarding your experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please set up the phone and the device for pairing.&nbsp; When the phone begins to search for the blue tooth device, remove the battery for about 1 minute.&nbsp; Replace the battery and check the bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional details we would like to help continue troubleshooting:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you go to the phone and tap settings &gt; bluetooth &gt; are any devices found here?</li><li>If a device is found, at what point is the pairing failing, before the code is requested, once you have attempted to enter the code, after entering the code, etc...?</li><li>Have you attempted to connect the phone to another bluetooth device?&nbsp; This is important as this may be a compatibility issue between the two devices or a larger issue with the phone using blue tooth.&nbsp; If you have yet to attempt pairing with another device,
 please try.</li><li>What is the exact OS version running on your phone, tap settings &gt; about &gt; more info.?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>

<h2>            SOLVED&#58; Outlook Cannot Sync Subscribed folders Since June 2017 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last weekend (25th June) I did the feature upgrade on my Windows 10 Pro laptop and since then I cannot download e-mail from any of the IMAP accounts.&nbsp; The two Hotmail accounts work fine, but the IMAP ones give me the error that 'Outlook cannot synchronise
 subscribed folders (0x800ccc0e)'.&nbsp; I have two other W10 Pro machines running the same version of Office 365 Home, neither of which have had the update yet, and both of these still work normally.&nbsp; There have been no other changes to software (e.g. antivirus).&nbsp;
 I have picked through the account configuration and it's fine.&nbsp; The only difference I notice is that on the two PCs that haven't been updated, the IMAP security can be set to either TLS&nbsp;or SSL, as specifics in the dropdown, while on the updated laptop it shows
 as "TLS/SSL", which suggests the laptop also has a different version of Outlook (although the version number and build seems to match on all three)?&nbsp; I've tried various older suggestions to resolve this issue to no avail.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,<br />
Marc.</p>

<p>True, but my service provider has some specific port and security requirements, so I had to configure the accounts manually.&nbsp; Either way,&nbsp;identically-configured accounts on different machines behave differently according to whether they've had the update
 or not, suggesting something was changed in this feature upgrade.&nbsp; The only thing that was obviously different pre- and post upgrade was the TLS/SSL dropdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have a look at the known issues article you linked to when I first noticed the problem, but couldn't see anything about subscribed folder errors.</p>

 the IMAP synchronized successfully. &nbsp;I re-enabled the filtering and Outlook still works. &nbsp;(Possibly coincidence, but I tried this with the AV several times before this update without success.)

<h2>            Find &#38; Replace Multiple Strings with VBA - Help with this macro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking to find and replace a list of words in a powerpoint full of queen's English words (Analyze = Analyse, Capitalize = Capitalise, etc) and replace them with their American English counterparts.&nbsp; Here is what I've been using so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Sub us_qe()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oSld As Slide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim oShp As Shape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim otxtTemp As TextRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim otxtR As TextRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strFindWhat As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strReplaceWith&nbsp; As String</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strFindWhat = "Analyze"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strReplaceWith = "analyse"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oSld In ActivePresentation.Slides<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveWindow.View.GotoSlide oSld.SlideIndex<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each oShp In oSld.Shapes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oShp.HasTextFrame Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If oShp.TextFrame.HasText Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set otxtR = oShp.TextFrame.TextRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set otxtTemp = oShp.TextFrame.TextRange.Find(strFindWhat, 0, False, True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While Not otxtTemp Is Nothing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otxtTemp.Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox("Replace " &amp; strFindWhat &amp; " with " &amp; strReplaceWith &amp; "?", vbYesNo) = vbYes Then otxtTemp.Text = strReplaceWith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set otxtTemp = otxtR.Find(strFindWhat, otxtTemp.Start + otxtTemp.Length, False, True)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next oShp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next oSld<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Sub</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">This works great for one word.&nbsp; Takes me to the word, asks if I want to replace it, and does so.&nbsp; I have a few questions here:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">1.&nbsp; I don't think this is the right start to go about replacing a list?&nbsp; Array("word 1", "word 2") isn't working at least.&nbsp; I have a list of 30+ words to look for.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">2.&nbsp; I'm hoping to keep the case the same, i.e if it finds "Analyse" change to "Analyze" and "analyse" to "analyze".&nbsp; Not sure if MatchCase:=True works here or not</p>
<p class="contentStandard">3.&nbsp; I want the macro to search in shapes and tables as well as text boxes.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have minimal VBA knowledge but would greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to help!</p>

            <p>I've noticed similar problems with select before. It only happen sometimes and I have no idea why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe try making the textrange (temporarily) BOLD or Italic instead</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try this illogical method - Select any shape on slide one before running the macro each time. Seems to help and I have no idea why.</p>

<h2>            Stopping the informational sheets with filename, directory, template, subject...etc. from printing</h2>
                    Every time I print a word document through Microsoft Office Word an extra sheet of paper prints. This paper contains a bunch of information regarding the filename of my documents, my name as the author, the date and time created, the date and time saved,
 the total editing time, date last printed on, the number of pages, number of words and number of characters. I would like to stop these extra sheets from printing as they are a waste of paper and ink. I have no trouble printing&nbsp;documents from&nbsp;PowerPoint&nbsp;or&nbsp;Excel.
 I have the 2007 version.&nbsp;

            This is on the print options. In your Print dialog there is a window for "Print what."<br />
It should say Document rather than Document Properties.<br />
<br />
This may be a "sticky" setting so when it gets changed once (say by a stray mouse-click) it stays that way.<br />

<h2>            No option to purchase UHD version if HD version is already owned.</h2>
                    I just finished talking with Microsoft support, and currently, there is no option to repurchase a UHD version of a movie if you already own the HD version.&nbsp; I've tried both with The Matrix, which was released today, and with Fantastic Beasts and Where
 to Find Them, which has been out for awhile. So I know it isn't just glitch with newer movies. This is a feature that Microsoft has dropped the ball on.&nbsp;

<p>it does seem like there needs to be some work done for this app. I get advertisements to buy movies in UHD that I can't because I purchased the SD/HD version already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to upgrading to UHD or repurchasing, I'd really like to see the ability to download videos especially UHD to the xbox hard drive for playback there like we used to be able to do on the xbox 360 for SD/HD downloads. &nbsp; The windows app can do this,
 just wish it was applied for the xbox one s/x as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
I'm using Office 2013 Pro on Win 7 64. Images stopped working as described previously in this forum. I can paste but not load or insert images of any sort. Files with images when opened have images corrupted. I cannot print any file containing images. I have
 repaired and then uninstalled and reinstalled Office. No change. I see below that someone "cured" the problem by reinstalling the OS. That is not acceptable. I need a fix or WordPerfect is in my future.</p>

            An error occurred while importing this file. This is the error message when I try to insert an image into any office application.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm using Office 2013 on Win 7 64. I can paste an image, but cannot insert. Images once pasted can be saved. But when the file is opened, the message "This image cannot currently be displayed" appears for some while others display, and some appear as a black
 spot. Using change picture with insert always ends with the above message. All uses of insert picture in all Office apps ends with the message "An error occurred while importing this file." Same result with tiff, jpeg, gif, bmp, etc. I have repaired, uninstalled,
 and reinstalled Office more than once. This does not fix anything. I saw a reply to this question elsewhere that said the OS needs to be reinstalled. &nbsp;The directions to find the graphic filters does not relate to my Win 7 installation. I can't find installation
 options. I see Control Panel --&gt; Programs --&gt; Programs and Features. The only further options are Organize, Uninstall, and Repair. Tried all of them and no installation options. This is not acceptable. I see WordPerfect in my future if this does not get fixed.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I agree that you shouldn't have to reinstall Windows to fix this. However, you may have to try a manual uninstall of Office and then reinstall the suite. See
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>Of course, you have to make sure that you are able to reinstall Office before the uninstallation</strong>. If you have a subscription version, you should be able to manage your installations via

            I have Repaired, Uninstalled, and Reinstalled Office several times with no change to the symptoms. I cannot insert images of any sort. I can paste an image, but documents with images do not load with the images intact. I have checked multiple threads in
 multiple locations and have yet to see a solution, that I have not attempted other than reinstalling the OS.&nbsp;

            Yes, I have used the Control Panel --&gt; Uninstall, I've used the Control Panel --&gt; Change --&gt; both quick repair and online repair. I've uninstalled and reinstalled twice now. In this process there is no indication that I have any options on what I can chose
 to install. There is no list of options for graphic filters that I can find.

            <p>A manual uninstall can't be done via Control Panel. You use a so-called Fixit or you manually delete files and registry entries. See
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>You are right that there is no way to customize a click-to-run installation of Office. You get all or nothing, unfortunately. When things don't work, that is another sign that something may be damaged with the installation.</p>

            <p>My power supply died an unnatural death so I am just getting back to this.</p>
<p>I did a manual uninstall. Reinstalled and nothing has changed. I still cannot insert images and I cannot load documents with images without getting a 'cannot display' message in Word. In PowerPoint the message is 'An error occurred while importing this file.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the 32 bit Office Pro first then the 64 bit version. Same issues in each. I am getting good at manual uninstall. I've had a lot of practice today and haven't crashed my OS, yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manual uninstall instructions in the note above:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</a>&nbsp;does
 not match my installation. Step 1 didn't work until all other steps were completed and the computer rebooted. None of the tasks in step 2 exist. None of the tasks in step 3 exist.
</p>
<p>Step 4 was a key to getting step 1 done. First stop the service and then delete it.
</p>
<p>Step 5 was OK. Note that step 4 must be completed and computer rebooted for Step 5 item 3 to get done. Step 5 item 7 "FFPackageLocker" is named "ClicktoRunPackageLocker."
</p>
<p>Step 6 was fun. Step 6 item 2: the first two entries were as noted in the instructions. The third entry is&nbsp;\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\ProfessionalRetail - en-us and there isn't anything for the individual Office apps. In HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office
 there is a mass of stuff. The instruction said to delete&nbsp;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\ClicktoRun so that is all I did here. Maybe I should have deleted the entire Office subset? I don't know what "Office Key" means at the end of Step 6.
 Is that some sort of jargon I am supposed to know without definition?</p>
<p>Step 7? I guess I did this. I don't remember there being anything in the Start Menu folder to delete.</p>
<p>Step 8 just did not match. I hunted through the items in the registry and found this:</p>
<p>Click-to-Run Licensing Component<br />
{90150000-008F-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE}</p>
<p>When I reinstalled the 32 bit version of Office this entry returned to the registry.</p>
<p>When I installed the 64 bit version I got these:</p>
Click-to-Run Licensing Component<br />
{90150000-007E-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE}<br />
Click-to-Run Extensibility Component<br />
{90150000-008C-0000-1000-0000000FF1CE}<br />
Click-to-Run Localization Component<br />
{90150000-008F-0409-1000-0000000FF1CE}
<p>
</p><p>The net is that after wasting a whole day on this, I am right where I started. I cannot Insert images into an Office application. I can paste an image and save the file, but when the file is loaded some images display and some do not and have to be repasted.
 I am really thinking Corel right now. I have PaintShop Pro and love it. I used WordPerfect in the past. I'm using Scrivener right now for writing, but I have got to have something with much more sophisticated formatting. Without graphic image support, Office
 is dead for me.</p>

            Since you mention both 32 bit and 64 bit Office, which one do you normally use? There have been problems with embedded objects, specifically PDFs, in some 64 bit versions. Maybe a variation on that theme has affected your system. Note that Microsoft recommends
 using the 32 bit version, even on 64 bit operating systems.

            I guess I was not entirely clear in my post to which you have replied.<br />
I have manually uninstalled 32 bit Office and reinstalled it twice. This did not solve the problem so I have tried 64 bit Office. I have the same issue with both versions. The manual uninstall does not help.<br />
My question in my last post is about the manual uninstall instructions. If you would follow your link to "Manually remove a Click-to-Run installation of Office" you will find the instructions I am attempting to follow. These instructions do not relate to reality.
 The first three steps are not relevant. The following steps all have issues that I related in my last post. If my failure to fix the image insert issue by manually uninstalling Office and reinstalling it is caused by an incomplete manual uninstall, perhaps
 the instructions for manual uninstalling miss something.<br />
I would like to be polite, but my frustration level is rising. I am writing a book on how to build a multi-user application using Access with the Jet database. I need images. Right now I am doing the writing in Scrivener where I have no trouble with images.
 My next book may be how to automate updating of PowerPoint slides from an Access database, but if I can't solve the immediate image issue, forget Microsoft. Yes, I have applications currently being used that do all this stuff. None of it is easy, so why can't
 I get an image to insert? Why am I being asked why I am using 64 bit Office when I have already said that I have tried both 32 and 64 bit versions? Can someone address my questions about the manual uninstall instructions? Is there another source for Office?
 Maybe a disk would work better than the Click-to-Run download.

    <title>N8 not using propper apn - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evildragon---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 not using propper apn</h2>
                    I went through hell trying to get tmobile to fix this, then they promptly told me my phonr doesnt support web, then told be its using the wrong apn, then hung up.<br />
<br />
Heres the deal, with packet data set to when available, internet works fine. But with packet data set to when needed, after a while of idle time, i keeo getting redirected to a web2go page saying i need to upsell my subscription, despite having flexpay unlimited
 data.<br />
<br />
So why is it seemingly that the phone is using the wrong apn in when needed mode, whereas in when available it works fine?<br />
<br />
Ironically, this all seems to have started though, since my billing cycle not only rolled over, but tmobile dropped unlimited data plans today. So much going wrong, im almost tempted to use a different carrier, but that option in the phone seems to fix it.

<p>How many APNs do you have set up on your handset ? Is one of them internet2.voicestream.com﻿ ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that the epc.tmobile.com﻿ APN is for 3G connection only, which is why it works "when available". When you are out of 3G coverage, "when needed" forces the use of 2G/EDGE/GPRS connection which for T-mobile US goes through the web2go APN mentioned
 above. Apparently using the second APN cuases the network to recognise you as a user on a different data plan, hence the messages you are getting.</p>

            I only have the epc.tmobile.com. I just tried changing it to internet2.voicestream.com and on 3g works superfast. Have not yet turned on when needed yet. Will in a bit after i verify that this other apn works in the first place as it should.

            Hopefully a final update. Everything worked out great with internet2.voicestream.com. I now am trying internet3.voicestream.com.<br />
<br />
Either its a glitch, but a 3g speed test showec 16mbps. Im sure its a glitch since hspa is only 10mbps.

            Well that didnt last. It does it again, and if i powercycle it doesnt work unless i powercycle with packet data set to when available.<br />
<br />
I might switch to AT&amp;T.

<h2>            Icons on desktop and toolbar for Word</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to the 2016 version of Microsoft Word. My icons on the desktop and the toolbar dissapeared for all of the Microsoft Office applications. I tried to reinstall them like another app, by going to toolbars -- new toolbars -- OS -- Program Files
 (both slick and (x86)) -- Microsoft Office -- Office 15 &amp; 16-- and then in there are only folders. There isn't anything in them. I can't find the programs to create the shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now for school, I have to go to my old reports, open them up, and then use that as the base to open a new document. Is it because they tried to put it on some sort of cloud? How do I go back to what it was!??</p>

            This is a relatively rare issue with the 1020, but there are hundreds of threads on the same problem with other models. Unfortunately the motherboard of your phone has developed a fault and needs to be replaced with a new one. There is no other solution.<br />

    <title>Using Publisher &#39;95 on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. rein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Publisher &#39;95 on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, I recently purchased a new laptop and was introduced to the problems involving Windows 7. I'm interested in accessing my old files for a book that was done with my Publisher '95.<br />
<br />
Question: What are the options to use Publisher '95 on Windows 7? I haven't tried the install disc directly as I'm concerned it will damage the computer.
<br />
<br />
I've been informed of a few options:<br />
<br />
-Run a virtual PC (after purchasing Windows 7 Professional)<br />
-Access .pub files and&nbsp; change compatibility mode on the properties of each file<br />
-Purchase Publisher '10<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!

            <blockquote>Ok, good ;) So, i've got at least one viable option.<br />
<br />
If I go this route, I'll def let the forum know what exactly happens in answer to your advice.<br />
<br />
Would you mind trying to open the file by changing the properties as listed in my email above via your older version? This may be a better and certainly more affordable way to go about things.<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering if using the virtual pc and sticking to Pub '95 would pay off after you explained the 'renovations' of Pub '10<br />
<br />
Have a nice weekend David &amp; Thanks again!!<br />

<p><br />
You are misunderstanding what is said in the article: How do I open Publisher 95 in Vista:
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6919352_do-ms-publisher-95-vista_.html#ixzz1mzTxGj00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ehow.com/how_6919352_do-ms-publisher-95-vista_.html#ixzz1mzTxGj00</a> This article is saying that if after you install Publisher 95 you have problems running it, then you can run it in 'compatibility mode' under Windows 95. It is not saying that
 you can change the properties of an individual publisher file. If after installing Pub 95 it does not run correctly then you change the properties of the Publisher program, not the individual files.</p>
<p>What operating system is on the computer where you ran Pub 95? Is it Win95, Win98se or what? The article suggests that you may need to run under Win95 but I am not sure that is the case. I think that the late,&nbsp;great&nbsp;Mary Sauer had Pub 95 installed on her
 Windows 7 machine and it ran just fine. In fact I don't remember her ever saying that she had to run any version of Publisher in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Bottom line is I see no reason to not just try to install Publisher 95 on your new Win7 machine. It is not going to hurt it. If Publisher 95 is part of an Office disk(s), then do a custom install and don't install the rest of Office. At the minimum just
 install it in its own folder rather than a default Office folder. Do you even have another version of Office installed? That is the only risk I can think of...that you might overwrite a newer version, and a custom install will avoid that. Also set a restore
 point just in case.</p>
<p>Then try running Pub 95 and you might be pleasantly surprised. And if you have problems then try running it under Windows XP mode before you go all the way back to Win95 mode. I am betting you won't need to run a virtual pc.</p>
<p>As to sticking to old legacy programs, I am not the best to ask. I am one of those people who follows the if it ain't broke don't fix it approach. I use a&nbsp;number of legacy programs that won't run on Windows 7. I thought Vista was a total failure and&nbsp;saw
 it a&nbsp;as a&nbsp;'downgrade'&nbsp;and am still running XP on most of my computers, Win98se on one, and even have my original DOS machine, though I don't run it anymore.&nbsp;Win7 is much better, but I just have not seen a need to move on to Win7&nbsp;and give up&nbsp;a couple of my
 legacy programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless a new version of a program offers me something I need that the old version doesn't, I don't upgrade. And even then you have to decide if the tradeoffs are worth it. Most upgrades also mean giving up features and functionality and sometimes
 the trade off is not worth it.</p>
<p>With that said, you will need to move on eventually. You may find that the printer drivers on your current printers will not work with Publisher 95.&nbsp;In that case you can print to a pdf tool such as
<a href="http://www.primopdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.primopdf.com</a> and workaround the problem for the short term. However eventually we all have to give up on our oldy but moldy programs. And remember you don't have to burn the bridge. I currently have
 Pub 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 installed on this computer and 2002 on another. Just remember that once you save a file in Pub 2010 you will not be able to open it in Pub 95 again.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<h3> n.c.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt worksheet - replace sheet without affecting formulas</h2>
                    
<p>Have a client file where one worksheet of the workbook is corrupt, open and repair not resolving.</p>
<p>If open workbook in excel 2007 try copy paste on the 2nd worksheet it crashes excel.</p>
<p>But no problems if open the workbook in excel 2003.</p>
<p>When I tried copying the worksheet to a blank workbook save that open it in 2007 excel, no problems copy paste not crashing excel.</p>
<p>Wandering if there is a way I can replace the corrupt worksheet without blowing up all the formulas, most of the fomulas refer to name ranges on various worksheets.&nbsp; If I just rename the sheet or delete it the formulas loose all the references.&nbsp; Tried to
 just copy replace the content, crashes Excel 2007.&nbsp; Only way I can get the copy/past to work is if I replace the worksheet but that means redoing all the name ranges and formulas.</p>
<p>Using excel 2007 on Vista or excell 2003 on xp, SP2 on both</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
