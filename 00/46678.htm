<h2>            movie maker won&#39;t open my wlmp or vep files</h2>
                    I made a long movie with an older version of movie maker and now I have the 2.6 and it tells me its not a supported file type. &nbsp;Cannot even import it. &nbsp;I have tried all the file converters that have recommended and I am freaking out as it is 2 hrs of photos
 &amp; music with animations etc. &nbsp;If someone can help me I would sure appreciate it!!! &nbsp;Thank You.

            <p>Windows Movie Maker 2.6 is actually a very old version of Movie Maker.&nbsp; It's from Windows Vista for those without a capable graphics card able to run Windows Movie Maker 6.0 (also from Vista).&nbsp; Those versions created .mswmm project files.&nbsp; You cannot open
 a newer project file in an older version of Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The .wlmp file is a project file from the latest versions of Movie Maker.&nbsp; Movie Maker 2012&nbsp;is&nbsp;part of
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Essentials</a>&nbsp;and that is what you should be using to open that project file to continue editing.&nbsp; I also assume you have all the source files still around on your computer too (the photos, video and
 music).&nbsp; The project file needs those in order to present a preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you get the project reopened and working again inside of Movie Maker, don't forget to save it as a
<u>movie</u> using <strong>File </strong>(Alt+F) and then <strong>Save movie</strong>.&nbsp; That will create a .mp4 or .wmv file.&nbsp; That's a true video file that then can be viewed, shared, etc. instead of just the project file which is the editing state inside
 of Movie Maker.&nbsp; The <u>project</u> file is just so you can go back and make more edits.&nbsp; It isn't an actual movie that can be "converted" to anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a file with a .vep extension, that is not even a Movie Maker project.&nbsp; The .vep extension is used by AVS Video Editor.&nbsp; Similar to the .wlmp file, it isn't an actual movie, just the editing state within the program.&nbsp;
 But for a .vep file, you would need to be using the AVS Video Editor, not Movie Maker.</em></p>

<h2>            Get a strange IPv4 address from DHCP server</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As title, I got a strange IP address - 169.254.XXX.XXX from DHCP server.</p>
<p>I used Wireshark, tried to get some bootp packets. &nbsp;I found that my laptop used 169.254.xxx.xxx as source address to send the DHCP discover.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there's an option called requested ip address content with 169.254.xxx.xxx. Just like my source address.</p>
<p>I could not access Internet with such this IP address.</p>
<p>I just wondering, is that a normal behavior for windows 7 to use 169.254.xxx.xxx to send DHCP discover?</p>

            <p>A DHCP request is sent via the universal broadcast address 255.255.255.255 which is one of the addresses a server listens to. The request includes the MAC address of the requesting device because at that stage it does not have an IP address. The DHCP server
 will respond to the MAC address in order to assign the address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case the 169.254 range is called the APIPA address and the PC actually assigns it to itself because it has not seen a response from the DHCP server. As you refer to Wireshark have a read of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://wiki.wireshark.org/APIPA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wiki.wireshark.org/APIPA</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The client cannot send the request via this address and get a response&nbsp;because the DHCP server will not be listening on the address or using the range. The response has to be via the MAC.</p>

    <title>What does the library default save location actually do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpakim1  say:</h3>
<h2>            What does the library default save location actually do&#63;</h2>
                    From Help it looks like it saves the library location to a location within the library which in turn is saved in the library and so on and so on.&nbsp; For instance, the "Documents" library contains (among others)&nbsp; "My Documents" which I've chosen as the default
 save location, therefore, the library, "Documents" is saved in "My Documents".&nbsp; Just silly.<br />
<br />
After reading some of the questions on this subject, it looks like it does something else.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So what does this default save location actually do?&nbsp; Please be detailed as it makes no sense to me yet.<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Okay to have a good laugh at my expense on this one.<br />
<br />
Or.... (I did some more research)<br />
<br />
... does this allow me to specify where a program stores it saves?<br />
<br />
If so, would the following be correct:<br />
<br />
My Flight Simulator saves are stored on my incredibly fast but smallish C drive.&nbsp; I want them on my massive D drive.&nbsp; So I set up a folder on my D drives called FS saves, put it the same library that Flight Simulator is in and choose FS saves as my default
 save location.<br />

            <p>Although downloading is up to ie9 and scanning of the files, </p>
<p>The default is the Downloads folder but files will end up in the proper/ optimize destination after scanning,</p>
<p>Right click dragging offers four choices,</p>
<p>Move to,</p>
<p>Copy to,</p>
<p>create shortcut to,</p>
<p>And Cancel My favorite :)</p>
<p>You can add Move to folder and Copy to folder to the right click context menus options using this,</p>

<p>Or Alt+E and click on either choice, it's a little safer :)</p>

                    Despite having played all morning with no issues, I am now unable to connect to my router. I have checked the password to ensure it is right and still no luck. Reseting the router is not an option unfortunately (people at home need it to remain on). All
 other devices including the PS4 right next to it are connecting fine. Any ideas? TLDR; That's the message I get, ideas?

 usually signs in just fine.I have reset the modem twice and still nothing.It has to be an issue with the xbox one device itself apparently because everything else connects and the settings are exactly the same as they were when I turned it off last night.I
 am about to pull my hair out.I love xbox but I am contemplating throwing it out the window.And I have no idea where to go for help on here</p>

            Hi DilgamSharifov,<br />
<br />
If there is a proxy server in your organization, you need to configure an exception for Office 365 URLs and applications from the proxy server. For more detailed information, please refer to the following articles:<br />

<br />
This issue might occur if the display settings on the 20" monitor is not set correctly. The stranded ratio for 20" monitor is 1600 x 1200 pixels.<br />

            <blockquote>
<p>My work laptop has been updated to Windows 7 and office 2010.&nbsp; I have a 20 inch and 17inch monitor - both set to the recommended resolutions.&nbsp; What I don't understand is my 20 inch monitor display is smaller for all programs compared to the 17th inch.&nbsp; For
 WORD, document size is smaller with larger dead space area on both sides. It doesn't make sense to me.&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Is the resolution for the larger monitor higher? If so, you should expect everything on the larger monitor to be smaller. The greater the resolution. the more there is in each inch on the screen.</p>

<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />

<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the&nbsp; manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.<br />
-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />

<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />

TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />

<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Also Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called
 the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />

<br />
<strong>Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled)</strong> . If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.
 If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 search can&#39;t locate outlook 2010 pst file</h2>
                    Installed outlook 2010 on a separate drive from an activated copy of outlook 2007. This made outlook 2007 disappear. Now outlook 2010, though it obviously contains data, won't send or receive mail. I am trying to use the inbox repair tool, but am unable
 to locate the outlook.pst file on my hard drive. Windows search function cannot locate any .pst file. Any suggestions are appreciated.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>My Xbox 360 refused to switch on, so I removed all the cables and started putting them back in one by one. Starting with the power cable, the Xbox 360 started, so I put back in the HDMI cable and the controller cable. All seemed to be going well and gaming was underway, until I smelt burning and looked down to see smoke coming from the controller cable where it connects to the controller.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I quickly unplugged everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;hole has been burnt in the controller cable in the plastic section which plugs into the controller and also houses the LED. I <em>think </em>what happened here was the the Xbox detected an electrical fault and so refused to start with the controller connected, but I bypassed the fail-safe by starting the Xbox without the controller connected and then plugging it in, but clearly the smoke&nbsp;shoudn't have happened regardless.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Notes on the hardware:</p><ol><li>The hardware I am usi

            <p>This can happen to any wired controller over time.&nbsp;</p><p>With the constant bending of the cable where it enters the controller housing, the insulation on the numerous wires can split exposing the copper wire within.&nbsp;</p><p>These can then touch each other and cause an electrical short&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>Once this happens a new controller is required.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes on Connection through Wired LAN</h2>
                    I have a Sony VAIO VGN-CR120E laptop currently running windows 7 which I clean installed a year ago on it.&nbsp; I always used the wireless connection until recently when I needed to use a wired connection.&nbsp; As a few seconds after I connected the LAN wire to
 my computer it would completely freeze. I can't move my mouse and even the clock stops on it. I have to turn it off by pulling out the battery or holding the power button for a few seconds. I have checked this on mulitple wired networks and the same outcome
 no matter what. I have updated all the drivers to the most recent version and double checked it.&nbsp; I disabled the firewall, antivirus program, wireless card, and unplugged USB items.&nbsp; I have unchecked the TCP/IPv6 in the properties for the port.&nbsp; No matter
 what I do it would freeze and have to be turned off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any other way I can fix this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks much appreciated. &nbsp;

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The Wireless Network looks good, as it should.</p>
<p>It "smells" hardware problem with wire NIC.</p>
<p>However,l starting to deal with hardware is quite costly with laptops.</p>
<p>So try first to re-install Windows. You do not need to reformat when booting from the DVD. Choose new install, it will give you an option to delete the current partition and initiate a new one.</p>
<p>Download all the Win7 Vista drivers from Sony Support page and store them on a flash drive. Win 7 will probably will detect everything on such laptop, but you never know, be prepared.</p>

<p>I'm an old man, living on my own, with no one to turn to for either advice or assistance and find that now I can't get through to a human being to actually speak with.&nbsp; How is this further improved surface , or support!!</p>
<p>And, to add to my problems various 'help' pages have defaulted to being in Portuguese - I speak and write in English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any human at Skype who can assist me - verbally??</p>

<h3> fi-knite  say:</h3>
<h2>            System freezes on CTRL&#43;ALT&#43;DEL logon screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in end user support at a university. One of our faculty members experienced an issue with her Lenovo All-in-one last semester wherein the CTRL ALT DEL logon screen was unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse could move, but could not click the accessibility options, and pressing CTRL ALT DEL yielded nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I swapped keyboards, no change. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get past this was to do multiple hard boots. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Virus scans revealed nothing; I swapped out the hard drive and re-imaged it as a last resort, but that didn't fix it either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We eventually solved the issue by giving her a new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a call this semester that the <em>same user</em> was experiencing the <em>
same issue</em> (again, CTRL ALT DEL logon screen non-responsive; mouse can move but cannot click accessibility icon) but the kicker is that she has
<em>a different, newer model</em> Lenovo All-in-one, and she is the <em>only </em>
user to experience this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Unlikely. It's been an issue with <em>two separate computers</em> with the same user. We image these machines once we receive them from Lenovo, and this is literally the only time this has ever happened. What are the odds on drivers not installing properly
 or being corrupted on two separate machines for the same user?</p>

            Turns out it was Dropbox. Like I said, virus scans didn't turn anything up, but removing Dropbox solved the issue. Clean-boot helped determine this, so thanks.

<h2>            moving windows apps to another drive</h2>
                    hi, I have moved an app from the windows drive to another drive to keep my windows drive free but when I checked the windows apps folder on the windows drive it now has the app listed as a shortcut folder but the app is still taking up space on the windows
 drive even though the app is showing on the other drive as well.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Did you follow a guide like this to move it to another drive? &gt; <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/move-windows-10-apps-other-drive-change-install-location" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/move-windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Should work for moving it without being a "fake" move. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps

            yes that is how I did it, when I go to apps and features and select the app and go to move it again it does say its installed on the new drive and can move it back to C drive but its still on the c drive. basically I cant install anything from the windows
 store because no matter what I do it will be taking up double the space. surely MS is aware of this problem.

            yes I have changed default location to the new drive, this is also interesting..... for example I installed horizon 4 now I got the selection to pick a drive to install with enough space, so I chose the new drive, I now have horizon 4 on my new drive but
 also on my C drive. I just don't understand why it keeps installing stuff to the C drive when I am not selecting that drive.

            Gotcha. 
<br />
<br />If you go to  Windows Settings, then System &gt; Apps &amp; features do you get an option to "move" items to another drive when clicking on them?

            I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers compatible for Windows 7.<br />
<br />

Open the Printer troubleshooter<br />
