<h2>            Is it safe to buy a refurbished xbox or withh the update issue follow it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Same Update and error code issue like others</p>
<p>Yes I took my xbox to a 3rd party repair place to switch teh cd drive . Why? It took less than a day. Most people are impaitent and do not want to send their system in to get worked on with the worry on if it will be returned in a timely matter. I know I
 was in the wrong.</p>
<p>What I worry is if I buy a refurbished one if I will fall into teh update problem. I wouldn't want to have to send in a newly purchased system.
</p>
<p>Gamestop says if I have an issue I can take it back. But why suffer through the issue again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't backup the HDD without logging into xbox live :/ <br />
So for now Im stuck in teh same issue as many other have.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Hi </span>Mohammed AlJasim<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We determined the issue and found out that your computer specs and graphics card are highly capable of enabling HDR and running a 4K video.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already tested this on <strong>Sony</strong> TV and its perfectly working fine<span>, we suggest that you
<strong>BenQ</strong>) directly for confirmation if this TV is really capable for
</span><span>streaming HDR videos in Netflix or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To know how to contact them, you can visit this link:

<p>
</p>
<p>
Netflix has a feature to auto-detect the capability monitors or TVs if they can stream HDR videos or not.</p>

<p>The BenQ monitor is HDR capable, since HDR is working fine when connected to a PS4 Pro or Xbox one x</p>
<p>The issue is when connected to the PC I can't seem to enable the stream HDR option. As you can see in the pictures below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>- I haven't Contacted BenQ yet.</p>
<p>- I only connect BenQ Monitor, The reason I connected the Sony TV was just to test if there was nothing wrong with the PC and if HDR worked fine. I connect only one TV-Monitor at a time.</p>
<p>- No I only purchased this BenQ monitor last week&nbsp; and it is my first 4k HDR PC Monitor, Aside from the Sony TV, Which is not connected to my PC</p>
<p>- Nothing changed recently in my pc.</p>
<p>- I tried uninstalling and installing, Nvidia drivers, also at first even 4K streaming was not working in Netflix until I figured I had to install HEVC Video Extensions from Microsoft app store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I am using Windows 10 built in Windows Defender.</p>

I Thought that might be the problem, but then this issue is only with windows PCs, since the monitor works fine with PS4 Pro, but there is no easy way to go around it to work on PC, only wait for a solution from Microsoft.<br />

<p>I'm on same boat. Similar configuration and same outcome with Benq EW3270U.</p>

            i have same issue all my consoles are fine, only my pc can't stream hdr video even due it has gtx 1080 ti. i contact benQ and there is no fix from BenQ. BenQ advised me to update firmware to latest 0.16 but was not enough to fix the issue and without a
 fix from Microsoft or new driver from BenQ this monitor is as good as dead.

<p>It looks like the latest version of CRU 1.4.1 (Custom Resolution Utility) supports editing HDR metadata blocks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thes steps should be something like this (I don't have an HDR monitor yet to test):</p>
<p>1. Download CRU 1.4.1 from&nbsp;https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU</p>
<p>2. Extract all and open CRU.exe</p>
<p>3. Select your monitor from the list at the top. If you already use CRU you might want to click Copy in case something goes wrong.</p>
<p>4. Click edit on extension blocks.</p>
<p>5. Under data blocks select HDR metadata and click edit. If it isn't there try other extension blocks in the previous screen.</p>
<p>6. Enter a new max luminance value. I suggest picking 300 or the maximum peak brightness measured by a reviewer.</p>
<p>7. Click OK a few times I think? Haven't actually used CRU before.... You might also want to hit export and upload the .bin for others.</p>

                    <p>I was not sure where to post this question, so I chose security since others have indicated it is Malware. System is Windows 10.&nbsp; I hear a sound like a camera snapping multiple pictures - it seems to only happen twice per day within minutes and usually after
 startup when I am typing into my browser? I read somewhere about a malware called Dagnabbit. I installed and ran Malwarebytes and Adaware and nothing was found.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Christina.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Disable the cam in your laptop on Driver tab in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, to test if the shutter sound goes away.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks. I'll try your suggestions.&nbsp; A couple of things in case they make a difference:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am on a desktop and I do not have a webcam. </p>
<p>- My system is a custom build so no factory installs.</p>
<p>-System was a Windows 7, but I upgraded to Windows 10 online.</p>
<p>- I connect via a wireless usb and it was randomly losing connectivity and causing my system to freeze, so I "reset" my PC and the shutter sound did not start until after the Reset.&nbsp; Using Event Viewer, I determined the wireless to be the problem because
 of the error timing and there were lots of DNS resolution errors. The only other errors at the time of the system freezing were Local Authorization errors.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling/reinstalling the device and did some troubleshooting on the adapter to no avail,
 so I reset.&nbsp; The system has frozen once since my reset of 2/28/18. I'll probably get a new wireless device although I don't think it is causing the shutter.</p>

<h2>            How to add SSD as boot disk on new Dell XPS 8700 with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span><strong>Goal</strong>: Add a Samsung EVO 500GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD and make it the boot disk for a new Dell 8700 running pre-installed Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Questions</strong>:
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do I have to change the BIOS from IRST to AHCI?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Can I transfer the OS from the original C: drive to the SSD via <a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">EasyUS Todo Backup</span></a>?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Do I need the Windows installation disks?</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Background</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Using a StarTEC USB 3.0 to 2.5 SATA III Hard Drive adapter cable, I connected the new SSD to the new Dell 8700 via USB. The Dell transfer tools, and Dell Navigator, did not recognize
 the SSD. I later read a post that said that these Dell tools did not yet work with Windows 10. As suggested in another post, I did get the transfer to work using EasyUS Todo. I copied Windows 10 to the SSD. I then installed it internally in one of the empty
 drive bays. Windows 10 file manager recognized the drive and I was able to see that Windows was indeed copied on it.</span></p>
<p><span>But, before I change the Boot Sequence to start with the SSD, I would like to know if the OS transfer will indeed work and\or whether the BIOs needs to be changed from IRST to
 AHCI (if yes, how).</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, Windows disks, usually orderable from PC manufacturers, are not yet available from Dell. Alternatively, the “create USB recovery disk” goes in an endless loop even though
 I am trying to create one using a new 32GB San Disk USB drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Any other things I need to do in order to make this SSD boot configuration to work?</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

<h2>            VIP status and reward points</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been a xbox live rewards member for quite some time. Recently I was checking the xbox live rewards site and noticed that my vip status has been at the same spot in the 2 tier for a long time. I have made quite a few purchases digitally through xbox live in the past year and I cant seem to tell if I'm get any of the reward/ % back or if my vip status is going up. When I look at the pending credits I only see points from surveys and one deposit from my vip star rank 2? am I missing points or have I just not qualified for any other points? Thank you for your time.</p><p><br /></p><p>-Joshua Mercuri</p>

    <title>Boot Manager Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mayank thapliyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot Manager Missing</h2>
                    I was installing Windows 7 Ultimate in my PC, I followed the procedure,(...........followed by "Press any Key," "Loading Files," Date Time &amp; Currency")&nbsp; then I used custom installation, and when it asked me to select a drive to install Windows, I firstly
 deleted 'C' the system Drive, and started to install Windows, but as soon as it started, my PC restarted and it showed me error message 'Boot manager missing.' My Problem is, I don't have system restore disc, neither I have any OS installed in my PC so that
 I can run a system repair.<br />
One more think that I want to mention, as I m installing W7 by a DVD, my DVD rom is SATA based, but my DVD cable is ATA, does that matters?? is it possible that I m facing this issue because of unsupported cable??<br />
I was afraid that if my Hard disc is OK or not, so I changed my Hard disc, and then again started installing W7 to the new Hard Drive, but again, the same problem appeared.<br />
<br />
please help me!! please!!<br />
<br />

            <p>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7:</p>
<p><br />
a) Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.</p>
<p><br />
If you do not have access to either disc: ISO download with SP1 included<br />
<a href="http://techdows.com/2011/07/download-windows-7-integrated-with-sp1-iso-official-direct-download-links.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techdows.com/2011/07/download-windows-7-integrated-with-sp1-iso-official-direct-download-links.html</a></p>
<p><br />
Create a Bootable Windows 7 DVD using the .ISO file<br />
Burning a Windows 7 ISO File on a DVD<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/977640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/977640</a></p>
<p><br />
b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.</p>
<p><br />
Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the display.
</p>
<p><br />
c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”
</p>
<p><br />
d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.
</p>
<p><br />
e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.
</p>
<p><br />
Note: On a Dual Boot system there may be only one operating system listed if you have removed one of the two versions of Windows 7. Click the ‘Next’ button.</p>
<p><br />
f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.</p>
<p><br />
g) At the DOS prompt type the following four commands:</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /ScanOs&nbsp; (Optional)<br />
The /ScanOs option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7.<br />
Additionally, this option displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store.
<br />
Use this option when there are Windows Vista or Windows 7 installations that the Boot Manager menu does not list.</p>
<p><br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd</p>
<p><br />
h) Close the command prompt window and click the ‘Startup Repair’ option. </p>
<p><br />
i) The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes at which point you will see two messages
</p>
<p><br />
“Windows cannot repair this computer automatically” and “Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically”.</p>
<p><br />
These messages are the result of the radical changes made by removing the other drive. Ignore the Send/Don’t send options.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please perform step j as detailed below, startup repair must be run multiple times (At least 3 times).</p>
<p><br />
J) Close this message window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the Send/Don’t send window. Next click on the ‘View advanced options for system recovery and support’ option and from the main menu once again click ‘Startup Repair’. This time the
 repair process may only that a few seconds and when prompted “Startup Repair could not detect a problem”, click ‘Finish’&nbsp; and run the ‘Startup Repair’ option one more time, click ‘Finish’, and then remove the System Repair DVD and click ‘Restart’.&nbsp; Reboot
 the computer.</p>

            Andre I tried the steps u provided me, but it was not useful for me, as when I followed step 9<br />
(Type Drive:\boot\Bootsect.exe /NT60 All, and then press ENTER.) the drive where the Windows 7 installation media was located, could not detected.<br />
I then tried once again, the normal procedure for boot. inserted the W7 bootable disc, restarted PC, filled the date, time, currency, keyboard setting.....then it asked me to select the where Windows has to be installed, I selected C drive, the installation
 begun, and while file expansion reached upto 15%, the DVD started rotating more faster, and ultimately the display goes off followed by system shut down. then sometimes, it restarts by it self and sometimes i have to cut the power and restart it and carry
 the whole installation procedure again resulting me the same issue..again and again.<br />
plz Help

            <p>Test your drive - Create a Bootable CD:<br />
Anywhere from 5 to 25%, (depending on the manufacture and model) of new hard drives are defective.<br />
Note: Hard drive reliability has gone way down in the last 18 months.</p>
<p><br />
Test your drive using the drive manufacture's utility. <br />
If you have a new Seagate hard drive the very next thing would be to download Seagate's Seatools<br />

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t my keyboard work under full screen MS DOS mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmb861240  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t my keyboard work under full screen MS DOS mode programs in Windows XP SP3&#63;</h2>
                    This is on a Windows XP Professional SP3 box.<br />
<br />
When starting any MS-DOS programs and setting them to fullscreen with Alt-Enter, you lose the ability to use the keyboard inside the application completely.&nbsp; You can still alt-enter or alt-tab out of it, but after that, there's still no keyboard functionality
 within the application.&nbsp; (IOW, you must terminate the application and restart it in a window only,)&nbsp; Of course, this renders software that uses graphical modes useless, as they switch to fullscreen by themselves and promptly kill the keyboard input.<br />
<br />
I've heard that using an older (sp2 or earlier) version of ntvdm.exe will solve this.&nbsp; Before I revert to an older virtual dos machine, is there any other way to restore keyboard functionality in a fullscreen MS-DOS app in XP SP3?<br />

<h2>            Installing a HP Laserjet 1100 onto Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>Judging by previous problems on the forum, I am not the only one that seems to be experiencing problems with installing an HP laserjet 1100 to Windows 7. The HP website
 reassures me that the driver is/can be found in Windows.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have found laserjet 1100 (MS) which I presume is the same thing.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have spent the last two days trying many different ways to install this onto a local printer.<span>&nbsp;</span>After following the "add printer” a relatively straightforward
 process, when I press “print”, nothing happens – it just hangs in the print queue.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I may have exacerbated the problem by ‘reinstalling’ the driver at least 5 times.<span>&nbsp;</span>Each time it comes up with
 a new copy e.g. to laserjet 1100 (Copy 1) laserjet 1100 (Copy ).<span>&nbsp;</span>Although I delete them when I restart the computer they reappear and I can’t find their location under properties or in the control panel.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is there
 a basic step by step guide to load this?<span>&nbsp; </span>I am desperate and frustrated.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can someone help with basic language?</span></span></p>

    <title>Desktop icons disappear after sleep mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop icons disappear after sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>Every time I wake my computer from sleep mode all desktop icons are gone except the Recycle Bin. If I double click the Recycle Bin I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>F:\Desktop is unavailable. If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network or Internet, and then try again.
 If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I shut down my computer and then start it again, all desktop icons are back but arranged in alphabetical order on the left side of my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides that, every time I 'Restart' my computer it won't turn on afterwards, a red light keeps burning on my motherboard. I have to hold the Power button of my computer until it shuts down and then press it again to start my computer again. Restarting my
 computer only works when a program asks for it after driver updates, but when it restarts and comes back to Windows I don't have an Internet connection anymore. The troubleshoot says it can't find any drivers. When I&nbsp;shut down my computer and then start it
 again everything seems fine again, but it is very annoying to do all of that every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I haven't found any solutions for these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The issue about the computer not restarting when I press Restart and lighting up a red LED on the motherboard, I'm currently having contact with the motherboard manufacturer ASUS, but since the problems might be related I thought it was good to point that
 out too.)</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer?</li><li>Have you checked if you have any pending updates with Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, below are some methods that you can use to possibly resolve your issue:</p>
<p>

link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. Open "C:\users\[your user account]" folder. If you see two Desktop folders with one blank and the other with your Desktop items you need to delete the blank one.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. Copy the desktop folder with your desktop items from “C:\Users\[your user account]\” folder to “C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\”.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>I've checked if I had any pending updates and there was one remaining. I just updated Windows and clicked 'Update and shut down', rebooted my computer and put it in sleep mode for a while, woke it up and everything seems fine for now. I hope it stays like
 that, but I'll let you know at the end of the week if everything is still fine unless the same issue appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But do you have any idea about my computer not restarting and why it only works (sort of, without having an Internet connection afterwards) when I give a program permission to restart my computer?</p>

<p>I had the problem of not having any desktop icon again.<br />
<br />
I already ran the System File Checker but it didn't find any "integrity violations". So I looked at your second method and I found that I have two Desktop folders:<br />
<br />
<em>Local Disk (C:) &gt; Users &gt; [User] &gt; Desktop</em><br />
This is an empty map.<br />
<br />
<em>Local Disk (F:) &gt; Desktop</em><br />
This is the location I have all the Desktop Icons.<br />

</p><p>I deleted the empty folder and copied the correct folder to:</p>
<p><em>Local Disk (C:) &gt; Windows &gt; System32 &gt; config &gt; systemprofile</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I shut down and rebooted my computer again (since I'm still not able to restart my computer). So far I didn't notice anything different and I also don't know if the problem has been solved since it only happens sometimes after sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(By the way, I did all of this after I 'restarted' (sort of *sigh*) my computer when the bug appeared, so I didn't check the Desktop folders at the time the bug appeared because Documents and File Explorer didn't work because they could't find the file location
 of the Documents folder)</p>

            Do a clean install. You'll need to reinstall Windows eventually if your motherboard is found to be defective and you have to replace it. Back up all you data and files first.

    <title>Unlocking Bitlocker encrypted system drive without recovery key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tintomatoes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlocking Bitlocker encrypted system drive without recovery key</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago I encrypted the whole hard drive on my Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd Gen notebook. There are no partitions. I did not save the recovery key externally, if at all I saved it then it is on the encrypted drive itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today my notebook crashed (whilst updating iTunes) and during restart I see the error message that Windows has a startup problem. It goes through the auto-repair procedure, which fails, and I'm taken to a screen which asks for my Bitlocker recovery key.
 I don't have that so I try the various advanced options like system repair, but none of the options that do not wipe my data seem to work because they need access to the encrypted drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there any way to unlock the drive, given that I know my Bitlocker password but not my Bitlocker recovery key? I am not able to actually get to any screen which asks for the password, every screen is asking for the recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the command prompt option and entered 'manage-bde -unlock c: -password' which prompts for the password. I enter the password but get the response 'The password you entered failed to unlock the drive'. I'm sure it's the right password. Next I try
 to view the recovery key with 'manage-bde -protectors -get c: -type recoverykey' but the resulting data shows the key ID but not the actual numeric key value (it's just blank).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Can anything be done to unlock the drive via the command prompt, or any other route such as a boot disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is it possible to generate the numeric recovery key elsewhere if the key ID and the password are known?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If I remove the hard drive from this laptop and attach it to another computer as a slave drive, is it possible to unlock it there using the Bitlocker password?</p>

            <p>1. No. &nbsp;Otherwise, what is the point of the encryption?<br />
(You recorded the encryption recovery password/key - I thought you said you didn't...? &nbsp;It is not asking for your user password - it hasn't gotten that far.)</p>
<p>2. No. &nbsp;Otherwise, what is the point of the encryption?</p>
<p>3. Maybe. But.... &nbsp;The stuff you tried already would have worked too with the right information.</p>
<p>4. Maybe. &nbsp;But... &nbsp;The stuff you tried already would have worked too with the right information.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Was this from a Upgrade to Windows 8 or did you wipe out the old OS and do a full<br />
installation?&nbsp;Are there any error messages? <br />
<br />
Check the Compatibility Center to see if the drive is compatible :<br />
<br />
Windows Compatibility Center<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US</a><br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation and driver/firmware,<br />
and ask in their forums (if any) about any known issues. If the drive, or computer is not
<br />
Windows 8 compatible there is not anything you can do without hardware replacements.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
If needed check this&nbsp;-<br />
<br />
From the Desktop either use WINKEY + X - Run - type in RegEdit&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
OR&nbsp; put the cursor in the lower left corner of the Desktop - Right Click - Run - type in
<br />
RegEdit.<br />
<br />
Click on the plus signs (+) next to the following folders <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class<br />
\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right Click on the key in the Left Pane - Export it so you can reverse in case of a mistake.</p>
<p>Save as Remove-Filters.reg&nbsp; (any name is ok with .reg as extension).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>In the Right Pane look for any of these = UpperFilters&nbsp;- LowerFilters&nbsp;- UpperFilters.bak
<br />
- LowerFilters.bak&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If any exist Right Click on them - Delete <br />
(There may not be any of those and if not this is not the fix.)</p>
<p><br />
Close&nbsp;RegEdit<br />
<br />
Reboot <br />
<br />
If you do not need the .reg file you saved then you can delete it.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the&nbsp;System Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation, &nbsp;and drivers.&nbsp;Check
<br />
for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers. <br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
From the DeskTop&nbsp;- WINKEY + D while on the Start Screen to access the DeskTop :<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X&nbsp; OR&nbsp; place the mouse in the lower left corner and Right Click - Command Prompt (ADMIN)<br />
<br />
Enter the below (or COPY and PASTE ) :<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>REBOOT&nbsp;<br />
(from AtishayMSFT)<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Use this - and you may need to use it again after trying the methods below.<br />
<br />
What if a device isn't installed properly? (Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a><br />
<br />
=====================================================<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.</p>
<p>From the DeskTop - WinKey + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
(space between C and / )<br />
<br />
Then run run CheckDisk&nbsp; - chkdsk&nbsp;/r&nbsp; (the /r includes /f parameter checks)<br />
<br />
WinKey + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r <br />
(space between k and / )<br />
<br />
Or run CheckDisk from within Windows 8 :<br />

<br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
WinKey + X - Control Panel<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's<br />
Tab - click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive -
<br />
UNINSTALL - REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack<br />

    <title>Corel Painter Essentials 4.0 Has trouble loading - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corel Painter Essentials 4.0 Has trouble loading</h2>
                    I just bought a new computer with Windows 7 and was installing the Corel Painter Essentials 4.0 into it and the installation went fine. Then when I go to open it, it goes to the open window and then just stays like that, I let it sit like that for over
 10 minutes hoping it would load and then when I finally just clicked my mouse, it was "not responding" and I had to shut it down.<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it again and it still never worked. I didn't find it on the compatibility list yet, but still wanted to find-out if it will be, or what else I can do.

<p>Hello leh1,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
In addition to what Bindu has stated, Corel Painter Essentiasl 4.0 system requirements state it will run on Vista and Windows XP. I would try by using the
<br />
Program Compatibility Wizard or you can try the XP mode using&nbsp;Virtual PC.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to</span><span>allow the port / ip through the firewall and check if it get
 resolved your issue. To do so, follow below link:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If you don't know about port /ip and you are in a secure environment, you can disable firewall.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Problemi con dlc Ufc undisputed 3</h2>
                    

<p>buonasera a tutti!</p>
<p>ho acquistato Ufc undisputed 3 ieri, convinto ci fosse Alessio Sakara! Ma ahimè ho letto che devo acquistare i dlc etc ma non só come fare.</p>
<p>ho un abbonamento di 1 settimana ad Xbox live, ma quando entro nel marketplace del gioco o nel pass stagione, mi appare soltanto la descrizione del gioco sulla destra!</p>
<p>come devo fare, vi prego di aiutarmi in qualche modo grazie!</p>

<p>Non ho il gioco e posso solo andare per tentativi.</p>
<p>In teoria dentro il menu del gioco dovrebbe esserci una voce relativa all'espansione, oppure dentro il marketplace dovresti vedere sia il gioco completo sia tutte le espansioni disponibili.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Il gold (abbonamento al live) non è necessario per queste cose.</p>

    <title>How can I change a radio station display name in WMP&#63; EDIT&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radical924  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change a radio station display name in WMP&#63; EDIT&#58; How can I fix my .m3u file&#63;</h2>
                    Hi I have a bunch of radio station .m3u files on my computer and I created a playlist in WMP labeled "Radio Stations". The problem is the display names or "Title" of the Radio Stations appear in an odd hardly recognizable format which isn't easy to understand.
 Is there a way I can "Edit" these names that appear???<br />
<br />
Here is a picture of my problem: <b><a href="http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/ae122/Radical924/Web%20Posts%20-%20Not%20Halo%20Maps/RadioStationPic.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PICTURE#1</a></b><br />

            Yes I am talking about changing the radio stations name. I found a <i>semi-solution</i> to this problem.... the only issue now is I can't actually play the file from Windows Media Player I have to double click it in windows explorer. I also cannot properly
 convert the file to a .wpl file because I modified the display names so they match the radio station name not the radio stations callsign.<br />
<br />
Here is my .m3u file I created containing all the necessary changes to fix the display issue:
<b><a href="http://pastebin.com/TFvt9u8W" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FILE#1</a></b><br />
As you can see the proper radio station names are displayed now... : <a href="http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/ae122/Radical924/RadioStationPlaylistwithnecessarym3ufilechanges.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>PICTURE#2</b></a><br />
<b><br />
Can you please help me fix this file so it works properly in WMP converted to a .wpl file?</b><br />
<br />
<b>Thanks</b>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If your computer is having problems accessing your collection of digital media files in the
<span>Windows</span> Media Player Library, try using the
<span>Windows</span> Media Player Library troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter makes sure
<span>Windows</span> Media Player is correctly installed on your computer, and checks to see whether your Player Library is corrupted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-library-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-windows-media-player-library-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebuild Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
a. <strong>Exit</strong> Windows Media Player.<br />
b. Click<strong> Start</strong>, type <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong>, and then click<strong>OK.<br />
</strong>c. <strong>Select</strong> all the files in the<strong> folder</strong>, and then click<strong>Delete</strong> on the
<strong>File </strong>menu.<br />
</p>
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.<br />
<div>c. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
<div>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<div>a. <strong>Exit</strong> Windows Media Player. <br />
b. Click <strong>Start,</strong> type %<strong>LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong>, and then click<strong>OK.<br />
</strong>c. Select the <strong>Media Player folder</strong>, and then click<strong> Delete</strong>on the
<strong>File </strong>menu.<br />
d. <strong>Restart </strong>Windows Media Player.<br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
<div>Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>
