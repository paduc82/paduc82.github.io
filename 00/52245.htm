<h2>            Why Are People So Quick TO Hate Activison&#47;Treyarch&#47;Infinity Ward&#47;Call of Duty Yet...</h2>
                    
<p>No one rages at Valve for using the same god damn engine for years and years, even though Valve is making just as much money releasing games after games after games with it. They have released 70+ games with the Sorce engine, with no notable changes to it.
 It's also funny because the majority of games Valve releases with Source are just terrible copy past of Counter Strike. Valve seriously releases Source games (bad ones too) every year, Sometimes two a year.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>How about Capcom ACTUALLY DOES release the same game every damn year. Street Fighter 4, How about Super Street Fighter 4! How about Streety Fighter 4 Third Strike! Resident Evil 5? How about Resident Evil 5 Gold? Dead Rising 2! How about Dead Rising 2 Off
 the Record! They actually do what people accuse Call of Duty of.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Call of Duty is being Milked? What about Bungie/343/M$/Halo?<br />
<br />
2001: Halo 1</p>
<p>2004: Halo 2</p>
<p>2007: Halo 3</p>
<p>2008: Cancelled Halo MMO. Cancelled Halo Movie</p>
<p>2009: Halo Wars/Halo 3:ODST</p>
<p>2010: Halo Reach</p>
<p>2011: Halo 1 Combat Evolved Aniversary</p>
<p>2012: Halo 4</p>
<p>TBA: Halo 5/6?</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>Call of Duty doesn't have books being sold about it. Or Movie attempts. Halo is more milked than Call of Duty!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>How about Battlefield? Battlefield has had 11? games in it's 10 year life span. Plus 7+ Expansion packs. Call of Duty has had 8 games in it's 8 year Lifespan.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>So... Why is it cool to hate On Call of Duty, but no one else? Because it's popular?</p>

<p>I don't hate CoD, I actually bought MW, WaW, MW2, BO and just expected more from the last two titles and this just looks like a copy paste of MW2 with a few things added/removed and changed to make it new and fresh but I am just not sold.</p>

<p>so instead aim it at valve, the source engine is the most stable and greatest most flexible engines in existence, in which all the most famous pc games released to date have been using such as counter strike TF2 portal and the most widely known and successful
 ahlf life series, it doesnt need canging because its at a state of perfection. infact your a bit of a *** to turn an argument at it quite frankly put</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I don't think it's the annual update of the game most people have a problem with. &nbsp;It's the fact they seem to disregard any previous incarnation of that game when the new version comes out. &nbsp;They'll support a game while they can
 sell new map packs for it, but once they release the new game, the last one is forgotten.<br />

<p>I hate Madden/EA for it's endless 60$ yearly Roster updates. Not to mention every other annual sports game. COD is now being lumped with them. Capcom gets a pass from me for multiple versions, cause Capcom's awesome and I just upgrade to the last version

<p>I dont know what your smoking, but VALVe certainly have NOT released 70+ source games. VALVe DO allow other developers to use the source engine, but it's not there own games. and there have been MANY noticeable changes to the source engine - its being constantly
 expanded upon. Compare Counter Strike: Source (which Source originally started with) to say Team Fortress 2 and the differences are huge. Also the last VALVe game released was earlier this year, Portal 2 - and the closest before that was Alien Swarm the year
 before ( a top down classic style game). So where you come of saying they release the same games each year I dont know. The "copy paste" part made me lol too.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder where you have been; Capcom get a lot of bad press for there constant rehashes<br />
<br />
Yes indeed CoD is milked - as is Halo<br />

<br />
That's 22 games in a 8 year life span bud. Sledgehammer games are also making there own CoD, which has been put on hold at the moment - then there's the Ghost spin-off in the making too. And yes the DS version do count too, as they have different storylines
 compared to the console versions.<br />
<br />
CoD has had comic books, card games and action figures in the past too.<br />
<br />
Battlefield too has had a lot of games released, but they get less flak as they change them dramatically each time. 1942, 2142, Modern Combat, Battlefield 3, Battlefield Hereos, Vietnam etc - they are all different in many aspects. CoD, however, is only WW2
 (which has been abandoned by the looks of it) and Modern Day setting (apart from blops). If you didn't play CoD it would be hard to tell Modern Warfare 1, 2 and 3 apart.<br />

 a company as large and prestigeous as MS.....Just when you get to your next move to discontinue, you are threatened that now all your other MS programs will also ‚Äúbe affected.‚Äù &nbsp; &nbsp; How can this be ? &nbsp; I also pay for those as well..... &nbsp; HA...I let the credit

<h2>            Photos Missing from Gallery</h2>
                    Last week, my Skype conversation had over 800 photos in the gallery. Yesterday, my phone broke and I lost everything on it. I signed into Skype on my computer to re-download photos, but now my gallery is empty. When I scroll up through the conversation
 to manually download photos I've sent and received, I can only go back a few weeks before Skype crashes on my Mac. I am using Skype version 8.12.0.2 on a MacBook Pro. Is there any way I can recover photos from the last 2 months?

</p><p>If you still cannot see the photos using the classic version, it's possible that the Skype folder where your conversations are stored has been corrupted. Unfortunately, we do not have an option to recover those for you. All conversations are stored on your
 local hard drive depending on your history settings and if the file folder where your conversations are stored got deleted or corrupted, the files saved will be lost permanently.</p>

    <title>Are &#39;Sample Music&#39; songs in Windows 7 - Ok for commercial - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mguest1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are &#39;Sample Music&#39; songs in Windows 7 - Ok for commercial usage&#63; &#40;Kalimba, Maid..., Sleep Away&#41;</h2>
                    Hello! I've searched the whole web for an answer to this, so now I'm trying this forum&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
On the Windows 7 computer I bought in January 2013, the 'Sample Music' folder contains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Kalimba<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Maid with the Flaxen Hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Sleep Away<br />
<br />
Under properties info, I'm not sure how to interpret this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Copyright&nbsp; (blank)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Protected&nbsp; 'No'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Owner&nbsp; 'SYSTEM'<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if the computer purchaser can utilize these songs as the soundtrack in commercial usage?<br />
Also, is it ok to edit them in any way?<br />
Finally, what, if any, attribution is required?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information<br />

            <p>Hello Vinod N</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the prompt reply. I did notice a couple of other threads where it's stated that the Sample Music songs are "Public Domain," but it did not address "Commercial Usage" specifically.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>The pure definition of "Public Domain" (for example: at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain#Definition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Wikipedia</a>) defines exactly and without any doubts, that if something is in public domain, it can be used on any possible way, including commercial use without need to cite original author.</div>

</p><blockquote>Hello! I've searched the whole web for an answer to this, so now I'm trying this forum&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
On the Windows 7 computer I bought in January 2013, the 'Sample Music' folder contains:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Kalimba<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Maid with the Flaxen Hair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Sleep Away<br />
<br />
Under properties info, I'm not sure how to interpret this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Copyright&nbsp; (blank)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Protected&nbsp; 'No'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Owner&nbsp; 'SYSTEM'<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me if the computer purchaser can utilize these songs as the soundtrack in commercial usage?<br />
Also, is it ok to edit them in any way?<br />
Finally, what, if any, attribution is required?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any information<br />

            Thanks for your suggestions, but I have done all that. &nbsp;This is an OEM Key, it was OEM sticker. &nbsp;The computer was orginally installed with Windows XP Media and has a thing on there that says it is Vista Compatable. &nbsp;Then Windows 7 Home Edition was installed.
 &nbsp;This computer was given to a friend by his son. &nbsp;It belonged to him, but since then the son has moved to FL and we are in KY. &nbsp;The drive died. &nbsp;I am replacing the drive and I tried using a 32 bit ISO of 7 Home Prem. &nbsp;It would not take the key. &nbsp;So I tried
 an OEM version, it would not take the key. &nbsp;I even tried to do it over the phone and it would not accept it, and even talked to MS about it and they could not figure out what is going on. &nbsp;They said it was technical issue. &nbsp;Which I do not get. &nbsp;I have done
 this many times, and I am not a novice but I have talked to other IT friends of mine and they are stumped as well. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 Pro that I was going to just sell

<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files, applications and settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Which features will be removed when I upgrade from a previous version of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>

<p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won‚Äôt be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

    <title>Online meeting error when attempting to create a meeting in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mph35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online meeting error when attempting to create a meeting in Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>When attempting to create a Skype 2016&nbsp;meeting within Outlook 2010 \Windows 7&nbsp;some (but not all) users&nbsp;receive the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>'Create Skype Meeting failed. Please make sure that Skype for Business is running and signed-in and try'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some Lync 2010 users also receive a similar error message</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>'Create online meeting failed. Please make sure that Lync is running and signed-in and try again.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users with this error also cannot add additional participants to ongoing IM's or Skype for Business\Lync calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue does not follow the user to other machines (which have the same software versions) and the issue does not affect&nbsp;all users who log on to the same machine e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User 1 has the error on machine 1 though not on machine 2</p>
<p>User 2 does not have the error on machine 1</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've read through the suggested fixes on this site though have not identified a fix yet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As it appears to me that 'something' is preventing the Outlook and Skype for Business\Lync client from communicating with each other, as Outlook cannot establish that Skype for Business or Lync is running, p</span><span>lease can somebody describe
 to me how the Outlook add-in &nbsp;'Skype Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office' or 'Online Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Lync 2010' communicates with Skype for Business or Lync 2010?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is this a local 'connection' between the Outlook client and Skype for Business\Lync 2010 clients or a call from the Outlook client to the Skype for Business server over EWS or MAPI?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your effort to work on this. However, in order to help you further, please reply with the following
 details:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the error message you receive when you try to update Instagram?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Does this issue occur with any other application?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer the following troubleshooting steps mentioned below and see if that helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Resetting Store</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since you are unable to update Instagram, you can try resetting the Store application and see if that helps.

            <p>The following does not address the problems with Edge which is a stable Browser and could be excellent.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues still needing to be addressed and the answer below does not address any of them - it might as well have been written by the PR Legal team (probably was)= as they are unlikely to have a clue about how things on the web work)</p>
<p>One other issue is that there is an option to "Pin" your favourites permanently to the home page as a side bar - YOU WISH - it reloads just as it was before.</p>
<p>Try contacting someone on your <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Facebook profile page &nbsp;by Video/phone - you will be advised that "the Video option is not available of this Browser" - it also advises you uses Chrome or Mozilla - WHY HAVE A FACEBOOK

    <title>Making space on C&#58; drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e a smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making space on C&#58; drive</h2>
                    My computer, which runs Windows XP SP3 is some seven and a half years old. &nbsp; The hard disk is partitioned and the C: drive occupies some 16.5 GB.<br />
It has become rather full, and I have had to resort to compression of the files, which is not good for performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I assume much of this to be junk,&nbsp; I have started considering what I can delete.<br />
One area which has caught my eye is a folder called C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; That do Machine Keys Do ?<br />
2.&nbsp; Where do they come from ?<br />
3.&nbsp; Do I really need 12,338 of them, occupyin some 48.1 MB ?<br />
4.&nbsp; Can I safely delete them ?<br />
<br />
I should be very grateful for any advice offered.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tony Smith.<br />

            16.5 GB is far too small a partition for any but the most bare bones Windows XP systems.<br />
<br />
The folder you are concerned about appears to be primarily related to servers, including Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) on Windows XP.&nbsp; If by some chance you have IIS installed but don't need it, you can uninstall it by following the directions
 at "Remove IIS 5.1 or IIS 6.0" in this article --&gt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325889/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325889/en-us</a><br />
<br />
After that, you can delete the files ... although from what I've read, you may have a permissions issue in attempting to do so.<br />
<br />
However, consider that 48.5 MB is only about 0.3% pf your 16.5 GB partition, so even if you deleted all of those files, it really won't do very much for you.&nbsp; I've copied below my standard answer for "low disk space" problems, but you really need to have a
 larger system partition.&nbsp; If you have a significant amount of free space on the drive (in another partition), you can use a third-party tool to expand the C: partition (native Windows tools cannot do this).&nbsp; If the rest of your drive is equally filled, you
 should buy a larger hard drive, clone your existing drive to the new drive, and then expand the C: partition on the new drive.
<br />
<br />
<b>More Disk Space</b><br />
<br />
There are a number of things you can do to -- temporarily -- free up disk space.&nbsp; The only real solution, however, is to get a larger internal hard drive (or a second internal drive). A desktop or tower probably will be able to accommodate a second internal
 drive.&nbsp; A laptop or ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù (computer built into the monitor) probably will not.<br />
<br />
You can move data to an external drive, but if it is data that you use frequently, the slower access times may annoy you.&nbsp; Therefore, I don't recommend that you
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">move your My Documents folder</a> in its entirety to an external drive, although you certainly could do that by following the linked instructions.&nbsp; Moving My Documents to a second internal drive
 is OK.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr &gt; OK) [See NOTE below]</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can reduce the size allocated to System Restore to about 1 GB (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; System Restore &gt;Settings)</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can turn off Hibernation (if you don't use it) (right-click empty spot on desktop &gt; Properties &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate)</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can disable Disk Indexing, which will also speed up your computer a bit (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp</a>)</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can reduce the size of your Internet browser cache (varies depending on which browser you use)</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can remove most of the $NTUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders following the directions here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/Hotfix_backup.htm</a>&nbsp; (read the caveats in the grey box first)</li></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also see: <br />

<li><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to reclaim disk space on Windows XP and Windows Server 2008-based computers?</a></li><li><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc750370.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Forty Ways To Free Up Disk Space</a></li></ul>
<b>NOTE</b>:&nbsp; By default the Disk Cleanup utility does not delete files accessed in the last seven days.&nbsp; You can either go directly to the Temp directory (Start &gt; Run &gt; %temp% &gt; OK), and select all of the files and delete them (except one or two that will
 be ‚Äúin use‚Äù) or alter the LastAccess value in the registry, to configure the Disk Cleanup utility to delete all the files in the Temp folder regardless of the last accessed date. Here's how (it would be prudent to backup your registry or at least create a
 Restore Point first):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Regedit (Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; OK)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Temporary Files<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate and double-click the LastAccess value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you see the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, change the Value Data setting from 7 to 0 and click OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart Windows.<br />
<br />
But none of the above will really gain you significant amounts of space for very long.&nbsp; The only long term solution is a bigger hard drive.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, download and run <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
JDiskReport</a>, which will graphically show you what files are taking up the most space and thus suggest what files you should move to another drive.&nbsp; An alternate utility (also free) is
<a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TreeSize Free</a>.
<br />
<br />
If you want to move an application to another drive (either external or internal), you'll have to uninstall it and then reinstall it specifying the other drive as the install location.&nbsp; You can't simply move the files.&nbsp; Even so, many applications will place
 some files on the system drive (i.e., the drive where Windows is located).<br />

            It's identified in Properties as Microsoft Photo Editor.Ink, which suddenly appeared after the April W10 upgrade. I can't get rid of the thing. Can't delete it the task bar or even locate the program in&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu (as identified
 in Properties from the task bar).&nbsp; Maddening!
