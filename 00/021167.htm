<h2>            Office 2013 OneNote Audio Recording Issues &#40;Silent Playback&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with the full Office 2013 suite on it.&nbsp; I have been using OneNote to record lectures and conversations that are important so I can reference them later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have discovered that some of my recorded lectures/conversations do not play any sound when I attempt to playback.&nbsp; The recordings are the length I would expect them to be and when I hit play, the system displays where I am currently at in the
 file (the play tracker?).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached is a picture of my audio settings.&nbsp; I do often keep my volume at 0 though I don't know if that would effect anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; Thoughts on preventing future issues AND possibly how to recover muted/silent recordings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

<p>I have also been experiencing no-sound after playback when using the OneNote 2013 on my Surface pro3. I just used the built in sound recorder as a test, and there is no sound when I played back my recording.</p>

            <p>I am experiencing an issue with the playback also.&nbsp; I performed a quick test before starting my recording, and the playback was fine.&nbsp; Then my "real" recording would not play back.&nbsp; Researching, I have found that I can play back the recording without a problem
 before closing the One Note application.&nbsp; However, once the app has been closed, when later opened, it will no longer replay.&nbsp; It almost seems the closing action of One note corrupts the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to restore the volume of a recording once One Note (my version is 2013) has been closed?</p>

            <p>I have this same problem with OneNote 2013 (and I had it before with ON 2010). I'm using an ASUS laptop with Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a brief test, which recorded fine, then recorded an interview that lasted over an hour. The ribbon showed that ON was recording. When it was over I clicked Stop but did not close the program. It was open for quite a long time. Then during 'playback'
 there was no sound, although the 'jump 10 min ahead' button seemed to work. Even odder, I right-clicked the recording file icon and used the context menu to find the file. The context manual listed the file under the correct name with its path. But when I
 went to the folder and opened it, there was no file there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in another forum (or maybe it was this one) that ON can't handle long recordings. If that is the problem, it means this feature, an extremely valuable one for me since it syncs notes with voice recording, is actually quite worthless since it can't
 be relied on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What about it, Microsoft? This problem has lasted through two versions of the program. What am I paying for?</p>

            <p>I strongly suspect that the problem on my Surface Book lies with the screen timeout and a solution may be to avoid screen timeout during OneNote recording</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd noticed that my Surface Book stops playing audio from YouTube when the screen times out and restarts it when the screen redisplays - because I had timeout set to 5 mins to help save battery. I'd seen other posts that say this arises because of some way
 the audio is configured internally. So I wondered if the screen timeout takes out recording as well as playback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, I set my screen timeout to 1 minute, started OneNote audio with some continuous noise to record, typed some text. then left the Surface Book alone for a minute which allowed the screen to timeout, left it that way for a minute, and then moved the
 mouse to redisplay the screen, typed some more into OneNote for a minute, and then stopped the recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the embedded audio, I could hear the intended sound while I was initially typing and for roughly a minute afterward. Then the audio playback was silent even though I kept my screen on during playback, and the silence lasted as long as my screen had timed
 out during the recording phase, after which the audio resumed and showed the sound synchronised with my last phase of typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second similar test generated the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were recording while drawing or typing, I'm guessing I'd lose no audio because the activity will keep the screen, the soundcard, and its recording alive. But I've recorded some past audio sessions when the screen has been timed out throughout and I
 suspect that accounts for some of my completely silent OneNote recordings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I'll assume that I must set my Power settings never to time the screen out before a OneNote recording (or maybe any other recording for that matter). I wish I could put a shortcut to the equivalent Windows power setting in my OneNote Quick Access
 bar or even on my Windows taskbar but the best I can currently find is to put a shortcut to all the Power settings on the taskbar and then navigating the screen timeout settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also guessing that I'll sometimes forget to change the power settings. But maybe I'll create a OneNote template for use with OneNote recordings and I could put a reminder to change the power settings at the top of the template.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall that the posts that I saw about audio <em>playback </em>stoppages suggested a solution but I'll check. Even if there's no solution for the internal soundcard, I wonder if an external soundcard would stay alive during a screen timeout. I don't
 have one to try at present but I'll see if I can find one and will report back if I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if anyone finds that my deductions are wrong, it'd be interested to hear that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this helps a bit at least.</p>

            <p>The voices in my head wonder whether the .onecache file that catches all local edits is not syncing to the .one file. &nbsp;(I'm not expert at this.) &nbsp;Are you saving your OneNote notebook to an external drive or a cloud drive? &nbsp;Perhaps there is a sync problem
 between these two files. &nbsp;Just a hunch.</p>

            Yes. Since I was continually using a laptop--and typing while recording--there was no screen timeout. Seems like for a computer at least, the issue is that ON can't handle a long recording length. There is free software that records audio and time stamps
 notes, so I think that is the solution. ON is not a very good program anyway; it seems to be made of odds and ends that MS threw together and is not well thought out functionally. &nbsp;There are lots of other, better notebook-organizing programs, so I've stopped
 using ON.&nbsp;

</p><p>Farhan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are seeing this same issue although only with Excel spreadsheets. &nbsp;They open as read-only in Excel 2016. &nbsp;When you click Edit Workbook I get the same error as above, but for me closing excel and trying again does not work. I'm unable to edit any Excel
 documents at all unless I uncheck Use Office 2016 to sync Office files I open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what impact that has because I don't get an indication that anyone else has the file open whether that box is checked or not, which makes for bad collaboration either way...unless I'm missing something</p>

    <title>Pulling information from multiple worksheets into one is not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhogan55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pulling information from multiple worksheets into one is not working for me. </h2>
                    I have 5 different worksheets and I have dates in each row for each worksheet. I am trying to create another worksheet that will basically pull the information from the 5 worksheets and put them in order based on the dates. I have tried the vlookup function
 but this does not return anything other than 0. Is this even something I can accomplish with the vlookup function? Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.

<p>Hi......</p>
<p>Unless each individual sheet is over 12,000 rows, then you could just append them all into one big worksheet by copy and paste.......then you could just sort that one big worksheet........</p>
<p>Usually it's better to have your data all on one sheet anyway, for lots of good reasons.</p>

            Yeah, I know it's new. I'm not an idiot. Although you seem to assume we all are. I don't care to "look around a bit". Please tell me how to forward all of my incoming e-mails automatically to another account or please tell me how to delete my account.
 I am done with Microsoft, you offer terrible support and are quite frankly rude.

    <title>Error Using .Find&#40;&#41; in Excel 2010 VBA - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error Using .Find&#40;&#41; in Excel 2010 VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hello All - Help is appreciated:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd like to do is pretty simple. If a string of text is found in a target workbook, I want to return True, otherwise return false.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I get an Object variable not set whenever the string is not found in the target workbook. I've seen many similar posts, but most have suggested incorporating the check for Is Nothing that I already have below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My code is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function getDeltaStatus(moduleName As String, thisWb As Workbook, deltaBook As Workbook) As Boolean</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getDeltaStatus = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sheet As String: sheet = getSetting("Project", thisWb, "Settings")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If the module was found, return TRUE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = deltaBook.Sheets(sheet).Columns("A").Find(What:=moduleName, LookIn:=xlValues)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not rngFound Is Nothing Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getDeltaStatus = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</p>

            <p>I don't see anything glaringly wrong with the code.&nbsp; Exactly which line in the code is identified when the error is thrown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only make a couple of recommendations at this point:</p>
<p>First - put a breakpoint at the&nbsp; <strong>Set rngFound =</strong> statement and double check that everything is set up to actually work properly.&nbsp; i.e., that the variables passed to the function are valid and correct and that variable sheet contains what
 you expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it all still looks good then perhaps inserting a new module and moving the code into it might get it to work if there is something corrupted in the current code module it is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code actually works for me, both when the moduleName is found and when it is not in a quick test scenario I set up.&nbsp; Here's the code I used to test with, you'll notice that I used ThisWorkbook as both workbooks, and I changed your function to set variable
 sheet = "Sheet1" in the workbook.&nbsp; I tested with "jlatham" in a cell in column A on the sheet and got the anticipated "True" response, then I cleared that out and got the anticipated "False" -- no errors in either case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub testIt()<br />
&nbsp; Dim myResult As Boolean<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; myResult = getDeltaStatus("jlatham", <strong>ThisWorkbook</strong>, <strong>ThisWorkbook</strong>)<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox myResult<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function getDeltaStatus(moduleName As String, thisWb As Workbook, deltaBook As Workbook) As Boolean</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; getDeltaStatus = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sheet As String: <em>'sheet = GetSetting("Project", thisWb, "Settings")</em><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sheet = "Sheet1"</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'If the module was found, return TRUE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngFound As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngFound = deltaBook.Sheets(sheet).Columns("A").Find(What:=moduleName, LookIn:=xlValues)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not rngFound Is Nothing Then<br />

    <title>ActiveSync upgrade problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> co1umn  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync upgrade problem</h2>
                    <br />
After installing ActiveSync 4.2 (which) came with my phone, I discovered that I could upgrade to 4.5 and then upgrade Windows mobile 5 to 6 (which I haven't done yet). My dilemma is that&nbsp; I didn't delete my mobile phone from version 4.2 before upgrading to
 4.5.&nbsp; When I tried to connect again, ActiveSync will only synchronize my computer with my HTC P4000 as the second computer.&nbsp; This means I can synchronize most things, but can't synchronize my e-mail.&nbsp; How do I clear this up?<br />

    <title>printing merge labels onto a Avery 4013 continuous feed label will not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathleensn  say:</h3>
<h2>            printing merge labels onto a Avery 4013 continuous feed label will not print properly.</h2>
                    I am trying to print labels to apply to baggage tags.&nbsp; We never had issues with Word 2003 but changed to Word 2010.&nbsp; I followed the instruction on the help for merging to labels.&nbsp; I chose the label type - Avery 4013 continuous feed label for a dot matrix
 printer (Okidata 320 Turbo 9 Pin Printer).&nbsp; The label is 4.25 wide and 12 inches long.&nbsp; I chose the data source.&nbsp; I set up my merge fields.&nbsp; I complete the merge.&nbsp; Everything looks fine until I go to print.&nbsp; The print screen appears and the size of the label
 does not come over to the print screen.&nbsp; It sets up to print to a legal page.&nbsp; I tried to adjust the page size but there no correct size appears.&nbsp; I tried to do a customized size but it does not come over to the page size.<br />
<br />
I tried printing but it is printing the labels like it is printing to a legal sized page and the label width seems to be taken as the left margin because the addresses are printing only partially on the right side of the label.<br />
<br />
I called Okidata support.&nbsp; They have tried to solve this issue to no avail.&nbsp; They feel that it is a Word 2010 issue.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I also tried choosing this printer as the default.&nbsp; I downloaded the newest Okidata print driver also.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Kathleen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may change the default printer to Microsoft Document Writer following the steps from the link below and check if it works:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all works fine with Microsoft Document Writer, then you may check with the Printer vendor if the printer in question is compatible with Office 2010 or not. If not compatible then you may check if
 there is any alternative driver available to make it compatible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Outlook 365 continues to block a safe sender&#39;s email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sachelis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 continues to block a safe sender&#39;s email</h2>
                    <p>I am running Outlook 365 version 1706. I have several IMAP accounts. Email from one of my acquaintances (e.g., let's assume his email address is "*****************") always ends up in my Junk E-Mail account. However:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have added "***************" and "@business.com" to the Safe Senders list more than a dozen times (and I can see both entries in the Safe Senders list for this IMAP account).
</li><li>His email address is in my Contacts list and I have the "Also trust email from my Contacts" option selected. &nbsp;</li><li>His email and domain name are not listed in my Blocked Senders list.</li></ol>
<p>If I look at the blocked email, it says, "<em>Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments: emailsignaturelogonotext_234-abc-123.png</em>" (that's not the exact name of the png file, but it's similar).</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Why is Outlook moving his email to the Junk E-Mail when he is listed (twice) in the Safe Senders list and is in my Contacts?</li><li>Is Outlook's message about the png file the primary reason the email is being blocked, or does Outlook automatically remove pngs from any blocked email?</li><li>What would Outlook consider a png file to be potentially unsafe?</li></ol>
<p>I have tried moving one of his blocked emails to my inbox, saving the png, and scanning it with AVG AntiVirus. It doesn't find any threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, My friend works for a large law firm which doesn't send spam. The png is the company's logo and is added by his server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

 do amazing thing for students, especially. I've been looking for a way to take documents that i've previously made and convert them into the notebook layout, so I can import them into OmniOutliner, which supports the OPML format.<br />
<br />
For the answer of you question:<br />
Yes, there is. I've been using a program called ReadTree, which does the conversion for you.<br />
The only problem is the Notebook Layout.. Regular file formate (not originally created in notebook layout) lose their formatting when&nbsp;transferred&nbsp;over. This causes you to have to edit every single line of the document to get it into the OPML format you want.<br />
<br />
From what you question stated though, it should work for you.

            Directly? No, but it can save in XML. I don't know of any software other than dedicated outliners which support OPML.<br />

<p>Hello Amanda,</p>
<p>The settings and STEPS you mention in your response do not show up on&nbsp;https://outlook.office.com "business premium". &nbsp;Why should I remove my BP account? it doesn't make any sense. The outlook 365 I am using is part of the BP account and my official email
 ID. Its just that I cannot move my entire organisation to exchange and need only to use my own email ID without the "on behalf of"- PERIOD. The "on behalf of" adds all the issues that the whole community of users have been complaining about- see requests from
 all others on this- google it if you want to know more .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft was supposed to have resolved this and kept promising but looks like MS support team itself is clueless on what they need to answer or support such queries with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received two replies that are totally out of context to the problem. while one has not read the question the other advises I give up the very account I purchased...what am i missing here...</p>

<p>Hi VG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have set up the Outlook.com account as a connected account in Office 365. In this situation, if you reply to a Outlook.com email or try to send from Outlook.com, the display name in the receiver side will be “*** on behalf of ***”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your concern. It is recommended that you submit feedback to our related team via this link:

<p>Hi VG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, I thought you’re not using Outlook client. So I assumed that you’re using the Outlook Web App (web browsers) and the Outlook.com account is a connected account in your BP account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the response above, this seems incorrect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid misunderstanding, would you please share with us your detailed steps about how you send out emails and how the email display “*** sending on behalf of ***”? Some clarifying screenshots are appreciated.
</p>
<p>What’s the relationship between the Outlook.com account and your BP account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            IE8 reset on computer restart</h2>
                    Computer restart causes the favorites menu (including links bar) to reset/reload many Microsoft websites. Also, home pages reset to MSN and Bing.&nbsp; Also, the default seach engine changes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this just agressive marketing by MSFT?&nbsp; How do I stop it?&nbsp; Im
 using XPSP3.&nbsp;&nbsp;This just started happening a week ago.&nbsp;

<p><strong>To one and all,</strong></p>
<p><strong>OK Final answer.&nbsp; My entire problem with IE8 was due to Trojan Fake Alert.&nbsp; I am particularly upset with this one because MSE failed to stop it, and worse, failed to find it during a scan</strong> .&nbsp;
<strong>Oh yeah, windows live onecare online scanner didnt find it either.</strong>
<strong>Whats funny is that Maleware bytes, a program that is easily hacked, found it and removed it.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>I am keeping that program on my machine now cause I dont fully trust MSE anymore.</strong>
<strong>Oh well, live and learn I guess.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So PA Bear, it appears your suspicions were right.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks everyone</strong></p>

    <title>How to stop auto upgrade from build 10240 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronkramerzx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop auto upgrade from build 10240</h2>
                    How do I stop from upgrading from 10 pro build 10240, every time It automatically tries I'm locked out of my computer for over an&nbsp; hour until it boots back to previous build of 10240, I've also tied to upgrade manually to a higher build by iso and other
 ways (about 30 times) all to the same effect. The computer HP touchscreen PC 520 refuses any upgrades past 10240, Microsoft said it's not even supports 10 it should not have activated in the first place !! How do I try to STOP it !!!!!I've spent 100's of dollars
 on programs and hard drives trying to get it to work on that computer. Finally put it on the back bench and bought a new HP Pavilion all in one from Costco with 10 home 1511 on it and upgraded it to 10 Pro 1607 no problem&nbsp;&nbsp; Grrrrr another 1.5 thousand dollars
 gone !!!!! Very frustrating !!!!!

            As you have posted this in the Insiders forum as Insiders we are to keep our systems upgraded with the newer builds, sounds like your system can't keep with the program, &nbsp;my suggestion would reinstall the original operating system which you should have
 done as a restore disc before installing the Beta software. &nbsp;Seeing that you just joined this forum you will find a lot of tips on how to restore to your original operating system, as for that system I just looked up the spec's and it meets everything that
 is needed to run Windows 10 even the newest builds suggest that you download the newest ISO and install it as a "clean" install.

            <p>I agree that a clean install of version 1607, after booting with Windows 10 install on a USB, is the best approach. Use Custom install and wipe all partitions from the hard disk before upgrading, in order to allow Windows setup to partition the disk.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you do not believe that this will work, first create a Recovery Drive USB so that you can reinstall Windows 10 build 10240. Run
<strong>recoverydrive.exe</strong> and choose to back up System files.</p>

    <title>Outlook 2010 Verifying data integrity at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> campingshadow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Verifying data integrity at startup  </h2>
                    I have been running various Outlook versions for many years including the Outlook 2010 beta and never have had this problem.&nbsp; Now with the Home version of Office 2010 every third or fourth time I open Outlook it goes thru a lengthy data verification procedure.&nbsp;
 It can take a minute or longer to verify data before opening the program.&nbsp; I dropped the number of saved emails from 2,000 to less than 200 and it is still acting the same.&nbsp; How can I get this procedure to stop running on such a regular basis?&nbsp; I can close
 Outlook and re-open in 30 seconds later and have to go thru the verification again.....when nothing has changed in that 30 seconds.&nbsp; It is extremely aggravating.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            <p>My boss was having the same problem.&nbsp; I found a fix, but I'm not sure it will work for you.&nbsp; It worked fine for me.</p>
<p>First, I have all the office computers set with 3 different user logins.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Owner' (Admin), 'Guest' and the actual 'User' (Standard)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have upgraded my bosses email in the past few years from Windows Mail, to Outlook 2007, and now Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>I also back up his email on a weekly basis as a PST file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I upgraded him to 2010, I did one more backup (just in case).&nbsp; This came in handy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I googled this issue and found all sorts of possible fixes, and none of them worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did find this one site that explained that it could have been a bad PST file.&nbsp; It stated that if you upgaded multiple times, then it might have corrupted the PST file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this is what worked for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I logged on as the 'Owner of the computer and created a new 'User'.&nbsp; As you know, this will create a brand new desktop with all clean files/folders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started Outlook and created a brand new account.&nbsp; I used all of his same info, but I told Outlook to use the last Backup file that I exported.&nbsp; It brought it up very fast.&nbsp; I went ahead and transfered all of his files from all the different folders from
 his old 'User'&nbsp;and copied them over to the same folders that are now in his new 'User'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't delete his old 'User' ID while I tested&nbsp;the new one&nbsp;for a few days (Just In Case).&nbsp; It's been about a week now, and Outlook is opening very fast.&nbsp; It is actually running&nbsp;a lot faster as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said at the beginning, I'm not sure if this route will help you, but it's worth a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this works for you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account &#38; Xbox Live Gamer Tag &#40;HELP&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    Hello i am having a vary unusual experience with my Microsoft Account and my Xbox Live Gamer Tag. 2 days ago i changed my email address on my Gamer Tag. When i was changing it, it was giving me different messages of why it wouldn't change but eventually
 i got it to change. In the past i was having difficulty changing my email so i just gave up. The issues i am experiencing are, I can not purchase any content. When i go to purchase content i can only make it to loading screen of the item i want to purchase
 then i get a error message. I am also having an issue signing into Xbox.com.
<div>I called XBL customer support and they tried looking me up in their system like they do to everyone els but they could not find my gamer tag only my email address's and histories of the emails. I can also not access my billing information through my xbox
 it gives me a error message as well. When i changed Microsoft accounts it did not transfer my currency from one to the other like it said it was going to do. I NEED some help badly Microsoft and Xbox keep playing pass around with me and all i want to do is
 download free content and have a secure account.</div>

            <p>Has anyone gotten a resolution to this issue yet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been in contact with support for the last month trying to get this issue fixed. Last time I called I was able to get a few more answers. The problem is caused when you attempt to change your email address when there is currency attached to your account.
 I have been told that my account will need to be re-coded. It is possible that this issue that causes these problems is already fixed and they are being slow about fixing the accounts of the people that were affected by it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My situation is similar to what has been described. I tried to change my email and it kept saying that there was an error. But it actually did change the email. Not only that, it created a new gamertag associated with my old email. This new gamertag has
 all my local currency, billing info, and download history that should be on my original gamertag. It is also fully functioning gold and has the expiration for my original gamertag. Now my original gamertag is also fully functioning gold but there is no membership
 or expiration. As far as I know it could be permanently gold. That would be nice if I could purchase anything. Also because my profile is glitched on Xbox.com the website trueachievements.com cannot scan my achievements, and that is a big problem for me.</p>

    <title>Counterfeit BL-5F Batteries being sold on eBay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> breeder---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Counterfeit BL-5F Batteries being sold on eBay</h2>
                    I recently bought a BL-5F battery as a spare from what appears to be a reputable seller:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.d...m=270118161380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.d...m=270118161380</a><br />
<br />
However, it fails the code authentification using the 20 digit serial number underneath the scratch panel on the hologram saying its already been authenticated:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3bzrq7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/3bzrq7</a><br />
<br />
I then though I'd contact some other people who left him feedback after buying the same battery from the seller in question. All of the ones that have replied back have told me that their 20 digit serial number is the same as mine! I've asked them to send me
 photos with their details in them as well for evidence.<br />
<br />
I've emailed the seller and hes replied back pleading his innocence offering me a full refund plus compensation as long as I don't leave negative feedback. I'll have to give him the benefit of the doubt because counterfeit accessories have been known to enter
 legitimate distribution channels. He might also be an innocent party in all of this but starting to seriously doubt it.<br />
<br />
However, I want eBay to take some responsibily and contact all the people (there are over a hundred of them I think) that have bought these batteries from him making them aware they are counterfeit and helping them obtain a refund.<br />
<br />
Do you think I'm wasting my time with eBay here? I might try contacting Nokia on *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and see what they say.<br />
<br />
Many thanks!

            I recently bought a spare battery here in Bangkok but the only ones they had were the ones that came with the phone so they cracked open another box and sold me the battery from it.<br />
<br />
Q. Did you hollogram pass the . .. ... ... test?<br />
<br />
Also why don't you post the serial number so folks can check if their battery is counterfeit also.

<br />
They might cost a bit more but in the end it is better to put an original battery from a Nokia shop into your $500 plus phone.<br />
<br />
Just my $.02

            Well you see Nokia have dropped the ball and left open an opportunity by not providing adequate supply of the 5F batterys. There are non available separately in Bangkok as of a week ago but there are N95's everywhere you look. A lot of times if somebody
 needs a spare battery they need it because of the current battery life. Given the 5F battery life is poor people are more inclined to take the risk given their need for an extra battery.

            I can understand your point but I think that you have maybe made a few statements that are misleading.<br />
<br />
1. Nokia does not make batteries. They purchase them just like SE, Apple, Dell, etc.... Batteries take time to produce. They are like memory in a way. They require lead times and fluctuate with the market demand.<br />
<br />
2. The battery life on the N95 is much better than anything SE has to offer. There is a post in this forum about this and I will post if I can find it again. The biggest problem people have currently is that they run the GPS, connect to the TV, run the media
 player, connect to 3G, and then wonder why the battery only lasts a day. I am getting anywhere between 24 and 48 hours based on my usage habits. I use GPS when I need it. I turn off BT if I am not connecting. Battery life is proportional to device usage. Use
 a lot, battery does not last long.<br />

What is the purpose of buying $500+ phone? It loads of feature, so people use it and battery run flat quickly. Subsequently they want some spare battery, it definitely must be avilable. It is phone manufature reponsibility, isn't it?

The 20 digit serial number is:<br />
<br />
04060407038489617899<br />
<br />
Its a pretty convincing counterfeit isn't it?!<br />
<br />
However it is the packaging which gives the counterfeit away:<br />

            Yes it has a hologram if you look at the photo of the counterfeit I posted above you can see that. Read this:<br />

<br />
But scratch off the black panel to reveal the 20 digit code. Authenticate the code here:<br />

<br />
If it fails the authentication then its counterfeit. No doubts.

            Oh wow. I know that a lot of the nokia batteries being sold on ebay are knockoffs but there's no way that I know that you can authenticate your own battery with a product code!? WOW! Thanks for the info! :)

            Yeah the counterfeiters aren't smart enough to produce a keygen to generate serial numbers that pass the aunthentication process. Instead they are mass producing using the same serial number.

            <p>Hello YousefSahib,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contributing to the Microsoft community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a Windows Phone is turned off during an update, it can be that the software on the phone gets corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is your Windows Phone responding at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you already tried removing the battery, waiting a couple of seconds, and re-inserting it, to check whether your phone will respond again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Zune software still recognizes the Windows Phone when connected to the PC, you may want to try to restore it to the previous update version. You can do so within the Zune software in
<b>Settings</b> -&gt; <b>Phone</b> -&gt; <b>Update</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not work, you could also try to reset your phone, if you can still turn it on, in
<b>Settings</b> -&gt; <b>About</b> -&gt; <b>Reset your phone</b>. But please be aware that this will erase all your personal data off your phone (music, pictures, videos, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows Phone does not respond at all, you may want to try a heard reset via the following button combination:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>With the phone turned off, <b>
press and hold</b> the <b>Volume Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons, and then briefly press the
<b>Power button</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Wait for the screen to show the instructions on how to do the factory reset, and then
<b>release the Volume buttons</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Follow the instructions on screen to factory reset your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows Phone does not respond at all to the above mentioned troubleshoot steps, you will most likely need to send in the device for repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information for a replacement or repair service, you will either need to contact the manufacturer of your phone or the retail store you purchase the phone from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc K.</p>
