    <title>Ever since latest Win10 update, DirectX has given Bad Image errors on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ever since latest Win10 update, DirectX has given Bad Image errors on most games.</h2>
                    <p>So I've been attempting to fix this myself using Google as a source of information for the last 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I've done many things to correct the issue but all have ended in failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some assistance with this before I'm forced to reformat, especially since I didn't get a physical copy of Windows 10 with my PC. I would have to rollback to Windows 7. I'm actually not against going back to Win7 either since I've
 never had so many issues as I have with Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've done:</p>
<p>Booted in safe-mode, and re-installed DirectX 9-12 using the redist files.</p>
<p>Used Elevated cmd prompt to scan windows files for errors. (Turned out there was no errors? Odd since every game ever is reporting Bad Image with DirectX files located in System32 being the issue.)</p>
<p>Changed my C drive security to allow the "Everyone", "User", "MY_EMAIL", "HomeUsers", and "Administrators" groups "Full Access".</p>
<p>Temporarily turned off UAC security to check if I could bypass it to fix things. (Answer is no, did not help. So I turned UAC back on.)</p>
<p>Multiple scans with multiple trusted Malware scanners, Spyware scanners, and Virus scanners. (Nothing except cookies showed up.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've noticed:</p>
<p>Even with "Full Access" Security Control on ALL User levels in MyDocuments, no game can write configs or folder data to it. This results in any game that uses MyDocuments to save files to completely fail to even start if I hadn't had the files already.</p>
<p>Windows Installer doesn't automatically start, I need to force start it every time I start my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common errors I get are:</p>
<p>XXXX_GAME.exe - Bad Image</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\SOME_DIRECTX_FILE.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error
 status 0xc000012f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, aside the game name most of the error is the same. In the case of the error I'm reading at this moment it is reporting this for XINPUT1_3.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I would really appreciate some assistance with this as I have been pulling my hair out for 2 weeks and am now bald. These issues have prevented me from playing a lot of games, even new games because of Bad Image errors or the failure to write to MyDocuments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need anymore information aside the fact I'm on Windows 10, please let me know.</p>
<p>

<p>I have ran the command and it completed, ran the sfc scan command it said no integrity violations. I ran the Windows Update, restarted my PC, and did another sfc scan, once again no integrity violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all that I ran my game to see if anything changed, and I still get the same Bad Image error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Installer service also still did not start with my pc and I had to turn it on to install the DirectX redist. Restarted my PC again, and still the same Bad Image error with XINPUT1_3.dll</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Fan makes loud reving sound when playing certain games at 4K</h2>
                    <p>When I'd play Wolfenstein 2 or CoD&nbsp;WWII, every once in a while it sounds like the fan speed goes from 40% to 100% for about 3-4 seconds before slowly getting quiet again. I have enough room around the console so it is getting plenty ventilation. Does anyone know what the problem is, or if it's something I can trade my console in for? Other people are saying they've been playing these games and the console has been 100% whisper quiet and not a problem. I just don't want to be stuck with a possibly defective console before my warranty is up and the console possibly breaks.</p>

            <p>The Microsoft guys are right, it is normal. Most of the time the normal speed of the fan will be enough to keep the system cool, but occasionally it will need to spin up faster in order to deal with a heat spike.<br /><br />Many computer power supplies follow a similar system. Most of the time the fan doesn't even spin but once the temperature reaches a certain point, the fan spins up to keep the temps where they should be.<br /><br />Got to give Microsoft credit where it is due, they've learnt a lot about cooling a system since the early Xbox 360 days.</p>

 does nothing.</p>
<p>Holding F8 during start up allows me to hit F12 to select another boot source, but nothing I have will allow me to boot.&nbsp; &nbsp; This is a Dell XPS8300 desktop running windows 10.&nbsp; The monitor works ok with another computer.&nbsp; Since the initial image looks like
 it is starting up, it seems like the graphics card is working.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I remove the white screen and get the system working normally again?</p>

<p>Yes. Everything except the keyboard &amp; mouse have been disconnected. I did not update any software that im aware of. The problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to access an internal dell service already installed that checks the computer. System, &nbsp;cables, OS boot path, hard drive, cd rom, memory, fans, video card, processor all passed the test.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Backup gives error code 0x8100015 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archimedes3.14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup gives error code 0x8100015</h2>
                    Just upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and am trying to get backup to work. Here is my saga to date:<br />
<br />
1st try: Got error code 0x1000037. After searching through ridiculously technical answers about
<em>REPARSE POINTS</em>, I got the idea that the problem may result from trying to back up zipped files. I moved those files to the another disk drive (not being backed up). [It occurs to me that, if Backup has difficulty with certain kinds of files, then why
 doesn't Microsoft FIX the problem???]<br />
<br />
2nd try: Got a <em>different</em> error code: 0x80070002. Looking through responses on this forum, I got the idea that the problem was missing image paths in the registry. I
<em>looked</em> at the registry, saw that the needed paths were exacty what and where they should be, and exited regedit without saving any changes. Ran Backup again.<br />
<br />
3rd try: Got yet <em>another</em> error code: 0x81000015. Looking through this forum again, I got absolutely nothing. What's the code mean? What's the fix for it? Why isn't there an easily accessible listing of all error codes?

            You can use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition, I would also suggest you to delete Temp files and folders. Removing temporary files is a quick and easy task that can help save disk space and keep your PC clean of file clutter. Just follow the step by step directions below to manually clean out
 the Temp folder: <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Click on Start, type the following command in the search box, and then hit the Enter key.
<br />
<br />
%temp%<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This command will open the folder that Windows Vista has designated as the Temporary folder. These are folders and files that Windows needed at one time but are no longer useful. Everything in this folder is safe to delete.
<br />
<br />
2. To remove individual folders or files, hold down your Ctrl key while left-clicking on each item you want delete. Release the Ctrl key when you’re finished.
<br />
<br />
3. To delete these items, hit your Delete key or click the Organize button on the toolbar menu, followed by the Delete option.
<br />
<br />
You will probably be prompted to confirm that you wish to Delete Multiple Items. Click on Yes to confirm.
<br />
<br />
4. If you’d instead like to remove everything inside the Temp folder, click on the Organize button and then choose Select All from the menu.
<br />
<br />
Note: If you’re prompted that there are hidden files in this folder, just click on OK to bypass the message. A few hidden files hanging out in the Temp folder probably aren’t important enough to worry about.<br />
<br />
5. Again, to delete these items, hit your Delete key or click the Organize button on the toolbar menu, followed by the Delete option.<br />
<br />
You will probably be prompted again to confirm that you wish to Delete Multiple Items. Click on Yes to confirm.
<br />
<br />
6. After all of the files have been deleted you can close the folder window and empty your Recycle Bin, permanently removing the files from your PC.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Conhost.dll and msls31.dll bad image errors</h2>
                    <p>Ok, this started right after i purchased my new Cyber Power Gamer Ultra Desktop from Walmart this past Christmas, i first noticed this bad image error on Nexus Mods (It downloaded fine the first day and opened correctly to, but when i came back the next
 day it wouldn't.) And ever since then this error has almost prevented every foreign program from installing, (Except steam, origin, and some free virus protection things, etc..) Anyways, i have tried installing so many thing ( OBS, Gimp, etc..) Im 99.95% sure
 its not a virus because i have ran 3 virus protection softwares (Excluding windows defender because it wouldn't work because of this)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't got very attached so, i tried to reset the PC, Didn't Work ("We encountered an error")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to refresh it, same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there have been many updates but, it wont update. same as first&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the best part is that it wont allow the disks to work that came with it, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the last time i try to seek help before i either call CyberPower and curse them out, Or take it to a PC repair store and spend money for some random person to hopefully fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(i am including the photos of both the errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Also i dont know what category this would go to so im picking update, recovery)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further troubleshoot the issue, we suggest that you perform the additional methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>:&nbsp;Use the System File Checker tool (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) to repair your Windows installation. For the steps on how to use these tools and the commands that you need to run, kindly
 refer to the following link:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">System file
 check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files &amp; DISM to fix things SFC cannot</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:<span> </span>
</strong>Restore your PC from a system restore point. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. This method should help if the issue is caused by a recent change on your computer. For steps on how to perform
 a system restore, refer to the&nbsp;<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>section in the following link:<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Problems with MIcrosoft Photos App.</h2>
                    <p>Ive been having an impossible time accessing my MS photos app...every time I look at the photos I've taken, my laptop freezes up and I have to hold the power button down to escape the freeze. I've tried repairing and resetting using the advanced option,
 however the uninstall option is not available. I've also attempted to uninstall using the powershell app using the command Get-AppxPackage *photos* | Remove-AppxPackage; this attempt did work for about 15 minutes but, since i'm asking for help, it wasent the
 permanent fix I was hoping for. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hello WaxierCamera556,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<p>Not sure if this works for apps but usually I use this to fix corrupted files on windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a command prompt and:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also just use something else as the default program to open images.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Shania,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I’ll try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue for a better understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) How are you playing the videos on your laptop? Is it using the Windows 8 Video App or any other desktop media player?</span></p>
<p><span>2) What exactly happens when you play the videos? Is it showing just a green screen with the audio?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Do you face this issue with all the video file types?</span></p>
<p><span>4) What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>5) Did you update the graphics card drivers and check the status of the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>6) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us with all these information to assist you better on this issue. For the time being, please try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues and provides the details on how to fix them. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on “<strong><em>Hardware and Devices</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. Check if it reports any issue with the graphics card or its driver installed on the computer. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and let us know
 if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Method 2: Turn off Hardware Acceleration</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps and check if that resolves the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Go to the Desktop Interface of Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Right click on a free space on the desktop and then select the option “<strong><em>Personalize</em></strong>” from that menu.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Now, on the “<strong><em>Personalization</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>Display</em></strong>” link from the left bottom corner of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Now, click on the link “<strong><em>Change display settings</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Advanced settings</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the new window, click on the “<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>” tab and then click on the “<strong><em>Change settings</em></strong>” button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note: If the “Troubleshoot” tab is not present or if the “Change settings” button is grayed out, then it means that your graphics card does not support the hardware acceleration.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f) Now, on the new window that appears, move the slider to the extreme left to disable or reduce the hardware acceleration and click on “<strong><em>OK</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Please get back to us with the result and all the relevant information regarding the issue.</span>

<h2>            The transforming d-pad on silvery Xbox 360 controller is cracking</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone else experienced this issue? On the new Xbox 360 controllers with the silver finish, the d-pad is starting to slowly crack in the center. I'm certain it will break eventually. Will Microsoft offer a replacement?</p>

<p>YES - mine broke. </p>
<p>The cracking is the center support stick slowly breaking its connection to the D-pad cross.
</p>
<p>While you're playing, you'll feel it lean into whatever direction you're pressing and break away, a spring behind it will pop it towards you.
</p>
<p>I haven't replaced mine yet since I have a joystick to alternate into for fighting games but I will call customer service in a few days.

<p>Don't even bother with the transforming D-pad controllers. the craftmanship is pathetic. Everyone of them will eventually have the D-pad break off in the exact same spot. The idea was good but the materials and construction will only lead to them breaking.
 I have gone through a few and they all broke in the exact same place. I'm not even going to bother calling Microsoft about it because They need it to be shipped to them and the shipping comes out of our pocket, and the cost of shipping is about half the price
 of the controller. As many times as I've sent the controller back I could have bought two new controllers. They are not even worth it.</p>

<p>This is incredibly frustrating, as my second D-Pad just snapped. The original D-Pad for the 360 is notoriously terrible for fighting games, so when I saw the design for the rotating D-Pad I was ecstatic. However after just a few sessions of rigorous fighting
 on SCV and TTT2, it snapped off in the exact same fashion as the other two. It worked surprisingly better after applying Gorilla Glue, for just another short while, but for the price of a game with the rotating D-Pad a featured aspect of the controller, I
 was not expecting such a flimsy product. I have already contacted MS, and there's nothing they can do for me. With a gamerscore of almost 70,000, I obviously love my system but with tactics like this they are hard to defend at times.</p>

<h2>            Upgrade to 8.1 from 8 Ruined my Internet Connectivity - Very slow to connect if at all&#33;</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8.1 this morning and when it finished I had variable internet connections. A page would work, then it wouldn't. This occurred in Chrome, IE and Firefox. So then I tried to run a game through ORIGIN (EA) and Origin couldn't connect
 so Cloud games couldn't be retrieved. Any program I have that accesses the internet struggled.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried re installing the browsers, didn't work.</div>
<div>I tried re-installing the LAN and Wireless drivers - this worked for 5 minutes, then I couldn't connect anymore</div>
<div>All the while through speedtest.net my internet was fine (even when tested on the ipad).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried resetting PC, Modem, Internet connection, still no fix.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the end I restored the PC Image I made before installing Win 8.1 and everything is back to normal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone else had this issue? Im really disappointed as I like Win 8 and the new features in 8.1 looked great.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can understand the inconvenience that is caused. This might happen if the Windows 8.1 compatible drivers are not installed for your network adapters.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
1. What is the make and model of your computer?
<p>2. Are you using wired or wireless internet?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I see that you have reinstalled the device drivers to fix the issue. In this scenario updating the drivers might help.
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would s</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">uggest you upgrade the operating system to Windows 8.1 then update the network adapter drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer to the steps mentioned under “Update driver” section.</span></p>

            Having the same issue with both my laptop and desktop after upgrading to Windows 8.1. The internet works for about 5-10 mins then slows down and stops completely.
<div><br />
<div>Other devices on my network (tablets and mobile phone) are working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restarting seems to be the only temporary fix but it is getting very frustrating!</div>

            <p>Same issue here, Win 8 great, Win 8.1 adhoc internet connectivity. Installed updated Realtek GBE Network adapter drivers, restarted Winsock and flushed cache, deleted browser cache, reset IE11 to default settings etc.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>All I can say is well done again Microsoft! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What should be a&nbsp;1/2 an hour upgrade, is&nbsp;now a 1/2 to full day time wasting problem which is unresolved. Certainly I am not going to reinstall Win 7, then Win 8, then Win 8.1 to find out is still MS's error!
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Oh and of course (silly me) I didn't image my HDD before the 8.1 "upgrade".</p>

<p>What do I do now - turn on my other Linux PC?</p>

So doing all that didn't fix it?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Yeah I wasted the whole day to end up at square one.</div>

<div>I have been making system images every few weeks and finally it has paid off. I highly recommend it.</div>

            This is common for upgrades. Clean install would likely fix this but Microsoft don't provide a Windows 8.1 installation .iso for clean installation and have introduced a large number of unnecessary complications to prevent users from clean installing.

I don't particularly want to do a clean install as I have a couple of programs (ie. office 2013) that I can't find the product key for. Plus I don't want to spend the next week installing everything again. It's taken me a year to get the pc running how I wanted
 it and now I have to do a clean install to get the upgrade right?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate the advice though, and you are right. Just wish they could get the upgrade right. Looks like we will have to wait for a fix, if that ever happens.</div>

<h2>            Facing issues with the Ricoh Lanier SP C242DN printer on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Ricoh Lanier SP C242DN printer on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software is installed.</p>
<p>Hardware is up and Ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Print a Test Page (or anything really) and it shows up in the Print Queue, then disappears as normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only no Data In on the printer, no error messages to say print fails from Windows ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Printer is on and Ready, cables to Printer are working as in I can Remove the printer in Windows and do a fresh installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have used Printer side test pages for both Configuration Page and Maintenance Page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed off both original installation disks and off the latest "Windows 10" downloaded from Lanier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be wonderful thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Footnote: &nbsp;Thank you very much for your reply and choice of answers&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Syed Abdul Jabbar.
</span>I worked through each and every step and came up with no errors. &nbsp;So I was about to box up my Printer when i noticed the model C240DN disagreed with the one installed on &nbsp;Windows C242DN. &nbsp;Using techniques shown in Method 2: I downloaded drivers off the
 manufacturer's website and installed them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi RvB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I split your response to create&nbsp;a new individual thread instead of reviving one from a while back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a known issue Forza has been aware of for a little while now when trying to download things from Forza 4 on PC. No matter what settings you have it will continue to tell you that the feature is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to contact <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza Support </a>and fill out a ticket with them to let them know you are also experiencing this issue.</p>

<p>If you did a hard reinstall without backing up your data, it's gone. Thank your friend for the advice.</p>
<p>Download the free version&nbsp;of&nbsp;these two tools. The next time you suspect a Trojan, run them. Running them once a week or so is not a bad idea either.</p>

            <p>You have just learned the hard way that <strong>backup copies&nbsp;of your files&nbsp;is mandatory</strong> for just this type of advice from a friend or possibly online in a forum from a stranger.</p>
<p>A large detail left out, backup your files before restoring to a factory settings partition.
</p>
<p>Now your only hope is that your still have the sd cards from the cameras with the photos on them, and original emails with the attachments in a web based email service.</p>

<p>What is program compatibility?<br />
Program compatibility is a mode in Windows that lets you run programs written<br />
for earlier versions of Windows. Most programs written for Windows Vista also work in Windows 7,<br />
but some older programs might run poorly or not run at all.<br />

            <p>Glad to hear it is all working out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was me, I would make sure you have the latest editions (for the latest OS possible) of each of the hardware device drivers. &nbsp;I would o it one at a time, with a reboot and possibly even a day worth of testing in-between (just to be safe - considering
 &nbsp;very thing seems to be working okay already.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as each new major thing I tried to upgrade worked, I would take the time to make a new FULL system image - that way going back to a working state is very very easy.</p>

            <p>I am thinking of buying a refurbished Dell Precision T5500 (comes with Win 7 Pro) but will want to use a touchscreen, so I would need to upgrade the OS. I found this on Dell's Product Support site:</p>
<p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Dell is not testing or developing Windows 10 drivers for this product. If you choose to upgrade, some features, applications, and connected devices may not work as expected.</p>

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Likewise, it appears that Win 8 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span> supported, but 8.1 is
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
If anyone has got either 8.1 or 10 working in a straightforward manner on the T5500 with or without a touchscreen, I'd be keen to hear!</p>

<p><span><span>We have a couple of Dell Precision T5500 workstations. I’m running Windows 10 on it. It works well, except there are some problems with suspend mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) In all Windows 10 versions, when the Hyper-V role is activated, the system freezes when resuming from suspend mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) The fall creators update, aka version 1709, is a complete disaster. Even without Hyper-V role, resuming from suspend mode causes a bluescreen in the NT kernel,
 and the shuts down/restarts. This has worked for all previous versions of Windows 10. I had to rollback to version 1703.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Those problems has been reproduced with several T5500 workstations, even with clean installs. We’re using latest BIOS version A16.</span></span></p>
