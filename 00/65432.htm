<h2>            All my hard drive is filled with windows installer &#34;items&#34; and most are fragged.  HELP</h2>
                    I have a problem with my Think Pad running XP Pro. I DO NOT have the installer disks any longer.&nbsp; I recently ran an antivirus program, moved and deleted some documents and other stored items.&nbsp; When I tried to run defrag, I had less than 2% free space (I
 started this process with over 50% free).&nbsp; I did a disk clean-up and found that just about everything listed there was empty.&nbsp; I ran MS Security Essentials.&nbsp; It took over 19 hours to run.&nbsp; There were over 27 million items that it scanned -- over 13.5 of which
 were in "windows/installer".&nbsp; Since this thread is saying that installer traps previous install / uninstall code, does it also keep the code for all of the malware that may attempt to be installed?&nbsp; MS support told me to run diskcheck - no problems with that
 operation.&nbsp; Only thing left on my PC is XP Pro, Office Suite and 3 anti-spyware programs.&nbsp; I used to run about 20 additional applications including photoshop and the associated f

            <p><span>The C:\Windows\Installer folder occasionally balloons in size (you can check its size by right-clicking and selecting Properties).<br />
<br />
I hope one of those "anti-spyware programs" is an antivirus program.<br />
<br />
The Installer folder keeps data from applications installed with the Microsoft Installer.&nbsp; It does not keep malware installations -- unless, of course, the malware installs itself using Microsoft Installer or otherwise deliberately puts itself there.&nbsp; Typically,
 the problem happens as a result of failed installations, usually of updates from Windows Update.<br />
<br />
The issue is that you shouldn't simply delete the entire Installer folder or even attempt to manually delete the files in it.&nbsp; The data in the Installer folder is used by properly installed applications when they need to be updated, modified, or uninstalled,
 so if you were to delete that data, you would have a problem if you needed to perform any of those functions.<br />
<br />
There is a Microsoft tool that can be used to clean out "orphaned" entries in the Installer folder. It is these orphaned entries that usually are what takes up all of the space.&nbsp; The tool is called msizap.exe and it is distributed with the Microsoft Installer
 Cleanup Utility.&nbsp; It is important to distinguish between these two tools.&nbsp; Microsoft no longer recommends that the Cleanup Utility be used because it sometimes "cleaned up" more than it was supposed to.&nbsp; As a result, Microsoft removed the Cleanup Utility from
 its servers.&nbsp; Msizap.exe is NOT the Cleanup Utility.<br />
<br />
Go here and download the installation package for the Microsoft Windows Installer Cleanup Utility --&gt;
<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/windows_installer_cleanup_utility.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Run the downloaded file.<br />
You will then find both the Installer Cleanup Utility and msizap.exe at C:\Program Files\Windows Installer Clean Up<br />
Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)<br />
Change to the folder where msizap is located by typing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd C:\Windows\Program Files\Windows Installer Clean Up&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
Run msizap with the following command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msizap !g&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
Alternatively, you can run this command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msizap !g&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; zapresults.txt&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
which will create a text file in the same folder which you can then open with Notepad to see what happened.<br />

*******************************************************<br />
After you run msizap and remove any orphaned installer entries, clean up more of your hard drive following some of the suggestions below:</span></p>
<p><span>There are a number of things you can do to -- <b>temporarily</b> -- free up disk space.&nbsp; The only real solution, however, is to get a larger internal hard drive (or a second
<b>internal</b> drive).&nbsp;A desktop or tower probably will be able to accommodate a second internal drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A laptop or “all-in-one” (computer built into the monitor) probably will not.</span></p>
<p><span>You can move data to an external drive, but if it is data that you use frequently, the slower access times may annoy you.&nbsp; Therefore, I don't recommend that you
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">move your My Documents folder</span></a> in its entirety to an external drive, although you certainly could do that by following the linked instructions.&nbsp; Moving My Documents
 to a second internal drive is OK.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You can run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr &gt; OK) [See NOTE below]</span></li><li><span>You can reduce the size allocated to System Restore to about 1 GB (right-click My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; System Restore &gt;Settings)</span></li><li><span>You can turn off Hibernation (if you don't use it) (right-click empty spot on desktop &gt; Properties &gt; Screen Saver &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate)</span></li><li><span>You can disable Disk Indexing, which will also speed up your computer a bit (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://lifehacker.com/031440/turn-off-indexing-and-speed-up-windows-xp</span></a>)</span></li><li><span>You can reduce the size of your Internet browser cache (varies depending on which browser you use)</span></li><li><span>You can remove most of the $NTUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders following the directions here:<span>&nbsp;

</span>(read the caveats in the grey box first)</span></li><li><span>Also see: </span></li></ul>
<p><span>«</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to reclaim disk space on Windows XP and Windows Server 2008-based computers?</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE:&nbsp; By default the Disk Cleanup utility does not delete files accessed in the last seven days.&nbsp; You can either go directly to the Temp directory (Start &gt; Run &gt; %temp% &gt; OK), and select all of the files and delete them (except one or two that will
 be “in use”) or alter the LastAccess value in the registry, to configure the Disk Cleanup utility to delete all the files in the Temp folder regardless of the last accessed date. Here's how (it would be prudent to backup your registry or at least create a
 Restore Point first): </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open Regedit (Start &gt; Run &gt; regedit &gt; OK)</span></li><li><span>Navigate to<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Temporary Files</span></li><li><span>Locate and double-click the LastAccess value</span></li><li><span>When you see the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, change the Value Data setting from 7 to 0 and click OK</span></li><li><span>Restart Windows.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>But none of the above will really gain you significant amounts of space for very long.&nbsp; The only long term solution is a bigger hard drive.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, download and run <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">J<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/jdiskreport.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DiskReport</a></span>, which will graphically show you what files are taking up the most space and thus suggest what files you should
 move to another drive.&nbsp; An alternate utility (also free) is <a href="http://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>If you want to move an application to another drive (either external or internal), you'll have to uninstall it and then reinstall it specifying the other drive as the install location.&nbsp; You can't simply move the files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even so, many applications will place some files on the system drive (i.e., the drive where Windows is located).</span></p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Hello! Surely the disk is partitioned in mbr. 
<br />In order for you to partition beyond 2 tb, the disk needs to be in gpt mode.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/disk-management/change-an-mbr-disk-into-a-gpt-disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server...</a>
<br />
<br />Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem?

    <title>Issues with Sleep Mode Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coolcat221  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Sleep Mode Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since the last round of windows 10 updates a month or so ago my computer will no longer stay in sleep mode. Every night I hit the sleep button and it goes to sleep but I wake up in the middle of the night when it randomly turns itself back on. The screen
 will go back to sleep but the computer never shuts back off into sleep mode just runs unless I physically hit the sleep button on my keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's a HP p2-1322 computer, was originally windows 8 upgraded to windows 10. Did not start having the issue until the computer forced an update that had my computer down for about 3 hours while it installed itself. I have check all of my power settings,
 they are all set correctly. I checked my display driver it says it is up to date. I am not sure what else to do so any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

This Qualcomm Atheros network Controller connects you to the network.<br />
HID-compliant mouse<br />
HID Keyboard Device<br />
<br />
</p><p>all it shows to wake is the keyboard and the mouse, neither of which is what is waking it up. I mean it did used to wake up every now and then but it always went back to sleep. The monitor does but the cpu never shuts back off it won't auto sleep only if
 I hit the sleep button on the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through the boards and tried mutiple solutions but so far nothing has worked. I notice a lot of the answers are from 2015 and I am not sure if this is the same problem or a new one as it didn't start until it did that massive update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still trying to see what is waking it up and go from there but that is not fixing the underlying problem of it not going back to sleep just trying to keep it from waking up.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Message - Increase in Yearly Subscription Price - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Message - Increase in Yearly Subscription Price</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a message via xbox live on the xbox one today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It advised that the price is increasing to £49.99. I paid for 12 months in April 2019 and my renewal is not due until May 2020.<br />
<br />
The message says all current subscriptions will be kept for 90 days and users will be charged on August 7th 2019. Does this mean that I will be charged again? Or does it just mean that my price will increase from my renewal date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message really isn't clear, but surely they can't charge me again only 3 months after I paid for a years subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone that can help</p>
<p />

            It means that the change in price would go into effect on August 7. Since you've already paid through 2020, you won't be charged again until that renewal date.&nbsp;

<p>G'day</p>
<p>I buy pre paid membership and won't change that!</p>
<p>Until I get an official notification of changes to my membership, and that I have to change my method of payment, I will take these and any other statements concerning my subscriptions with grain of salt.!!!</p>
<p>I'm sure that there will be plenty of XBL users that DON'T put their payment method ONLINE... Unless the encryption is strengthened to my satisfaction I will never put any account details ONLINE.</p>
<p>Call me old school if you like! I prefer to pay, with real money that I have, instead of incurring debts on the never never!</p>
<p>And YES, I am old school!</p>
<p>I believe that if you don't have the money to pay for something you desire, save up and pay for it when you do, in full!</p>

<p>Lol its the same crappy graphics engine and when that building collapsed it looked so bad compared to BF3.Those destructable environments look so scripted and just outdated.The explosions had the same bad physics and horrid textures are back.</p>

    <title>Windows Live Mail encountered an unexpected problem while displaying - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmedarts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail encountered an unexpected problem while displaying this message. Check your computer for low memory or low disk space and try again.</h2>
                    In Windows Live Mail on my home PC (Win 7 home premium) I can only see headers in my primary hotmail account. No bodies or attachments. Any message under my primary hotmail account that I click on says "Windows Live Mail encountered an unexpected problem
 while displaying this message. Check your computer for low memory or low disk space and try again." in the body. Inbox, sent, deleted, period. I am not suffering from low memory or low disk space.
<br />
<br />
It gets new headers, but not the messages.<br />
<br />
my hotmail account is configured via http<br />
<br />
Windows live mail works fine for my optonline.net acct (POP3) and my other hotmail address (http). It can view all of my stored messages without issue. It's just my primary one that is screwed up.<br />
<br />
I have full functionality on outlook.com. I have full functionality from my iPhone and iPad.
<br />
<br />
I have gone back to a system restore point from one month ago. I have repaired Windows Live Essentials. I have removed and re-added the account. I have uninstalled/reinstalled Windows Live Essentials. I have automatic update on, and all is up to date. I use
 Microsoft Security Essentials and it is also up to date.<br />
<br />
This same issue has been posted by 3 or 4 people and not answered. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Joe<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system detected that opening up that email will eat up all the computer's resources. I suggest that either you set Windows Live Mail to work offline or&nbsp;quit other running applications such as anti-virus software and then try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks so much for trying to help me out, but i do not think that's the issue.<br />
<br />
Working offline doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I do not have memory, disk space, or system resource issues. A simple test email, with just the word test in the subject and body should not overtax any email program.<br />
<br />
I am using Microsoft Security Essentials and no other virus/firewall software<br />
<br />
Yesterday I removed my other hotmail account from livemail, and then uninstalled/resinstalled livemail and re-added that account. Now LiveMail is doing the same thing with that account. Messages that displayed just fine yesterday will not display today. This
 is further evidence this is not a resource issue.<br />
<br />
Today I noticed that every time i hit send/receive, windows live mail downloads every single messsage from hotmail (sent, deleted, inbox, etc). When functioning properly, wouldn't it download the messages once and not re-download them every time?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Joe<br />

            OK - so I fixed it myself. As near as I can tell, my installation of Windows Live Mail was corrupt. Reinstalling did no good because your old configuration files don't really get wiped when you uninstall (Thanks Microsoft!)<br />
<br />
I followed the procedure here, BE SURE TO BACK UP ANYTHING ON YOUR PC AS THEY RECOMMEND, with one exception: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mesh-wlinstall/windows-essential-2012-no-longer-includes-live/7e9b6066-e68e-44ff-a902-f89f94e94852?tm=1353297349110<br />
<br />
The exception - When it tells you to: <br />
<i><b>3. Browse your computer to:<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files then delete the Windows Live folder if available.</b> <b><br />
Go to C:\Program Files\Common Files\. Delete the folder Windows Live on this location.<br />
<br />
</b></i>That is not sufficient<i><b>.</b></i> When I did this the first time, upon re-install all of my email accounts and stored messages were right there waiting for me in Windows Live Mail when I opened it after the re-install (see comment above, a wipe
 is not a wipe. Thanks Microsoft!)<i><b><br />
<br />
</b></i>So I figured my Windows Live Mail files must be somewhere else.&nbsp; I went digging on my C: drive and found at least three more places where "Windows Live" folders were hiding.&nbsp; I deleted them all. Then when I reinstalled, the accounts were not there,
 I had to add them again manually, and now they have come up perfectly.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Please note i am the only user of this PC, I would not go deleting Windows Live folders under someone else's username.<br />
<br />
Good Luck - YMMV<br />

<h2>            Outlaws To the End Co-Op Mission Pack &#40;RDR&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Купил в GoD игру Red Dead Redemption и Undead Nightmare Collection. Играю, делаю ачивки и обнаружил что DLC&nbsp;Outlaws To the End Co-Op Mission Pack недоступен в российском лайве хотя он и бесплатный! Очень странно что покупая игру еще и дороже чем, например,
 в США получаем меньше контента. Хотелось бы узнать когда планируется добавить этот DLC в российский лайв.</p>

<p>RDR давным давно добавлена, добавлены основные DLC, но нет именно этого бесплатного без которого 100% достижений не выбить. Какие могут быть проблемы добавить не понятно. Не так уж и скуден русский лайв - 100+ &nbsp;GoD игр. Может обратиться в твиттер или еще
 куда чтоб получить официальный ответ по этому поводу?</p>

<br />
Try FreeHideFolders which both hides the folder and requires a password for access so 1st<br />
someone has to know it exists and its location and&nbsp;name&nbsp;and then they have to know the<br />
password. <strong>HINT</strong> - write down the password and keep in several places including at home.<br />

<p><font><font>What happens when you try to open Catalyst control center? Do you get an error?</font></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to an incompatible driver. In this case, I would suggest you to uninstall the catalyst control center, update
 the graphic card driver and then install the catalyst control center again and check. You can download the appropriate 32bit or 63 bit drivers by following this link:</font></font></p>

            <p>Hi Bennet Martin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HP Pavillion E-016TX with ATI Radeon HD 8670M (2GB) graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphics card was working fine with Windows 8 and there no lag at all while playing Assassins Creed 4: Black Flag. However, after updating my Laptop to windows 8.1, it has stopped working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier&nbsp;I was not able to open Catalyst Control Centre. Then i went to HP site and updated my AMD/ATI Radeon graphics driver to the latest as provided by the company.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading and Installing the driver, the Catalyst Control Centre started working. However, even after changing the settings to High performance while plugged in, the gpraphics is not switching. Apparent from the fact that the Assassin Creed 4 is
 lagging a lot and giving a much lower FPS when compared to FPS before the upate. Also when I run dxd diag it shows only InteL HD graphics 4000 and does not detect my other graphics card.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My device manager is showing my graphics driver and when&nbsp;i try to update it either is shows it is updated or while updating the screen goes black and I am not able update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Request you to tell whether the Graphics card issue has been resolved? if yes, what is the final solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if there is no solution then unfortunately i have to roll back to windows 8. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nikhil</p>

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your DYMO 450 twin turbo labelwriter&nbsp;only works with Windows 7 and lower version of Windows. It has something to do with the compatibility of drivers. Kindly check with the device manufacturer if there is a Windows 10 print driver available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

    <title>Windows 7 Won&#39;t Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Won&#39;t Update</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 Pro 64 bit SP1.&nbsp; I could not install updates and tried every solution listed all over the web.&nbsp; I spent several days trying everything I found in the forums.&nbsp; My profile also got corrupted, with the NTUSER.dat vanishing completely, so I
 tried everything to fix that too.&nbsp; Eventually, I gave up and formatted the drive and did a fresh install.&nbsp; I am an administrator user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update still hangs through the update program.&nbsp; When I attempt to download the convenience roll-up from the windows catalogue, it asks to install the add-on, so I do, then I approve it, but it just says the add-on fails to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Googling that message, off I go to the link for the "Fix-it" tool.&nbsp; It downloads fine, but when I try to install it, it says it can't finish because there is a problem accessing the server.&nbsp; The Internet is fine for searching, it activated fine, etc.&nbsp;
 I am not sure why it can't talk to the server for the Fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a complete loss.&nbsp; No matter what I do or what back door I try to find to those updates, my OS just refuses to do it.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; My computer has been basically down for weeks now and I am getting very behind with things
 I need to do for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Another step I took was to finally get the Convenience Roll Up through another computer.&nbsp; When I run it, it starts processing just fine, but when it gets to "searching for updates on this computer" it completely hangs just like using automatic update.&nbsp; It
 just won't take updates, automatically or manually.</p>

            Thanks VZ.&nbsp; The first link didn't work.&nbsp; The second uses the WUSA.&nbsp; Like everything else that uses the WUSA it also hangs when "searching for updates on this computer".&nbsp; I have tried turning the auto update off, but unfortunately, that did not work either.

</p><p>I did do a system scan before the format/fresh install and it said it repaired everything, but it didn't help.&nbsp; This time it says it didn't find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I have not transferred my files back or installed any programs, I am at a loss; it is a completely fresh install using the same media I used the first time I set it up, and had no problem..&nbsp; I tried the updates right after the O/S install finished,
 so I really didn't expect that.&nbsp; While I was trying to get WU to work, I did install some updated drivers from Dell, and that worked fine.</p>

            I got the one from that link installed.&nbsp; I also got the Convenience Roll Up kb 3125574 installed, but after reboot and finalizing the installation, Windows Update has been "checking" for over 1/2 hour, so that is still not working.&nbsp; I have it on manual
 right now.

<h2>            Windows Speech Recognition Annoyances</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong><span>Just some minor inconveniences which I'm having with Windows Speech Recognition.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>First, is it possible to change the activation phrase? Actually, I know it's possible - but is it possible to do that
 without breaking all these whatever blablabla terms of agreement Microsoft laid out? Sorry, but "start listening" just sounds lame. Something like "resume dictation" sounds much better in my opinion. I tried using the WSRmacros (Windows Speech Recognition
 Macros) but it doesn't seem to work (but it does get quite a lot of other jobs done).</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Second, I don't know why, but since I've upgraded to Windows 7, my speech recognition would turn off randomly when it's
 on standby (or 'sleeping' as how Microsoft calls it). I don't touch it at all and poof, it turns off - which I would have to manually turn back on again. Any suggestions for this as well?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Third, sometimes Speech&nbsp;Recognition&nbsp;would take a while to run a command, such as when I'd say something like, 'run [program]'
 it would take quite a while before the command goes through. Never had that much delay while I was running under Vista. Does it have something to do with WSRmacros not programed for 7's Speech Recognition?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any insight&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;these problems would be&nbsp;appreciated, thanks.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi Zyresic,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>You can change the activation phrase by using Macros. You will have to do some coding in XML. Refer this link for information:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wsrmacros/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Create an  'Advanced' Speech Macro&amp;version=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wsrmacros/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Create%20an%20%20'Advanced'%20Speech%20Macro&amp;version=1</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>For other problems, you can try to uninstall and reinstall Windows speech recognition program and check if it helps. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to start and type in “turn Windows features on or off”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now from the Windows features windows, uncheck Windows speech recognition.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To reinstall, check the option again in windows features.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Not sure what you mean; I have set up an Toshiba satellite 5sst B5273NR&nbsp; which has a touchscreen; it appears in Device Manager.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You could try signing in with administrator permissions, then start Device Manager.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In one of the menus, there is a "show hidden devices" option; does this reveal it? Also, in the same menu, you should find"scan for new devices" or similar; when you do this, does Windows find the hardware?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Two other options;<br />
- is the touchscreen powered by a Windows service, which is now stopped or disabled?<br />
&nbsp;- is the touch screen working perfectly; it is just that it is [accidentally?] disabled? Look for relevant options in Control Panel or. Settings.</p>
<p>this issue is comming after i upgrading windows 10 updates</p>

            Try selecting the hidden HID-compliant touch screen in Device Manager and uninstalling it.&nbsp; Then select the computer, at the top of the devices listed, and scan for new devices to see if it is now detected and installed properly.

<h2>            How to eliminate duplicates in playlists.</h2>
                    sometimes I drag an album to a playlist... creating duplicate songs.&nbsp; How can I easily identify.&nbsp; Or perhaps prevent - like iTunes asks if you want to copy duplicates

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>vbjnk,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you referring to Windows Media Player? Let me know if it is something else</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this happen only with a particular album?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Check the file Location and delete the duplicate entry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Play
 the album<strong>; Right click</strong> on the duplicate item\file and select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the&nbsp; <strong>File location</strong> and you may <strong>Delete the duplicate</strong> item</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Player is monitoring a folder and replacing the entries in your library that point to files in that folder. For example, you may have copied the files to a new folder but didn't
 delete the original files from the folder that is being monitored.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To prevent entries from being re-added to your library<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>1.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>Delete or move the files from the folder that is being monitored</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>Monitor Folders</strong> feature is useful for automatically updating your library when media information in monitored digital media files changes. However, you must be careful to keep the list of
 folders monitored by the Player up-to-date to avoid invalid entries in your library.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For more information on&nbsp;<strong>monitoring folder</strong>, refer the link below</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Add items to the<span>Windows</span> Media Player library</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Add-items-to-the-Windows-Media-Player-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Add-items-to-the-Windows-Media-Player-library</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue occurs for multiple albums try step 2</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You may want to<strong> Rebuild Windows Media Player Library database</strong>.
 To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You cannot view, add, or delete items in the library in Windows Media Player 11</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925718</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Prevent duplicate or invalid entries from being added to my library when I play music files</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you move digital media files on your computer, the file name and file path information remain unchanged in your library. Then
 when you select a file to play from its new location, a new entry is created in your library if the option to automatically add it to your library when it is played is selected. As a result of this, your library may quickly contain a large number of duplicate
 or invalid entries.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To prevent music files from being added automatically to your library<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>1.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>In Windows Media Player, on the<strong>Tools</strong> menu, click<strong>Options</strong>.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>2.</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>On the&nbsp;<strong>Player</strong> tab, clear the
<strong>Add music files to library when played</strong> check box.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>
&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>
&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Now, when you play
 any music files on your computer or from the Internet, the file will not be added automatically to your library.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>How am I supposed to import photos and videos in Win 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How am I supposed to import photos and videos in Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It seems the software to download and transfer pictures and movies sort of got left out om Win 10.&nbsp; I have quite a bit of stuff on my iPhone and am having a terrible time with it.&nbsp; I did a search and find references to Win 8.1 but not Win 10.&nbsp; There recommendations
 to use a variety of apps but I can't find any one who can say for sure they'll work with Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using Picasa, but it only finds pictures already on the computer, so that didn't help at all.&nbsp; I've tried a number of different options that are available when you first plug the phone in without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an HP Envy with an i7 chip.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to import some files - I didn't think it would be this much of a problem</p>
