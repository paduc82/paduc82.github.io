<h2>            Kids Corner - Unauthorized purchases made</h2>
                    
<p>Morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My daughter has been playing My Talking Tom through Kids Corner on my Nokia Lumia 635. This morning she suddenly had way more coins than she should have had, and upon looking in to it she has managed to buy coins through kids corner without our consent or
 it asking for a password. I am absolutely furious!! I was under the impression Kids Corner was supposed to be safe for my child to use, without internet access and without her being able to spend money! I'm still trying to figure out exactly how much she has
 managed to spent, but I know it's definitely not money we can afford to lose like that. I no longer feel my child can play any games on my phone now, as obviously it's way too easy to lose money. Incredibly disappointed (I've only had this phone for 2 weeks)
 in this phone and your software now. My 4 year old isn't a genius, if she can get around the 'safety features' that are supposed to make this feature safe to use for children then any child can!&nbsp;</p>

<p>In-app purchases in Kids Corner is possible when:</p>
<p>There is a PIN on the wallet</p>
<p>The child knows the PIN</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if the PIN is the same as used elsewhere, to unlock the phone(!), computer, house alarm etc, then it is likely that the child will try that when asked for a security code. Please rethink carefully -&nbsp;and ask the child what happened?</p>

<p>I think you underestimate 4 year olds.. My nephew just turned three and he know hiw way around my brothers iPad and phone like no other.&nbsp;As mentioned if you have a PIN on Wallet and it's the same as you use elsewhere it's not unlikely she knows this code
 and will try it anywhere a code is needed.</p>

                    I am using Publisher 2013 for a website and want to post a counter. I tried StatCounter.com Reports but I need to be able insert the code in the html of the page. I can't figure out a way to get to the hmtl or if someone has another web counter they have
 used that is free and they recommend I would be open to that. Thanks in advance.

deprecating the web building functionality</a> in Publisher as of Pub 2010. They took it a step further in Pub 2013 and among other things the

<p>I would bet that Frontier also has a built in web stats of some sort. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the script, sorry, you will have to figure that out yourself. Part of the reason I use Publisher to produce my sites is I did not want to learn how to code.</p>

<h2>            Why wont my PCH games play on IE&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can play PCH games&nbsp;on Edge but not all of them will play on IE.&nbsp; IE plays some of my games but the ones I really like are&nbsp;on Edge and&nbsp;wont play on IE. Some of them wont play on Chrome ether. I don't know very much about computers. So all of the other places
 I have looked&nbsp;into for&nbsp;advice, gives me all this technical&nbsp;stuff that I have no idea what they are talking about. I have windows 10 or 11&nbsp;and my protection plan says every thing is up to date. I hope what little bit of information I have given you about my
 computer is enough to help me with this problem. One more thing I have contacted Geek Squad and they were not able to solve this problem. Maybe this is just not possible to do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since only certain games works with Edge and Internet Explorer, looks like it's a compatibility issue with the browser that you are using. We highly recommend that you contact the game publisher for support.

<h2>            Lumia 950 XL on 14955 crashes when unlocking</h2>
                    <p>After updating to build 14955 (and also the previous build) my 950 XL tends to crashes during unlocking. It is happening very often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happen when pressing the unlock and also double tap to wake. The screen will turn on for a while (less than a second) then goes blank. Pressing other button will not do anything. I will need to wait for the phone to restart on its on or I will need
 to press lock+vol down combo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody face this issue or is it an isolated case. This usually happens when the battery is between 40-60%.</p>
<p>

            My phones battery drains when this happens and the sim area near the bottom of the phone gets really hot!

            <p>Yes, I got the same symptom too. After digging around, the fault lies with the battery. As the battery ages, there seems to be sudden power drops which cause the phone to freeze, especially when there's an increased power draw when waking up there phone.
 And as it worsens, phone will crash automatically when battery is below 40% frequently out of the blue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many workarounds without success, I had no choice but to change to a new battery. That solved everything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To those who face the same problem, change your battery. Good luck. </p>

<p>I also have this issue and I already tried 2 distinct batteries with same result.
<br />
Made an Hard Reset, Soft Reset, and used Windows Device Recovery Tool, and nothing: Result is the same, even using Insider versions of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Also, MS Phone Test Application shows no Hardware failures.<br />
<br />
My Lumia 950XL, crashes when unlocking using on/off button when battery is below 65%. Normally does this at 42-48%.
<br />
<br />
After pressing the on/off button for 10 seconds, phone reboots and I can continue using my phone normally.
<br />
Phone suddenly crashes again with black screen when battery is around 20%. - When this happens, phone overheats and drains all the battery.
<br />
<br />
Next, after forcing a reboot by pressing on/off button for 10 seconds, and connecting the phone to a PC, the Charging Test on MS Phone Test Application, shows a battery level of 4,8% and phone shows 19%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone at Microsoft is reading this, please do something. There are a lot of users experiencing this problem. If a file dump is needed by using Field Medic app, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Cheers from Portugal<br />

            This issue has deteriorated significantly for me to the point of it happening numerous times in a day. Really hoping a new battery will solve it..

<p>Thanks for putting this so eloquently. It is clearly something with battery monitoring and software attached to that, along with something odd that causes a silly amount of power drain when turning on the phone. For this, I have begun disabling anything
 on the unlock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fear that it is either an app or something that gets a read at that point. Out of interest who else has any of the following on their unlock screens?</p>

<p>I have turned off the "Battery Saver" and whilst this has not fixed the problem</p>

<p>Yes this is happening to&nbsp; me aswell, why won't Microsoft do anything to help ? Like an update ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;also my memory card keeps becoming unavailable, and needs repairing/scanning after a reboot, what's that all about ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;compatibility issues ?</p>

<p>I ended up switching platforms. Nokia 6.1 with the Microsoft launcher. Microsoft supports and updates the launcher on Android better than their own phone. It does not connect as well as Windows phone to all their services. ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found myself with no choice but do this as Microsoft announced&nbsp; support for their mobile platform ended in November 2017.</p>

<h2>            Setting a rolling monthly password</h2>
                    <p>Hi there community</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to set a rolling password that changes monthly / weekly on an Excel file that a user has to enter each time on opening the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally it would change every month (or week) to preset passwords that would be known by an Administrator.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Steve,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Setting a rolling password or a password that resets after a given time frame is not possible in Excel or any Office application. Since Passwords are meant to be user initiated
 they cannot be reset automatically after a set interval. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the above answers your query.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

<h2>            Should I Uninstall Office 365 Subscription after Installing Office 2019&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I did not renew my&nbsp;Office 365 subscription earlier this year. </p>
<p>Instead, I purchased and installed Office 2019 on the same computer and both appear, in my&nbsp;MS Account.
</p>
<p>Office 2019 shows as "Activated" and Office 365 as "Expired"</p>
<p>I have just noticed that when I use Excel&nbsp;or Word they show as Office 365 "Unlicensed Product" even though Office 2019 is Licensed and installed correctly</p>
<p>Should I uninstall 365 or leave both alone?</p>

            Hi Ataera
<br />
<br />Yes, you should definitely uninstall Office 365, to avoid file association conflicts and licencing issues . . .
<br />
<br />Use this tool from Microsoft to remove all remnants of the previous Office 365 Installation:

            <p>Thanks Mimmo57 - changing integer to variant in the dim statements and using a 'Do while' loop works.&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g., the input box does not clear until a number is entered.&nbsp; And Cancel is Not an option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks also for the Val(num1) ... otherwise 44 +&nbsp;44 = 4444 instead of 88.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>with an InputBox we have no difference if user click Cancel or click OK without&nbsp;inputs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want create a friendly&nbsp;end-user interface you&nbsp;must use a Form. There is easy the dialog management using&nbsp;many different controls&nbsp; and VBA.</p>

            Thanks Mimmo - I was practicing VBA coding in the standard module.&nbsp; In a form I think I could code the controls&nbsp;before_update event.&nbsp;

            <blockquote>In a form I think I could code the controls&nbsp;before_update event.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<br />
That enables you to validate whatever a user actively enters in individual text box controls, but it does not cater for a user skipping a control completely and leaving it Null.&nbsp; For that you also need appropriate code in the buttons' Click event procedures
 which examines each text box control, and, where appropriate, makes whatever the button is doing conditional on the text box controls not being Null.<br />

<h2>            Release 15&#58;22  - fix for word documents not saving properly - not fixed</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a problem saving and closing already saved documents with word asking me to 'save/save as' as if they were newly created documents. &nbsp;This seems to happen when documents are open for a while. &nbsp;The file has become corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issue was when opening a document it would come up with an error that there was not enough space in the start up disk - which is incorrect. Its a new laptop and there is 70% space remaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The release 15:22 was meant to fix these problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1). Does the release fix this bug on documents that were created prior to its installation? I am assuming it was meant to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or</p>
<p>
</p><p>2). Has the release simply failed to fix the bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3). Should I be doing back ups to an external hard drive if the files are corrupted?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the release has failed to fix the bug and it is corrupting files this makes office 365 not fit for purpose and dangerous to run - when will the new bug fix be released? &nbsp;What compensation will MS offer for work documents that becomes lost? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug should be a P1 and a new bug fix released asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>The problem is not a document issue, so earlier documents don't need fixing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As workarounds, you can use Time Machine to make automatic backups as your work, or you can Save As regularly, adding an incrementing number to the file name. This reduces the amount of work you can lose between saves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest opening <strong>Apple&gt;About This Mac</strong> and noting your model information. Then click on the
<strong>smiley-face</strong> icon in the upper-right corner of the Word window, choose
<strong>Tell Us What Can Be Better</strong> and describe the problem in detail. Include the model information. Then hopefully when they test on the same model, they'll get the same error and be able to finally solve it.</p>

            I don't want you to lose work, so I still recommend you save multiple versions. You can always delete the extras when you get to the final version. I routinely work that way on unstable files from clients. But of course, it's your call.

            <p>I work on the Word for Mac team and would like to get more information about this issue. Could you provide the Console logs when you see this dialog? You can use the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Launch Console&nbsp;from Applications/Utilities</p>
<p>2. Click on Clear Display&nbsp;so the logs you share are only related to your steps</p>
<p>3. Launch Word and&nbsp;get to the&nbsp;out of 'disk space' alert you are experiencing</p>
<p>4. Select all and Copy with Edit or Cmd-A, then Cmd-C</p>
<p>

<h2>            POP3 account&#58; show all emails as unread and with no folders</h2>
                    <p><span>I added an account to Outlook from Gmail. Initially it was with IMAP and it was working fine. Although, I couldn’t use the Categorise function. I talked to one of the Microsoft technicians and they recommende my to
 switch to POP3. I did that and all the emails come up as unread and I lost all my previous folders that I had in Gmail. Apart from that, it takes ages to download the emails and outlook constantly crashes. Do you have any idea how can I keep my folders and
 have the same status with my emails (read-unread)?</span></p>

            Pop only&nbsp;downloads&nbsp;the emails from the server, it does not include any folder information. Imap actually shows you whats on the server in real time. Also when you use pop, and the settings are set to delete the files from the server, it will remove them
 from gmails server. So when you go into the gmail website, they will most likely be gone. I would&nbsp;probably&nbsp;go back to imap. Now if your settings are set to leave the emails on the server, then you will still have them on the gmail site. Imap is usually the
 setup for gmail. I hope that helps :D

            Thank you for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>The only reason that I changed from IMAP to POP3 was the fact that I couldn't use the categorize function on the emails.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is this the default with IMAP, or am I doing something wrong?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there any other way to use the Caterorize function with my emails?</div>

            What version of outlook at you&nbsp;using? &nbsp;In outlook 2010 you can get them by going right clicking on the bar above your emails, it will&nbsp;probably&nbsp;say something like "arrange by: date" and stuff like that. That should bring up a small sub menu, from there
 you want to click on "view settings". This should bring up the&nbsp;advanced&nbsp;view window, from here click the button that says Columns. There should be a drop box that says something like "select available columns from", you want to click on that and choose "all
 post fields". From there you should see "categories" in the left window, you will want to click on it, so it's highlighted, and then click the "add" button. From there, hit ok a few times, and you should now have&nbsp;columns&nbsp;available :D

            I am using Microsoft 2010 Ultimate.
<div>I know how to add the categories (like from, subject, received, size, importance, icon) &nbsp;on the top. This is not my issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My problem is focused on the Email tab only ( the following function work normally in the Calendar tab).</div>
<div><br />
<div>My problem is that I can not organize my emails in categories. To be more precise - the square that has red,orange,green and blue colors inside. It does not appear in the ribbon. If I make it to appear it does not work!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other problem, is the flag status! It only allow me to add a flag or just remove it when normally it has more options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is the a way to solve the above problems?</div>

            Unfortunately in Outlook 2010 you can't use&nbsp;categories&nbsp;on the ribbon. The thing i mentioned before will allow you to use&nbsp;categories, but red is the only color it will let you use. I don't know why they changed this in 2010, but it looks like it's be design.
 You can use pop if you like to get the&nbsp;categories&nbsp;back, but you will loose the list of imap folders you have. Sorry to for the bad news :(&nbsp;

<h3> annie909  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open word document after virus scan error&#58; product necessary to open the file is not available on my computer.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> Can't open files in 2007 after virus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hi guys - I recently had a full on virus on the computer.&nbsp; The virus has been removed but it has changed things on the computer and moved somethings around.<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 and have been running Office 2007 on it.&nbsp; I can open Word 2007 and create a new doc in Word 2007 but when I just went to open an old word file from My Docs, I discovered all the symbols for my word docs have turned to a little orange symbol
 which if I click on the document associated with the symbol, the word doc won't open.<br />
<br />
A window comes up for Office 2010 and says the product necessary to open the file is not available on my computer.&nbsp; The virus seems to have converted my Word 2007 files to only being opened with 2010?&nbsp; How do I convert them back?
<br />
<br />
Thankyou</p>

            <p>CCleaner if you have run the registry option it can cause problems, the temp file cleaner is fine</p>
<p>Your malaware apps, if these are all versions that are installed for real time scanning, as apposed to you simply opening the program to scan, will cause conflicts with each other.</p>
<p>Registry cleaners should never be used as they can and do cause loss of win finctionality or other program functionality by incorrectly modifying the registry or deleting registry entries.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The //BUILD conference proudly announced Microsoft Edge as the new name for the next generation browser that was previously only known by its codename, Project Spartan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In case there’s any confusion, Project Spartan and Microsoft Edge are one and the same browser.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In Build 10074, it still appears within the operating system with the name “Project Spartan”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can expect it to appear with its new name, Microsoft Edge, in a future build.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So to find Microsoft Edge in the current build, just look for “Project Spartan” in the Start menu, or by searching on the term “Project Spartan”.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>Spanish Grammar Proofing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john 92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spanish Grammar Proofing</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased office for mac (2011) and use it to write documents in both English and Spanish. However, it only recently came to my attention that this version of Office does not include grammar proofing for Spanish. When buying the product I assumed,
 as you would, that seeing as this feature was available in earlier versions of Microsoft office (I had Microsoft office Word 2007 for PC) that this feature would also be available in this later version. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know whether or not a language pack is available for this version of Word through Microsoft which would enable grammar check in Spanish? Alternatively, are their any trustworthy third party applications which can check Spanish grammar in Word
 documents? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>
<p>
</p><p>John :)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Joe,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I'm aware that Mac Office comes with spell check for Spanish amongst other features however noticed it didn't have the full set of feature which other languages such as English, French, German and Italian do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply too Bob,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cmd Y &#40;Repeat Replace&#41; stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel g. grau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cmd Y &#40;Repeat Replace&#41; stopped working</h2>
                    It used to be that I could initiate a search operation, advance through the results with Cmd G (this still works), do a single replacement and then go through the rest of the document's content by pressing Cmd G (Find Next) if I did not want a replacement,
 or Cmd Y (Repeat Replace) if I did want it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, at the point where I would normally press Cmd Y to effect a replacement, this shortcut takes me instead to the Find dialog (the sidebar, if no dialog was open, or the Advanced F&amp;R dialog if this was open). The same thing happens if I select Repeat
 Replace through the Edit menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Curiously, this new behavior is happening in my older versions of Word as well (2004 &amp; v.X). I guess this points to a System problem, but I was not able to find a solution. I've checked shortcut assignments in the Keyboard panel in System Preferences,
 and taken out all shortcuts. Still, the behavior persists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone reproduce this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Daniel</div>

            Just finished using ⌘-Y a few minutes ago works like a Champ. <br />
<br />
If these applications are on the same Computer. Then sounds like a Computer issue.<br />
<br />
Have you tried:<br />
<ol>
<li>turning off the Machine(s) involved then turning back on.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Repairing Permissions<br />
<br />

</li><li>Try restarting Office so it bypasses Preferences.<br />
<br />
</li><li>If your using Os's that require DVD insert DVD then restart with C key down<br />
When restarted from DVD use Disk Utilities. And Repair both Hard Drive and Permissions<br />
Don't waste time verifying if. Nothing is fixed it verified anyway.<br />
<br />
</li><li>For Lion (OSX.7.x), Mountain Lion (OSX.8.x) , and Mavericks (OSX.9.x).<br />
Then restart an computer and Hold ⌘-R down. (Recovery Disk)<br />
Go to Disk Utility&nbsp; Repair Drive and Remissions again don't waste time verifying.<br />
If any issues with Drive were Found, running again until comes back squeaky clean.</li><li>Go to in Word View Menu The choose Tool bars and Menus:<br />

            Thanks, Rich. Perhaps <i>Cmd Y</i> never worked properly over here and somehow I've got this lingering idea that it did.

<div>I was about to suggest using the <i>Cmd G/Cmd Y</i>&nbsp;combo to the poster whose

            I’m not sure I know exactly what you mean by “Repeat Replace.” Command-Y should repeat the most recent thing you did (cut, copy, paste, insert Autotext, whatever it was). &nbsp;Is that what you expect from Command-Y?

            Yes, Jim, that's exactly it.
<div><br />
<div>And "Repeat Replace" is what the <i>Edit</i>&nbsp;menu shows after you do a single replacement.&nbsp;But repeat the replacement, it does not. However, Phillip says it works for him, if I read him correctly.</div>

            And I must'a caught a nasty virus that spread to all Macs. Jeez...

<div>Perhaps we are misinterpreting what "Repeat Replace" means. It might stand for "Repeat the opportunity to do a Replace operation." As they say, "This is by design."</div>

    <title>Custom Form VBA Not Working After Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom Form VBA Not Working After Update</h2>
                    I am having trouble with using VBA to open a website in the latest version of Outlook (1705 / 16.0.8201.2102, installed from 365 ProPlus). I have a custom form that has several buttons on it, with code that looks like this.<br />
<br />
Function AdminForm_Click()<br />
<br />
Set Web = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")<br />
Web.Visible = TRUE<br />
Web.Navigate "http://intranet/admin/forms/adminform.asp"<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
So when the button is clicked, Internet Explorer opens up to the specified URL. This code has been working for 17 years but now in 16.0.8201.2102, when you click the button it does nothing. I found a workaround, in which you can open the Developer ribbon, click
 "Design This Form", and then click "Run This Form". After that the form relaunches and the button works as expected.<br />
<br />
This problem has come up on several computers all at once, and on all of them it was after the update to 16.0.8201.2102. Happens on both Windows 10 and Windows 7. I have tried it in Safe Mode, and it does not work there either. I have used the Office 2016 Deployment
 Tool to downgrade to 16.0.8201.2075, and confirmed that it works correctly in that version.<br />
<br />
So is this a bug in 16.0.8201.2102? Or has there been a change to where I need to be doing something differently? Is there better code for launching a URL from a custom Outlook form? Like I said I've been using this code since Outlook 2000, and kind of half-waiting
 for it to break with each new version.

<h2>            Enable alt &#43; s to send in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    In Microsoft Office 2013 I normally hit alt + s to send an email. &nbsp;But about 2 weeks ago alt + s stopped working in that way and now brings up the style selection menu for Windows 8. &nbsp;How can I reset so that alt + s works the way I want; to send emails?

<p>You need to check with the publisher of the app to see if they plan to release an app for Windows Phone 8 or not. No one else can answer that question.</p>

    <title>New onset cursor lag in Outlook 2016 for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New onset cursor lag in Outlook 2016 for Mac</h2>
                    Anyone experience cursor lag when using Outlook 2016 for Mac, particularly with the delete key used for backspacing? -- or have any remedies?&nbsp; The problem is occurring in a new MacBook Pro, most recent Outlook version 16.9, and I think (but I'm not sure)
 is co-incident with an upgrade to High Sierra two weeks ago (of note: I have no problems with other programs in Office Professional Plus [e.g., Word 2016] and no problem with Outlook 2016 in Windows10 [I run both operating systems of my MacBook Pro]).&nbsp; I'm
 working with Microsoft support and with them have run several simple diagnostics, to no avail (waiting to hear back from Support for their next suggestions).&nbsp; &nbsp;This isn't a problem with a cursor that glides; it's a problem of inconsistent and sometimes delayed
 response to keystrokes on my laptop.&nbsp;

            <p>Hold down the power button until the device shutsdown, then press again to restart.&nbsp; You should see logos (Samsung, probably, Windows Mobile, and maybe your mobile operator) at boot up,&nbsp; If the screen just lights up already in whatever app you were in last
 when you powered off, you didn't hold power down long enough.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, there might be a "reset" hole somewhere on the device you poke with a paper clip or stylus, or you can just remove and reinsert the battery.</p>
