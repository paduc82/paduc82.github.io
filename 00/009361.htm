<h2>            How to select from a drop-down list of forms.</h2>
                    <p>I am part of a applications lab which is in dire need of a database.&nbsp; We work with paints of many different colors. What I want to do is to track the entire process - from mixing the paint to testing on walls. Right now I want to track in what type of mixer
 the paint was mixed in. We have several different mixers, and each sample of paint can be mixed in several one or several of them. I have created a form for each of those mixers since they have different parameters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how to enable the user to select (from a drop-down) which mixer they used. That mixer's form would open and the user could enter specific data. I'm not sure if you can have a drop-down list of forms. Do I accomplish this by macro, or something
 else?</p>

<p>First, the success of any database is based on a properly normalized table structure. In your case, it sounds like you need a Mixer table. I would suspect that every Mixer has some common characteristics and some that are specific to each Mixer. That would
 call for a structure like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblMixer</p>
<p>MixerID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>MixerName</p>
<p>MfgID (FK)</p>
<p>other info specific to Mixers in general</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblMixerA</p>
<p>MixerID (PK Number&gt;Long Integer)</p>
<p>Info specifc to mixer A</p>
<p>
</p><p>tblMaufacturer</p>
<p>MfgID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>MfgName</p>
<p>other mfg info</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you would have an unbound form with a combobox bound to tblMixer. Once you select the Mixer it would open up a form bound to tblMixer. On that form would be a subform control. When the user selects the Mixer, the subform SourceObject would be
 set to the form for the specific table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to answer your question specifically, a combobox is generally based on a table. So if you needed to choose from a list of items, you would make a table of those items.</p>

<p>You have a list (a single table) of Mixers, I presume?</p>
<p>I would expect something like </p>
<p>mixerID, mixerName, capacity, etc.</p>
<p>Probably a table of MixerUse: mixerID, startTime, endTime, paintSampleID, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’d also expect a table something like MixerParameters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, a table that connects the two, say JoinMixersToParameters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I might produce a single MixerForm that has all the parameters, enabling only those applicable to the Mixer of interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you have the forms already, so use the mixerID and mixerName as the source for a combo box, and write some VBA to open the form that’s applicable.</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. In your setup, is tblManufacturer necessary? Could that information not be included in tblMixerA? Below you can see how I had this set up initially. tbl3MixPhase does not have the individual mixer names as they are stored in tbl3MixerNames.
 I am also somewhat confused by the need of the unbound form - couldn't the form bound to "tblMixer" be opened (removing the need for the blank form + combo box) have a sub-form bound to the value of the combo box?</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since each mixer I have in lab have different parameters, I am not sure if your suggestion would work. Are you suggesting that I create one table with all the parameters as field names, and for a particular printer, only show which parameters are relevant?
 How would that be better than having individual forms for each mixer with the relevant parameters there?<br />

<p>Can multiple mixers have the same manufacturer? If so, then it would be better to have a table of manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use a bound form with an unbound search combo to select the mixer. The reason I prefer the unbound form is it makes sure you don't accidently change any data until you have the data retrieved.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>The Mixers table should include a column for the form name relevant to the mixer.&nbsp; You can then set up the combo box as follows:<br />
<br />
Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cboMixer<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT MixerID, FormName, Mixer FROM Mixers ORDER BY Mixer;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0cm;0cm;8cm<br />
<br />
The code in its AfterUpdate event procedure would be:<br />
<br />
Dim strForm As String<br />
<br />
strForm = Me.cboMixer.Column(1)<br />
DoCmd.OpenForm strForm, WindowMode:=acDialog<br />
<br />
Opening the form in dialogue mode means it has to be closed (or at least hidden) before the user can return to the calling form.&nbsp; Code execution is paused when a form is opened in dialogue form, so any subsequent code in the calling procedure can, if necessary,
 process data entered by the user into the dialogue form.<br />
<br />
As regards the design of the mixer forms, if you follow Scott's model, because the table for each mixer models a sub-type of the mixers (super) type, which has columns for the attributes common to all mixers,&nbsp; you can base each form on a query which joins the
 two tables, rather than using a subform.&nbsp; Entering data into a type hierarchy is one of the few instances where, because the relationship type is one-to-one, data can be entered into a single form rather than a form/subform.&nbsp; In your case the forms would then
 include a subform for the phase data.&nbsp; You'll find examples in TypeHierarchy.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly.<br />
<br />
This little demo file uses a simple model of personnel in an academic institution to illustrate how a type hierarchy is modelled.&nbsp; In this you'll note how the students form includes a subform for the courses taken by the student, analogous to your phase data.<br />

            In my case all of my mixers are from different manufacturers. Regardless, would you mind taking a look at the relationship layout in my earlier comment and tell me if that is a sound design? Thanks.

<p>Could the situation exist that you might have mixers from the same manufacturer? If so, then there should be a manufacturers table. One of the principles of a relational database is to eliminate redundancy. This is one of the reasons why you should have
 one mixers table with info common to all mixers then separate tables for each specific mixer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So your screen shot looks OK. I would be interested in seeing what the parameters of a mixer are.</p>

</p><p>Re the relationship layout:</p>
<p>I’m astonished that Ken hasn’t already commented on using the names of the mixers (tbl3MixN) in the names of the tables… while he will mention Codd’s laws, I will simply say that “it gives me a creepy feeling”.</p>
<p>[I also don’t prepend “tbl” to what I know is a table.]</p>

<p>Is it possible that the Mix phases are where the characteristics of each mixer are related?</p>

<p>I haven't commented because, on the information provided by the OP, there is no way of knowing whether those tables legitimately model types or illegitimately model attributes.&nbsp; If the former, the most I can say is that the table names are inadequate descriptors
 of the types being modelled.&nbsp; I'd need to see the totality of the model, with all columns of all tables visible to comment further.<br />
<br />
What I said in my reply was in the context of Scott's suggested model, not the OP's reply, which was not available when I drafted my reply.<br />

<h2>            Spellchecker is utterly useless</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The spellchecker in Word 2013 is completely crazy - it tells me things are good to go when they are quite obviously not good to go.</p>
<p>Here's a good example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/423498bc-b385-4abb-a84c-bfdc1d3223bd" /></p>
<p>Now - I don't care what settings down in the bowels of the widget box might lead to this - this is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE FEATURE. If these words are not correctly spelled, then the spellchecker needs to tell me so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible exception is when I have specifically added these words to my custom dictionary (in which case it should probably highlight them somehow anyway to let me know they are user-defined in case spelling errors have accidentally been added to
 the dictionary).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then getting back to the bowels of the widget boxes, if I go here:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed3a6e2a-e014-46c3-a2f5-85690171137c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>then I can get to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0d3e3b32-d443-4346-9b8a-25a57957f6cf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, apart from the silly double negative (tick the box to not check spelling) ... this does actually solve the problem BUT ONLY if I select the individual words or a small number of paragraphs around this sentence and change that tick box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do a select-all and change the tick box, it does NOT work - the words remain undetected and when I revisit the dialog box above the check box has re-ticked itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select less than a full page of the document it seems to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select more than about a page, it does not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the program only acknowledges that I have unchecked that box if I have selected a small enough number of characters before unchecking the box.</p>

</p><p><strong>How is this even remotely sensible? </strong>It does not matter to me that there may be some word maestro out there who could see why it behaves in this way... it simply should not behave in this way. If I select text and click a box that say "please
 spellcheck this text" then <strong>IT SHOULD SPELLCHECK THAT TEXT. NO EXCUSES.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I ask it to check my spelling, then it should tell me when there are errors. If there are errors, it should not tell me I am "good to go". It's like a mechanic letting me drive off knowing I have loose wheel nuts even when I have specifically asked "are
 all the wheel nuts tight?" because for some reason he or she had decided that the left front wheel was exempted from the query.</p>

</p><p>I would really love to know how the most-used word processor on the planet can have such a ridiculous bug shipped as a standard feature?&nbsp;</p>

            When the "Do not check spelling or grammar" property has been applied to text, you have to select that text (<strong>Ctrl+A</strong> to Select All) before clearing the check box if you want it to be checked. Whenever you select more than a page of text
 in Word almost any setting in any dialog will appear shaded (neither checked nor clear). Sometimes this indicates mixed formatting, but in many cases it is just a result of Word's inability (or refusal) to be explicit about formatting for large quantities
 of text. If the box is shaded, just click it until it's clear. And it's a good idea also to disable "Detect language automatically," which is usually more trouble than it's worth. For more on the spelling checker, see

            <p>Thank you Suzanne for your replay.</p>
<p>My apologies - I must not have explained it properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear I do exactly what you have suggested. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my point - I select all text using <strong>Ctrl+A </strong>and then change the setting. It completely ignores me. And when it (i.e. the "do not check spelling" option) is neither checked nor unchecked (indicating that there are mixed results in the
 selection) I click it until it is definitely unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it completely ignores this and still does not pick up the errors in the text. If I then select only the incorrect text and go through the process again, I will find that the box is checked again - even though I just did a select-all and unchecked the
 box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can make it pick up the errors is to select a small amount of text (e.g. just one word or a few paragraphs) and then uncheck the box. (Then it will uncheck and stay unchecked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is obviously only useful if I already know where the errors are and I just want to make them show up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I won't in general know where the errors are, I want to use <strong>Ctrl+A
</strong>so it shows up the errors everywhere in the document. That is surely what a spellchecker should do?</p>

            <p>Yes, the box is not checked. Despite the cute logic puzzle from Microsoft, putting a tick next to a "not", I managed to think it through and uncheck the box and click ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I then go back to the document the text is still not registering as incorrect. If I select a small amount of text around the incorrect words, then I find that the box is checked again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my point. I select all (Ctrl+A) text and uncheck the box. When I then go back to the specific text (the text I know is misspelled) I find that the box is checked again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. it ignores me when I uncheck the box.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you Doug - I'll email you the document at the gmail address above once I have removed anything confidential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't checked for different proofing languages, but I would say it should not matter whether it was in different versions of English or not - this came up because a staff member was mortified to find a couple of glaring spelling errors after sending
 a document even though he was sure he had checked the document. The errors in question were errors in every dialect of English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure enough when I got a copy it said "good to go". The errors were not underlined or flagged in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select all and instruct the program to check everything, it should check everything. It's not the user's job to check that the "all" in "select-all" really means ALL. &nbsp;All can only mean all.&nbsp;It should not be a trick question. I should not have to second
 guess whether it really checked all the spelling or not - that is worse than useless!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(maybe a dialog box could pop up to say <em>"ah hah - fooled you... we checked everything except the bit you copied in from that email from the UK - you should have known that may have been in a different proofing language even though you have never heard
 of that!"</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - let me know if you can see why it behaves as described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again - good of you to look into this for me.</p>

            Hi KarlBorq,<br />
<br />
We're glad to help you! "No Sim" message means, the phone won't detect the sim, as sometimes the phone is being dropped accidentally. It's good to know that sim has been replaced, but please make sure that the sim is inserted properly and not losing its contact
 (copper connector for sim). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can also test your sim in other phone for isolation.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
<br />
<p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon seeing the first link that you've provided in your post, Microsoft already announced that Office products will not supported EPS files. The link also mentioned the reason why Microsoft turned off the ability to insert EPS files in Office programs. We
 understand that you're the one who created those EPS files, but not everyone who creates EPS files have the intention of using it for work. This means that their is still a security risk for other users. This is why Microsoft disabled it in the first place.
 It is best that you follow the workaround found in the same article or you can post this concern in our
<strong><a href="https://word.uservoice.com/forums/304924-word-for-windows-desktop-application" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Word UserVoice page</a></strong>. This page is used by users to post feedback and suggestions to Word. If you want to have an option
 to insert EPS files to Word again, we suggest that you post it in that page so that our developers can look into implementing it for you. After posting your suggestion, please share your submission here in the Answers Community so that other users can upvote
 it.<span><br />

<h2>            E71 Messenger</h2>
                    I've installed and am using Messenger on the E71 and it works great apart from one small thing. Is there any way getting the phone to vibrate or just make a smaller noise when the IM comes in? At the moment it makes the usual MSN ding dong which is far
 too loud and attention grabbing!<br />
Can I change this sound or just get it to vibrate instead??<br />
<br />

<div>- if i set the pwd to the db i can still see the data in MsQuery but when I close it down so that it would return the data to Excel - it says that it's not a valid Password!!! (that's despite the fact that MsQuery returned all the necessary data from the
 db)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have a clue what is happening and how to fix that?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, this is what I do:</div>
<div>- i've got two identical .accdb apart from the fact that one is but the other isn't pwd protected</div>
<div>- I go Data&gt;From Other Sources&gt;From MsQuery&gt;MsAccess database&gt; and then I either pick the protected or unprotected db. If i chose the protected, it obviously prompts for the pwd. I enter the pwd and it's all fine this far - i can build my sql in there
 and refresh/pull the data into MsQuery BUT</div>
<div>- when i do File&gt;Return Data to Excel (after prompting for the range to insert the table) it fires: "ODBC Microsoft Access Driver Login Failed" "Not a valid password."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it impossible to pull data from pwd protected .accdb into Excel?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help/advise would be greatly appreciated as I've been struggling with this and surfing the web for a solution to no avail for quite a few desperate weeks now...</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on my research, you’d better save your accdb file to old version (mdb file). Then the problem will be solved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or just use this accdb file without password protected also will solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>That statement is not accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reality is that you can install Windows 10 Insider Preview on any PC as long as the minimum requirements are met. You won't be able to activate it without a license but nothing prevents you from installing it.</p>
<p>You can even personalize the new copy if installed offline.</p>

<p>Firstly, I am running windows 10 which is permanently activated (digital license)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, YES, my pc covered the minimum requirements for windows 10, but the last time I install Windows 10 Insider Preview Build, I installed the first 19H1 build and it destroyed this PC totally. When It crashed during the installation, this PC cannot
 read the hard drive anymore, it stuck at the name of manufacturer of this device (Lenovo)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, I did backed up, but in the situation I mentioned above, backup couldn't help to recover this device. I had to make a big repair on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can my PC WIP Build?&nbsp; Or at least can anyone tell me the minimum requirements for 19H1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            You said you installed Preview how? or did you just let it join by way of the settings? as for my experience that system is at the bottom of the spec's and I would leave it with the current Public build, as it will always be slow.&nbsp;

</p><p>Secondly, YES, my pc covered the minimum requirements for windows 10, but the last time I install Windows 10 Insider Preview Build, I installed the first 19H1 build and it destroyed this PC totally. When It crashed during the installation, this PC cannot
 read the hard drive anymore, it stuck at the name of manufacturer of this device (Lenovo)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thirdly, I did backed up, but in the situation I mentioned above, backup couldn't help to recover this device. I had to make a big repair on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can my PC WIP Build?&nbsp; Or at least can anyone tell me the minimum requirements for 19H1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minimum requirements tell not much. Some machines may have some bizarre components in them that make it difficult to install preview builds. Even some very common Intel cpu's may have blocking cpu steppings and models that make it impossible to install
 the preview build. This happened very recently with build 18342 and MSFT released another build 18343 one day later for those Intel cpu's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have also seen that your machine went wrecked upon installation of a preview build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install another preview build is your call. Back up and keep your rescue media within reach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>
        </p>

<h2>            What is the filename where outlook stores email account details&#63;</h2>
                    I have a normal ISP mail account and a Live mail account.&nbsp; Both link into Outllok 2007.&nbsp; I move from business to business as a consultant and sometimes have problems reciving mail on a client system. I had some changes made to my ISP outgoing server details
 and have had continuing problems ever since.&nbsp; I want to go back to a system backup ad get the old details, but do not know where to look, what file name or directory.

<p>Can I add a question ...</p>
<p>I am trying to use outlook.com on my desktop using outlook which I prefer for managing e mails .. I filter my incoming mails with Mailwasher. It needs incoming and outgoing server address to complete the link but I have an IMAP account with outlook.com and
 I cannot find the right details anywhere. Where can I find this information?</p>

<h2>            Office Home &#38; Student 2016 for Mac License &#47; Activation Error after Mojave</h2>
                    <p>Several months ago I bought my new macbook pro from an Apple original premium reseller, which was running in High Sierra OS at that time. Along with that, I also purchased the Office Home &amp; Student 2016 for Mac from the same store, and activated the program
 in the store right away. Things were going fine until I decided to update my macOS to Mojave. After the upgrade, when I start the Office program, it showed as if I haven't activated the program and when I try to activate it again, the office cannot find my
 license anywhere, although I have inputed the correct Microsoft account. I even have tried to reinstall the program and used my Product Key (that I received upon the purchase), and still the office cannot find my License anywhere. any suggestion?</p>

<h2>            Sharing OneNote notebooks without SMS verification</h2>
                    <pre><p>I have already contacted Microsoft general help, they directed me to you. I can't find a topic where this issues is resolved without the need for a mobile phone number, can you please help?</p><p /><p>I am trying to share a One Note notebook with colleagues. I was prompted to create a new folder on One Drive, which I did. The folder is, by default, only viewable by me. I am trying to make the folder accessible to all of my colleagues so that they can see and contribute to the notebook I have saved in there. I do not have a work mobile and I do not wish to connect my personal mobile to my work Microsoft account. (I also cannot ask my colleagues to use their personal mobile numbers to verify their accounts - I'm not sure if this will be an issue yet but I will need a way around this also if that's the case). 

When I add a colleagues email and then click "share" I get a message saying "sharing from this account has been temporarily blocked, please verify your account information."

Using One Note is a new thing to us all, it's a great tool but I need to be able to set it all up with my colleagues with minimum fuss. I will already have to ask them all to create a Microsoft account, they will all use their work email addresses to make the account and I cannot ask them to use their personal emails or mobile numbers to verify these accounts. Can you please offer an alternative? Will my colleagues also need to verify their accounts or will it just be me as the owner of the shared folder? If it will just be me I can offer a personal email account to verify with (I would rather not be mixing my personal accounts with work though!!) Is it not possible to verify through the email address I have already provided? This is an official University of Bradford email address if that helps?</p></pre>

<div>Can DialogSheets from older worksheets be edited?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I'm revising a worksheet that was done for us by an outside firm in 1999 which uses several macros and two DialogSheets. I can Show the dialogs and use them in the related functions (written as Functions rather than Subs for some reason, even when they neither
 receive nor return values), but I can't find how to access them to edit them. Could they be locked and hidden with a password? Or maybe they're just not accessible in Excel 2011? Perhaps it would be easier to just recreate them with UserForms, which I hope
 are functionally equivalent to DialogSheets.

<h2>            Embedded calendar not displaying correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have embedded an Outlook calendar on a simple webpage. It has been working fine until recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now, all-day events are spanning two days and the start time is shown as the day before. Take a look below for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ca2c768-af23-4c7c-8969-bdf5f614e13b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ca2c768-af23-4c7c-8969-bdf5f614e13b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>On the actual calendar in Outlook, we get it displaying over only one day and starting on the correct day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description. The all-day events are spanning two days and the start day is the day before on a webpage.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this all-day event show as one day and the starting on the correct day on the Outlook client (this calendar works fine in Outlook client). To narrow down this issue, please go to
<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>&nbsp;(if you are using Office 365 account) to check if this calendar show correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, may I know what is the "</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">simple webpage</span><span>" you mentioned? Is it Outlook Web App or other website? Or could you tell us the detailed steps that you embedded calendar to the
 simple webpage?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

    <title>Unable to run Excel after install of Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sue bedingfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to run Excel after install of Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I can access all the other Office applications but when I run Excel it asks me whether I want to allow it to make changes and when I say Yes I get the error message "we're sorry, but Excel has run into an error that is preventing it from working correctly"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can do a quick repair which has no effect and the online repair does an uninstall and then tells me that I need to get a later version of Windows. (I am running Windows 8 Pro)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can uninstall successfully and reinstall Office 365 but always with the same results. I am now starting to get frustrated.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other bit of information. On the first install I could open Excel but it crashed whenever I tried to open a document or create a new document (as did Word). I know how to disable addins to get around that, but need to get Excel working first. Any help
 will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Kies is a good example of the problem.&nbsp; Although i don't think that posting on that support forum would be as good, as it is always Outlook integration that the common factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example I've have the problem with kies, (all versions), and Outlook 2013.&nbsp; In Kies the problem appears when setting up the sync, and you click on any Outlook item that you want to sync.&nbsp; (A would assume this is at the vary first attempt of a program
 to interface with Outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>unsuccessful attempts to fix include clean reinstall of all the various products involved, running "regsrv ole23.dll", and i think there is a Microsoft "fix it for me' download for this error that I ran too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These did fix the issue when the client program is MS Office related, but not for third party programs.</p>

<p>Hi Oz,<br />
<br />
Regarding the situation, I suggest you try creating a new login key chain or updating it with your new password. Here is the article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">If your Mac keeps asking for the login keychain password</a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Change to another network environment, and check the outcome.<br />
2. Does the issue happen to all users or some specific users in your organization?<br />
3. Confirm with your administrator if ADFS is enabled for your Office 365 tenant.<br />
If so, you can troubleshoot referring to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3015526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Let us know if there is any update.<br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 - POP account setup issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas efthymiou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 - POP account setup issue</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today at work I reset to factory settings a&nbsp;<strong>Toshiba Portege Laptop z30-c-135</strong>&nbsp;after a failed windows update. On the laptop I had installed&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016</strong>&nbsp;and it was working fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reset I reinstalled Microsoft Office Home and attempted to setup again my work email (a pop account type) in Outlook 2016 (<strong>version 1706, Build 8229.2073</strong>) unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I executed the following steps from auto account setup wizard:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I entered my email address and checked "Let me set up my account manually".</li><li>In choose account type I clicked on POP.</li><li>I entered POP account settings for the email address and press connect. (the settings were double checked)</li><li>In the pop-up window I entered the username and password and clicked OK.</li><li>Message appears&nbsp;<strong>"Something went wrong and Outlook couldn't set up your account. Please try again. If the problem continues, contact your email administrator"</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>I noticed that the auto account setup windows was different from the last time that I setup the same email account without any issues. Most probably Microsoft updated auto account setup windows in the last office update and something went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I also tried thunderbird on the same laptop and it was working with POP and IMAP settings without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Informations that might help:- Microsoft Office Home and Business 2016 has the latest updates and my mail server is a Postfix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did someone else experienced the same problem in Outlook 2016 and resolved it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hi Sunny,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, you mean that the registry doesn’t exist. It’s expected behavior so you need to add the registry key in to local client machine. Please try to add the registry as below steps and captures:
</p>
<ol>
<li>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security] and right click in blank place. New and choose DWORD (32-bit) Value.</li><li>Paste the value name "EnableRoamingFolderHomepages" (Rename) and value data “2” (Modify).</li><li>Ok </li></ol>

ITxGamer</a>. I understand that you can't play YouTube videos on your Lumia 710 even using different apps. What exactly is happening when you try to play videos? Did you get any error messages? Is there sounds coming out, but without video? Have you tried it
 on the web browser? Are you using WiFi connection? You may also try resetting the phone, but before you do that, make sure you have backup everything to avoid data loss.
