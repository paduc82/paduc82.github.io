<h2>            Windows wants a driver for my DVD drive but i can&#39;t find one</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.<br />
I was trying to install Windows 7 Professional 32 bit on a HP Pavilion dv7-2070eg last week.</p>
<p>During setup Windows told me it needs drivers for the DVD drive (according to Everest Home Edition a LG Electronics HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT20L ATA Device.)</p>
<p>I was trying to find drivers for it, but so far i wasn't able to find anything useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, does anyone know where i can find the appropriate drivers or how i can install Windows without using a third-party driver for this drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Seems the image i got was corrupted. I got another one from MSDNAA and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi s5340409,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. What type of installation are you trying to perform, is it a Custom Installation or an Upgrade installation?</span></p>
<p><span>b. How are you trying to perform the installation, is it through a DVD, USB or through a downloaded file?</span></p>
<p><span>I believe you are performing a clean installation booting from DVD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We usually come across this error message if the CD/DVD drive is incompatible with Microsoft's AHCI driver (msahci.sys).</span></p>
<p><span>To work around this issue, disable AHCI mode for your disk controller in the system BIOS. Typically the controller has to be changed from AHCI mode to "IDE" or "ATA" mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Access the below link for more information:

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Yes, i'm trying to perform a clean install from DVD. I'll try to change the BIOS settings, but this being a Laptop the BIOS settings are kinda limited.</p>
<p>If this fails i'll try what Kevin Hau posted.</p>
<p>And if that fails, too, i'll see where i can get an USB stick that's big enough to perform the Installation from there.</p>
<br />
<p>Thanks for the suggestions, i'll come back and report what worked when i had the time to try it.</p>
<br />
<p>Edit: no BIOS settings for the drive (i didn't find any). The drivers don't seem to work either.</p>
<p>I was about to try shinjiteimasu idea (from Friday, November 13, 2009 3:56 AM) but i can't find out who made the drivers for either the board or the SATA or IDE controllers ...</p>
<p>I try it with the drivers Windows Vista uses for the controller right now (i'll simply copy the mshdc.inf to the flash drive), if that doesn't work either the last opinion would be to look for a Flash drive...</p>
<br />
<p>Edit 2: It didn't work. (Windows found it and saw it as legitimate driver for the controllers, but was unable to install it ...)</p>

<p>That's the right computer, but they don't list drivers for either the controllers nor the drive itself.</p>
<p>(I've been there twice already. HPs website was the first place i looked for those drivers.)</p>

                    Hi I was trying to use UAC trust (64bit) on my windows 8 (64bit) laptop but every time I put the name and path in the box I get the message<br />
"Please provide a 'name' for the shortcut and the actual program 'path'" although I clearly have.<br />
Is this a windows 8 thing or something? Because I'd love to use it :)<br />

            <span>Hi
<span>WeaveBeader,<br />
</span><br />
If you're referring to Windows Live Photo Gallery 2011, here are the steps on how to print pictures on it.<br />
<br />
1. Open <strong><span>Windows Live Photo Gallery</span></strong> from your computer's start menu. When the screen opens, you can see a list of your photo files on the left-hand side.
<br />
<br />
2. Select a photo from one of your photo folders by double-clicking on the folder and on the photo you wish to print. The photo appears in the middle of your screen.<br />
<br />
3. Open the Printing Wizard, hold <strong><span>ALT&nbsp;</span></strong>and press<strong><span>&nbsp;F
</span></strong>then select <strong><span>Print.</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
</b>4. In the Printing Wizard you can customize the <strong><span>Paper size</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Quality </span></strong>and<strong><span> Layout&nbsp;</span></strong>of the&nbsp;photos.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. Once you have selected a printer and customized the output settings of your pictures, on the right-hand side you will see a list of print sizes. Select your preferred size&nbsp;and click
<strong><span>Print</span></strong>. Your photos will now print.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any other concern regarding Windows Live Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

    <title>Enable and Disable Display Adapters in Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richelleramirez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable and Disable Display Adapters in Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to disable and enable the Display Adapters on my Device Manager. The reason is that, I have a laptop which will connect to the PC at home but I don't want things to be viewed/displayed on my PC whenever I will Remote (using TeamViewer or AnyDesk)
 it from a far.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb650ff3-3d3d-48ac-9df6-74a1666a186a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bb650ff3-3d3d-48ac-9df6-74a1666a186a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Scenario I will be needing:</p>
<p>- I will remote my PC at home without display, and can be viewed only in my laptop</p>
<p>- Once I get home, I can still enable the Disabled Display Adapters</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, can I still remote it even if the Display Adapter is not working?</p>
<p>I would like to do test but will be able to get things back to normal if things go wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>I am using <strong>VivoStick PC (TS10)&nbsp;</strong>so I have to connect it to a monitor.</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi Richelle, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I get your meaning, one simple way to do this is just unplug the cable of your monitor or take it with you, so that others could not get displayed on your computer.
<br />
<br />Remote view tools (TeamViewer or AnyDesk) will still work for you while it's running.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Richelle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You wouldn't want to disable the Display adapter because you'd not be able to access Device Manager again to restore it except by using System Restore which is only for emergencies.  
<br />
<br />Instead what I do when I plan to remote into my PC that day, is before going out hit the Function keys for Mute and to Turn off Display.  Then I can connect and no one whose around the PC knows it.  
<br />
<br />If your screen doesn't have an Fn key to Turn off Display, there are other methods to do this that are safe here:

<p><span><span>3. Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try changing the screen resolution and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Change screen

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try updating the display drivers and check if it helps:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows update error code 0x80070424</h2>
                    <p>Hello, two days ago I had a trojan virus and was able to quarantine it with different anti-malware software. Now I have tried updating my Windows 10 and get the following message after clicking the "check for updates" button:
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">There were some problems installing updates, but we’ll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80070424)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked through other forums, which had the similar problem. I tried the <strong>
<em>sfc /scannow</em></strong> command in cmd, but got the message below:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />
For online repairs, details are included in the CBS log file located at<br />
windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For offline<br />
repairs, details are included in the log file provided by the /OFFLOGFILE flag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried the command <strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</em></strong> and it didn't work either. It only displayed the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Error: 1060<br />
<br />
The specified service does not exist as an installed service.<br />
<br />
The DISM log file can be found at C:\WINDOWS\Logs\DISM\dism.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm all out of ideas. I would really appreciate your help from the bottom of my heart.</p>

            <p>That is not possible.&nbsp; EXE files are executable code that has been compiled into a binary format for the computer to process.&nbsp; You need to be a programmer to build these, and it is not a process of combining scripts.</p>

<h2>            Mass Storage devices won&#39;t show up in &#34;Computer&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Kodak Zi8 HD Camera and a card reader and both wont show up in my computer. Since the camera doesn't pop up in "Computer" I thought I would buy and take the SD card out of the camera and put it into a card reader. The card reader now doesn't work
 either. They do however show up in "Devices and Printers". When I go to Disk Management and I try to change the drive letter, I get a red error pop up window. I was told by Dell support on Twitter that I had to reinstall windows but I don't have a Windows
 7 recovery disc. I really want to upgrade to a 64 bit processor. I'm currently running:</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Duo @1.8GhZ</p>
<p>4GB Ram</p>

<p>What is the brand and model of the memory card you are using with the device?</p>
<p>Are you able to access the camera in the Devices and Printers section?</p>
<p>What is the PC model?</p>
<p>What does the error in the popup say verbatim"?</p>

<p>Mas em todo caso, entra no site do fabricante do seu modem/router e baixe o manual, lá com certeza terá uma explicação de como fazer isso.</p>

<p><span>S</span><span>ystem restore depends on the RPC Server service this could be the reason why you are unable to perform
 System restore.</span></p>
<p><span>The RPC (Remote Procedure Call) service in&nbsp;<strong><span>Services&nbsp;</span></strong>should be started and the startup type
 should be set to Automatic.</span></p>

            <p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

<h2>            Desperate, nothing I do fixes computer. It won&#39;t boot or repair. I need it for a school, got the software free from yall off kivet hub.</h2>
                    <p>Please help me. I had issues with my wifi the other night. I got that fixed. After I got done with homework I turned it off. I have been trying all night fix it as I have a test online today. When I turned it on last night it once again would not open Google
 chrome. All I could get was the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Repair won't work. I went into command prompt and ran sc /SCANNOW. It said it fixed corrupt files on the X drive, changes would occur when I reboot. It still just says it's checking for issues, then does the repair thing, then tells me couldn't fix
 it with this http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255039. It won't open. I had developer and stuff on it to. I'm just learning. I could fix it if it was still setup by Dell but I put Windows 8.1 on from the kivet hub. So no software to reformat. I am so
 desperate please help me.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you face any issues using Internet Explorer?</li></ul>
<p>Since the computer does not boot and you do not have installation media for Windows 8.1, you can refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Create USB installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Run the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows&nbsp;8.1 Setup</span></strong></a> program.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;When prompted to run or save the file, choose <span>Run</span></p>
<p>c.&nbsp;When prompted to enter a product key, enter the 25-digit product key you received when you bought
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>. </p>
<p>d.&nbsp;When prompted to install <span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, select <span>Install by creating media</span>, and then click
<span>Next</span>.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;Select the type of media you want to use: either a USB flash drive or a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To create a USB flash drive</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click <span>USB flash drive</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Plug the USB flash drive into a USB port on your PC.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When prompted, select the USB drive you want to use and then click <span>Next.</span></p>
<p>If you have files on the USB flash drive, they'll be deleted.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You do require the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Once you have created the installation media, follow the steps below to fix MBR.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.</span></p>

d3dx9_43.dll is the newest of the dx9 files and does not install with Win7.<br />
Did the DX Web Installer download or only not run after downloading ? You do need to<br />
be on line when running the Web Installer because it is only a tool that looks for 'missing'<br />
DX files which it then downloads and installs.<br />
<br />
- If the Direct X Web Installer is not working at all try emptying the TEMP folder<br />
(<i>Username \AppData \Local \TEMP</i> and delete all the files that Windows allows ).
<br />
After rebooting try running the Web Installer with&nbsp; your Anti-Virus disabled.<br />
-&nbsp; If that does not help try running the Web Installer while in <i>Clean Boot</i> -<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>

If you continue having problems try using the full Direct X runtime installer -<br />

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
<br />
<br />
The installer will extract the files to a location of your choice. You then need to open the<br />
folder the files were extracted to and run the&nbsp; <i>DXSETUP.exe</i> .<br />
- As you have slow download speeds you will want to save the installer package you downloaded<br />
as it is close to 100MB.<br />

<p><span>If I understand you correctly, your computer is not working properly as your need to restart your computer two times in order to function properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do your get any error message while switching on the computer ?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Is the computer running slow once you switch on the computer for the first time ?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try <b>safe mode</b> and check. Follow these steps to start the computer in
<b>safe mode</b></span></p>
<p><span>Check in<b> Safe mode.</b></span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Start the computer in <b>Safe mode</b>, to start the computer with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type ‘<b>MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.<br />
c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab.<br />
d) Under <b>‘Boot Options’</b>, select the<b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.<br />
e) Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the Safe boot check box:<b>‘Minimal’</b>.
<br />
f) Click ‘<b>OK’</b> and then <b>restart</b> your PC.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Restart the computer to start in <b>normal mode.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method2.</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn't occur in <b>safe mode</b> </span><span>Try <b>‘Clean boot’</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the first method didn't fix the issue set the computer in <b>‘Clean boot’</b> state to check software conflicts. Refer the following steps:<br />
<br />
<b>Step 1:</b><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’ </b>key on the <b>keyboard</b>.<br />
b) In the ‘<b>Run’ </b>windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’ </b>and click ‘<b>Ok’</b>.<br />
c) Click the ‘<b>Boot’ </b>tab and uncheck ‘<b>Safe Boot’ </b>option.<br />
d) On the ‘<b>General’ </b>tab, click to select the option ‘<b>Selective startup’</b>, and then click to
<b>clear </b>the option<b> Load startup items</b> check box.<br />
e) On the ‘<b>Services’ </b>tab, click to select the ‘<b>Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click ‘<b>Disable all’.<br />
</b>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’ </b>tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’</b>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
<b>right click </b>on <b>each startup item </b>which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’</b>.<br />
f) Click ‘<b>OK’</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</span></b><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services </b>tab, and then click to <b>select </b>the <b>Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
</b>c. Click to <b>select half of the check boxes </b>in the Service list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If the problem still occurs, </span></b><span>repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<b>If the problem does not occur, </b>repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<b>If only one service is selected in the Service list,</b> and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If no startup item causes this problem,</span></b><span> a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services
 check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>If the problem still occurs,</span></b><span> repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<b>If the problem does not occur, </b>repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<b>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, </b>and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<b>If no startup item causes this problem</b>, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem:</span></b><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem,</b> contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for
 the problem item.<br />
<br />
<b>Step 7:<br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Note: </b>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) Restart the computer and check with the issue, if the issue persists follow the next method.</span></p>

            <p>I had a similar problem as well, I think I fixed it by downloading the updated atk package from the asus support site, before you install it uninstall the older version first.</p>
<p>ux21e - utilities -&nbsp; ATKACPI driver and hotkey-related utilities.</p>
<p>version 1.0.0023.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however I don't recommend updating the touchpad driver (asus smart gesture version 1.0.35)&nbsp;to the windows 8 one, because on the ux31e it sucks and isn't as smooth as the windows 7 one. but you do get a few extra swipes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

            There's no native ability in Windows to do this.&nbsp; If your scanner has a document feeder, it can be done using the software that came with the scanner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing that, you'll need a third-party app.&nbsp; Use your favorite search engine.

                    <p>Windows 10 installer sees my Nvme PCIe M.2 ssd (Sabrent Rocket 256gb brand).</p>
<p>But when I click to install-error messages says : Windows cant be installed on this drive.</p>
<p>When I click "Show Details"-It goes further to say "The computers hardware may not support booting to this disk"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed various advice I found on google, like disable/enable secure boot or legacy; none has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS Of this HP Spectre X360 Convertible (Intel Core i7-5500U) does not offer the option to change to ACHI or SATA or CSM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought clicking the "load drivers" tab, but couldnt find any drivers on Sabrent's website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone.</p>

            Hi Horatio
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br /> Boot the PC to the DVD or USB key in UEFI mode. For more info, see Boot to UEFI Mode or Legacy BIOS mode (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh8...</a>).
<br />
<br />    When choosing an installation type, select Custom.
<br />
<br />    On the Where do you want to install Windows? screen, select each of the partitions on the drive, and select Delete. The drive will show a single area of unallocated space.
<br />
<br />    Select the unallocated space and click Next. Windows detects that the PC was booted into UEFI mode, and reformats the drive using the GPT drive format, and begins the installation.
<br />
<br />To manually wipe a drive and convert it to GPT:
<br />
<br />    Turn off the PC, and put in the Windows installation DVD or USB key.
<br />
<br />    Boot the PC to the DVD or USB key in UEFI mode. For more info, see Boot to UEFI Mode or Legacy BIOS mode (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825112.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh8...</a>)
<br />
<br />    From inside Windows Setup, press Shift+F10 to open a command prompt window.
<br />
<br />    Open the diskpart tool:
<br />
<br />    diskpart
<br />
<br />    Identify the drive to reformat:
<br />
<br />    list disk
<br />
<br />    Select the drive, and reformat it:
<br />
<br />    select disk &lt;disk number&gt;
<br />    clean
<br />    convert gpt
<br />    exit
<br />
<br />    Close the command prompt window.
<br />
<br />    Continue the Windows Setup installation.
<br />
<br />    When choosing an installation type, select Custom. The drive will appear as a single area of unallocated space.
<br />
<br />    Select the unallocated space and click Next. Windows begins the installation.
