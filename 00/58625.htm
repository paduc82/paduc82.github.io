<h2>            Microsoft Photos app not recognizing faces in photos</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft.Photos to manage all my photos (about 20K files). When i first checked possibilities using this tool, i was suprised to see that thousands of good face detection for many persons had been done automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For exemple i got around 2300 detection concerning me, in spite of Lightroom detected about 2700 (but improved by manual confirmation).</p>
<p>The problem was the size of my collection, about 80 GB, because i'm not a photograph, this was only slowing Lightroom and other detections tools, so i decided to convert them using xnview to compress and obtained a 20 GB collection size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i decided to reset Microsoft.Photos to see if it detect more faces, hoping it approches lightroom results. A really bad idea..
</p>
<p>I never got again a working face detection... Concerning me, it detects between 80 and 120.. instead of the 2300 or more..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many things :</p>
<p>- reset app using parameter option many times</p>
<p>- repaired the app using parameter option<br />
- created a new local account and tried detection</p>
<p>- tried detection on another computer (linked to my account)</p>
<p>- deleted the app and reinstalled using appxpackage install</p>
<p>- tried windows insider with latest updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no logs explaining what's happening with this uwp apps.</p>
<p>I dont understand what's the problem. Did the conversion make my photo unreadable by recognation (Microsoft cognitive services ?).</p>
<p>However I can see them correctly in Photos or some other tools with same quality as the olders ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope some help</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that the face recognition in Microsoft Photos app is not working properly after resetting the app. We will look into this for you. However, in order to get a better clarity on the issue, please reply with the following details:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which version of Photos app is installed on the computer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Which version of Windows is installed on the computer?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Photos app recognizes the faces from the contacts saved in the People app. If the Photos app is unable to recognize the faces in the photos then, I suggest you to try resetting the People app and see if that helps in resolving the issue:</span></p>

</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: Resetting the app will reset it to default settings. You will have to re-add the account to People app after resetting it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If resetting the app didn‚Äôt fix the issue, I suggest you to manually add the contacts in People app whose face is not getting detected in the Photos app. You can refer the section

<p>I am experiencing the exact same problem. 6000+ photos added to Photos app and it only recognizes 8 people. Refuses to do any more. Why can't I tag people manually and have it recognize more people like every other facial recognition tool out there? I want
 to like Photos because of this feature, executed locally and _not_ on the cloud, but it's very broken in this state.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I also tried to reset everything for the Photos and Contacts app. Also removed and added the photos ordner into the collection. For me it recognized 13 people which appear in about 300 photos out of approx. 20000.

<p>I have the exact same issue - Photos will not recognise faces in my photo collection anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It currently recognises about 12 faces from a library of over 85000 photos.&nbsp; Google Photos manages to find hundreds of faces and matches these to contacts etc. perfectly well across this same library.&nbsp; Previous versions of Microsoft Photos seemed to work
 well.&nbsp; Something has changed !&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. About 27624 photos and only a 4 groups of face tags (165 photos in these few groups). Resetting the Photos and People apps doesn't work. No changes after installing beta version of Photos.</p>

            Both I and my husband have the same problem and have tried to get a response from MS over the last 6 months.&nbsp; WE have the issue on our individual ID and have done all the trouble shooting steps including multiple resets, reinstalls and repairs.&nbsp; There
 is an issue with Photos. It would be nice if MS would admit it.

<p>I have been experiencing the same issues.&nbsp; Initially the photos app recognized all the faces for my pics but it dropped to only recognizing 6 faces and only 10-20 pics for each face.</p>
<p>I reset the app and it now cannot recognize any faces at all.&nbsp; I reloaded the my contacts in people and it still does not recognize anyone. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Laptop suddenly does not &#39;see&#39; my wireless router, use to work fine</h2>
                    I have a HP Laptop and it was set up on a wireless network to a d-Link N wireless router.&nbsp; All worked fine for about 3 months.&nbsp; Now it cannot connect.&nbsp; Running the trouble shooter asks it to pick a connection - all my neighbors show up, but not the one
 in my house.&nbsp; The router is also new (both it and laptop were Christmas presents).&nbsp;&nbsp; It used to work fine with the Windows 7 one, and now nothing...&nbsp; I cannot get it to show up in the list of wireless connections.<br />
My 5 year old laptop running XP is online with this router and it works just fine - so I do not think it is the router that is the problem.<br />
THANX!

            Hello Bchek,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;Check with your D-Link documentation and settings to ensure that the SSID broadcast hasn't been disabled. &nbsp;This would prevent you from being able to see the wireless network. &nbsp;Please let us know if this did or didn't help to resolve
 your problem.</div>

 triiggers soon,to add wen your batterys run out the light dulls and the vibrations stop,but then the buttons stop working to after est 50 hours of use.I found playing forza especially the new triggers really good.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Dual Monitors Extended</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded from Windows7Pro to Windows 10. At first, would not recognize second monitor. Used extended screen, now the monitor is recognized however I can only see the extreme right of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a way to remove the extended because just a portion of the screen is being viewed. Can't find the fly-out that appears on the right or left of the screen to remedy the situation.</p>

                    As title says, I installed Windows 8 and updated some drivers and anti-virus. Whenever I go to start and click on any app it won't load. It gets to the loading screen and doesn't change from there.

            Hi,<br />
<div><br />
<div>1. It was just the modern UI apps that didn't load.</div>
<div>2. Yes I attempted disabling the drivers and anti-virus (Kaspersky Internet Security 2013) However apps still didn't load properly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I attempted rebooting the PC and reinstalling the anti-virus etc, however no difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I actually ended up performing a clean install which fixed all the issues. My PC is now very fast and up to the standard. Seems like the upgrade process didn't work for me. I hope this thread can help someone else with the same issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also my Cyborg v7 keyboard doesn't work with Windows 8, I actually had to use my old Logitech G11 keyboard instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other than that everything seems to be working fine and I'm finally enjoying the full Windows 8 experience.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks very much for your help.</div>

<p>When exactly did you loose your internet?</p>
<p>Were you able to install the anniversary update?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem</p>
<p>I install &nbsp;anniversary update from ISO file, which download from Microsoft site.</p>
<p>After updating, my internet connection was lost. I checked Device manager, and find that Ethernet-controller not found driver (had symbol '!'). I tried install from Win10 - Win wrote that it not found. Tried install driver for my motherboard-dvd but DVD-drive
 didn't work well. It worked but wrote somesing about XP/98 (I don't remember sorry).</p>
<p>I switch off my antivirus software - did not help.</p>
<p>WIn10 didn't found ethernet. Another device had internet so it's no problem tp-link rowter or cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I go back for previus build use <span>
<span>standard method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After that I tried install
</span></span>anniversary update from ISO file <span>
<span>again, and I had the same problem.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So, How I fix this problem?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Wi-Fi Direct on the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question regarding wifi direct support on the xbox one.</p>
<p>I have seen from many sources that the Xbox One supports wifi direct but I can not find a way to use this feature and support seems to believe that this is not a feature of the console.</p>
<p>I found mention of the feature from:</p>
<p><a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/connected</a></p>

<p>I also se this listed as a feature by many websites that review the console.</p>

<p>So is this a feature of the console? And if so, how does one use it?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                    <p>I have a Windows 8 Toshiba laptop that gets stuck for a long time while booting up . It first gets stuck at black screen after Windows logo and then after tiring long moments it moves to a Please Wait screen. It finally boots to a desktop which does not
 work itself. It flickers and seems to load something but at the end i have to forcefully shut it down. I am tired of making it work. Can somebody please find a solution?</p>

</p><p>To access the System Restore, Refresh and Reset options using the F12 option at start up, perform the following:<br />
<br />
1. If not already, ensure the computer is completely shut down. <br />

            I did not refresh or reset it. But I tried Automatic Repair, Startup Repair and also fixing the boot and scan commands through the command prompt. None worked so far. Automatic Repair is not working- it shows that it cannot work on this operating system.
 Startup Repair brings the diagnostics and Safe Boot options, both of them lead to same problem occurring again. And the commands execute successfully through the Prompt but they do not fix anything.

            Guess the answer was that an update was stuck. I cleared all the junk from the laptop and checked for other issues. I checked for updates once again. Once the laptop showed "Update and Restart" option and I followed that, the laptop booted correctly.

<p>Sorry to bump this old thread but this happens to me all the time. </p>
<p>Basically using Crackle on Xbox One makes the closed captioning turn on in the Settings.
</p>
<p>Here's how it plays out:</p>
<p>1. Closed Captions off in Xbox One Settings</p>
<p>2. I use Crackle</p>
<p>3. I make no change to internal Crackle apps settings </p>
<p>4. I jump to Netflix</p>
<p>5. Closed Captions in Netflix Apps are now on and Closed Captions in Xbox One Settings are On.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to figure out a solution to this, but I'm wondering if anyone else can duplicate it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp; I wish you hadn't removed the Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address as it would be useful in view of other items.&nbsp; What was shown?&nbsp;&nbsp; A proper DHCP assigned address or a 169.... type?<br />
&nbsp; Your output shows a blank default gateway which explains the lack of access beyond your local network.&nbsp; If you are getting a proper DHCP assigned address, your router should be providing the gateway also.<br />
&nbsp; Addtionally, the DNS servers show PV6 addresses.&nbsp;&nbsp; What kind of router do you have?&nbsp; Are your other computers using ipV6?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If not, I suggest firstly that you temporarily disable ipV6 and see happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; If still a problem, what happens if you try a static IP address (and enter proper gateway etc.).<br />
<br />

            hey gts i tried to configure my ipv4 address after i saw this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXsKTAxYtk but now that i go into properties it is set back on "obtaining an ip address automatically". ipconfig /all now says autoconfiguration ipV4...........:
 192.245.79.186 &lt;preferred&gt;
<div><br />
<div>as for the dhcp assigment a while back when i tried to do some cmd commands to fix the network problems there was an error message saying that i "cant connet to the dhcp server" or something along those lines but i cannot remember the command that caused
 the message.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>My router is a 2wire gateway uverse and every other computer uses ipv6 without any problems.</div>
<div>when you say try a static ip do you mean call up my isp and request one?</div>

            The working computer shows an assigned IP address of 192.168.1.71.&nbsp; This is in a commonly used DHCP range of consumer routers.<br />
The failing computer shows an IP address (per your info) of 192.245.79.186.&nbsp; .&nbsp; This is a completely different sub net.&nbsp; It's hard to see how this is possible if you are connecting both computers to the same router and using DHCP on both.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Are you certain
 you do not have a static address coded?)&nbsp; How is the problem computer connected? Wireless or wired? Plugged into a LAN port on the router?&nbsp; I believe the 2 wire unit you have is a combination modem / router. Is that correct?&nbsp; Is there another router or access
 point involved?<br />

            <div>how can i change my computers ip to something commly used would that solve the problem? i am very certain that both computers run DHCP.</div>
the problem computer is wired directly to the 2wire modem/router via ethernet cable and the laptops are connected to the same modem/router via wifi. That is the only access point in my home network.

&nbsp;hey i was looking around on this forum &nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/ac9a26a0-54a8-4f57-b0d5-e230f51ba5b3/local-area-connection-doesnt-have-a-valid-ip-configuration-yet-again?forum=w7itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/ac9a26a0-54a8-4f57-b0d5-e230f51ba5b3/local-area-connection-doesnt-have-a-valid-ip-configuration-yet-again?forum=w7itpronetworking</a></p>
<p>
and saw than one person said to another person that...</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
When you get 169.254.. it means that your laptop is not able to see DHCP server or router.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
What you can do is</p>
<p>
1. reboot (power cycle) your router</p>
<p>
2. Set your wirless connection to use static IP address.</p>
<div><br />
<div>that might be the problem with mine since my computers ip starts with 169.254.. too</div>

    <title>Processes won&#39;t die - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> algolinurca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Processes won&#39;t die</h2>
                    About a week, maybe two, ago processes, especially firefox, IE, and some games, refuse to die. They won't die when closed regularly, from task manager, or even from process killing programs. I find it highly annoying that I have to reboot my computer because
 frequently used programs are hogging all of the memory or one-instance programs refuse to run because there's already one running. I've lost work over this problem. Is this something that's happening to other people? Is this a ploy to get everyone to install
 7? <br />
<br />
I have no spyware, malware, viruses, or trojans that are recognized by all of the major spyware/malware/anti-virus programs. I'm also fairly savvy at which processes need to run and routine maintenance, so I doubt that I messed something up along the way, I
 know this mostly because I haven't had to mess with anything including config and registry. There weren't any programs or registry changes anywhere near the time that this started happening.<br />
<br />
I should also add that restart doesn't work, it just hangs. I have to do a hard reset.

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            why can&#39;t I delete BabyBoyBackground and other unwanted videos from the Media Center library&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There are many unwanted videos in my Windows Media Center Library. When I try to delete them, I am told I cannot as I requre permission from Trusted Installer. When I take the many, many steps to take ownership of the files, it still won't allow me to delete
 them. I am told access is denied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my computer. I am the only one who uses it, I am the administrator, I have no desire to make a DVD with baby boys, teddy bears, boys on dirt bikes and such rot. Tell me how to permanently delete the BabyBoy files and all the others I didn't put on
 my computer. </p>

<p>I do not have lightscribe on my laptop. Can anyone suggest a good (&nbsp;and preferably free) label maker that will&nbsp; allow printing directly&nbsp; onto a DVD? I've downloaded Disketch and it says you print directly onto the DVD but I don't see how.</p>

            <p>To print directly on the DVD you need special printable <br />
DVD blanks and a printer with the correct type of tray.<br />
<br />
You can also print on self adhesive paper labels but<br />
the glue can degrade the DVD and if the label comes <br />
off it can damage your DVD Drive.<br />
<br />
An external lightscribe drive may be the best solution.<br />
And...BTW lightscribe also requires special DVD blanks.<br />

            Hi Sarah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try resetting OneDrive at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; OneDrive &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails try reinstalling OneDrive:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/tips/reinstall-onedrive-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/tips/reinstall-onedr...</a>
<br />
<br />If those fail go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>80070422 Error. Windows Update troubleshooter says it repaired the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timbarnard  say:</h3>
<h2>            80070422 Error. Windows Update troubleshooter says it repaired the problem but the error persists. How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I've yet to find a solution for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Update gives an 80070422 error.<br />
</p>
<p>I run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it detects problems with the Windows Update components.<br />
I tell it to go ahead and repair them and after a few moments it says the problems are fixed.<br />
However, when I then go to run Windows Update, the error persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can repeatedly run the troubleshooter and with each run it says there are problems to fix and reports them as fixed.</p>
<p>I have also tried running Microsoft's Fixit for Windows Update at support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update and the same thing happens. I.e., it says it has repaired the windows update components when I suppose they've not really been repaired; because I
 can keep re-running it and it will repeatedly say there are problems and they're now fixed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need some help in figuring out what the real problem is and fixing it.</p>

            I had already tried running that Fixit utility - to no avail.
<div><br />
<div>However, I did manage to fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I opened up the Services window under Administrative Tools. I then opened the Services window on a known working Windows 7 Home Premium laptop. I then went line-by-line comparing the two machines settings. Wherever the problem machine indicated that a
 service was Disabled but the working system indicated otherwise, I changed the problem machine's service settings to match. If either machine listed a service that was not on the other machine - I left that service untouched.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Upon rebooting, the problem was fixed and Windows Update worked perfectly. There were many discrepancies between the two systems' service settings so I have no way of knowing which changes finally fixed the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks to all for their suggestions.</div>

            Since it looks like you can get this if you have a virus, <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/5350?el=88446#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
get tdsskiller then run it</a>. If it picks anything up select cure wait for it to finish then reboot<br />

See if you've got rootkits<br />

</strong>The KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000001E. This indicates that a kernel-mode program generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.
<br />
<br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.
<br />
<br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Cause</strong> <br />
<br />
This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the ntstatus.h file located in the inc directory of the Windows Driver Kit.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution&nbsp; <br />
<br />
</strong><strong>If you are not equipped to debug this problem</strong>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing
 video adapters. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><strong><br />
If you plan to debug this problem</strong>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p>If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><strong>Hardware incompatibility. </strong>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Faulty device driver or system service. </strong>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.<br />
<br />
If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.
</p>

If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending system
 service file.</p>
<p><br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially
 the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><br />
The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<strong>To get a stack trace if the normal stack tracing procedures fail </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551943(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</strong></a> command to display parameters in the stack trace. Look for the call to
<strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. (If this function is not listed, see the note below.)</p>
</li><li>The first parameter to <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong> is a pointer to a structure, which contains pointers to an
<strong>except</strong> statement:
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Copy </div>
<div>
<div>typedef struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS { PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord; PCONTEXT ContextRecord; } EXCEPTION_POINTERS, *PEXCEPTION_POINTERS; ULONG PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread( IN PEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers )
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff542790(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>dd (Display Memory)</strong></a> command on that address to display the necessary data.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The first retrieved value is an exception record and the second is a context record. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff563043(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.exr (Display Exception Record)</strong></a> command and the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff562301(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.cxr (Display Context Record)</strong></a> command with these two values as their arguments, respectively.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After the <strong>.cxr</strong> command executes, use the <strong>kb</strong> command to display a stack trace that is based on the context record information. This stack trace indicates the calling stack where the unhandled exception occurred.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure assumes that you can locate <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. However, in some cases (such as an access violation crash) you will not be able to do this. In that case, look for
<strong>ntoskrnl!KiDispatchException</strong>. The third parameter passed to this function is a trap frame address. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565491(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.trap (Display Trap Frame)</strong></a> command with this address to set the Register Context to the proper value. You can then perform stack traces and issue other commands.

<p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED Parameters </p>
<p>The following parameters appear on the blue screen. <br />
<br />
<strong>Cause <br />
<br />
</strong>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the Ntstatus.h file that is located in the inc directory of the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution <br />
<br />
</strong>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Try changing video adapters. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>If you plan to debug this problem, </strong>you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hardware incompatibility. Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Faulty device driver or system service. A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.
<br />
<br />
If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending
 system service file.<br />
<br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual
 for your computer. <br />
<br />
The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation
 that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and .chk files that contain saved
 file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<br />
You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen. <br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and provide a link to it so we can analyze it.

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

                    So apparently norton security does Tune-ups. Error popped on drive C and then had to manually defrag in W8.1 also noticed that there was a drive with the name of "\\?\Volume...". The disk fragmentation is at 32% and it doesn't let me optimize it. Please
 what do I do ???

<p>Hi Kevin</p>
<p>
</p><p>A drive that only shows the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)&nbsp;such as 
\\?\Volume........&nbsp; is usually the Recovery partition. This drive cannot be mounted or accessed unless you use the manufacturers procedure for recovering the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This drive does not require Defragging or Optimizing.</p>
<p>
