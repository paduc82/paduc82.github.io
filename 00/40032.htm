<h2>            Siren heads</h2>
                    
I'm looking for 3 Siren heads (listed below) that I haven't been able to obtain in the game for the longest time. I'd gladly trade it for LV50 legendary weapons such as CC, Infinity, Baby Maker, Volcano or shields such as the Black Hole, The Cradle, The
 Bee and Flame of Firehawk. Please message me if you can help and thank you for reading this post ;)
<p>- Cold Steel: My friends and I farmed Terramorphous about 100 times already but have not come across this head :(</p>
<p>- Kawaii Killer: Vermivorous the invincible = impossible! The varkids would morph to Ultimate **** Vorkids but no more (&gt;&lt;)</p>
<p>- Shrapnel Slayer: My friends and I spent the whole new years day farming BNK3R but where is the head lol???</p>

<h2>            Disabled Gaming - Adaptive Controller</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Xbox One S with the Adaptive controller for my son. He lost the use of his left side due to a brain tumor. He is 24 for and gaming is a HUGE part of his life. If went further to purchase 2 pdp joysticks, 1 large jelly pad and 1 Extreme 3D joystick.
 Put this all together and it is not cheap but I am willing to pay the money to see my son smile again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get it to work in a way that only requires his right side. We have talked about getting more, smaller pads but it would all be so cumbersome he couldn't even enjoy playing. If there were just one joystick like the Extreme 3D joystick that allowed
 remapping it would be fine. WHY IS THIS NOT AVAILABLE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, do you have any care for the disable community? Does anyone have any ideas that would help? I'm desperate.</p>
<p>

<p>I hope that we can help!&nbsp; There are a few videos on this page :&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/controllers/play-with-adaptive-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/controllers/play-with-adaptive-controller</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They show some typical setups, and suggestions to help.&nbsp; At the bottom of the page are links to groups that Microsoft worked with in creating the adaptive controller.&nbsp; They also have suggestions for setups, and creative ways to use the inputs.&nbsp; There are
 some situations and games that will be very difficult to control.&nbsp; You can connect a standard controller as a "copilot" and use that controller to assist in the more complex gaming situations.</p>

<p>Hi, so recently my friend had a spinal cord injury and was left quadriplegic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is still recovering and as regained some use of his arms and has started gaming with assistive peripherals and has very recently been trying out online gaming again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our problem is that his microphone doesn't work with the peripherals. No headset is compatible with the assistive peripherals he bought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why isnt it possible to connect a headset directly into the xbox via usb?</p>
<p>2. Why doesnt a mic work with disabled periherals?</p>
<p>3. What is microsoft/xbox currently working on to make it easier for disabled people to actually play games?</p>
<p>

<h3> shplink2  say:</h3>
<h2>            WWE 2K14 Accelerator</h2>
                    
<p>So today I purchased the WWE 2K14 Season Pass. I downloaded everything that came with it, including the accelerator. The details for the Accelerator say, "Decide the overall rankings and attributes levels of every WWE Superstar, Legend, and Diva in the game.
 Unlock every WWE Superstar, Legend, and Diva, including alternate attires and all arenas and championships in WWE 2K14. Note: This item is included in the Season Pass premium content purchase."</p>

<p>All of the other packs downloaded perfectly, but I am still missing some characters from the "30 Years of Wrestlemania Mode" and also missing some arenas and one extra gamemode located under "Specialty"</p>

<p>I also went into "Download History" and re-downloaded the accelerator and watched it download to 100% and it still didn't work. Am I doing something wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!</p>

<h2>            trying to attach a saved file Surface doesn&#39;t show it</h2>
                    Using the Surface I opened my Yahoo mail. &nbsp;I wanted to attach a file to an email reply. &nbsp;In the reply email I clicked attach, Surface went to files, but my file did not show up and I know it's in there. &nbsp;I searched every folder and the only thing that
 showed up was "OneNote". &nbsp;Very frustrating.

<h2>            I managed to remove admin privileges from my Vista computer and need to find a way to restore an admin account to make things right.</h2>
                    I am using Vista 64-bit on a dual Athlon machine.&nbsp; I have attempted some of the fixes I found doing a search of the forms here but to no avail.&nbsp; Opening a DOS box by right-clicking and selecting run as administrator doesn't allow me to turn on the admin
 account.&nbsp; Downloading the program enableadmin.exe and following the instructions to reboot with my install CD gets me to the point where I try to run the program, except the error message I get is the system can't run the program.&nbsp; When trying to manually
 change the registry values, the values shown in the instructions don't match what I see on this computer.&nbsp; I seem to be in a rut going nowhere fast.&nbsp; I'm hoping someone may have additional suggestions for me (besides reinstalling VISTA and all the programs
 I have).&nbsp; Thanks...<br />

Try Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot. The Admin Account there has no password by default<br />
so unless someone changed it you should have access there. Then Control Panel - User Accounts -<br />
Manage another account - use this lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times.<br />
Then fix the password in your normal account. Be sure to leave your account as Admin if you<br />
wish.<br />
<br />
Try these to clear corruption in case it has a role.<br />
<br />
1. Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
2. Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

</span><br />
<br />
3. Then run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then do this -&nbsp;use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times. Do the<br />
same for other accounts that might have problems. Then if needed you can also reset your passwords
<br />
in the accounts. Remember to leave your account as Admin and the others at the level you wish.<br />
<br />
Make another&nbsp;Admin Account&nbsp;with your password&nbsp;and use it to fix the others when needed. (just to
<br />
repair with, not to use as regular account, a safety valve) Always keep a spare ADMIN&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
DO NOT LEAVE THE HAA ENABLED OR USE IT DAILY. If it corrupts you are toast!<br />

<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Here's what I've run across so far.<br />
<br />
First, I was able to boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Went to manage accounts; I have three accounts - my main login account (now set to guest account which I'm trying to change); another guest account for my wife's computer to share files, and another guest account which
 is inactive.&nbsp; When I go to manage my main account and try to change it to administrator, it seems to accept it (it gives me no errors) but when I go back into the change type of account screen, it's still marked as "standard".&nbsp; Can't change it.<br />
<br />
I tried to create a new account and typed in a name; it gave me an error message that the name was invalid because it had invalid characters in it (from the !@#$%^%^&amp;...etc family of special characters) however the name did not have any of these characters
 and was in fact a valid name.<br />
<br />
So I proceeded on to your step 1 which was run Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; It worked fine.<br />
<br />
Step 2.&nbsp; I started the command prompt box using "run as administrator" and tried to execute the sfc command.&nbsp; It wouldn't let me - said I needed to be an administrator.<br />
<br />
Then I went on to step 3 - run checkdisk.&nbsp; I tried to schedule the checkdisk program from within Safe Mode but it said I didn't have sufficient rights to run this program.&nbsp; So I rebooted back into normal Vista and tried it again and got the same answer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, here I am; still stuck.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Any ideas on where I can go from here?<br />
<br />
Let me add this:&nbsp; I have a 2nd boot disk still attached (the original Windows XP-64 bit) and can boot up in it just fine.&nbsp; So if necessary I could boot up there and make any other changes that may be needed to the Vista disk as an option to get me off top dead
 center with Vista.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help so far...<br />
<br />

<br />
Use the HAA to make a new ADMIN account and the other procedures as outlined above.<br />
You can also use it to correct/change an passwords.<br />

<br />
You can copy and paste the command in and you can access it from a Vista disk if needed.<br />
<br />
If you do not have one borrow a friend's as they are not copy protected. The System maker will sell the
<br />
physical disk cheap since you already own Window. And you can make a Repair Disk, see below.<br />

            I mentioned above that I've been unable to get into the HAA and I think I've already tried the link you mentioned above in your reply:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</span>
</a>, but I'll try it again tomorrow.&nbsp; I've tried additional steps using my VISTA install disk and I keep getting the same error - you need the administrator account to do (whatever it was I was trying to do at the time).&nbsp; That's why I think I'm between a rock
 and a hard place.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen the Vista recovery disk link before and I'll look at it as well tomorrow after work.&nbsp; Thanks for those additional links.&nbsp; I'll let you know if I'm successful.<br />

            I looked at the links provided and like I suspected, I already tried the steps in the first link.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The second series of links leads to creating recovery disks and one of the things mentioned in there is these are needed if you get your computer from a major retailer (like Dell, etc) who doesn't generally provide original operating system installation disks.&nbsp;
 I have an original install disk which includes the routines to facilitate recovery operations.<br />
<br />
I ran across another link that discusses how to use one of these disks and what to do when you get into the recover program.&nbsp; Problem is...it doesn't seem to work in my case.&nbsp; Nothing that I've been able to try so far has helped.&nbsp; Here's another interesting
 twist I noticed last night:&nbsp; after I boot up "normally" in my (formerly administrator) main account and do the CTL-ALT-DEL to log our or switch user, my main account isn't listed.&nbsp; Only the guest account for my wife's computer to share files.&nbsp; The only way
 I can get back to my main account is to do a reboot which eventually brings it back up.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm really hosed or not here and I'm not looking forward to reinstalling VISTA (plus everything else) at this point.&nbsp; Hopefully there are some alternate methods of force-feeding this thing back to semi-normal status.&nbsp;

<h2>            Uninstalling Adobe Flash Player</h2>
                    My computer has just shut down on me 5 or 6 times today without warning. I have restarted in safe mode and normal mode.&nbsp; When recommended I ran a repair, twice.&nbsp; I got a message that new software and/or hardware installations may be causing this.&nbsp; The
 most recent software was an update to the Adope Flash player so I was trying to remove that program but I get this message "The installer will automatically continue when these conflicting applictions are closed - brccmctl. I have nothing open when i am trying
 to uninstall.&nbsp; I am desperate and irritated.&nbsp; Can anyone point me in the right direction?&nbsp; Thanks

            Yes, the same product key used for activating 32 bit Windows 7 can also activate 64 bit Windows 7 as long as they are corresponding editions.

    <title>Why deny permission has no effect on folder &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sreyan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why deny permission has no effect on folder &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am facing a peculiar problem. I am creating an empty&nbsp;folder in my D Drive, and I am assigning the folder explicit Deny Delete permission in its DACL. But when I do a Shift+Del on the folder I can delete the folder right through. What I am doing
 is listed below through screenshots -:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Creating an empty folder in my D Drive.</li><li>Adding "Deny Delete" and "Deny delete subfolders and files" permission for my specific user. The DACL for the folder is given below-:</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4548d852-c3d6-4f08-87cc-60acb2ca6c72" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I after applying the permissions on my folder I am hitting Shift+Del to check whether I am prevented from deleting the file. And to my frustration I can delete the folder without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are as follows-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why am I able to delete the folder even when I have specified a "Deny delete" permission ? I know that even if I am the owner of an object I can still deny myself permission to it.</li><li>According to the following article on TechNet-:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/2005.11.howitworksntfs.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How IT Works: NTFS Permissions</a><br />
<br />
NTFS permissions are evaluated from child to parent to grandparent and so on. <strong>
So since I am applying the deny permission on the folder itself I should have been prevented from deleting it since I am applying the permission at the child level.
</strong>But I am fully able to remove the folder completely. <strong>So either the article is wrong or NTFS is much more complex that anticipated.</strong></li><li>Does the permissions of the <strong>user groups come into play when something unexpected like this is happening
</strong>? Do the user group permissions take precedence over explicit permissions ?</li><li>Even the Effective Access of my folder shows that my user is denied Delete permissions on the folder and subfolder. So what meaning does effective permissions hold when it doesn't seem to work ?<strong>&nbsp;I mean why use effective permissions
</strong>?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If any other info is required from my system please tell me. I want to know how I can make this folder "un-deletable" by using file permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Last night just before I went to bed I checked for Windows updates and my Surface found a firmware update. I left it on and running overnight so it could download and install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning the device would not turn on at all. I press the power button and get no response&nbsp;at all. It was fully charged and plugged in to the docking station when I left it so it's not out of power. I tried all of the troubleshooting tips on the Microsoft
 website (hold power button for 30s, hold power&nbsp;and vol+ buttons for 15s etc.) and they make no difference. It's completely dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I find out that the firmware update was to do with the battery. This has to be more than a coincidence doesn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Microsoft website my only option is to pay £333 to have it fixed. I can't quite believe it. The Surface is only 18 months old and has hardly been used. It's like new. And searching the internet there are apparently hundreds (thousands?)
 with similar problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime all I can suggest is DO NOT INSTALL THE SYSTEM FIRMWARE UPDATE!</p>

Just read a bit more about the update and it says not to leave the Surface plugged in to the docking station when running the update. HOW THE **** AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THIS? All I did was run 'check for updates' and it came up with a firmware update and automatically started downloading so I thought it was better not to interfere and leave it running. Why was there no instruction to disconnect the dock and use the mains charger BEFORE the update started? This will likely happen to everyone with a docking station won't it? 



Shame on you Microsoft. I think someone needs to warn all potential future Surface customers that these things die naturally after less than 2 years and Microsoft will leave you high and dry.

<p>Yes. It was definitely fully charged last time it was working and it has been locked in to the docking station with the power plugged in ever since. This morning I tried leaving it off the docking station&nbsp;for a few hours but it didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally I've not been experiencing battery problems like many other owners. My battery is an LGC not SIMPLO and it lasts a whole working day on one charge.</p>

            <p>David is just a forum management team leader, he won't be able to troubleshoot the Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm not an expert in dealing with a Surface if you're at the point where it won't turn on I'd consider taking it into the shop. You are also able to try the recovery image for a Surface

</p>
<p>This method will most likely reset it completely.</p>

            <p>Thanks for trying to help Westi651. The Surface was bought from a Microsoft store in the US but I&nbsp;am in the UK and there are no Microsoft stores to take it to here. All we have is the phone line which I will have to pay £99 (US$130) to call because I'm 6
 months out of warranty. I'm pretty sure all they are going to do is run through the standard troubleshooters then tell me to pay £333 for an exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would gladly reinstall the OS if I could get the thing to turn on.</p>

            <p>Hi B3nWatkins,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 update also killed my screen on 3rd October. (It was working fine before the update. Then went to sleep mode. Screen was dead when I came back to power it up 4 hours later). I cannot do factory reset without a main screen.</p>
<p>My device is 16 mths old. Just 4 mths after warranty ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked to pay $790 SGD for the replacement. (Just because 1 day the update pushed thru to mess my life up).</p>

<p>Hi Blueforus,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A default program is the program that Windows uses when you open a particular type of file, such as a music file, an image, or a webpage. To associate a&nbsp;.JNLP file with a non Microsoft program, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hold the <strong>Shift </strong>key and press <strong>right-click</strong> on a .JNLP file.</li><li>Select <strong>Open </strong><strong>with </strong>&gt; <strong>Choose </strong>
<strong>another </strong><strong>app</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>More </strong><strong>Apps </strong>&gt; <strong>Look </strong><strong>for another app on this PC</strong>.</li><li>Then browse the program that you would like to use and select it.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

</p><p><strong>Keyboard Language Layout changed</strong> </p>
<p>PCs configured to support more than one language will display the current keyboard language layout in the lower-right portion of the sign-in screen, directly to the left of the power icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, EN is displayed for English.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If you see a language option, make sure you’re entering your password with the correct language characters.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If this doesn’t fix the problem or you don’t see a language indicator, continue reading.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Webroot Software</strong></p>
<p>Webroot antivirus software prior to version <strong>8.0.2.79</strong> mistakenly removes core Windows&nbsp;10 operating system registry entries required for Microsoft account sign in.<span>&nbsp; If you are running&nbsp;a version of
</span>Webroot prior to 8.0.2.79, you should update immediately.</p>
<p><br />
For updated information from Webroot, please visit <a href="http://www5.nohold.net/Webroot/Loginr.aspx?login=1&amp;app=vw&amp;solutionid=1397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are&nbsp;several options to get back into Windows 10.<span>&nbsp; </span>We recommend you try these in the order presented.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Options</strong></p>
<p>If you are able to sign into your computer using a local account, do so and update your Webroot software to the latest version.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After rebooting, you should be able to sign in with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you only sign into your computer with Microsoft accounts, and they all return the ‘password is incorrect’ error, you will need to reset or restore your computer to a point prior to Webroot being installed in order to sign in to update Webroot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To Restore or Refresh your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Locate the power menu on the Windows&nbsp;10 sign-in screen.<span>&nbsp; </span>While holding down the “Shift” key, select “Restart”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will put your PC into System Recovery.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong><span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re prompted for a password, enter the password that you used the last time you successfully signed in to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 1: System Restore.<span>&nbsp; </span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This option will allow you to roll your PC back to a working restore point.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any system changes made since that restore point will be lost.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the System Recovery screen, select <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System Restore</strong>. Your PC will restart and prepare the System Restore experience.</li><li>Choose an account name to continue and enter the last good password used on the PC.</li><li>In the System Restore window, click <strong>Next</strong> and select the <strong>
Show more restore points</strong> check box.</li><li>If one is shown, select a restore point at or before the Webroot installation and follow the prompts to complete the system restore.</li><li>When returned to the sign-in screen, if you still can’t sign in, perform the same steps and select an earlier restore point until you are able to sign in.</li><li>Once signed in, we recommend you uninstall Webroot until Webroot has shipped an update to address this problem.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have any system restore points, you will need to do a system Refresh.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will restore all Windows&nbsp;10 operating system files, and also backup your files and folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any programs installed will need to be reinstalled.<span>&nbsp; </span>This process requires you provide the original Windows&nbsp;10 media that came with your computer, as well as any media you used to install other programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2: System Refresh.<span>&nbsp; </span></strong>This option will restore key system files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will uninstall any third- party applications, but won’t affect personal settings and files.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>From the System Recovery screen, select Refresh. You’ll see a screen that explains what actions will occur.</p>
<p>Your PC will restart and a refresh will occur. When this is completed, there will be a file saved on your desktop with a list of programs that were uninstalled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don’t reinstall Webroot until an update to fix this problem is released, but feel free to reinstall any other programs on the list.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Sign in with the same password you used to start the refresh process.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once you’ve signed in, if you have changed your password online you’ll be prompted to enter that new password once Windows&nbsp;10 fully loads.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>this may be the result of a computer virus that modifies some operating system files.</p>
<p>Scan thoroughly your system.</p>
<p>When iis clean run SFC Scan Now<br />
<br />
Open an elevated command prompt, type in sfc /scannow&nbsp; and press Enter.<br />
<br />
It should scan the system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833<br />
<br />
***Note, if this process shows too much mistakes and cannot correct them, you will have to reinstall Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Game lag suddently after installing Windows update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game lag suddently after installing Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Well I remember I was playing just fine Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, there were No ping spikes, the ping was always around 100-120 and there wasnt lag, I remember I needed to install some application(I believe also updated MSVS) but after the installation
 of Visual C++ 2012 OR update KB4483232/KB4477136 the game had an increased ping from no where, I thought It would be the driver,the game or perhaps my internet connection then decided to try Titanfall 2 and and after installing the driver again, the game also
 has a lag spike, So I decided to do a system restore, I will see if it changed anything but the problem is that it restored to the date I installed the Visual C++ 2012 package.<br />
<br />
A note I had disabled the automatic updates and I do the updates manually probably skipped some of them but I didnt have a problem until 4-6days ago<br />
<br />
Do you have some advice I could try to find out why the connection has lag? some program to monitor the background?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            I will try the clean boot but the problem seems to be network related, it never had happened before, at least in 2 different games at the same time, also it was really odd because the game was playing just fine few days before&nbsp; the first days of&nbsp; January

<h2>            Windows media player and Mpeg 4</h2>
                    <p>I have been able to play MPEG videos without difficulty using windows media player 12 - windows 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; WIth recent updates, - within the last month - there is now no picture - sound is fine, but blank screen (with music note).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have 2 different computers with windows 8.1 and both have the same exact problem so this must be an issue with a recent update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully there will be another update that will fix this... but in the meantime, please let me know if there are any
 solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jmt</p>

<h2>            Monopoly</h2>
                    
<p>Was unable to find the actual game in the Xbox One individual game forms section. I'm almost certain Microsoft was unaware this game was even being released. I'm having a hard time connecting to game parties. I've done a hard reset of my console, reset my
 router/modem doesn't seem to help much. Other players have expressed the same issue. Is it just me? Or is it xbox live / low player population?</p>

<p>Don't waste your money. This game is junk and nothing but bugs.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to find a game to join. The same 6-8 games have been listed since day one, and you can't join any of them.</p>
<p>If you can eventually find a game (which isn't easy), the first player is the game host. If he/she leaves the game or goes bankrupt, game over for everyone. Found a game last night, played for over an hour with 5 of us. Host went bankrupt, none of the rest
 of us got to finish the game. Ignorant programming not having it pass off the hosting duties.</p>
<p>Plus, every time I play it, it causes system-wide bugs and lockups when I exit the game, requiring a hard reboot EVERY SINGLE TIME.</p>
<p>I'm highly disappointed and wishing I hadn't flushed that money...</p>

<p>Yessss. This game is great idea gone very bad. First of all how do you make a turn base awful with no timers? ? How do you make a turn based game with no timers? So when people are bankrupt they can sit there for two hours without selecting bankrupt until

</p><p class="contentStandard">(Registry shows 944 entries but I do not have the confidence to delete things in the registry)</p>

            <p>Thank you for your generic Microsoft cut and paste 'suggestions'. </p>
<p>Lots of simple basic information which is available elsewhere. </p>
<p>Have tried all the basic stuff otherwise would not be posting here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, have solved the immediate problem and in so doing have incidentally solved the problem where Devices and Printers takes for ever to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further research showed I had many greyed out entries under&nbsp;Universal&nbsp;Serial Bus controllers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I manually 'un-installed' all of the&nbsp;</span></span><span>'Generic volume' greyed out entries and the many greyed out&nbsp;</span><span>entries under&nbsp;Universal&nbsp;Serial Bus controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>This automatically removed the vast majority of the&nbsp;</span>1000 'Generic volume shadow copy'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then manually un-installed the rest of the greyed out ones.</p>
<p>Devices and Printers now loads instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I hope is that the problem does not re-occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is of some help to others with the same problem(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This may not work for everyone and I hasten to add that I am a total amateur!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As always, don't forget to do a backup first (don't bother with Microsoft's methods. They don't work - many posts on this too! I use Macrium Reflect - works well).</span></span></p>

    <title>Halo x for 360 won&#39;t save - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lscitytech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo x for 360 won&#39;t save</h2>
                    
<p>With every Halo game made for the 360 (3, ODST, Reach) I'm having problems saving my campaign or any settings with my XBL account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Games played with a different local account will save. </li><li>Games played while connected to XBL (which is rare) will save. Immediately after cutting the network connection, saved game disappears.
</li><li>No problem saving Halo: CE and Halo 2 games. </li><li>Have removed all Halo content from the hard drive with no positive result. </li><li>Have removed and restored XBL gamertag (several times) with no positive result.
</li><li>No problem with ANY other game </li></ol>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Did you play the Halo 3 multiplayer disc BEFORE actually playing Halo 3? When I first got my Xbox Live, I played the multiplayer for Halo 3, then got Halo 3. I started the campaign for Halo 3, and it won't save my progress every time I turn off my Xbox.
 Did the same, recovered gamertag, cleared chache, even called customer support. This is some sort of anamoly/bug that from what I gathered hasn't been patched. :( So, we may be out of luck.</p>

<p>Yes, Ekisra, I think you are right. This same thing happened to me with the Halo 3 multiplayer disc causing Halo 3 not to save. You can, however, play Halo 3 on another profile that you did NOT play Halo 3 Complete Multiplayer Experience or whatever it's
 called. It will save fine.</p>
