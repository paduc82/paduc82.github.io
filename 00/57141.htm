<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse not working</h2>
                    <p>Just purchased a new Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse bundle (USB connected).</p>
<p>As soon as I plug in the receiver, the computer thinks for a little bit, then comes back with "USB Device Not Recognized".&nbsp; I have removed it, downloaded/installed the newest Microsoft Keyboard Mouse Desktop 2.2 software to no avail.</p>
<p>When I go into the Microsoft Desktop application, it says that it doesn't see any Microsoft Keyboard or Mouse devices, even though they're plugged in and sitting right there, with fresh batteries in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted, I have plugged the receiver into a USB hub, and then directly into the laptop with the same result.&nbsp; I would be happy to even just get one or the other working, but neither will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a Lenovo ThinkPad Helix running Windows 8.1 with 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>I have tried installing it onto a Lenovo T410 laptop running Windows 7 with 8GB of RAM and receive the same "USB Device Not Recognized" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I have a faulty receiver, or is this neat looking keyboard/mouse just not very reliable?</p>
<p>With it being a Microsoft device, I figured it'd be fairly quick and simple to installed, but I seem to be mistaken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas/suggestions are greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Bryan,<br />
<br />
1. Are all the other USB devices getting recognized? <br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>I would you to connect the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard and Mouse to the different USB ports on the computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As per the keyboard center at Microsoft Hardware website, there are no driver for Windows 8.1. The latest one is for Windows 8. I would suggest you to download and install the latest software in Windows Compatibility
 mode. This might fix the issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Refer<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> to the link to download the latest software:</span><br />

            <p>Still receiving the error that the "Last USB device you plugged in is not recognized or malfunctioning", even after uninstalling the Keyboard and Mouse software and re-installing it with the Windows 8 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used three other wireless USB mice, and one other wireless keyboard, and they all work perfectly fine.&nbsp; One was&nbsp;a Logitech mouse, one a Lenovo mouse, and one an older Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3000.&nbsp; They keyboard I'm currently using is a Logitech
 wireless, and again, no&nbsp;issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only having issues with the expensive Sculpt keyboard and mouse...which is a bit frustrating...especially considering it&nbsp;they are&nbsp;"Microsoft" branded devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Dell Inspirion 15R, Windows 8.1 (fully patched), a Logitech mouse m305, and a MS Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard. &nbsp;The keyboard worked at first, but then would stop and the laptop would not recognize it (as the person above mentioned).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all of the suggestions above.. the driver is listed in the device drivier list, when I troubleshoot it says it is there, but keeps telling me it is incompatible. &nbsp;I've tried setting the Microsoft Keyboard and Mouse software to 8.0, and 7.0.. still
 no help. &nbsp;(this is also happening on my Surface which is also at 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>

            <p>I am also getting the USB not recognized or malfunctioning error. Summary:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sculpt ergonomic desktop (keyboard band mouse)</li><li>Windows 10</li><li>The keyboard and mouse both work fine for about 10 minutes</li><li>Then I get the error. </li><li>Keyboard, Mouse, and USB receiver are all still listed as connected in "connected devices"</li><li>Changing usb port does not make a difference. </li><li>Rebooting does not make a difference</li><li>Reinstalling the MS software (in different compatibility modes) brought short-lived success</li></ul>
<p>Bottom line: It is functioning, not a hardware problem, but it ALWAYS stops working in a few minutes and then is very difficult to get working again, and then it stops AGAIN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off all power saving stuff I can find, and also looked for conflicts, but nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have advice or similar experience? I have implemented every fix I have found on the net to no avail.

            How did you get them to send you a new keyboard?&nbsp;I spent an hour on web chat with them today and their only advice was to drive to the local Microsoft store to have it fixed.&nbsp; that store happens to be 4 hours away from me.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 wifi issues</h2>
                    Recently purchased a surface laptop 2 from my local electronics store and iv'e only just started using it thoroughly and ive noticed the wifi drops out while im watching 4k videos on youtube and i tried downloading a file on chrome and edge (tested both)
 and the download speed is pretty bad. it spikes to 2mbps and then drops really low around 10-100kbps and then completely stops downloading, if i download something on utorrent i get about 12mbps strong and steady. my internet connection is solid on all devices
 in the house and have no issues downloading large files from web and utorrent. i noticed the wifi signal stays connected im not getting a warning about limited access etc unless i watch 4k quality videos on youtube. ive tried updating driver's, removing and
 reinstalling drivers, flushing through cmd.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
my modem/router is a netgear nighthawk d7000, i have fibre to the premises and on 100download/40upload plan.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is not the problem with joystick. I have tried many joysticks, all of them worked individually. But when connected together only one works. There is no such problem in my friend's laptop. Why I am facing such problem? Please help me.</p>

    <title>External Mouse Scrolling in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donbme  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Mouse Scrolling in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a 3 week old HP touchsmart 15 with windows 8.1 installed from the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I have added an external Microsoft mouse but I can't seem to be able to keep the mouse from scrolling 20+ lines at a time.</p>
<p>I have gone to Settings numerous times (when I turn it on and also while I"m using it) and changed it to 6 or 8 lines per scroll of the wheel and it keeps going back to 20+ lines per scroll of the wheel. &nbsp; I have not seen any spot that says to save or apply
 these changes so I simply 'x' out of settings when I"m done.</p>
<p>Is there some way to make this stay at 6 or 8 lines per scroll?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated...thank you</p>
<p>don</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>I do not know what the model # of the mouse is but it is a Microsoft mouse for a laptop with a USB plug in so it is wireless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it is a Microsoft mouse chances are that you have installed <strong>Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center</strong> in which case you would have
<strong>mousinfo.exe</strong> which could help you identify your mouse.&nbsp; More significantly though, you would see how options for your wheel had been set.&nbsp; Then you would go to
<em>PC Settings Mouse and Touchpad</em> to see if your changes with MMKC were being sensed there...(?) &nbsp;Apparently not.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't know where the
<em>Roll the mouse wheel to scroll One screen at a time</em> is found in MMKC.&nbsp; But also note that MMKC can let you say that you don't think much of scrolling in IE (for example).&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OIC.&nbsp; There are actually 3 parts to this mess.&nbsp; The Desktop Mouse Properties has a Wheel tab and that relates to the MUF
<em>Mouse and Touchpad</em> settings page and then in the MMKC Wheel dialog we get to change how many interrupts we will be generating when we spin the wheel.&nbsp; (I think.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mousinfo <em>Scrolling Monitor</em> tab may give you a clue about what your combination of settings is accomplishing.&nbsp; However, I have yet to decipher exactly what it is supposed to be showing us.&nbsp; There is a continuous&nbsp;green line which goes up and down
 and there are a bunch of white bars, sometimes with a different height,&nbsp;which get deposited on the X-axis while the green line is being drawn.&nbsp; Any guesses?&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also, that another alternative, which I sometimes resort to in exasperation, is making the Wheel click (i.e. Wheel press down and hold) a Middle-click.&nbsp; Then I can engage AutoScroll and turn off or ignore the wheel interrupts however they happen and
 whatever they may mean to an app.</p>

I have a similar problem and need your help. <br />
<br />
I've tried installing the <a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/UDF-Reader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UDF reader driver</a> for my WinXp SP3 and making sure that Nero burns the DVD in 1.02 UDF version, but the disk is still being unreadable by the system.<br />
<br />
What else am I missing?<br />

p.s. My Disc Device is PIONEER DVD-RW&nbsp; DVR-215D.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I grab this as a desktop background? It vanishes when I enter my PIN and reverts to the standard desktop choices, or my own set of photos.</p>

<p>I copied the files from 'assets', renamed those of reasonable size and found some photos that I have seen , but not all. Is there, maybe, another cache somewhere?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mart - just for info - to save time copying and altering the assets folder contents I set the 'View' tab to
 'Open With' and then 'Paint'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another useful method of acquiring most past and present spotlight images (and current Bing daily images) is by downloading the free
<strong>'Dynamic Theme' </strong>app from the Windows store (although there is no detail supplied in 'properties' unfortunately) - Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>Hi Amirali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most blue screen errors are caused by faulty or out-of-date drivers. <strong>DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE</strong> is usually encountered when you put your computer to sleep or take it out from sleep, and the device driver doesn't doesn't respond or is inconsistent.
 Other causes of blue screen errors are compatibility issues and abrupt changes on the system, and so, we would like to know, were there any changes made on the system prior to the issue? What action triggered the blue screen error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this, we suggest starting your PC in Safe Mode with Networking, and then update or remove the faulty driver. To start your PC in safe mode with networking, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode with networking, open Device Manager and check for device drivers with a red or yellow symbol beside it. This is an indication that there is an issue with the driver. If there is none, use the Driver Verifier to help identify the faulty driver.
 Here is a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">forum article</a></strong> by ZigZag3143 (MS-MVP) for your reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have identified the driver, uninstall it by right-clicking on the device, and then clicking
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. After uninstalling, restart your PC. This will remove the faulty driver and reinstall a generic driver. Manually downloading and then installing the latest driver from the manufacturer also helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you encounter further issues, let us know.</p>

<h3> mroll60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Export Accounts &#38; Mail from Live Mail 2012 to Outlook Office 365</h2>
                    <p>I have two new Windows 8.1 computers running Office 365 and I have two older home computers running windows live mail 2012. I want to move the mail and accounts across to the new platforms. WLM has an export function for the messages and accounts. However
 I cannot export as an exchange pst from the old machine, because it searches for outlook on the old computer and it's obviously only installed on the new computers. Outlook 365 does not appear to have an import function for anything other than a pst. WLM will
 export account information to an .iaf file, but outlook 365 does not appear to have an import function. Can anyone advise how to migrate from WLM 2012 to Outlook 365. Both computers have very large archives of mail which must be retained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the only way to achieve this; Install WLM on the new machines and delete after use?</p>

<p>I've never heard of anyone who has managed this feat, but that doesn't mean to say that it can't be done. People don't usually come to forums to enthuse about something that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you'll have to install Windows Live Mail on the new machines, because the only mechanism for moving messages from Windows Live Mail to Outlook requires a working instance of Outlook on the same machine. Messages are then exported to the current Outlook
 profile. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the store folder from the old machine to the default location on the new machine (C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail) before installing Windows Essentials. The installer should find the store folder and take it into use. Once
 it's done so, you can use the <em>Export email&nbsp;&gt; Email messages </em>to export the messages to Outlook on the same machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Outlook can't import IAF files, you'll have to set up the accounts manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this was successful.</p>

<h2>            Skype Group Call - Can&#39;t see all participants</h2>
                    <p>I hosted a Skype group call with 17 other participants today, using Skype installed in my Windows laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meeting, everyone was given a chance to speak in turn. I tried to select the video of the speaker each time, but the videos of only 5 speakers show up in circles on the top right, and the rest were grouped and shown as +8 in the far left circle. When
 I clicked on the circle that said +8, I saw the list of the names of the participants, and I clicked on it, but I was not able to make them appear on my screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another way to select the participants who will show up on my screen? Do I have to change any settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, one of the circles on the top right had a white rim around it. What does that mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help asap.</p>

</p><p>For the circles with&nbsp;white rim you're seeing on the top right, can you provide a screenshot of that?</p>

<p>I am using the version of Skype which can host up to 25 people.</p>
<p>I got the below photo from the Skype website, and you can see the circles showing the faces of participants that do not show up on the main screen. The far right square is the host, the middle circle is the other participant, and the circle on the left is
 where the other remaining participants will show. When I hosted the 18 people group call, the left circle showed +8. I want to find out how I can choose one of those +8 people who was speaking to show up on the main screen. Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>Yes, it can accommodate up to 25 participants. The 10 was for the classic version, sorry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The participants' feed should automatically display on the screen, once that participant speaks. If this doesn't happen, try resetting your Skype app by uninstalling and reinstalling it.</p>
<p>

<p>You bought the DLC? As in the skins? DAMN, that's dedication. I bought one, but thats because I had some spare MS points from XBL rewards. As stated though, it is just for employee's, like the flaming recon for Halo 3.

<p>It's meant to be an employee only skin but people are using a save editor to unlock all the developer content. So don't take the players word that they work for Epic just because they have the transparent weapon skins.</p>

<p>Late reply, but I think its a bit unfair to just call people gullible because they bought it. People can buy anything they want if they find value you it, everyone spends hundreds of pounds of Iphones and I think they are worthless pieces of trash. They
 could have put it in the game for free, but they didn't because people would pay money. Its a business and they will look for openings in the market whereby they can exploit there customers, but if the customer thinks it is worth it then that is all that matters.</p>

            Hi Viking
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />If you happen to be using Edge and you get and error when you load a site requiring Flash, it's possible it's just disabled.
<br />
<br />To change that, open the More actions menu in the top right corner of the Edge browser, scroll down, click the View advanced settings menu then toggle on Adobe Flash Player. Refresh the web page or close Microsoft Edge then open it again. In rare cases, you might need to restart your computer
<br />
<br />If there's no overt signs on the page that Flash needs to be enabled, but you still sense that there is some missing content, then it's possible that Flash content isn't loading.  This may be by design; as a security measure, Microsoft is limiting the use of Flash where ever it can. So, if you are greeted by a web page with only a puzzle symbol, don't be puzzled. Instead, look in the address bar, then click the puzzle icon. From here, you can choose whether you want to allow the website you are viewing to always run Adobe Flash or Allow it once.
<br />Update Adobe Flash Player in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Since Microsoft bundled Adobe Flash in Windows, you also get Adobe Flash updates via Windows Update. So, if you have tried all the above and Flash still refuses to load in Microsoft Edge, you likely need to install an update.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install the latest update for Flash if it's available.
<br />
<br />Sometimes even Windows Update might prove problematic when installing updates for Flash Player updates. What you can do is download the update for Flash Player manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. We showed you how to do that in our previous article on how to install Windows updates manually.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems viewing Flash content, then you might want to try to repair or reset Microsoft Edge.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-microsoft-edge-web-browser-windows-10-1709/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-m...</a>
<br />
<br />What About Other Web Browsers?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 bundles Adobe Flash for use with the Edge browser. If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers, you will need to either enable or download then install Adobe Flash manually. In Chrome, when you visit a website that requires Flash, click the Secure menu in the left of the address bar then click Site settings.
<br />
<br />Scroll down, click in the list box for Flash then select Allow.
<br />
<br />If Flash still does not work, you likely need to update it. In the Chrome address bar, type chrome://components then hit Enter. Scroll down then click Check for the update under Flash Player.
<br />Mozilla Firefox
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe's download page where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

            Hi, Viking,
<br />
<br />On your computer, open Chrome.
<br />In the address bar at the top, enter chrome://components and press Enter.
<br />Look for "Adobe Flash Player."
<br />Click Check for update.
<br />If you see "Component not updated" or "Component updated," you're on the latest version.
<br />Go back to the page with the Flash content. If it doesn't open automatically, at the top left, click Reload .
<br />
<br />On your computer, open Chrome.
<br />At the top right, click More .
<br />Click Update Google Chrome. If you don't see this button, you're on the latest version.
<br />Click Relaunch.

<p>I've checked chrome and i'm already on the latest version of flash. As stated previously, I use chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is some type of windows update issue due to the timing and the fact everything worked fine before the updates I listed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The poker site i'm playing on is not 'browser based', it's a stand alone downloaded poker client and therefore i'm not playing with any browser open.</p>

<p>Is your device throwing any errors in Device Manager?&nbsp; Can you Add a Device in Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Devices and Printers, follow the "not finding what you are looking for" link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your device work on another (older) computer?&nbsp; It is not faulty in other words?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps you can use a Virtual Machine solution to run a compatible operating system, or dual boot?&nbsp; You will need a Product Key for XP etc.</p>

<p>You can run even older operating systems than XP in virtual machines, or dual boot them with Windows 8 as long as you have the CD and any required Product Key.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the game. Have you tried to uninstall and reinstall the game. Also Are you trying to play the game on your main account or a secondary account?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p><span>In the Search box, type <strong>CMD</strong></span></p>

I would like to inform you that in Feedback app there is an option to select Store, so you can select that option while providing feedback regarding Store issues.</p>

<h2>            Installed SSD, Can&#39;t use alot of things on HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently installed an SSD in my PC and put windows 10 on it (my old HDD also had windows on it). But now I can't seem to use a lot of the stuff on the HDD. I can still click on it and see all files but when I try to open a program I seem to get an error
 every time. It's a different error for each program though. Does anyone know what's going on?</p>

            Hi Lucky
<br />
<br />Do you mean your programs (software) are installed on the HDD from the previous installation?
<br />
<br />If so, that won't work, you need to install those into the Windows that is on the SSD
<br />
<br />When you install software into Windows that installs files into many folders and creates a lot of registry keys, those will be missing from the new Windows 10 installation on the SSD, so you need to install all 3rd party applications again       
        </p>
