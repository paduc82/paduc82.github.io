    <title>Custom Keybinding for Xbox Elite Controller on Win10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qyntus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Keybinding for Xbox Elite Controller on Win10&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>While I absolutely love the new Elite Controller, I'd like to be able to bind different keys to all the buttons instead of just reassigning existing buttons (e.g. Left-Mouse Click to Lower-Left Paddle).</p>
<p>Is this functionality something that will be part of a future update? Is there a way outside of the official app to make this happen? I can't seem to make it work with Joy2Key.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I second this. &nbsp;I bought this controller exclusively for use with PC games. &nbsp;I was expecting four new buttons, not four duplicate buttons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that xbox only supports a limited number of input values, and that non-xbox values can't be stored in the on-board profile memory. &nbsp;However, as a PC gamer I have no use for profile memory and would happily do without it in exchange for the ability
 to map the controller buttons to arbitrary values. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Accessories app is already able to differentiate between the four new paddles and the normal keys. &nbsp;There should be no difficulty in exposing a Windows-only configuration type that allows arbitrary mappings for PC games using local disc storage instead
 of the on-board memory.</p>
<p>Also, a note for the mods: &nbsp;I've been trying to post this on the feedback site but I can't complete it with any browser, so I'm posting it here instead.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You can't in Windows Photo Gallery. Some camera maker's provide utilities for importing pictures that may
<br />
have more functionality. Also there are some&nbsp;3rd party utlities which may help - use Bing or Google.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 new install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ibbeebee2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 new install</h2>
                    <p>I have been using windows 10 sense 12/08/2016 &amp; I have always meant to do a clean install &amp; now have the opportunity. I was trying to uninstall an earlier version of Flash &amp; the app hung. I was able to continue as normal but the next time I started the computer
 it hung. After rebooting the repair utility attempted a repair &amp; failed. I had neglected to download the windows&nbsp; 10 creation utility so couldn't go any further. I installed windows 7 on another small drive &amp; then saved my Docs &amp; everything else I need from
 the install including the Windows 10 Upgrade folder. I now have a copy of the Media Creation Tool on an 8 GB USB stick&amp; have downloaded all of the windows 10 drivers available for my motherboard &amp; video card. &nbsp;I would like to do a clean install over the top
 of&nbsp; &nbsp;my existing copy of windows 10 . Is&nbsp; &nbsp;there anything else that I will need for a new install? and also where is my digital Licence stored?
</p>
<p>Regards David&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Leviathan DLC...SPOILERS AHEAD&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahnariprellik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Leviathan DLC...SPOILERS AHEAD&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So not to beat a dead horse that's already been beat to dust by now ( I contributed a few blows myself lol) but I feel that the Leviathan DLC is further proof of the Indoc Theory and that there is more to come ending wise later on down the road. The revelations
 at the end of the DLC and the mentions of indoctrination and Shepards increased exposure, to Reapers artifacts, indoctrinated humans, and even the first Reapers themselves, is overwhelming in this DLC. Either Bioware is just rubbing the Indoc Theory in the
 noses of those who came up with it, or they simply have more up their sleeves than we currently know. Also we know a Take Back Omega DLC is coming eventually which makes me think, are all the single player DLC's gonna give us more information/weapons/allies
 to battle the Reapers? Something important to Cerberus, who are so indoctrinated in ME3 to the point where they may as well be Reapers themselves, has to have been on Omega for them to seize it and I am assuming make it their new base of operations.A Reaper
 artifact maybe? A weapon/device that would allow the Illusive Man to control them/Shepard destroy them depending on who decided to use it? Seems to me like all the single player DLC may add options for a final DLC where we can choose from the different options
 how we would like to go about defeating the Reapers and there would be a different outcome/ending for each one and depending on the choices made across all 3 Mass Effect games and your EMS, you could have at least one where you can come out unscathed and still
 save the day.Another observation is during all the ending controversy why were the devs saying on Twitter, hold onto your saves, meaning end games saves after the terrible ending, not the one right before the Illusive Man's base, if there wasn't some sort
 of post game DLC coming. Also I watched the extended cut on youtube for the destroy ending and wouldn't you know the scene with Shepard taking a breathe in the rubble is still there. That alone leaves the possibility of indoctrination. There is no way he survived
 a fall to Earth from the Citadel, burning up in the atmosphere, then rubble landing on top of him. He's only human for crying out loud.Anyway, what are everyone's thoughts on Leviathan? Is there a point for single player DLC at this point based on how the
 original endings went? Even game journalists are caling for DLC to completely change the endings now as they are saying Leviathan is pointless without a new ending because the new war assets, etc. make no difference when you factor in that everything ends
 the same regardless. </p>

<p>"we know a Take Back Omega DLC is coming"? &nbsp;Don't get me wrong I'd love to see it but I'm not so sure it "is coming", in fact after the lukewarm reception to 'Leviathan', I wouldn't be so sure that ANY more SP DLC "is coming". &nbsp;I still subscribe to the 'Indoctrination
 Theory' as well for it's the only explanation that makes any real sense to me, each to their own but it works for me, I still feel like I'm indoctrinated while playing the single player campaign for this game and the ending is when that "reality" becomes fully
 realised, for me, there really is no other explanation...:-)</p>

<p>See I noticed something else while working on my second playthrough on my main Shep. At the beginning on Mars, when you first get attacked by Eva and Liara says Illusive Man got the last piece of data but most of the plans for the Crucible were still in
 tact, did we ever hear that last piece mentioned again during the story? I am thinking the only way Bioware could pull off adding a Indoc Theory DLC would be to have us track down the Illusive Man prior to him warning the Reapers about us using the Citadel
 with the Catalyst and kill him so he can't warn them and when we do find him, you'll find something to use with the Catalyst so that it will only destroy the Reapers and not all synthetics, at his new base on Omega, which is likely the only place he could
 be when he speaks with you after you beat Cerberus Headquarters. Also even with the extended cut they don't explain why Harbinger still flies off or why/how Anderson gets to the beam and into the Citadel unscathed when he would have had to run straight to
 Harbinger like you were. I just can't bring myself to believe Bioware would leave the story like that. Also the breathe scene is still there in Extended Cut I think if you have high enough EMS. If they really wanted to kill the Indoc Theory they would have
 removed that scene, but they didn't. Lastly, after watching the after credits teaser scene again I think there will be some post breath scene DLC. Take this last line as evidence. Kid: Did that all really happen? Stargazer: Yes...but some of the details have
 been lost to time (the single player DLC that is coming soon). Kid: Can you tell me any more stories about The Shepard. Stargazer: Well...it's getting late (in the console cycle maybe?) but ok. One more story. Mind you that last line was referring to one more
 story after Shepard allegedly defeats the Reapers, I am assuming Leviathan is part of the original story prior to the credits. This seems to me to be hinting that something else is coming that will drastically change the ending. My guess is Bioware wanted
 to change the ending when the original got leaked about a month before the game came out. They were pressured by EA to get the game out on time so they penned the ending we have now, Extended Cut included, however, I think they fully planned to work on a better
 more fitting ending as DLC. The only question now is will it be free or will we have to pay?</p>

<p>Also just remember that in the mission where you speak with the ex-Cerberus scientists and rescue them, the female scientist that Jacob is with mentions her work on some implants that would essentially prevent Indoctrination. She described it as something
 that the Illusive Man had them research regarding how to break the link the Reapers used to communicate with the Collectors. I am wondering if this will factor in to any future DLC somehow. If all DLC packs are like Leviathan and change the ending slightly,
 depending on how many they release and how extensive they are we may get the ending(s) we were promised after all.</p>

<p>I think there is lot's of hidden DLC clues in the game. For example if you did not kill Balak &nbsp;in ME1 bring down the sky DLC then when in ME3 and a C-sec agents asks you to help out with old Batarian codes when you get to the last one you find Balak and
 he mentions the Leviathan "Leviathan of dis the ancient organic dreadnought my people found, heard of it". the same with Omega when talking to Aria. And I am still holding out hope though ill fated that we can go give support to Kal'reegar and get him as a
 squad mate, also hopeing for more on Rannoch and Thessia. &nbsp;I think most if not all future DLC will be come from some line of dialog or from a line in a message that has been there before any of the DLC where released. I would also love to see that with every
 DLC Shepherd learns more about the Reapers and the more she/he learns about them the more ending options are presented(but only if you complete said DLC, you should be able to get DLC endings with out playing it, as for the original endings I wont go there
 ) . That way the endings kind of make sense(but not really) in the sense of if you don't play the DLC then your Shepherd dose not learn about the reapers and can't make the decisions about some thing she/he dose not know. Also would like to see a DLC based
 on the weapon that destroyed a Reaper in ME2 where you get the Reaper IFF from. &nbsp;Just some of my early morning precaffeine thoughts.</p>

<p>Noticed something else when playing earlier. If you read the entry in Liara's Shadow Broker messages that talks about finding a way to control the Crucible's bursts when it fires. Now the bursts in the original endings look kinda spontaneous and not really
 controlled or directed at all other than following a path toward all the Mass Relays. I think maybe the Illusive Man has a missing component to the Crucible that would allow Shepard(maybe Anderson?) to control it and make it so it only kills the Reapers and
 spares EDI and the friendly Geth. I can't be the only one who wanted to see the Geth and the Quarians fighting along side each other to take back and rebuild Rannoch.</p>

<p>Just thought of something that doesn't make sense. If the Reapers supposedly built the Citadel and were aware that we had the Catalyst and knew that it could wipe them out when used with the Citadel, why didn't all the Reapers just blast the Citadel to peaces?
 Why let it even get to the Citadel? I'm not entirely &nbsp;certain at this point that anything after Shepards last dream before Cerberus HQ happened the way we saw it happen.</p>

<p>[quote user="ahnariprellik"]I'm not entirely &nbsp;certain at this point that anything after Shepards last dream before Cerberus HQ happened the way we saw it happen.[/quote]This would make the most sense. After she/he makes whatever choice on the citadel she/he
 wakes up this time for real with L,I then we go kick the Reapers to whatever black hole they crawled out of. And no your not the only one that wants to see at least one mission where the Geth and Quarians are retaking Rannoch( that is if you made peace with
 the geth)</p>

 connection it then prompts me to give “additional authentication” and another option to enter a “Alternative MAC address” (which I have done manual at least 4 times) I looked on the older questions and answers about people who had this similar problem and
 tried it all multiple times and nothing seems to be working!! Everything else can connect to the internet and works perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For reference</p>

<p>I have turned my Xbox One on and off</p>
<p>i have hard reset my Xbox One&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reset my router&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have tried an alternate MAC address gained from my PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>And sadly I have no ethernet or mobile hotspot to try to connect to the Xbox One</p>

            Same! My PS4, Phone and computer are perfectly fine. Reset my router and nothing. I can't access game pass or any of the services I spend good money to Microsoft to enjoy. This started 2 days ago...Very frustrating.

            Здравствуйте!
<br />Как вы уже знаете, Windows 7 и Windows 10 это совершенно различные ОС.
<br />7ка может стабильно работать на вашем оборудовании, а 10ка "зависать".
<br />В первую очередь советую вам уточнить у производителя ноутбука информацию о совместимости его с Windows 10.
<br />В момент выхода 10ки обновлялись все устройства, даже с ней несовместимые.
<br />Ответ производителя ноутбука напишите здесь.       
        </p>

Возможно, т. к. в 2015 г. такого не было. Интересно, что зависает строго раз в 3-4 дня.

<p><strong><span>Hi Champions05,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Do you have Service pack installed for Windows Vista?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to use the below provided methods and check -<br />
</span></strong><strong><span><br />
<span>Method 1: <br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>You can get a new IP address for your computer. You might need to do this if you are having connection problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start. Type&nbsp;<strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp;<br />
b. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and /)<br />
The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. ipconfig /release in the command prompt and press ENTER. This releases your current IP address.<br />
d. ipconfig /renew in the command prompt and press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The DHCP configuration for all adapters will be renewed. To renew the IP address for a<br />
specific adapter, type the adapter name that appears when you type ipconfig at the command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
<span>If the issue persists and you do not have Windows Vista Service Pack installed &nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>then you may refer to the below link and check if using the hot fix assists you resolve
 the issue -</span></span></p>

I'm running the tests as Administrator.<br />
This continuous restart of IIS is preventing my endurance tests run.<br />
<br />
I'm the only Admin user on that computer, no other applications are running on the machine.<br />
<br />
I've found some similar questions and I've tried their solutions without success.<br />

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your Skype&nbsp;contact has a mobile number attached to his account or, if you have called a mobile number and added that number as a contact to your contact list, look for the "<em>via Skype</em>" option at the top left side of the chat window.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click the "<strong>v</strong>" arrow, an option "<em>Send SMS</em>" will be shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro in Latitude 3540 Sometimes Won&#39;t Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I try to shutdown my machine and all led lights goes off, hd, LCD goes black and power led still lid. I need to press Power Button to force windows to shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a clean install: installing the Dell device drivers, tried using the windows drivers, no success at all. I tried even change the memory sticks but at the end I got the same results: if I try to make the laptop go to sleep or shutdown after some period
 of time I experience the results explained above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go back to Windows 8.1 everything goes fine: no issues with sleep or shutdown routines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have some clue?</p>

            <p>Thank you Anup but this won't solve my problem. The troubleshooter just suggest to change to default Power Plan, I followed the suggestion with no better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to sure that I don't have any issues with memory sticks I left the machine running Memtest86+ (live cd) all night long with no single memory error. So, isn't a hardware problem too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying and I really planning to go back to Windows 8.1 since in this version I have no issues at all.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research by my self and some people at Dell forum indicated that Intel Management Interface Driver that came with Windows 10 could be the reason of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I made a Factory Reset (restored the Windows Install) and installed the Dell recommended Intel Management driver. with Notebook in offline mode (not connected to Internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I tested from 2 days and till now the machine is sleeping and shutting down properly, so I'm extending this test for more 2 days to check if this is really the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If is positive, maybe Microsoft double check the issues with the provided driver or remove it from automatic driver update.</p>

            <p>Hi Anup!&nbsp;I have good news!<br />
<br />
I have been successful to install Windows 10 in Dell Latitude 3540 15 series doing this:<br />
<br />
1. I Bring the Notebook offline (removed lan cable and not connecting it to internet)<br />
<br />
2. I made a clean Windows 10 Install (changed BIOS to use UEFI, pressing F12 key at boot time)<br />
<br />
I Installed the following Drivers from Dell Support Site:<br />
<br />
3. Intel Management Engine Interface<br />
<br />
4. Audio Drivers<br />
<br />
5. Wifi and Bluetooth Drivers<br />
<br />
6. TouchPad<br />
<br />
And finally, I rebooted and connected the notebook to internet. Them, Windows downloaded the remaining Video Drivers, Card Reader drivers an so on.<br />
<br />
After this my Latitude 3540 suspend, shutdown and reboot with no freezes at all. No need to change any power settings, or run further diagnostics: Windows 10 is running flawless.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this little tutorial can help any people experiencing the same issues as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 User Upgraded From Windows 7 Authentication Issue With - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmblaney1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 User Upgraded From Windows 7 Authentication Issue With Single Software App</h2>
                    <p>The Issue:&nbsp; I see lots of issues users are having with Administrative permission to change their settings, etc.&nbsp; As far as I can tell this is not my problem -- fingers crossed!.&nbsp; My issue is with a single software product by MakeMusic.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Details:&nbsp; I have purchased their Finale PrintMusic 2014 product, actually upgrading from an older version (PM 2004).&nbsp; I have the product serial number.&nbsp; I acquired PM 2014 by downloading as a 30-day trial.&nbsp; Before the 30 days, you need to authorize the product
 or else you lose the ability to save or print your work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Error:&nbsp; Each time I try to authorize PM, it throws an error saying I need to log on as administrator.&nbsp; But I am an administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Analysis:&nbsp; This is Windows Home if that makes any difference.&nbsp; I understand a Windows account either has admin authority or not.&nbsp; There are no progressive levels.&nbsp; I have been back and forth numerous times with their help desk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Upgraded:&nbsp; They told me they are getting similar queries, not with PM on Windows 10 out of the box, but Windows 10 when upgraded from a prior version (like me -- I upgraded from Windows 7).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Collaboration:&nbsp; If they are in touch with Microsoft on this issue, they are not sharing that with me, and they are asking me to reach out to Microsoft myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting to the Heart of It:&nbsp; It gets tricky from here.&nbsp; Their method of authorization is their secret, so they can't tell me exactly the nature of the failure to authorize, and there is no installation or operation log.&nbsp; I am truly at a loss and any assistance
 would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

            Hello Pavan, thanks for ringing in and offering a good, basic first step.&nbsp; Be assured I have tried this step several times, without success.&nbsp; The publisher states they are experiencing this with users in Windows 10 who upgraded from Windows 7 or 8.&nbsp; (Update:&nbsp;
 about 20 users who upgraded from Windows 7.)&nbsp; They state their authorization routine goes pretty deep into the registry and its details are confidential.&nbsp; Question for you:&nbsp; Aside from this one application (MakeMusic - Finale - PrintMusic) are you experiencing
 similar issues from users of other applications?&nbsp; Your support is appreciated and I will appreciate any further information.&nbsp;

            &nbsp;When you say, revert to your 2010 version: I was unable to use my older version either; it was PrintMusic 2004. it was giving me the same administrator error. I thought that buying PrintMusic 2014 would overcome that issue. Unfortunately it was the same
 issue with either version -- 2004 or 2014. Please write back and let me know if you were successful with your older version -- &nbsp;that is, if you were able to authorize your PrintMusic 2010. I think what's in common is moving from one environment to another.
 In the case of PrintMusic 2004, I had it installed on a different machine and in a different version of Windows. Actually I think it was XP. On my present machine, when I updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I had to give up my old Windows user ID and I wonder
 if it has something to do with it. &nbsp;I am optimistic that MakeMusic will resolve this issue in good time, especially if we work with them and let them know we are waiting and are willing to provide information and any test

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash. You may scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted
 files by running the System File Checker (SFC) tool. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. You may check the article below for the steps.</p>

<h2>            How to prevent my soon to be ex husband in monitoring my account in Family Safety&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I feel, as an adult, this is a violation of privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know if this monitoring under parental settings gives him access to my email accounts or social media accounts and I would like to know what he can view and also if there is anything I can do
 to block him from using this program to "spy" on me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi kyliedog,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting query. I understand how are you feeling and let me try to assist you. Regarding the access on your email accounts/social media accounts, he cannot access it unless he has your passwords. As for the information he can view, he can only
 see the activities (Example:&nbsp;The websites you&nbsp;just visit and how often.)&nbsp;you made on the user account he is monitoring if he is really using Family Safety. As for the blocking of the program, what you can do is to uninstall the Family Safety program using
 the administrator user account of the computer. You can do it by following these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Press <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> + <span style="font-weight: bold">
R</span>, input <span style="font-weight: bold">AppWiz.cpl</span>, and click <span style="font-weight: bold">
OK</span></font>.</p>
<p>2. Select <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Essentials 2012/Windows Live Essentials</span>, click
Remove</span></font>.</p>
<p>3. Click <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Remove one or more Windows Essentials programs</font></span>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Tick <strong>Family Safety</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Uninstall</font></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, to further investigate the issue, we would like to ask for the affected Microsoft account you are using. Kindly provide it in the private message area for privacy reasons. You can access it by signing in to Microsoft Community and hit
<strong>Private Messages</strong> button in line with All Replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Thank you for providing those details. After checking the account, we have determined that your soon to be ex-husband is not monitoring your e-mail address using Family Safety. It seems
 that he only setup a Family Safety to monitor the local standard account on the computer.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>What you need to do to prevent this from happening in the future is to use an administrator account when accessing the computer, because Family Safety cannot monitor an account that
 has Administrator privileges. </font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>However, If you don't have an administrator account and you access the computer using standard user account, there is no way to remove the settings of Family Safety because it will
 still&nbsp;recognize you as a child user even you are an adult and this is working by design.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you really want to remove it, you should ask your soon to be ex-husband to&nbsp;give you a separate local account on that computer that has an Administrator privileges.</font></span></p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I have seached and tried all the suggestions from Google but they aren't the solutions I can use. I don't have the entire Outlook Express folder just 2 .dbx files. I need to convert them to .pst or at least have the ability to import them into Outlook 2007.
 I could only recover 2 .dbx files from the old computer and am running WIndows 7 Professional with Outlook 2007 on the new computer that I want to get the 2 .dbx files into. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

 You might also try DBXpress on the old drive if it is still accessible, it might be able to recover more messages than what is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the two dbx files.</div>

<p>if you don't have the folders.dbx file, afaik, you will need to get a utility that exports the dbx to individual eml files before you can import them into outlook.</p>
<p>I'm going to move this thread to the windows xp forum - the guys there can suggest utilities to work with the dbx.</p>

<p>Yea...that&nbsp;should work...I didn't realize you were able to do that...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can, Delete the entire partition(s)...if you can reformat it to NTFS in Linux, you could do that too, or just wait and do it in Windows.</p>

            Hi HIMADRIDAS2 
<br />
<br />From that web page, you can download and create Installation media for Windows 10
<br />
<br />That is free to do, but it is not an evaluation copy, it is the full version.
<br />
<br />That will install, but it will not be activated, you must then after a few days, purchase a Windows 10 licence . . .       
        </p>

            Hi HIMADRIDAS2,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />You can download Media Creation Tool and make a bootable USB to install Windows 10 on your device. To get a trial product key you can use one from : <a href="https://productkeysdl.com/windows-10-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://productkeysdl.com/windows-10-product-key/</a> picking one for the Edition you are going to install (Home or Pro).
<br />These key will activate temporanely Windows 10, giving you the opportunity to decide if you want to buy a legal key or uninstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you have other doubts.

<h3> robndawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home The User Profile Service failed the Logon User Profile cannot be loaded</h2>
                    <p>I am really hoping someone can help me with this problem.&nbsp; I noticed when posting that there were several similar matches to my problem however each suggestion I tried following did not correct the problem so I decided to start a new chain.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 with 3 user accounts, 1 for me (Admin) and 2 for my kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in October when I went to log into my account after an automatic update, I received the following message:&nbsp; "The User Profile Service service failed the logon&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Profile
 cannot be loaded".&nbsp; This first came up on my primary admin account but I was still able to get into my files under my childrens accounts.&nbsp; A couple of months ago I started receiving the same error message on my daughter's account so now I can only access my
 computer through my sons account.&nbsp; I really need to get this fixed and would appreciate any advice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note this problem is with my Admin account so many of the recommended solutions do not work because when I am prompted to give admin permission, my password is not accepted due to error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed posts that recommend I start simple by creating a new user profile but because my admin profile is not working, I receive an error message that I do not have the correct permissions.&nbsp; I've followed instructions trying to get me into the c:\windows\system32
 command prompt but I receive an error message that windows cannot find that location.&nbsp; I've gone into the registry and tried keying in specific fixes but again no luck.&nbsp; Also tried restarting in safe mode but no success.&nbsp; I am willing to retry some of these
 at your suggestion but just wanted to put out there what I have tried so far.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; I mentioned above have 3 user accounts, and by that I mean available to log into once the computers turns on, not sure if it matters but there are far many more options when I look at C:\Users.&nbsp; There are the 3 accounts I reference above plus an All
 Users file as well as Default, DefaultUser, Public, and Temp.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that's significant but thought I would mention.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

            <p>Hi Robn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error may also occur if the user profile folder was deleted manually. A profile folder that is manually deleted does not remove the Security Identifier (SID) from the profile list in the registry. You can follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try performing System Restore from Windows Recovery mode and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What are the system recovery options in Windows?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Enable the built-in Administrator's account. follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start System and press “F8” to enter Safe mode with Command Prompt.</li><li>Choose any Administrator account and you will enter the elevated command prompt, type
<strong>net user administrator /active: yes and press Enter.</strong></li><li>Close the command prompt. Restart the computer and you will now see the built-in Administrator account log on icon added on Screen.</li><li>If you want to disable the built-in administrator account, just type <strong>
net user Administrator /active: no</strong>, then you will see the built-in Administrator account log on icon removed.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I so very much appreciate the information you provided but unfortunately I am still unable to access my primary Admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have tried a system restore in the past, I followed the instructions in Method 1 to try again.&nbsp; Unfortunately there were restore points for last month (the computer hasn't worked right since at least November) then went all the way back to 8/28/10
 which if I had to guess is around the time we bought the computer.&nbsp; As with my prior searches, if I had found a restore point for somewhere in the Fall 2013, I would have went with it and known any information I lost would have been minimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I followed your instructions in Method 2.&nbsp; At first I could not get command to work correctly so after a few tries, I removed the : and it worked.&nbsp; Restarted the computer and there was a new Administrator account.&nbsp; I was going to come on and ask you
 next steps with this new Administrator account but could not even get that far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was requiring a password for which I do not have one.&nbsp; I tried several default options like leaving the password blank, using the words password, admin, 1234, etc but none of the default settings worked.&nbsp; I also tried to follow a few other tutorials to
 set up a password for the Administrator account but they did not work.&nbsp; When I tried lusrmgr, I received a message that this snapin may not be used with this version of Windows.&nbsp; I tried going in through Control Panel to User Account but because I am only
 left with one working account and that account is not an Admin, it will not let me assign a password for Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried setting up a password for the Administrator through a command in the Command Prompt but keep getting syntax errors. I am able to pull up the Administrator profile in command prompt and it shows No for password required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to recently try Method 3 but it sounds familiar, I think I have done this in my prior troubleshooting attempts.&nbsp; Can you please review my notes above and see if you have any additional advice on Method 1 or 2 before I tap into the registry again.&nbsp;
 I know going into the registry is always at a caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dawn</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.<br />
<br />
Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />
temporary profile: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded"<br />

BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />

DO NOT USE THE HIDDEN ACCOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS! If it corrupts you are TOAST.<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            <p>If you want help with the latest version of Movie Maker 2012, please answer the questions asked by skier-hughes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer some of your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with accepting music or video files are usually caused by incompatible file types in Movie Maker. It might be a case of an unusual encoding or a missing codec for decoding the video or audio. The other cause may be problems with the audio service
 or audio driver, or for video a problem with your graphics card driver being out of date.</li><li>There are a set of 26 effects that can be applied in Movie Maker 2012 from the Visual Effects tab and an additional 34 pan and zoom effects on the Animations tab. A few are shown on the "ribbon" bar when you click on the corresponding tabs but you can also
 click the down arrow to get more of the effects, transitions, pan &amp; zoom effects, etc.</li><li>In order to save your slideshow for viewing elsewhere, you must use&nbsp;<strong>File &gt; Save movie</strong>. That will create an .mp4 file that can be played in Media Player or uploaded to a video sharing site. The path to this file is specified at the time
 you save, so pay attention to the screen prompts. You can also pick the destination folder if you don't like the default. You can also choose to save in .wmv format, if you need that instead.</li></ul>
<p>If you just want to ignore the latest version and go back to using the older legacy version from Windows Vista that you are familiar with, you can still install
