<h2>            Make a SATA PCI Express card bootable</h2>
                    I installed a SATA PCI Express card &amp; applicable drivers... all is good &amp; working. Here is my problem... when I disconnect the one &amp; only internal hard and connect it to the PCI Express card... upon restart,&nbsp;no bootable devices can be found.&nbsp; I thought
 there was a way of over-riding the BIOS to point to the SATA PCI&nbsp; Express card now hooked to my hard drive but can seem to find out how.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a way of making the Express card Bootable ???&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated... Thanks in Advance. Pat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    I did updates for about the last year. Friend gave me the computer and am just updating it.&nbsp; After it rebooted I got the error code. I've tried everything I could find to fix it, nothing it will boot to the Microsoft Window then shut down with the blue
 screen. Tried to use safe mode it won't boot to it, tried last config won't boot to it. tried to reinstall XP, won't recognize cd. did hard drive&nbsp; and cd drive diagnostics, nothing they passed. Should I just forget it? Got the reinstallation cd from dell.<br />

            The lz32.dll file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after so it would take some extra effort for it to becoming missing or corrupt.<br />
<br />
I booted into the Recovery Console so WFP is not running, deleted the lz32.dll file and XP boots just fine.<br />

I booted into the Recovery Console so WFP is not running and purposely corrupted the lz32.dll file and XP boots just fine.<br />
<br />
I think you must have gotten into some trouble here:<br />
<br />
... tried to reinstall XP...&nbsp; (always, always, always the positively absolute last resort)<br />
<br />
If your installation has now not been FUBAR'd, you should find a copy of the file in this folder (assuming XP is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
You should be able to get into the XP Recovery Console using your genuine bootable XP installation CD or you can make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required), boot on either to get into the RC and see if you can replace the suspicious file.<br />
<br />
This article tells you how to get into the RC from your genuine bootable XP installation CD:<br />

<br />
Once you get into the RC, you can enter this command to copy in the backup file:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\lz32.dll&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />

            When I first booted up the computer it worked fine. I went to the windows update in the task bar&nbsp; and clicked on&nbsp; updates, there was a lot of updates to do, probably at least a year or more . It did the updates and when I rebooted it that's when I got
 the error code. I tried a lot of different things including re-seating the memory modules, I still get the blue screen with the error code. The CD rom says it needs a CD with digital content to read it when I checked in the diagnostics program. It won't boot
 to safe mode or last good configuration either. The light on the CD rom flashes but it won't read anything. I tried to change the boot sequence to CD rom but it still won't do it.<br />

<h2>            Start Menu, Cortana, Task bar and apps all not working</h2>
                    <p>First things first, I HAVE searched around the internet and found a metric ton of people saying they have fixes, whether it be something to do with the appmanifest.xmal or some other one. None have worked for me and this was a last resort really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, I upgraded from 8.1 yesterday and all was fine... until today where, I found, the start menu would not open when clicked - the case is the same with cortana. I can left click on the pinned icons on my task bar but can do nothing beyond that (I can't
 right click them to show the unpin option or the recent files option) - note: I can right click the task bar itself and have it come up with the context menu with "properties", "lock the task bar", et cetera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, nothing in the notification icon area works either, clicking the non-third party icons don't work, i.e. clicking on volume does nothing the case is the same with the click, networking and notification icon (those four are the only ones I have
 showing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally all the metro apps are gone. Well, I say they are gone but they still exist in their respective directories but do not show up anywhere and when I use the cmd to try to open them a message pops up with "you'll need a new app to open with" which makes
 me believe that for some reason the app container has gone a buggered itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all happened after I did a huge scan with IObit's Advanced System care. I rebooted the computer (as required) and Iobit advanced uninstalled told me that "search" and "powershell" had items to be cleaned up which gives me reason to believe they uninstalled
 themselves (hence cortana not working) and yet I have been using powershell successful even after said message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing with the apps is that when I look at the default apps section all of the apps no longer present themselves as options (for the defaults that do work, I have thirdparty programs assigned, e.g. for web browser I'm using Opera)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, get this fixed asap!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's any more information that will be needed to find a fix I'll be happy to provide it.</p>
<p>

            She should download the Windows 10 ISO as Arun said above and then mount it to a memory stick or DVD and then boot from it. She can do a clean install that way but make sure she backs everything up (docs, music, pictures, etc. tbh I don't know what I'd
 do without my music :D )

<p>1: fscopilot</p>
<p>2: fsinn</p>
<p>&nbsp;both are required to connect vatsim with fsx.</p>
<p>I successfully downloaded it and all the installation was very good and okay.</p>
<p>Then i started fsx and&nbsp; it gave me an messsage to allow fscopilot and fsinn to work with fsx and i clicked yes option.</p>
<p>suddenly i got an error message </p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;FSFDT CONTROL PANEL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Component 'VAYSIMVL.ocx' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered:a file missing or invalid.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i cannot open the addon for fsx that connect vatsim with fsx.</p>
<p>please help me to solve this error i really need vatsim to work with fsx.</p>

<h2>            Using Skype on an IPad</h2>
                    <p>I had previously added my IPAD to my Skype account. &nbsp;It is not showing up. &nbsp;My IPad is clearer in making calls than my Phone. &nbsp;When I tried again to add my IPad phone number, they wanted to send a SMS, but it doesn't work. &nbsp;How can I make sure that my IPad
 phone number is added to my account. &nbsp;I am leaving the country in 3 days and cannot contact anyone to ask. &nbsp;I need customer service and cannot do so.</p>

<h2>            No verification code sent to my email adress or tex sent to my mobile NO.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently deleted my microsoft account from my windows 8 machine because I believed it to be corrupt. I then tried to re create it in windows 8 specifying my hotmail address and giving my password which all went well, my account was created. However I noticed
 that I needed to enter a verification code which could either be emailed to my hotmail account, or texted to my mobile. I requested both several times however I received nothing on all occasions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have access to my calendar / mail etc om my machine so I'm wondering if I even need to bother with this verification??</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only item of information that I can't seem to access is my sensitive information in my online account, which I would like to be able to access although not right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how I can get hold of this verification code??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>Matt</p>

            Hi Caleb, this is just a sequence problem . . .
<br />
<br />A couple of things left to do . . .
<br />
<br />Open c:\Program Files\Vuze\Azureus.exe
<br />Right click the vbs file and choose 'Send to' - Desktop (Create Shrotcut)
<br />Close File Explorer.
<br />
<br />On your Desktop, delete your original Vuze Shortcut
<br />
<br />Right click the vbs shortcut and choose Properties
<br />Click ;Change Icon'
<br />Click Browse and navigate to c:\Program Files\Vuze\Azureus.exe
<br />Set the icon to the Vuze icon
<br />Click Apply and OK and close all dialogs
<br />
<br />Finally rename the Desktop icon 'Vuze'       
        </p>

            A "supervisor" password sounds more like a password related to the computer hardware than to Windows.&nbsp; I know for sure that IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad computers have "Supervisor" passwords that are difficult but not impossible to reset.&nbsp; This is what<a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/detail.page?LegacyDocID=migr-59377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 Lenovo says:<br />
</a><br />
A forgotten Supervisor password will prevent access to the ThinkPad BIOS setup utility. To regain access, the system will need to be serviced to have the system board and hard drive replaced. Proof of purchase is required, and this repair is not covered under
 the warranty. <br />
<br />
As with most computer-related things, there is more than one way to skin this particular cat, but Microsoft's policies forbid anyone in this forum from providing any such advice other than to think harder about your hint (initials, birthday, some combination
 of that information, etc.).<br />

 and that failed, too. &nbsp;the store then restored us back to Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. &nbsp;ever since, we have had issues. &nbsp;The first is related to viewing pictures - if we flip through them quickly using Windows Photo Viewer, or something similar, we will

            In that case, I recommend that you talk with the IT staff at your workplace, explain the situation, and ask them to give you the capabilities that you want.&nbsp; If they won't do that, ask them to restore the files for you.<br />

<h2>            Still being called when busy</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm in a lot of groups with quite a few other people and as such I usually set myself to busy to basically mute the 'message received' blip sound and dashboard popup while i'm playing games but as some of the channels are gaming ones calls happen frequently
 to which the center pop up and the call jingle still happens, this didn't used to happen when I was set to busy and only started recently. How do I get it back to not notifying me when i'm set to busy?</p>

            1. Check the reply of Ariel Acu in below thread

<br />2. I would suggest that you should raise a support ticked to seaofthieves also for this problem. So, you will be supported both by Windows community and seaofthieves also.
