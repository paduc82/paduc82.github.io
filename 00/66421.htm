<h2>            Do I need to install updates to Windows 7 sp1 prior to upgrading to windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, thanks to all in advance, I will hit helpful&nbsp;for all sincere answers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed Windows 7 Sp1 Pro 32 Bit OEM.&nbsp; Clean Install on Acer Aspire 5100.&nbsp; Telephone Activation successful.&nbsp; Basic LAN, sound, and display drivers appear adequate.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 updates appear to crawl (if they are even working), only one update so far after 8 hours of trying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From previous Windows 7 experience, there are about ~200 plus updates after SP1 and at this rate it will be days, if I can even do it.&nbsp; Microsoft
 really needs to release a Windows 7 SP2.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) installed on Windows 7, with full daily scans scheduled.&nbsp; When MSE installs it completely de-activates Windows 7 Windows Defender.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have previously (early Nov 2015) downloaded free iso of Windows 10 from Microsoft and burned to DVD.&nbsp; It allows choice of upgrade or clean install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Do I need to fully update Windows 7 Pro prior to upgrading to Windows 10 Pro?&nbsp; ....nets, security patches, et...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Can I update from my Windows 10 ISO file directly, or do I have to use the DVD I made?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; If I upgrade to Windows 10, do I need to uninstall MSE and re-activate Windows Defender prior to Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Is there a way to set the Windows 10 Defender to run a FULL SCAN (drives, et..) daily&nbsp;at ~5:00 am (I have read several posts on this site on this question and still completely confused).&nbsp; I know I want daily full scans, not quick scans.&nbsp; I also want
 real time protection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Is there a way to put the Windows 10 Defender Icon on task bar so I can easily check to see history, status, see when scans are running (like MSE does).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Is there a specific Windows Upgrade Test and can download, I know test comes with taskbar Windows 10 Icon, but at this rate I'll never get to that update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to stop other PCs from putting software on a Windows 10 PC, I know I only want updates directly from Microsoft Server, not any third party PCs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of questions, please answer what you can and answer by number if that works for you.&nbsp; Be well....</p>

            Hi Cos,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I completely understand your concern and feel sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please refer to the solutions to your queries below and check, if it works.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Do I need to fully update Windows 7 Pro prior to upgrading to Windows 10 Pro?&nbsp; ....nets, security patches, etc and Can I update from my Windows 10 ISO file directly, or do I have to use the DVD I made?&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can directly install Windows 10 on Windows 7 using the Windows 10 installation disk. If you are trying to install through update you need to install all the updates.</div>
<div><br />
2.&nbsp;If I upgrade to Windows 10, do I need to uninstall MSE and re-activate Windows Defender prior to Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp;
<div><br />
Windows Defender anti-virus software is already in-built on Windows 10 and you do not need to uninstall Windows Defender anti-virus software.</div>
<div><br />
3.&nbsp;Is there a way to set the Windows 10 Defender to run a FULL SCAN (drives, et..) daily at ~5:00 am (I have read several posts on this site on this question and still completely confused).&nbsp; I know I want daily full scans, not quick scans.&nbsp; I also want real
 time protection.&nbsp; </div>
<div><br />
Yes, of course, you can run a Windows Defender anti-virus software FULL SCAN on task scheduler.</div>
<div><br />
4.&nbsp;Is there a way to put the Windows 10 Defender Icon on task bar so I can easily check to see history, status, see when scans are running (like MSE does).&nbsp;
<div><br />
You can right-click on the Windows 10 Defender Icon, then click on pin to task bar.</div>
<div><br />
5.&nbsp;Is there a specific Windows Upgrade Test and can download, I know test comes with taskbar Windows 10 Icon, but at this rate I'll never get to that update.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would like to inform you that, there is no Windows Upgrade Test tool available, when you install Windows 10 and it will automatically, check for the compatibility on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to check the system specification on Windows 10 and refer to the link below:</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>6.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to stop other PCs from putting software on a Windows 10 PC, I know I only want updates directly from Microsoft Server, not any third party PCs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I would like to inform you that, Windows update will not install any third party software on the computer unless you install it manually.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>&nbsp;Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.<br />

            <p>You don't <em>have to</em> upgrade any further than SP1 to qualify for the free upgrade. From a technical standpoint, however, the more up to date Windows 7 is, the better your chances of success when upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since you seem comfortable with a clean install, why not just clean install Windows 10? A clean install is always superior to an upgrade, and since the November upgrade you can perform a clean install with your Windows 7 product key.</p>

            Hi Thanks for tip about Windows 10 clean install using windows 7 product key.&nbsp; Not sure this works with OEM versions of Windows 7.&nbsp; With OEM, you need to do a telephone activation as key comes up as invalid (has for me anyway).&nbsp; With Win 10 DVD I made
 in Nov, if key comes up invalid it does not let you proceed.&nbsp; When I tried a seven key months ago and it would not activate, I called Windows 10 support and they said I had to purchase a product key for 10.&nbsp;

            Hmmm...that doesn't make sense. I did a clean install with an OEM Windows 7 key. Considering how desperate Microsoft is to have Windows 10 adopted, and given their practice of hiring script readers to answer their phones, I think you should keep trying
 to make your case until you connect with someone who will let you activate.

            I believe Microsoft allowed free upgrades to Windows 10 up to a certain time. If you upgrade after that time, then you will have to buy an activation key for the Windows 10. Also, about the question of a clean install or upgrade, if in clean install your
 drivers are retained, then it's better, but if your drivers are retained only in the upgrade version, then upgrade is better. Many manufacturers have not made patches for their products in Windows 10, so be careful what you do.&nbsp;

                    When my PC was upgraded to Windows 10, I discovered that my Dell All-In-One 966 printer had no drivers for W10.&nbsp; I was able to work around it using Vista drivers, running the install as compatible with Vista SP2.&nbsp; When W10 released its last update, this
 work around no longer works.&nbsp; I have an older PC still running Windows 7 so I decided to install the printer there and share it to the home group.&nbsp; The printer installs just fine as USB typical install.&nbsp; But it won't give the option to share it.&nbsp; I've tried
 installing after adding the W7 PC to the home group and when that didn't work, I Uninstalled it, removed the PC from the home group, then reinstalled it, then added the PC back to the home group.&nbsp; Still won't give the option to share it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description,&nbsp; you are not getting the option to share on your windows 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run </strong><strong>Printer troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer troubleshooter makes sure that a printer is connected to your computer, and it checks for common issues such as whether the printer has enough paper and toner to complete printing your document.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists try&nbsp;method 2,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Reinstall the printer in compatibility mode.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to&nbsp;reinstall the </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">printer</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> in compatibility mode.

            I have already done all this.&nbsp; As you can see from my description, I installed the printer using compatibility mode for Vista SP2.&nbsp; The troubleshooter finds no issues.&nbsp; The printer is functioning just fine on W7 but I cannot share it to the home group.&nbsp;
 When I right click on the printer in Devices and Printers, it is not giving me the option to share it.&nbsp; Since I cannot get it to install on W10, this was my only option, install it on a W7 PC that is part of the home group and share it so that I can still
 print to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no problems with the printer's operations, only that I am not seeing any options to share, either by right clicking on the printer icon in Devices and Printers nor by selecting properties.&nbsp; Properties is only giving me two tabs, general
 and hardware.<br />

            I'm afraid that this wasn't helpful.&nbsp; The Homegroup has three PCs running Windows 10 and one running Windows 7.&nbsp; This is for sharing when NOT using a homegroup.&nbsp; The homegroup settings are marked to share printers.&nbsp; My problem is that when I try to share
 this one printer, it is not giving me the option to share.&nbsp; When I right click on the printer, the "Share" option is not coming up and when I go into properties, the share tab is not present.&nbsp; I have de-installed and re-installed this printer using compatibility
 to both Vista SP2 and XP.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I have one other Dell printer on one of W10 PCs shared and the computer running W7 cannot see it and none of the W10 PCs can see the printer on the W7 PC.&nbsp; All are in the homegroup all have file and printer sharing turned
 on.&nbsp;

<h3> hao ca liew-vien  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get my computer to stop barking errors at me after it goes into sleep state&#63;</h2>
                    Usually I find myself leaving my computer on for long periods; the computer goes into the C(?) sleep state. After all of these states, my computer comes back up with an error prompting decision to send details for something going wrong. I was looking online
 to see if there would be any solutions made for this type of error; I found that one of the posts offered this community is ready to help others with dmp logs. I have one available in my Windows\ called MEMORY.DMP. I will include that with the post. If there
 is anything other files which help, please ask me. I am hoping there is an (easy) solution for this problem, but I'll be understanding if there is not one.

<h2>            Suggestions &#40;Wrist-band&#47; bracelet&#41;</h2>
                    
Problem Statement
<p>We have an Xbox 360 in our house, which we mainly use as a video streaming device these days. When we bought it though, the idea was to use it as a potential educational tool for our daughter (who turns 5 this April), and eventually to our son (who is 2.5).
 However, as soon as we bought it, we realized that there were some roadblocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kinect sensor placement</b>: We have connected our Xbox to the wall-mounted TV in our family room, where the set top boxes, Blu-ray players (and now the Xbox) are all placed in a rack in one corner of the room, with the wires to the TV run thru the wall
 (so as to keep a clean, un-cluttered look). This setup caused 2 issues… </li></ul>
<ol>
<li>While I could use an existing HDMI cable, that has been run thru the wall, to connect Xbox to the TV, I still had to connect the Kinect to Xbox via a cable that was outside the wall, and hence defeated the purpose of hiding all the wires behind the wall.
</li><li>I own a Nintendo Wii as well, and the fact that I could stick the Wii sensor to the top OR bottom of the TV screen made life much easier with a toddler around. With Kinect, I am using a tripod (as there is no table below the TV), and whenever I setup the
 tripod, my son would invariably crawl/ walk to it and tip/ move it. This caused a very stop-and-go experience.
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><b>User Identification</b>: Our family room has enough space to move around comfortably (i.e Xbox would identify the available space area as ‘large’). However, that also means that my daughter, playing Kinectimals or Sesame street, will share the space
 with her younger brother who is just jumping around or playing with his lego stacks. And this results in Kinect constantly identifying my son as another player or as the primary (blue) player.
</li></ul>
<p>Due to the issues above, we have stopped using Kinect (at least until the kids grow older, by which time Xbox 360 would be out of date they won’t want to use it J), and now it is acting as a streaming device for our Netflix, Youtube, Amazon,
 etc.</p>
My Reaction
<p>I am a User Experience Specialist by profession, and I thought to myself “If I were working at Microsoft, how would I tackle this problem?”, and started thinking. As I went down this path, I set a few parameters to myself…</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m not going to focus on solving this particular problem, but use this as a Launchpad for a holistic solution.
</li><li>The solutions should be such that it scales well with the current and near future technology trends.
</li><li>The solution should have new business viability. I.e it should assist Xbox get a foothold in other areas (outside of gaming and entertainment).
</li></ol>
<p>I also made one assumption – i.e. the Kinect technology is what it is now. I made this assumption because I’m not in the gaming industry, nor do I focus on gaming peripherals. I’m assuming that the user cannot tell Kinect to ‘stop tracking a particular person,
 even though they are in Kinect’s scan zone’. However, even if that assumption is incorrect, I think there is still some value (both from user experience perspective as well as business perspective) to my proposal.</p>
Kinect Sensor Placement: Proposal
<p>I’m not a hardware/ industrial designer, so I did not focus too much on this problem (I did on the next one), but some means of making the bulky sensor ‘clip’ onto the TV screen (both at the top as well as the bottom, as placing the sensor at 6 ft. causes
 recognition issues with small kids as players.) will be very effective. And ofcourse, making the sensor communicate to the Xbox wirelessly should be the next logical step.</p>
User Identification: Proposal
<p>With wearable computing devices fast becoming a reality, I am proposing a bracelet (like a fit-bit fitness band) that can be used to alleviate the user identification issue. And I think this problem is not just with kids moving around, but even if there
 is an adult standing behind the kid (like I use to do, teaching some game moves to my daughter) the sensor picks up the adult, and causes a bad experience.</p>
<p>With the bracelet, I can tell Kinect to track only the user(s) that are wearing the bracelet and avoid everyone else. Now my son can also jump with his sister for Dora dance, thinking that he is also playing while only my daughter is playing the game.</p>
<p>The bracelet can be used for few other things as well…</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Controlled play time</b>: One of the concerns I hear from some of my friends with tween/ teen kids is that the amount of time they spend with their video games, phones, and computers. With the bracelet, I should be able to assign a bracelet to each kid,
 and specify things like total amount of time they can use Xbox in a day, maximum amount of time they can use Xbox at a stretch, etc. This way parents can control their play time effectively. This functionality can be extended to phones and computer as well,
 using the bracelet as a key part of login mechanism (i.e. the user must wear the bracelet in order to use the device).
</li><li><b>Fitness</b>: The bracelet can borrow some ideas from the fitness bands in the market today, but extend the functionality multi-fold. My wife can wear her bracelet during her morning run, and when she comes home and starts the Jillian Anderson exercise
 game in Xbox, ‘Jillian’ would know that my wife had already ran for 3 miles that morning, and she (Jillian) can congratulate my wife on her enthusiasm, as well as tailor that session based on her calorie burn so far that day. And when my wife goes to her gym
 the next day and start her workout on an Xbox integrated elliptical, the elliptical can automatically pull up the appropriate exercise pattern for her, and update her workout information to the bracelet (or the Xbox cloud server) for later use by ‘Jillian’.
 In fact, if the fitness center provides personal TV monitors, then the bracelet can be used to prompt my wife whether she wants to continue watching the latest episode of Sherlock Holmes that she paused half way thru at home.
</li><li><b>Healthcare</b>: An extension of the above feature. The bracelet can keep track of the user’s heart rate, how far away from the screen they stand (averaged out), etc. And when the user gets an email/ calendar notification (in her windows phone or Windows
 computer) about her doctor appointment, the Windows system can sense the bracelet, and prompt the user to send her health statistics (from the bracelet) to the doctor’s office, so that the optometrist can review the information and tell her that she should
 stay at least a feet more away from her current position, and should be tested for near-sightedness.
</li></ul>
<p>I am sure there are a lot more possibilities in addition to what I have stated above, but the key thing is the potential to expand the Xbox eco system beyond the current gaming/ entertainment areas.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>This activity started as an exercise to quench my creative curiosity, but as it evolved I thought it would be a good idea to share this with the folks to whom this might be of interest. In all likelihood the Xbox UX team has thought of these things already
 (and probably working on it), but still I think it does not hurt to share ideas.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the newer Kinect on the one can do a lot of the stuff you're saying. It can tell who is who in the room etc...</p>
<p>Plus the 360's Kinect if you look on youtube a lot of people been using it for all sorts of stuff. I'm pretty sure even NASA is or has used it as well for stuff.....</p>

<p>ManneredDonkey: &nbsp; &nbsp;A very weel thought-out piece with some good thoughts. I think that some of the problems you are having with the 360 Kinect have been "solved" on the one but there will still be problems with the smaller kids. (don't wish them to grow
 up too quickly!!!!!)</p>
<p>Thanks for the post, it made me think.</p>

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the complete error message that you receive when trying to install the printer driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes you would receive if the initial installation files are corrupted.&nbsp; The drivers create temporary files and then leave them behind in Temp folders.<br />
<br />
Follow these methods.<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>Please remove files from the Temp folder and then try to install the printer driver again and check the issue.
</p>
<p><br />
You can run Disk Cleanup on the Operating System drive to delete contents of the Temp folder.</p>
<p>Now, try installing the driver from the website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/support/12648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/support/12648</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
You may try installing the printer drivers in a Clean boot state from manufacturer's website.</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</font></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a lot of problems reinstalling my Lexmark... Here is a list of the steps that finally worked...</p>
<p>They may or may not work for you...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>1) Printer must be On for it to show up in Devices and Printers after the Upgrade - Just this one time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, only the Lexmark Fax shows up and the Printer can't be REMOVED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Now UNHOOK the Printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) REMOVE Lexmark Printer and Lexmark Fax in Devices and Printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) STOP the PRINT SPOOLER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Uninstall software - TWO Firewall Security Messages Pop Up about "ALLOWING' Printer Communication..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select "ALLOW".... if you Allow both Shared and Private on both windows, you end up with two printers in
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer Preferences, Properties, etc. I unchecked a "Shared" on the first window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) After REBOOT, STOP Print Spooler AGAIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Reinstall Software\Drivers ... Hook Printer back up when Prompted. XP SP3 Compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Unhook Printer again and REBOOT ... This step isn't necessary if Bidirectional Support is already ENABLED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skip to step 10 if Enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Enable Bidirectional Support and Reboot. </p>
<span>
<p>To do this, go to Devices and Printers and select "Printer Properties" and then the "PORTS" tab... The check box is near the bottom.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>10) Set up Printer Preferences if desired, and it's ready to go.</p>
</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are drivers and other software available for your printer from Epson for Win 8.</p>
<p>Even with these drivers you may need to use Compatibility Mode.... it happens sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think that your OEM Installation CD should work in Compatibility Mode as well...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To have any chance of getting any of these to work, you need to get the old stuff out...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the steps I posted previously, and use Compatibility Mode with your CD... Try Vista or Win 7.</p>
<p>Whichever it worked on before....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before reinstalling the software, go to Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Print Management...</p>
<p>Double Click on both the "ALL Printers" and "ALL Drivers" and delete anything that is not Microsoft...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then reinstall... make sure the printer turned OFF, Unplugged,&nbsp;and&nbsp;NOT HOOKED UP when you reinstall....</p>
<p>Hook it back up when instructed by the Installer..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't notice if you were using a USB or Wireless connection... You may have better luck with USB.</p>
<p>If you use the wireless, temporarily turn off your Firewall while installing...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you would have a registry issue that reinstalling wouldn't fix, but it's most certainly possible... Normally a reinstall overwrites the registry with new values...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be that there is something in there blocking that though...</p>

<h2>            How do I allow standard users to install and run games&#63;</h2>
                    I want to allow a standard user account to install and run games and such but I keep getting prompts to for an admin password, I've already tried disabling UAC but I'm now just getting prompts that say only the administrator could only install. I'd like
 to be able to do this without having to turn off UAC.

            &nbsp;You have to have administrator authority to install anything, period.&nbsp; Trying to allow standard users just to do that is like trying to be a little bit pregnant. :-)

                    Using a pretty old Windows 10 laptop. I'm trying to sign in to icloud and can see that the login is over on the bottom left but I can't scroll over to it or click on it to sign in. Apple won't help because this is a PC. I have tried clearing caches and
 cookies and have used a few browsers, but certainly not all of them! Help! Thanks!!! My apologies if I posted this in the wrong topic.

<p>I want to apologize for disappearing! Life got busy! I want to thank you for your advice. Strangely enough, I was about to go ahead and follow your advice today and before doing anything, I realized the icloud page was working on one of the tabs. This is
 so interesting since I have been trying to login on and off for over a month and have struggled with this issue. I appreciate your willingness to help and am glad to be able to use my account! Have a blessed day!</p>

<p>I have a problem with win10, i can't use it.</p>
<p>The following happens:</p>
<p>I turn the computer on, I can see the windows logo and the "scanning and repairing drive D: 100%" text.</p>
<p>Then after a little bit of loading, it changes to black screen with cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have red different troubleshooting tips, but nothing helps.</p>
<p>-can't "log in" under the black screen</p>
<p>-ctrl+alt+del / ctrl+shift+esc doesn't work</p>
<p>-therefore can't update drivers</p>
<p>-same with and without battery</p>
<p>-same in safe mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this happened after an update.</p>
<p>What can i do?</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

            Hi Bálint, please try this:
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the fast response, sadly nothing worked.</p>
<p>I wanted to avoid resetting, but since nothing helped, I did that.</p>
<p>Now it's stuck at 89% in the reset process (that circle still spins, but the percentage is stuck at 89% for about 3 hours now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance that i can make it work again, or I have to format everything and reinstall from the windows cd?</p>
<p>(I had to do that about half a year ago, so if nothin else, it's an option, i have backup of my important files)</p>

<p>i love lumia so much but it doesn't have my favorite game like clash of clans and schoolidol festival. and i'll wait for the release of 2 apps to buy an lumia and keep away my android from my life.</p>
<p>i love windows because the simple gui and easy to use. and it's recommended for gamers and business because it's easy, better, and safer.</p>
<p>i love microsoft band because it's funny and simple look, better gui and many more. i hope that the microsoft band can explode google androidwrear and apple watch and another smartwatch's markets so no more competitors that defeat microsoft band's quality.</p>

            Did you try leaving the password for "Administrator" blank?&nbsp; The default for Administrator is blank.&nbsp; If it is not blank then you set it, either intentionally or by some action during the fingerprint configuration process.<br />
<br />
If a blank password doesn't work -- and none of the passwords that you can remember entering while you were attempting to configure the fingerprint system work -- then although there is a method to "reset windows administrator password", I'm not permitted to
 tell you how to do it under Microsoft's rules for these forums.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Just be aware that if you do reset a Windows password you will lose any files in that account that have been encrypted with the Windows Encrypting File system (unless you have backup credentials for that).<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As of now there is no information on the new brushes other than the ones that are currently present.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, I'd suggest you keep your computer updated by installing <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Forza horizon 3 wont finish downloading after multiple attempts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza horizon 3 wont finish downloading after multiple attempts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased the game Forza Horizon 3 about a week ago and it does not finish downloading. every time it gets close to finishing, it adds an extra 30-50GB's worth of download onto the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game has downloaded 0GB's out of 60GB. I leave it to download over night and wake up the next morning to see that it says its downloaded 70GB's out of 100GB's. i leave it to download longer and once it reaches 90GB's downloaded, the overall game goes
 up once again to 130GB's. it has been doing this over and over until it reached 280GB's before i decided to restart the download again from the start. I have been trying to install it for a week now and its not working. this has been very annoying since I
 have not been able to fix it and the store wont allow me to return the product. Some help would</p>
<p>be appreciated please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall windows store as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Ryssen01,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the game files got corrupted on your computer that's why it won't finish downloading from Microsoft Store. This happens if there's an interruption with connecting to the game server while downloading the game files. For us to better assist
 you, kindly provide us the following information below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us if you're getting the same result after you tried redownloading the game?</li><li>Are you getting the same issue if you tried downloading other games or apps on your computer?</li><li>Aside from redownloading the game and uninstalling Windows Store, can you tell us other troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you download and run the Windows app troubleshooter to scan and repair your Windows apps. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>

<p>Hi ariel thank you for replying to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us if you're getting the same result after you tried redownloading the game?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>i tried to uninstall the Windows Store and download it again but when i was going to load it and download it it was the same that it continued to load higher i was up to 300gb then i did not know what i would do so i was waiting and after a week later, the
 download had begun so while I downloaded it I was up to 45 gb but the game itself is 55 gb. I was so glad I might be able to play the game. but suddenly freezing my computer so I had to shut it off.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting the same issue if you tried downloading other games or apps on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has never been to any other games just when I download forza horizon 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from redownloading the game and uninstalling Windows Store, can you tell us other troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tested the troubleshooting I tested it once before answering but became no change and then I tested it now but it did not help now either.</p>

<p>So, I decided to upgrade to Windows 10, because the free offer was going to expire soon. My brother installed it on his computer - an exact copy of mine (both home made), and it works just fine for him, so I thought it would be a good idea.</p>
<p>I wish I would've just stuck with 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I reset my machine.</p>
<p>- I troubleshoot(ed?) for a problem - "troubleshoot couldn't identify the problem."</p>
<p>- I tried to reset it to W 7, but I can't go back - the W7 files were deleted, and I'm not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>- I went on this website here: <a href="http://www.askmehelp.com/softwares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.askmehelp.com/softwares/</a> All the person who 'helped' me did was try to get me to grant his "technician" access to my Mac laptop which is in no way connected to my PC, despite telling him that my problem is with my PC, which can't connect to the
 internet, and I'm definitely not giving him access to my Mac. He left shortly afterwards. Super shady.</p>
<p>- I called Microsoft customer support, but the lady on the other end insisted that the problem was with my ethernet cord, despite the fact that I was connected just fine on Windows 7, and my laptop accepts the ethernet cord. I eventually got tired of being
 talked to like I don't know what a RAM is, and gave up trying to get help from her.</p>
<p>- I tried to connect my desktop to my phone's personal hotspot through USB, but the computer tells me it cannot find a network. I checked my network drivers (they're both enabled, and updated to the best of an offline computer's ability).</p>
<p>- I've force uninstalled the network adapters, and reinstalled new ones that are supposed to be compatible with W10 (this was done using my mac, and a jumpdrive).<br />
- I've installed, and run driver fixers, and ComIntRep, <br />
- I've even tried using different hardware - a usb to ethernet adapter that I made sure was compatible with W10, and a new ethernet cord altogether.</p>
<p>- I went out and bought a usb WiFi adapter.</p>
<p>- I ran the command 'netsh winsock reset.' (As admin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * "Sucessfully reset the Winsock Catalog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You must restart the computer in order to complete the reset."</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Then I ran the command 'netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting Interface, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting Unicast Address, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting Neighbor, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting Path, OK!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting , failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Restart the computer to complete this action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Then I ran the command 'netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Resetting , failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Restart the computer to complete this action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Restarted my computer, fixed nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I ran the command 'ipconfig/all'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Host name . . . . . . . . . . . . . : [My computer's name]</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * WINS Proxy Enabled . . . . . : No</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Then I ran the command 'ipconfig/flushdns'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Windows IP Configuration</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Then I ran the command 'ipconfig/renew'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The operation failed as no adapter is in the state permissible for this operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried the good ol' unplug the router technique.</p>
<p>- I've talked to someone on Reddit/techsupport, who suggested I try many of the things I did.</p>
<p>- I even gave the desktop a stern kick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to fix this annoying problem? The computer was working just fine before the downgrade to W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what's going on is that Windows 10 didn't upgrade properly, and perhaps I'm missing important system files.</p>
<p>When I go into Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet, the only options I see are 'Data usage,' 'VPN,' 'Dial-up,' and 'Proxy.' I don't see a tab for WiFi, or anything like that.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I try to start an application - such as the command prompt - the computer tells me something along the lines of "bad data," and won't start it. Then when I try to start it up again it works.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I restart my computer / turn it off, and back on, it fails to locate the desktop, and I'm unable to do much of anything, and I have to restart it multiple times just to get the desktop back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable. If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or driver is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to
 the network, or internet, and then try again. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I go into settings, the window closes itself with no warning or explanation.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I restart my computer, and try to log in, it take forever loading, then tells me something along the lines of "bad data."</p>
<p>The Network Connections folder (Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Network Connections) Is empty.</p>
<p>My computer tells me it can't find any networking hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SuperAntiSpyware, and MalwareBytes on the computer. SuperAntiSpyware tried to get me to delete PCCleaner, and MalwareBytes only detected the usual suspicious cookie I'm guessing was from the last time I was on the internet.</p>
<p>I can't run Windows Defender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * This app has been turned off and isn't monitoring your computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked it in the settings, everything is turned on, but when I click 'Open Windows Defender' nothing happens.</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials is scanning the computer right now. I'll post whatever it finds in an edit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * EDIT *</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security Essentials didn't find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* EDIT *</p>
<p>Discovered additional information:<br />
<br />
I went to visit my brother (the one with the identical computer), and looked through his files to see if I had anything missing - mainly the network adapter devices.<br />
<br />
I noticed that I'm missing a lot of the Wan Miniport adapters he has.<br />
The only one I have is the SSTP Miniport.<br />
I lack the IP, L2TP, Pppoe, and PPTP.<br />
<br />
Upon trying to reinstall them through the Add Hardware Wizard, I get an error message:<br />
"The following hardware was not installed:<br />
Microsoft IP_HTTPS Platform Adapter<br />
<br />
An error occurred during the installation of the device.<br />
<br />
This operation returned because the timeout period expired."</p>
<p>
</p><p>* EDIT *</p>
<p>I once again tried to install the necessary Miniports through the command prompt (admin).</p>
<p>As instructed here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/953795</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Netcfg -u MS_L2TP"</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Like everything else I've tried, it ends in an error code, and the problem persists.</p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting on my nerves. I've tried everything I can think of other than buying a new Windows 7 disk, and reinstalling Windows 7, but why should I have to do that? It feels like Microsoft really screwed me over with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help me in any way I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>* EDIT *</p>
<p>The problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>For future reference if anybody else has to go through this -</p>
<p>I fixed the problem by transferring the system files from my brother's twin computer onto a USB drive, and re-updating Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 blue screen crash clean install fails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen crash clean install fails</h2>
                    Windows 10 will not load - I get a blue screen with the stop code "memory mgmt" several times, and on occasion "critical process died" and "cache mgr". I downloaded the windows.iso file on a dvd and attempted a clean install. The first step (Copying Windows
 files) finishes and then after 22% for step two (Getting files ready for installation), I receive the error 0x8007025D "Windows cannot install the required files. Makes sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. I
 tried again, and received a new message (it attempted a repair) "System registry file missing or contains errors. Error code 0xc000025. The message said I need recovery tools. I am not tech savvy, but I can follow directions, and do not have the money to send
 in for a repair. Hoping someone can help me, with maybe a bit more explanation than would be offered to a tech-savvy person! Thank you!!!

<p>How you activate Windows 10 after reinstalling it depends on how Windows 10 was originally installed on your device. If you activated a free upgrade to Windows 10 or bought and activated Windows 10 from the Windows Store, you have a digital entitlement for
 your device. This means you can reinstall the same edition of Windows 10 that your device has a digital entitlement for without entering a product key.<strong> During reinstallation, if you’re asked to enter a product key, select Skip</strong>. Windows 10
 will automatically activate online after the installation is complete. </p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you previously installed a "Retail" / Boxed version and activated Windows 10 using a product key, you’ll need to enter the product key during reinstallation.

<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Check your Activation Status:</strong><span> </span>Select the Start button icon button, then select Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation. If Windows 10 isn’t activated on your device, see Get help with Windows 10 activation errors
 for more info.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>One of the most common is a generic key associated with "Digital entitlement / License" computers.</strong> This is a new method of activation in Windows 10 that doesn't require you to enter a product key:

            Thank you so much. I used your link and burned a new DVD, and now the error code is 0x80070570, with the same message: Windows cannot install the required files. Maybe corrupt or missing. I boot from BIOS, and I choose the primary partition, which is about
 900 GB. Another thread said the size of the partition can be the problem, and one could make a new partition. Should I consider this? I certainly don't know how. I also don't know how to clean the partition...<br />

<p><strong>Fist run Memtest86+:</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This runs from a boot disk / CD or USB and should eliminate or confirm if one or more of your memory</p>
<p>sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.</p>
<p>Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.</p>

            I've run the memory test for 11 hours, and the results don't look good. At the top, its says pass: 14%, test 70%. Below in the RAM box, it says pass: 0, errors: 18,220,000 (and still counting rapidly). It is on test 6. I have 32gb of ram installed. Is
 there any hope for my machine? It has an intel core i5 processor. Should I start testing each RAM stick individually? Thanks!!!<br />

            <p>Shut the computer down, unplug the AC power cord, press the Power On button to totally discharge the power supply. wait about 5 minutes and then remove all but one bank (pair) of memory (Check the user's guide for which bank / set of slots to use when using
 only one bank (pair) of memory).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rerun Memtest96+ and if you are still getting errors I would check the BIOS settings for the RAM / Memory voltage and Timing to see if they match the memory manufactures specifications.</p>
