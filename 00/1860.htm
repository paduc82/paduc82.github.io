    <title>Microsoft Voice Command on Windows Mobile 6.0 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Voice Command on Windows Mobile 6.0</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I recently bought a new phone that had a free upgrade from Windows Mobile 5 to Mobile 6. My previous phone had Windows Mobile 5, and I thought the upgrade would be cool, but then I discovered something deeply troubling: Microsoft Voice Command doesn't
 install! This <em>absolutely sucks. </em>I don't consider Windows Mobile a viable smartphone operating system without the program, and I'm wondering what my options are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed my phone has something called "Voice Speed Dial" but as soon as I realized I had to program voice tags for every contact and each of their various phone numbers (cellular, home, work, etc.), that was a big deal killer. Plus, I can't
 appear to do things like view a contact by saying "Show [Contact Name]" and stuff like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm conisdering trying to downgrade to Mobile 5, but does anyone have any way around this problem or have any other ideas. Will there be a Voice Command version that will work on Mobile 6?</p>

<p>Are you using a cab file to install on the phone or an executable via activesync on a pc? I have the Tilt and should be able to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to make it very easy on yourself? Upgrade your phone to Windows Mobile 6.1 (at no cost to you), from the maker of the phone's website. They included Voice Command in the package. See below link.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure to read the instructions carefully. The most important of which? Make sure your battery is at 50% or higher on the battery before you start the upgrade process.</p>

    <title>Cortana still will not read aloud incoming text messages on Lumia 950 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> worsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana still will not read aloud incoming text messages on Lumia 950 with Windows 10 Mobile v1709.</h2>
                    <p>My Lumia 635 WP8.1 phone would read incoming text messages via Cortana in the car using Bluetooth without any problems.</p>
<p>Since changing to a Lumia 950 W10M phone Cortana will not read text messages in or out of the car.</p>
<p>I have spent many hours searching the web and consulting "experts" on the subject without success. I have tried changing more settings than I can recall but this option can not be made to work.
</p>
<p>Cortana works otherwise and its voice option is functioning. </p>
<p>I have reset the phone many times but the Cortana read texts aloud option will not work.</p>
<p>The phone pairs successfully with the car and is correctly identified, the phone book is available, messages can be read on the screen, and hands free calls can be made.</p>
<p>The text reading is is a very helpful service when working that promotes safe phone use while in the car, and its sudden unavailability is very inconvenient.
</p>
<p>I have been unable to find any warnings of the problem or effective advice on corrective action from Microsoft before and after buying the phone. Also, the version of the phone manual I have contains very little useful information on troubleshooting this
 issue.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if anyone could suggest a solution to this baffling and troubling problem.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tom.</p>

<p>Hello Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having issues with your Cortana's read text message aloud feature on your Lumia 950. We'd like to know when did you start to experience this. Was this before or after the 1709 update? Is the
<strong>Read</strong> <strong>incoming</strong> <strong>text</strong> <strong>message</strong>
<strong>aloud</strong> feature of Cortana set to <strong>Always</strong> <strong>
on</strong>, <strong>Bluetooth</strong> <strong>only</strong>, <strong>Bluetooth</strong>
<strong>and</strong> <strong>wired</strong> <strong>headsets</strong>, or <strong>
Wired</strong> <strong>headset</strong> <strong>only</strong>? Is it working without using the Bluetooth connection with your car?<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>The phone was provided with the 1709 update and Cortana has never been able to read text messages. This is the case whether in the car with Bluetooth or not. At the moment the read text messages is set to "Always on", but it does not work. I have tried all
 the settings without success.</p>
<p>I don't think it is a Bluetooth issue because everything else works in the car after pairing it with the phone.</p>
<p>Cortana speech works when pressing the search microphone on the phone, and also if you dial the Cortana number from the car phone book.</p>
<p>I hope you can help.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for the information. Let’s check this further. Have you tried to turn off the Cortana and turned it back on? If not, please do so. To turn off the Cortana, kindly follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On Start or in the App list, tap <strong><span>Cortana</span></strong>.</li><li>Tap <strong><span>Cortana's Notebook</span></strong> <span>, and then tap <strong>

<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you reset your phone. We'd like to know if it is <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/forum/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">soft reset

<p>Thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp;If I tap:&nbsp;Cortana-menu bars-notebook, there are no settings, there are permissions but none that state Cortana off! If you tap: Cortana-menu bars, there is a settings item but it does not contain an option to turn Cortana off.</p>
<p>I am using M10M v1709 build: 10.0.15254.401.</p>
<p>Would you please provide instructions to turn Cortana on/off for this system.</p>

<p><span>We appreciate you giving us an update and information. Normally, the turn off option can be found under Cortana settings. In this case, we suggest that you use the Windows Device Recovery tool to isolate and fix any
</span>software problems on your phone. This tool will set your mobile device back to the release available for your mobile operator's network. Basically, it will revert the original operating system for your phone and remove everything else, including your
 apps, games, texts, call history, music, and photos. Therefore, creating a <strong>
<span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup</a></span></strong> on your phone before using the tool is important to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download and install the tool on a PC running Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10. Once installed, you will need to use a USB cable to connect your phone to a PC. Please make sure that the PC have at least 4 GB free storage space and
 is connected to the power outlet. Please also make sure that your phone is fully charged and do not shut down the computer during the recovery process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the reset option is not available in Cortana settings, we’d like to request that you send it to our Software Engineers and Software Developer by using the Cortana Feedback Hub. To do this, go to App list &gt;
<strong>Cortana</strong> &gt; <strong>Menu icon</strong> &gt; <strong>Feedback</strong>. You can create a thread or search for a similar issue and tap "<strong><span>upvote</span></strong>" to include this on the next update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information and to download the tool, you can visit <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Device Recovery Tool: FAQ</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. However, I have already reset and updated the phone and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>I have sent the feedback you suggested but this doesn't help resolve a problem with the Microsoft system when it is needed.</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions, but none of them has solved the problem.</p>
<p>This is obviously an issue with the operating system and Cortana that has occurred as a result of introducing W10M to replace WP8. The requirement for Cortana to be location based before it will work now does not seem necessary, and the lack of an on/off
 toggle switch is an omission. The many links between Cortana and other aspects of the system settings is not at all helpful and makes fault finding far more difficult. I am aware that this problem has been affecting a number of users for some time, and it
 is not good that Microsoft has not sorted it promptly for its loyal customers.</p>
<p>If I hadn't recently bought this phone I would seriously be considering an alternative to the Microsoft options.</p>
<p>I suppose I must wait and hope that Microsoft provide an update to correct this known fault, and in the interim live without a function that the OS claims to offer its users.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tom.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials updated v4 is ugly, cheapy, cheesy, plain, simple design right&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've just updated my MSE v2 to v4 and I thought I had a virus LOL due to the cheap fake plain&nbsp;new&nbsp;look design. I thought it was a hacker virus program. OMG look at that Protect Status bar its just white letters and a long green strip behind it. It so yucky,
 cheesy,&nbsp;cheapy,&nbsp;plain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone think so too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>whoever was in charge of this update must been drinking or smoking something, no offensive :P. But seriously how can&nbsp;you guys&nbsp;release this update? make bill gate look bad. This will be on the&nbsp;Magazines, Blogs, and News. Please bring back the MSE v2 look
 or make the v2 design better. Until a really nice better look design for the next update upgrade release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>everyone lets get on this and let Microsoft people know that it really&nbsp;needs to be change back to the v2 look or better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you guys are trying to do a simple layout for simple people that doesn't know how to use a computer than at least have an optional to switch the layout look. But still even if it simple as least make it look nice simple not old&nbsp;old&nbsp;technology photoshop
 look days. We want the V2 look or better PLEASE :)</p>

            <p>"Us guys" are users just like you...this is primarily a peer supported forum and very few of the visitors, posters, users, responders, etc., &nbsp;are employed by Microsoft.&nbsp; But I'll bet MS won't consider changing&nbsp;the appearance&nbsp;for quite a while.&nbsp; Especially
 since the interface was changed (from what I've heard through the proverbial grapevine) in response to other complaints that it was too complex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the price and my concern is not appearance but whether it's user friendly and&nbsp;I want it to do a good job at preventing and if necessary - removing malware issues.&nbsp; Hopefully&nbsp;MSE will continue to do that....based on the following links&nbsp;MSE must be
 doing a credible job.</p>

    <title>How long should I charge a new battery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rameshi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long should I charge a new battery</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a new battery (BP-4L) for my E63 handset from a Nokia Care outlet yesterday. The technician said I should switch off the phone and charge it for 3 hours on first recharge. I read in this and other online forums that Li-ion batteries don't have "memory
 effect" and don't require "conditioning" like earlier NiCd or NiMH batteries required. I also read that once the battery is fully charged it doesn't make any difference keeping the charger on and connected to the phone, which means charging it for over 1.5-2
 hrs serves no purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would like to know from experienced and knowledgeable folks whether above is true, and how I can get the best out of the new battery. Thanx.</p>

<p><span>Welcome to to the Nokia discussion boards!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to charge your device for the recommended first charge time just so you know it is fully charged. 2 Hours is sufficient charging time for this.</span></p>

<div>As long as you cancel while you are still on the trial period, you shouldn't be charged. &nbsp;When you cancel a trial subscription, you are really just stopping it from rolling you into the paid 30-day subscription, it won't cut your trial period short. &nbsp;I
 wouldn't recommend waiting until the last moment to try and cancel, to be on the safe side.</div>

    <title>Echo Problem on Nokia Asha 501 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesdean18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Echo Problem on Nokia Asha 501</h2>
                    
<p>I love my 501, but everyone I call on it complains that they hear them selves echoing at their end.&nbsp; I can't hear it myself, only the person at the other end does.&nbsp; It's consistent (happens to everyone I speak with using my 501) and did not happen with my
 old phone (a Samsung), plus I'm using the same carrier I've had for many years (AT&amp;T), so I'm certain that it's something to do with my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Nokia customer service last week, and the representative had me reset the phone.&nbsp; All that did was cause me to lose all the contacts in my phonebook (she assured me the this wouldn't happen, but it did) which I ended up having to rekey in manually;
 the echo is still there for anyone I speak with on the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else run into this issue?&nbsp; Is there a fix for it?&nbsp; I love my little Nokia, but if this problem can't be solved then I'm going back to a Samsung (which I'd prefer not to do).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Your phone needs a hardware inspection. Because your unit is rather new, you should bring it to your dealer who either exchanges it or sends it to a local but genuine Nokia Care Centre. Make sure to include a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/problem-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>detailed error report</u></a> otherwise you end-up with support ping-pong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your SIM got cut, you should consider to go for a genuine Micro-SIM because those SIM break over time, which might be notable only with certain devices. you are able to rule out the SIM, by testing the wired headset from the box.</p>

            <p>Hi Fran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes you can change the sound when a new messages arrives in Outlook or the Pop-up notification in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the new mail sound you need to <strong>exit Outlook</strong>, then Open the<strong> Control Panel</strong> then choose
<strong>Sound</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the <strong>Sound</strong> dialog box, select the <strong>Sounds</strong> tab, under
<strong>Program Events</strong>, find <strong>New Mail Notification</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3406ef6e-0fbb-4773-8155-f672c275a9b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3406ef6e-0fbb-4773-8155-f672c275a9b3" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now change to your desired sound alert by choosing from the list of sounds under
<strong>Sounds</strong>, click Test to hear the selected sound. Click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Only .wav audio files are supported. Other audio file formats such as .mp3 or .aac can’t be used. Your favorite sound editing program might be able to convert other audio file formats to a .wav file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have questions.</p>

<h2>            Prompted for User Account Control when starting Excel</h2>
                    <p>User Account Control Loading Excel</p>
<p>Every time I try to load Excel, User Account Control requires me to allow Excel to make changes to this computer. This wastes time as I load it often every day.</p>
<p>Please supply a fix that doesn't involve changing the recommended settings.</p>
<p>How is it that MS doesn't recognise one of its own programs ?</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>Unfortunately the problem still exists.</p>
<p>If it helps, I am using a Dell XPS with an Intel Core i7, 8GB of memory, and the latest version of Office (Home and Business) with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.</p>
<p>I have a friend who has Office Professional and he&nbsp;doesn't have the problem if he logs on as System Administrator, but has the problem when he logs on as a standard user.</p>

            <p>I corrected this by changing the properties of the Excel executable file (EXCEL.EXE). In Windows 7, Excel 2003 it's in:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\OFFICE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the right mouse to call up the properties dialog. Pick the compatibility tab. On mine, privilege level "Run as administrator" was checked, and I unchecked it. This corrected the problem.</p>

<span>Users on older builds (with the same permissions) do not have the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - when the user makes changes to a workbook from either sharepoint or sharepoint online, and click save, they get the save as box instead and are not able to even select the original location and save over it. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - user has data connections to another Excel workbook and clicks refresh, then they get an error that the source can't be opened. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>My email account is either not receiving emails or they are taking as much as 24 hours to arrive. I've tried accessing my email via the mail app on an Android phone, via the CloudMagic App on an iPad and via a web browser on iPad. None of them show the message
 as being received. Also it doesn't seem to matter whether the messages are sent from CloudMagic or from the ipad email app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In comparison, sending messages to my husband's hotmail account works within seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've checked the service statuses and they are all showing no problem. I've also checked Junk mail and the messages are not going there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are not receiving emails sent to your account on Android phone and iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when your account went out of sync with the phone, or the mail server settings were not configured properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to send a test mail to your account. Try with a different browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can resolve this by removing and re-adding your account from the phone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I don't think this is a device or browser specific issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday we tried to access test messages on:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>An Android smart phone using the Android email app</li><li>An iPad using the Cloud Magic email app.</li><li>An iPad using the Safari browser to open my account.</li></ol>
<p>In each case the messages took 30+ minutes to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In contrast I've just tried again to send a test message from an iPad and it appeared almost instantly on the Android phone. Very puzzling .</p>

            <p>Hello Simon,</p>
<p>This error normally translates to a poor internet connection.&nbsp; Were you trying to connect across your cellular connection or your Wi-Fi connection?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you try a Wi-Fi connection, or a different one from the one you were using previously?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for letting us know about your experience with HTC Live.&nbsp; This is a new feature for us, and I'm sure they will be up to speed in no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<h2>            Recovery Key for nokia 650</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old nokia 920 finally failed, so I will use my son's 650.&nbsp; However, I can not reset it.&nbsp; I need the recovery reset key code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed this link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Next to the phone you no longer own, select&nbsp;<strong>Remove phone</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>I'm ready to remove my phone</strong>&nbsp;check box, note the recovery key, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Remove</strong>. The recovery key will display on the page and will also be emailed to you.</li><li>
<p>When you're certain that you have your recovery key saved, select the&nbsp;<strong>I've kept a copy of the recovery key</strong>&nbsp;check box, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Okay</strong>.</p>

<p><span>Your phone is no longer listed on this </span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>, and you can remove Reset Protection during phone

    <title>Outlook 2016 keeps asking for password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_87122  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 keeps asking for password</h2>
                    <p>This is a recent development.&nbsp; Normally I log on in the morning and Outlook keeps my password as long as I am logged on, so that I just have to enter my password once a day.&nbsp; I don't want Outlook to save my password permanently, but recently I've started
 having a problem where I have to enter my password every single time I check for new messages, which is pretty annoying.&nbsp; I can get back to the normal Outlook behavior if I do a System Restore to before the problem started, but it keeps coming back.&nbsp; I have
 done System Restore three or four times now.&nbsp; Each time things will be OK again for a week or so and then the problem comes back.&nbsp; I cannot figure what is causing it.&nbsp; At first I thought maybe it was a problem with a system update, but it is not associated
 with the regular updates as far as I can tell (I also turned off the option to update other Microsoft products along with Windows, but that doesn't seem to have helped).&nbsp; I have done a bit of searching for an answer, but the only answers I have been able to
 find have to do with saving your password in Outlook (which I don't want to do) and&nbsp; problems with credentials (which I tried, but did not seem to have any effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information:&nbsp; I have Windows 10 64 bit and Office 2016.&nbsp; I am using Outlook to connect to a single e-mail account via POP3 and SMTP.</p>

<p>Hi Mike, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having an issue with your Outlook 2016 password. For us to isolate everything here, we would like to know if you tried signing in your Outlook account using a different device. Also, have you tried using a different account to see
 if the same issue persists? This is for us to know if it has something to do with the account itself or with the Outlook app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response. </p>
        </p>

<p>First of all, so far it has been working properly since Monday, but only time will tell if it starts acting up again.&nbsp; I'm being careful to keep restore points at times I know it is working properly.&nbsp; As for your questions, I usually only use Outlook on
 one device (a Dell desktop) and one e-mail account.&nbsp; I regularly connect to that e-mail account on my phone (Samsung), but not with Outlook.&nbsp; I occasionally (pretty rarely) connect using Outlook 2007 on an Asus laptop/tablet (IMAP rather than POP3).&nbsp; That
 seems to be working fine at this moment, and I'll try to use it more over coming days to see if it acts up at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The problem occurred again this morning.&nbsp; For the record, that's 10 days since the last time.&nbsp; There were no recent updates in the Update History, and there was no obvious reason for the change.&nbsp; Just, one time I went to check messages (I do it manually
 rather than on a time schedule) and Outlook prompted for my password, even though it had already been entered before.&nbsp; I tried shutting down and restarting Outlook.&nbsp; I tried shutting down and restarting my computer.&nbsp; Outlook still wanted the password every
 time I tried to check messages.&nbsp; So I did a System Restore again and now Outlook is back to working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this has anything to do with the Outlook problem because it has not happened previous times, but I'll mention that since the System Restore I'm having some problems.&nbsp; After a restart I got a blue screen with stop code CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED,
 and Dropbox isn't working for some reason.&nbsp; But Outlook is working!</p>

<p>Good to know that your Outlook problem is now working. Based on the error message you received,<span> If the processor is unable to process these multiple processes properly, it generates the CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED error. Sometimes this error can be quite
 critical as it could damage your hard disk, memory or in rare circumstances, your processor.</span><span>
</span><span>In this case, we may need to perform some troubleshooting steps and see if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fil-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start your device in Safe mode</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe Mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in Safe Mode with Networking, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in “How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot “to reset computer as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and install all the latest chip set drivers.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest that you download and install all the latest chip set drivers and Hardware Driver update from the manufactures website.</p>

<h2>            No &#34;Spreadsheet &#62; Existing Excel Spreadsheet&#34; options on the &#34;Insert&#34; tab in my OneNote</h2>
                    <p>I am using the OneNote that comes with Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 pre-installed on my Microsoft Surface III Pro. I want to insert a spreadsheet in OneNote and be able to edit the spreadsheet within OneNote. But I don't see the options of inserting a spreadsheet
 on the "Insert" tab. All I have on "Insert" is "File" and then 1) "Insert as Attachment", 2) "Insert PDF Printout" &amp; 3) "Send to OneNote".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked online and learned that on the Insert tab I should be able to choose "Spreadsheet &gt; Existing Excel Spreadsheet". But there are no such options in my OneNote.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried repeatedly to reset the OneNote program within Windows, uninstall and reinstall OneNote again, and even tried to get help from the Windows online help team. But no one seems to know why I do not have that option within my OneNote or how the
 issue could be fixed. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Downloading attachments in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>For the past month or so, I have been unable to download attachments from emails in outlook.com to my computer. This occurs at work with IE and at home with Chrome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can save the attachments to OneDrive, but whenever I try to download directly to my computer, I get a HTTP 404 Not found&nbsp; message "The webpage cannot be found". The View option sometimes works and at other times I get the same error as when I try to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is terribly inconvenient. Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution?</p>

            <p>Both inline images and viewing attachments like PDF files and Images did not work on my account either after it was "upgraded" to the new Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I was able to solve it was by making the Primary Alias my @outlook.com email and waiting hours (4 to 8) for it to take effect. &nbsp;I tried it a dozen times over the last 9 months probably but never waited long enough before switching the
 primary alias back to the primary email that I have used for the last decade for it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not ideal but you can still sign in with any of your other aliases to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a quick write up I did on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is a 9+ month old bug in the Outlook.com code and it happens on some accounts but not on others. &nbsp;It has been there since the release of the new version in the Spring of 2016 for my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately Microsoft does not care enough about their customers to spend a few days fixing these major bugs so we are stuck with a "New" Outlook.com that is far worse than the old Hotmail/Live programs that worked really well for the last decade.</p>

<h2>            Single versus Double spacing after a sentence &#40;not to be confused with double spacing within a paragraph&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    In MS Word 2003 there is an option in grammar &amp; spelling check to select 1 space or 2 spaces as grammatically appropriate after a period. This option seems to have dissapeared in MS Word 2007. I am running the student version and I have read plenty of
 forums telling me to just find and replace all ". &nbsp;" with ". " but I do not want to do this. I want a single space after a period to be the norm for my documents like it was on my MS Word 2003. Please help! &nbsp;

</div>
<div>This issue relates to wanting a paragraph to read like this example. I am frustrated with Microsoft Word. I want only one space to be grammatically correct after sentences. I am tired of receiving documents written by others who double space after a sentence
 before beginning the next.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not want paragraphs to read like this example. &nbsp;People insert two spaces after a sentence because they learned that way in typing class or learned on a typewriter. &nbsp;This is acceptable, but in academic work and things you want published, it is cumbersome&nbsp;and
 an issue that should be avoided. &nbsp;Individuals should use one space after a sentence, not two, in documents crafted in modern word processing software.</div>

            <p>Well the setting is there.</p>
<p>Office Button&gt;Proofing&gt;When correcting spelling and grammar in Word&gt;Settings&gt;Require&gt;Spaces required between sentences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However setting this option on your particular installation of Word is will not&nbsp;prevent you from receiving documents written by others who double space after a sentence.</p>
