<p>
</p><p><span>We understand how you feel about the situation. Let me guide you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Uninstalling the Office suite won't make you lose any documents. However, you won't be able to access the document until the Office suite is re-installed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I need more information before to help you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) What do you mean by <strong>so figure I need to delete 365? Do you already have Office 365 installed on your computer?</strong>
<br />
<br />
2) Do you receive any error? If so, what is the complete error? <br />
<br />
You may refer to the following KB article which discusses about common Office installation issues and see if it helps.<br />

            I know this question is really old, but since I had the same issue but figured it out, I thought I would post it here. In your source manager you have a Master list and a Current List. The Current list is the list of references entered while working on
 this document. In the current list a little check mark appears to the left of a reference. This tells you if the reference has been cited within the document. When you are done (aka not adding any more citations) remove the unchecked references. They will
 remain on your master list, but won't appear on your bibliography.<br />
Similarly, if there is a reference you use in many different documents you can always pull that into your current list from your master list so you don't have to recreate that reference.<br />

            Whether uncited entries appear at the end of the list probably depends on the referencing format you're using. Regardless, merely deleting them from the bibliography is singularly ineffective. As soon as you do anything that causes Word to refresh fields
 in the document (e.g. printing the document or updating the bibliography after adding a new item), the deletions and&nbsp;any other edits you might have made to the bibliography will all be reverted.

<h2>            how to undo&#47;reset&#47;delete Symbiotic links for desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows 10 preview(10061). Randomly a symlink folder to my desktop appeared on my desktop that I could not delete. Stupid me, I tried moving into my "documents" folder thinking it would just sit there and at least be out of the way and now it's
 symlinked all my documents to my desktop and vice versa, so deleting anything from either deletes the source and these folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My "documents"&nbsp; folder essentially became another "desktop" folder to which I cannot fix. Adjusting it in properties &lt;i&gt;says&lt;/i&gt; it's documents but even on the folder overview it's still labeled as "desktop", is still symlinked to desktop, and as a new default
 there is no documents folder to "move" to or "find target"...moving to another folder&nbsp;asks me to move contents and&nbsp;simply creates a duplicate "desktop" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm inclined to think that&nbsp;this very much a Win10 issue&nbsp;as I know for a fact I didn't mess around with other&nbsp;user folders, yet&nbsp;when open up my user folder there is a mess of duplicates with this stupid time paradox I created myself with the 2 folders I described
 above but also my Pictures, Music, Downloads, Video folder all have their own symlinked duplicates that cannot be gotten rid of without deleting all the content</p>

            <p>The entire insidious way metro has taken over the whole damned OS. I thought that I had made that perfectly clear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a very large segment of ms's user base, metro is completely, 100% unwanted. But instead of less metro, win10 gives us more, despite the cosmetic touch-ups.</p>

            <p>Even with 8.1, you could start your machine in desktop mode and avoid metro except for metro apps. I think W10 is great - I hope MS continues to refine it but avoids major UI tweaks at this point.&nbsp; I recently installed on a TPY Yoga (I have installed W10
 on multiple machines since the technical preview came out) and&nbsp;while there are of course a few quirks still, it is very usable and very enjoyable.&nbsp; I did get bored with the Metro UI and the tiles, but this seems like a very fair compromise.</p>

<p>Well yes, of course I use classic shell, win 10 is unusable without it. I wasn't merely referring to the ridiculous inclusion of metro in the start menu, which is hideous enough. I refer to everything else. The notification center, for instance, is a moronic
 metro app. The horrible new calculator, is a metro app. And the list just goes on and on. Metro has taken over, very quietly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to make matters worse, like many people, I turn off uac, via the registry... which in turn hobbles metro, which in turn hobbles windows itself. Pretty soon, there won't be anything left.</p>

    <title>Applying themes but not fonts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cg2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applying themes but not fonts</h2>
                    <p>I would like to be able to apply a theme however not change fonts.&nbsp; We have many old presentations that have customized fonts and font sizes on most of the slides.&nbsp; I know that in not the "Right" way to make presentations yet that is the sitituaiton.&nbsp; So
 I want to apply a theme but not change the font or font size, is that possible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can you edit a theme to remove the font information and still apply the theme or will it just complain the file is corrupt or an access error?&nbsp; So far my first attemp ended with the error accessing the file issue.&nbsp; I have created VBA code to create&nbsp;a copy
 of a presentation and reformat all the text boxes to the original in 2003 however was hoping it could be done with themes in 2007 or&nbsp;2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can a template be created without theme aware fonts?&nbsp; I tried and they ended up being teme aware, assuming I understand this correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a property of the font that makes it theme aware?&nbsp; Can I create a&nbsp;macro that makes the font not theme aware?&nbsp; I do not see a property that looks like it indicated a font is&nbsp;theme aware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>A theme consists of a number of settings font is just one of them.&nbsp; If you are refering to fonts applied to standard place holders then&nbsp;it wouldn't be too hard to have a theme use alternative fonts.</p>
<p>If you look in the Design tab, Themes section there is a font button, this allows you to change the fonts used by the theme to any other installed theme.&nbsp; So effecitvely you can load a presentation set it to a them and then if the Theme font is not the desired
 one assign the fonts as used in another theme.</p>
<p>There is also an option to create New Theme Fonts, for Heading (Title place holders and Body content palceholders).&nbsp; Using this you can assign any font to the standard parts of your presentation.&nbsp; There's no option for colour as this is controlled in another
 set of values with in the theme, use the Colors option for this.</p>
<p>Font size is controlled by the slide master, as is the background content of the slides and the location of the placeholders for Tile, Content anf Footer components</p>
<p>If there's no combination that meets your requirement then you could try the tool provided here</p>
<p><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/themebuilder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://connect.microsoft.com/themebuilder</a></p>
<p>to build your own theme, but you'd need to combine it with a slide master to have complete control.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerpoint is designed to keep presentations consistent and what I want to do is keep them inconsistent in font and font size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to&nbsp; not apply any font or font size to slides when a theme/design is applied.&nbsp; My conclusion is VBA is the only option to reset the fonts and fontsize after applying the theme.</p>

            <p>I have just tested using text boxes in a file generated in 2003, opened in 2007.</p>
<p>For actual text boxes the font assigned to the text box is retained in 2007 after the theme is changed.</p>
<p>The only things that changed were the colours.&nbsp; But that was due to the use of palette colours in the 2003 file which are mapped to the colours in the theme.</p>
<p>The same applies font formatting applied to text in title and content placeholders.</p>
<p>So the theme is only applying the background graphics, position of standard placeholders, alignment of text in placeholders, colour if colour from the colour scheme in 2003 were used.&nbsp; For the odd theme Opulent for example titles are reformatted to use text
 effects (the old Word Art) but font and size are preserved.</p>
<p>Of course if you already have the VBA to format as required it may still be functional in 2007.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            Windows Phone 7 and USSD</h2>
                    Hi? <br />
<br />
On Lumia 900 and I cannot use certain USSD based apps like mobile banking. I read emDial can solve that but it's not available in Kenyan market place. How can I get the app and install it?
<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Akhenaten77,<br />
<br />
Thanks for visiting the Answers forum.<br />
<br />
I understand that you're having issues installing an app because it's not available in your region.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, app publishers can opt to restrict apps in certain regions based on their own personal preferences. If an app is not available in your region, then it is not able to be downloaded.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no workarounds for this other than using the apps that are provisioned for your region.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
<br />

            I have same problem with an old Cingular 8125 that I'm trying to sync with Windows Mobile 6.1 so that I can then convert to my new Iphone.&nbsp; Contacts and notes synced fine and some of the permanent calendar items, but none of the regular calendar items
 came across.&nbsp; I have the sync set to "all" rather than last 6 months etc., but still no go<br />

            <p>I also had a very fast WiFi but unfortunately that always failed to download a particular update. This has nothing to do with you but rather your ISP's problem.
</p>
<p>The best way is to connect to another WiFi or connect to a wifi hotspot(using 3G/LTE).</p>

<h2>            Incorrect number displayed</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a Nokia Lumia 520 and was looking at my windowsphone account today and realised this is displaying the wrong number. I have had a look through my phone at Settings&gt;Applications&gt;Phone and the number showing here is also incorrect. When i bought the
 phone i also bought a new sim card with the same provider i was with. I had my number transferred to the new sim card. Is there a way to fix this as if i ever lost my phone i would like to lock or block the phone via the windowsphone website.</p>

            <p>Hmm, I've always used the same SIM provider &nbsp;(and have never changed my number). As time has gone by, I have had new devices that use a different size SIM and when I have used them the number is always displayed. I thought the number was coded on the SIM
 (and would expect it would be).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If it were mine, I would probably hard reset. When it sets up the device it has to recognize and read the SIM. The number should appear correctly. If it does not, I would go to your provider and have them check(verify) that the SIM is correct.</p>

            <p>I'm with Jack, I'd check with your provider. The phone and subsequently the web, get your number off the SIM in the phone. The phone number is associated with the ID on the SIM. When you call the number shown does your phone ring? It would have to be something
 in the provider data or SIM that needs to be fixed.</p>

                    <p>if you are having strange problems with windows 10 and devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best solution will be to reset all your hardware, meaning clear cmos, physically remove the add-in cards (gfx) and let them drain out the stored power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>rebuild your pc, reinstall windows 10 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>enjoy a problem free windows 10.</p>

            Pretty extreme as a last resort. Almost sounds like something one should be doing to isolate a hardware or an extreme virus problem. Been there and done those to fix problems for people that have come to me about it. I have not seen it on Windows 10 yet
 which is a good thing right now.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just saw a firmware upgrade being suggested by Ovi Suite for my nokia e71 as Version 510.21.009.</p>
<p>It showed as REQUIRED and featured a lot of improvements and stability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as i started downloading it, the internet disconnected suddenly and now i can not see any upgrade available.</p>
<p>Right now, my firmware version is 500.21.009</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - 10041, no desktop just a grey screen after login</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>DELL XPS 18 Update from Win 8.1 Up 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to switch back to Win 8.1 after installing 9926 of Win 10. Dragon NaturallySpeaking stopped working completely and I NEED that program.</p>
<p>Now that 10041 was released I figured I would try to use that to see if anything changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a system image of my 8.1 Up 1 setup :-) I downloaded 10041 ISO then extracted the files from the ISO (mounting and copying them to an external USB 3.0 drive). The install&nbsp;made it all the way through (I am using it now) - side note: Love the new
 setup screens</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the event viewer is full of errors and I don't have a desktop O.o - just a grey screen.</p>
<p>I've used Task Manager to launch Event Viewer, IE, Snipping Tool and a command prompt.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there is any other information I can get you. I'll leave it in this state for a few days and use Ubuntu (not a dual boot, I use an external USB to boot from and have used it this way with 8.1, 8.1 Up1, 1st Win 10 Preview - dragon worked fine
 on this version, then build 9926 for a couple days)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance your can give.</p>

<p>On the Internet I found an ISO for build 10056, I used that to upgrade from Windows 8.1 update 1.</p>
<p>Once that finished installing; roughly 2 hours later. I chose fast under "choose how preview builds are installed" that's when build 10061 was available.</p>

Dragon NaturallySpeaking premium version 13 works :-) I am dictating with it right now. As well as my Plantronics 780 headset.<br />

<h2>            White Font turns Black when I save as Picture on Powerpoint.</h2>
                    <p>So I created a poster on powerpoint and I used white coloured font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to save it as a png file and hence I selected everything and used the "save as picture" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I saved it as an image, I opened the .png file to realise that the fonts had turned black. How can I get around this problem and still save it as an image while preserving my white fonts?</p>

<p><span>Hi Ain,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on your description, I suggest you try the following steps to check if the issue occurs:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Create a new PowerPoint file&gt;type white text on text box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Select the text box.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-Click the text box&gt;Save as picture.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. The Office version and OS version.</span></p>
<p><span>2. How did you create the poster?</span></p>
<p><span>3. The screenshot of the PowerPoint file and PNG file. As we need the screenshot to contrast.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Did the issue occurs on a new file?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Sorry, we are having trouble showing some of your notebooks. Please check back later.</h2>
                    <p>I am running office at work. I get this error and I am unable to access an old notebook. I have tried this both on Mac and Windows, on both I am unable to see the notebook. When I go online in 365 i get this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b64328f-ad22-4c37-9a11-f76d44bb2694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b64328f-ad22-4c37-9a11-f76d44bb2694" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything has been updated. The old notebook was created in OneNote 2016. I would like to get this notebook back, given that there is an error of this sort I am assuming there is a "location" where this could be retrieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jerzy,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates.<br />
<br />
Could you confirm and provide the following?<br />
<br />
1. How many notebooks did you create in the OneDrive for Business library?<br />
2. If you click the notebook you recently created in the OneDrive for Business library, can it be opened and work fine?<br />
3. Does the issue happen in the old specific notebook?<br />
<br />
Given the situation, I suggest you try the following and let us know the outcome.<br />
1. If you create a new notebook stored in the OneDrive for Business library on your Mac, check if the issue also happens in it.<br />
2. Check if you can find the notebook in OneNote 2016 on Windows and if you have the backup locally. If yes, copy the content from the previous notebook to a newly created notebook to see the outcome.<br />
3. Check the recycle bin and the Second-stage recycle bin to see if some notebooks there.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Cliff<br />
<br />
