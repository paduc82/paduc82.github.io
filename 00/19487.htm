 - deleted the unstable text and reformatted it from scratch, making sure the columns are correctly linked, but I'm still getting problems. I've tried Adobe Online support and it's not the PDF converter. I've even deleted duplicate fonts from the Apple Font

            Hi,
<div>Finally got onto Microsoft Support, as I needed this document urgently. They looked at it for a while and eventually got me to copy the source text for that section into Pages, as you have suggested, and then delete the 'bad' text from the word file, recreate
 'new' blank pages and then paste the text from the Pages file back into the document. I needed to do a little reformatting, BUT this did the trick!!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Many thanks for your reply and I hope this thread helps others. It would be nice to know why this happened, but I guess I'll never know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks also to Microsoft.</div>

<h2>            Refresh multiple pivot tables shortcut</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a workbook with multiple pivot tables linked to one datasheet that I've created. When using Excel 2010 (in compatibilty mode),
</p>
<p>the shortcut Ctrl + Alt + F5 refreshes all pivot tables just fine</p>
<p>When I'm using the workbook on a machine that has an earlier version of Excel, the shortcut doesn't work</p>
<p>Does anyone know if there is a shortcut that will work for the earlier version of Excel that would work for me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That short cut key combination should work in Excel 2007 as well.&nbsp; As far as I know, in Excel 2003 and prior versions, there is no short cut key to refresh a pivot table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if at all there is some way in Excel 2003 and prior versions, it has to be under Data &gt; Refresh All.</p>

<h2>            Why still no ability to alphabetize OneNote Windows 10 notebooks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read that Microsoft wants us to move from Onenote 2016 to Onenote for Windows 10, but there's a good reason not to, for me anyway. It still hasn't provided the very basic option of sorting notebooks. At least there is an app--Onetastic--that makes sorting
 possible in Onenote 2016 (which means it is technically possible). Microsoft must have some reason to deliberately withhold this capability, but I can't imagine what it is. It's such an obvious thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want&nbsp;<em>this </em>user to use the Windows 10 app, provide this very basic option. Otherwise, there's no good reason to switch.</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>

<p>I understand that OneNote for Windows 10 as a newer product doesn't have as many features as in OneNote 2016, and our advanced users may find it less likely to have an equally smooth customer experience
 on this new product.

 here</a>), you may go on using it for the following years. Meanwhile, you may also send your suggestion to the OneNote team in the OneNote for Windows 10 application by clicking the ellipses in the right side of the toolbar &gt; select Settings &gt; Feedback. You
 may also share your experience and insights in the&nbsp;<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327186-onenote-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneNote for Windows UserVoice forum</a>&nbsp;so that the OneNote for Windows development team will know your requirements.

            Maybe I will follow your suggestions, although I doubt that it would do any good. The ability to alphabetize the folders is such an obvious one that surely the people of Microsoft have thought about it and decided not to do it. As feature-rich as the app
 is, why is this not present already? If it was an oversight, it was an elementary oversight. I think it's a safe bet that other people have suggested this as well.

<p>Hi Rick,</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your understanding. I agree that the feature of alphabetize your notebooks is a very useful one.

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the conversation between Rick and I that OneNote 2016 and OneNote for Windows 10 don't have this feature. I assume that you may have used a third-party add-in on your OneNote 2016 such as Onetastic, as Rick mentioned. You may tell us
 the name of the add-in and let me test to find the way of changing the order.</p>

<p><br />
Open a new workbook with the default three sheets in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select all sheets then do a page setup and set your margins and other stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ungroup the sheets then File&gt;Save As&gt;Saveas Type&gt;Template(*.xlt).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Name it BOOK then save it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open another new workbook and delete all but one sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format your margins etc. then same as above except name it SHEET</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Move those two templates into&nbsp;your XLSTART folder they will become the default New&gt;Workbook and New&gt;Worksheet.</p>

<h3> jonrichco1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem pasting from Word 365 clipboard</h2>
                    I used the clipboard for the first time today. However, Word pasted all clipboard items into a single paragraph and not into separate paras, which I need. I could work around this by pasting the clipboard into Excel, but this seems to be a somewhat strange
 solution. Any ideas on how to paste directly from the clipboard into separate paras in Word? Maybe it is just a glitch in Office. Thanks<br />

            Thanks Doug, but I want to paste all items in the clipboard into separate paragraphs at one time. This is how the clipboard used to work. I would never want to do it one item at a time. It seems to be a mistake made by MS, as the current system is hopeless.
 Unless there is something wrong with my system, or there is something I am missing.<br />

            Which clipboard are you using, Windows or Office?<br />
<br />
I have not seen the clipboard do what you are describing<br />
<br />
I tried using the Office clipboard, it pasted all of the paragraphs separate not matter if they were copied individually, or in a group.<br />

            I am using the Word 365 clipboard. If I copy several sentences within paragraphs from a document to the clipboard, and paste all - it pastes all of the clipboard items into a single paragraph.&nbsp; However, if I copy full paragraphs to the clipboard, it does
 seem to operate properly and pastes them as separate paragraphs.<br />

It makes sense, since the snips from inside the paragraph don't have a paragraph mark.

            I guess that is the reason. But it is annoying - in this particular case, I had 20 items on the clipboard, which I needed to paste separately and sort. As mentioned I could work around the problem by pasting into Excel, where the clipboard pastes all as
 separate rows. The cells can then be copied into Word as a table, then converted to text.
<br />
<br />
I don't recall earlier versions of Word having this problem. So to me it represents a small but significant problem that MS should resolve. Inserting a linefeed should be the default action - it is far easier to remove line feeds if you don't want them, compared
 to the several and unintuitive steps required to insert them by the means I outlined above.<br />

You are lucky to have identified that you can use Excel as an intermediate step to get what you want<br />

            Sounds like you have different resolution settings on the two computers. Best to find out what the projector system is using and change your PC to match while you create your presentation. 1024x768 is pretty common for middle-of-the-road projectors newer
 HD systems can go higher.&nbsp;

<p>In any case, I think that we are in agreement that the "Paste Formatting" is no longer available to be added to a custom toolbar.</p>

<p>I have just got a Samsung laptop with Windows 8 &amp; Internet explorer 10. Initially the appearance of IE 10 would be as shown in the image taken as a screen print from the website. this had the address bar , tabs&nbsp; &amp; tool bar hidden.

            <p>That is the START screen view.&nbsp; It has changed to the Desktop view, probably because another browser (Chrome) has been installed.&nbsp; Only one browser can be the default browser.</p>

<h2>            Macro to copy data from excel to word</h2>
                    
<p>I need help!</p>
<p>On a daily basis I run reports a large number of reports.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have set up macros to delete rows matching criterias.&nbsp; I now require a macro that will copy the used cells/rows into a word document.</p>
<p>In word,&nbsp;I currently use a macros that insert text at the beginning and end of the document, currently I am manually copying the used cells/rows across to word.&nbsp; Is there anyway that I can automate this.</p>

</p><p>Hi, I've implemented your macro to copy worksheets to Word. It was working fine however now when I run it it copies the entire worksheet, including hundreds of rows of empty cells below the required data. I have two worksheets that require copying, which
 will be completely different ranges. Can I set specific ranges for each worksheet within this macro, or else how can I prevent Excel from copying all the unneeded empty cells?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. Perhaps I should have said that my worksheets have numerous empty rows - therefore this just copied down from A1 until it found the first empty row, and then stopped. What could I do to copy all data? Or set ranges per worksheet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hello Er. Nitin Pandey<br />
<br />
Thank you for thorough code. <br />
Is it possible to re-write the code with the option to open specific document ( in my particular case, it a contract form (template)&nbsp;and in a particual row from the wordfile&nbsp;I must enter common customer data such as names address and etc. )<br />
Secondly, I should be able to rename the file with the name of customer for example and since I imput new customer, it should creat new file contract with the new customer.<br />
To clarify</p>
<p>file_name = x</p>
<p>person = xy<br />
rename file_name from x to xy<br />
After that I must be able to send it instantly through email.<br />
Thank you in&nbsp;advance for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards!<br />
<br />

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I figured out this option but it seemed &nbsp;to me &nbsp;not the best possible way to solve the problem in long term. The reason behind that is because it I have N number persons I need to make N individual contacts. Therefore if the macros
 take the raw data and insert it in N world documents which are equal to the N number customers &nbsp;will safe valuable time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will appreciate any help modifying similar code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will clarify so that you will understand &nbsp;what I mean :</p>
<p>In excel spreadsheet I have two records with client data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore macros must l open twice two word templates and to integrate the data on specific places into the contract form. After that it should safe the document as a separate and rename the files with the customer name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That sounds like a situation where the use of Mail Merge is a perfect solution. &nbsp;Set the Contract document as a Letters type mail merge main document and attach the Excel spreadsheet as the data source. &nbsp; Then insert merge fields in the appropriate locations
 in the document and then execute the merge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be able to create individual documents with the filename of each document being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source, you could use the Merge to Individual Docs facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can download the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file from the following page of my One Drive:</span></p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge out-of-the-box:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail
 message.</span></li><li><span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></li><li><span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></li><li><span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></li><li><span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></li><li><span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></li><li><span>Duplex Merges</span></li><li><span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></li></ul>

<p>Hallo Mr. Robbins,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had &nbsp;followed your advice and realized that you were absolutely right. I highly appreciate your assistance solving the issue. I can't miss to highlight how useful was the mail merger tool for extracting the contracts as separate files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be wonderful with your permission &nbsp;if your share the code behind it even though it is your intellectual property and &nbsp;I fully respect how &nbsp;much effort you have put on it.</p>
<p>Wish you all the best!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I started my Reporting Server and if I use the Internet Explorer as a Administrator everything works fine.</p>
<p>But if I don't open it as an admin it calls "rsAccessDenied The user [...] does not have the permission...".</p>
<p>Problem is that I want to run it in an SAP Program with an HTML Viewer. </p>
<p>Does anyone have a clue how I can get those Permissions ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way somehow I'm not able to create or change roles in the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.</p>
<p>Any clue about this one ? :/</p>

<h2>            How to force Internet Explorer 9 to open pdf in the application windows as opposed to in the browser&#63;</h2>
                    This should be very simple but I've been struggling to make it work. I disable the plugin for Acrobat viewer and then I cannot open any PDF files? Why is this so simple in other browsers and such a pain in IE?

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Where did you disable the plug-in for acrobat viewer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you disable the plug-in for acrobat viewer in Internet Explorer, then you cannot view PDF files in Internet Explorer, but you can view on other browsers.</span></p>
<p>
<span>So I would suggest you to enable the plug-in/add-ons for the acrobat viewer in order to view PDF files in Internet Explorer.</span></p>

    <title>Using Merge Fields in a Split Document Macro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawngosney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Merge Fields in a Split Document Macro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use an Access database to merge client information into letters in Word. I can select multiple records in access and create all of the merge letters at once - however, they of course merge into one document with a new letter on each page. I have a VB Macro
 to split the document into separate letter files. My question is whether it is possible to use one of the merge fields to populate the document name as the Split Macro loops through each page. For instance, can I use the "Applicant Name"&nbsp;merge field to populate
 as the document name for each new split &amp; save? If this is doable, help would be much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code:</p>
<p>Sub&nbsp;SplitLetters()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Used to set criteria for moving through the document by page.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.Browser.Target = wdBrowsePage</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = 1 To ActiveDocument.BuiltInDocumentProperties("Number of Pages")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Select and copy the text to the clipboard.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Bookmarks("\page").Range.Copy</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Open new document to paste the content of the clipboard into.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documents.Add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.Paste<br />
' Removes the break that is copied at the end of the page, if any.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.TypeBackspace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ChangeFileOpenDirectory "C:\"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DocNum = DocNum + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=DocNum &amp; ".doc"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Close</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Move the selection to the next page in the document.<br />

            <p>The merge fields don't exist as fields in the output of the merge -- they're replaced by the value of the source field for the current record as plain text. There isn't anything field-related there for your macro to refer to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your merge document (where the merge fields are) is such that the applicant name is always in the same paragraph in each page, for instance in the third paragraph, then the macro can grab the text from that paragraph, delete the paragraph mark at the
 end of it, and use the text as the file name. In code,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; strApplicName = Replace(ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(3).Range.Text, vbCr, "")<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveDocument.SaveAs FileName:=strApplicName &amp; ".doc", &nbsp;_</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FileFormat:=wdFormatDocument97<br />
</p>
<p>To use this in your macro, change the number 3 in Paragraphs(3) to the number of the paragraph that contains the "Applicant Name" merge field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this won't work if any merge field that precedes "Applicant Name" could possibly insert more than one paragraph into the output.</p>

The MergeTools  20150422.dotm file needs to be saved in the Word Startup folder.&nbsp; In Windows Vista and Windows 7, 8 or 8.1, and 10, the default location for that folder is<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[User Name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP<br />
<br />
If you do not see the AppData folder: - <br />
<br />
In Windows 7, - In Windows Explorer, click on the Organize drop down and then on Folder and search options and in the Folder Options dialog, go to the View tab and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to
 uncheck the box for "Hide extensions&nbsp;for known file types".<br />
<br />
In Windows 8,&nbsp; 8.1 or 10, in the File Explorer, click on Options on the View tab of the ribbon and then on the View tab in the dialog that appears and select the item "Show hidden files, folders, and drives".&nbsp; While there, it is a good idea to uncheck the box

<span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook.
 If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.
<span>&nbsp;</span>For the Chart Merge utility, download the Mail Merging with Charts document that is also on that page of my OneDrive for additional requirements of the data source for use with that utility</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character (0-9).
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the data must start in the second row of the worksheet and there should be no empty rows within the range of data that is to be processed.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>NOTE: The MergeTools applications cannot handle Compound MergeFields such as the AddressBlock or GreetingLine.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks so much Jay, much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question if you can help - I would ideally like to have the name of each document be "Permit Number Applicant Name.doc" (ie. 100-15 John Smith). I would do the same thing, but the permit number is actually formatted with a forward slash (100/15),
 which isn't a usable character for Microsoft file names. How would I go about replacing the slash with a hyphen? I looked up whether I could mask it from the point of merging but that doesn't seem to be possible. And I don't want to replace ALL slashes in
 the document with a hyphen otherwise I'd just do a full find and replace for forward slashes.&nbsp; The Permit Number is paragraph 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>FWIW, the <em>Send Mailmerge Output to Individual Files </em>macro in the links I posted eliminates any potential illegal characters from the prospective filenames. As coed, the macro simply deletes them, but replacing them with hyphens instead is trivial
 - simply change:</p>
<p>StrName = Replace(StrName, Chr(j), "")</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>StrName = Replace(StrName, Chr(j), "-")</p>

 me flawlessly.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t receive messages on my msn account</h2>
                    <p>My email was working fine and then at 4 am or so stopped receiving messages. I have tried all the troubleshooting and still nothing. I can not receive messages on my iphone either. It seems like something is down with the server? Any suggestions?</p>

    <title>The BLUE Default Theme That Came With The N73 &#38;amp&#59; N80 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grayburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            The BLUE Default Theme That Came With The N73 &#38;amp&#59; N80</h2>
                    Morning everybody?<br />
<br />
I've had a few Nseries handsets such as the N70,N73 and the N80 and now i have the N95 i'm really missing the Nokia theme (Blue with the blue circles,square clock with white hands) as it's been replaced with the Turquoise theme which is nice but not a patch
 on the old Nokia theme.<br />
I have a copy of it but it's not the original which i'm really after.<br />
Is there anyone out there preferably from Nokia that knows where i could get it from?<br />
<br />
My thanks to you all in advance

            as this theme isn't standard in the N95 I don't think you can get a "real" one on this phone (due to copyright)... I think you'll have to use your "fake" one :p

Why would there be copyright issues when it's a Nokia theme on a Nokia phone?

it's bound to some phones... I tried to get a standard Nokia tune from the N70 on the N73, couldn't do this due the fact it's phone-bound (copyright was not the good word ;))

            I already got one... but the point is that i think it's the same with some themes... that some are phone-bound and that Nokia will not give them free for other phones where that theme is not on the phone

<br />
This formula validates the&nbsp;existence&nbsp;of values as well as their potential effect. For example, there must be a value is C2 as well as not being either
<i>Wed</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Sat</i>&nbsp;or the 4th or 7th day of the week. The same applies to B2 in that there must be a numeric time value as well as the time matching the criteria.<br />
<br />
<i>Edit:</i>&nbsp;added error control in case B2 was a date/time and not just a time value.<br />

<h2>            Data Validation &#38; Autocomplete from a different sheet</h2>
                    I've been searching for the better part of a couple of hours on how to achieve this.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a list with 1000+ items, which I'd like to be able to choose from on different sheets in my workbook. Given the volume, a typical dropbox would be too arduous, and developer tab is quite new to me for me to fiddle with VBA unassisted. I found an
 excellent step-by-step that had been cut short due to the original poster not being able to comprehend. I'm willing to fiddle and play with options to see what suits me best, but I need some basic framework that I hope the community can guide me in.</div>

<div>Now the problem that is occurring is once I click on a cell with Data Validation, it reads an error 9 about the subscript being out of range. Debug highlights "ValidationLists" line.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know how to proceed or troubleshoot from here since it seems to be reliant on coding I have no experience in.</div>

    <title>Using CapsLOCK as a style doesn&#39;t allow searching by case - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgemanley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using CapsLOCK as a style doesn&#39;t allow searching by case</h2>
                    <p>Folks and Microsoft tech wizzes, I've got an interesting conundrum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a format using a table whereupon one of the columns is preferred, by my clients, to be in all CAPS. Finally, I found the way to create a style that was applicable to the column in my tables in question. In other words, all of the text I typed in
 the column after applying the new style (without using Shift or the CapsLock keys) to it came up in all CAPS. Good job, I thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, here's the bugbear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for this feature to be useful to my clients (and myself, for that matter), we have to be able to use Replace or Find to hunt down the text in this column, and it tends to speed things up checking the box that reads "Match Case." However, all the
 entries in this column that I didn't specifically use Shift or CapsLock on are still recognized by the search applet as being in lower or mixed cases. So, other than applying the CapsLOCK for cosmetic purposes, it seems as if it doesn't provide a lot of utility
 otherwise. Obviously the answer to this question is that's the way Word is currently designed. However, since the goal of using this style applied to text is to give it a different formatting appearance, wouldn't it be more helpful to let "Match Case" find
 these bits of text as they appear, as opposed to the manner in which they were typed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inquiring minds, and people like me who have to come up with ways to use Word better to get more work done in less time, want to know.</p>

    <title>Outlook won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Outlook 2010 for years on my Windows 7 computer and love it. Just bought a new computer with Windows 10, but when I installed Outlook 2010, I could not get it to work. After several attempts, I was able to get my email from work once, but
 the next time it opened it would not connect. And then Outlook 2010 would not open at all, stuck on "Processing" for 30 minutes or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried the demo Outlook 2016 that came with my computer. But it was stuck on "Loading Profile" for more than 30 minutes, and now the same in safe mode. How can I use Outlook on my new computer?</p>

<p>You need to uninstall any Office trial version, then repair install 2010, and having done so hold the Ctrl key when starting OL - does it then open?</p>
<p>And if you see a loading Profile then you must have initially started OL and set up a mail account, otherwise you would not get any Profile msg.</p>
<p>Can you start Word 2010 itself?</p>

<p>Thank you for your help, but the problem has not been fixed. I uninstalled the trial Office 2016 program from my computer, restarted it, and then reinstalled the Outlook 2010 -- I had previously uninstalled Outlook 2010, so this was a completely new install.
 I then tried opening the program in safe mode, and now 20 minutes later it still is trying to open with "Loading Profile" message. I'm not sure what you mean by "repair install 2010." Was I supposed to somehow repair the .exe file before re-installing Outlook
 2010? I am grateful for any suggestions you may have.</p>
