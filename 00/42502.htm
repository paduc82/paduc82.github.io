    <title>I need to eject a mounted disk&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no skill  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to eject a mounted disk&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>(I'm really bad with computers, so please bare with me)<br />
<br />
I recently mounted some things with MagicDisk, but ever since I mounted them, my CD Drive thing has not worked, like I can't burn songs from iTunes, and no CDs that i put in will work. It's obviously because that stuff is mounted!</p>
<p>I even pressed "unmount all drives" but nothing worked, i tried to eject the "Removeable Disk F" which i think is my CD Drive, I'm not sure! but it told me that it was in use and that if i clicked continue, I might lose some information. I clicked continue
 but it still didn't work! The message came up agian.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do :( I ask my friend and he said that maybe my CD Drive thing is broken. PLEASE HELP! I beg of you. Is there anyway I can get it to work again??</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>
<p>P.S. I deleted MagicDisc and all of the things it was mounting, (i think i got most/all of it) but it didn't help....</p>

<p>Okay, I saw you post on the "Fix It" thread, and I was wondering if what you said could also help me. I have a disk mounted but I don't know how to eject it, so technically it is kind of like having 2 CD's in at the same time, (when i put a real CD in) so
 i was wondering if what you said in that other thread would work.</p>
<p>Thanks so much :)</p>

<p><span><span>Hello No Skill,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are several ways that you can try to work this out before concluding that the CD drive could have gone bad.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your first step towards troubleshooting this issue would be to unmount any virtual discs that you have mounted recently.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Do you see any CD/DVD drives showing up in the Windows Explorer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If 2 drives appear in the Windows Explorer, this means that the device is still mounted on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a tutorial I found at the Magic ISO website that will show a demo on how to unmount the virtual disc:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-unmount.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-unmount.htm</span></a></span></p>

<p>Heya, (hopefully you will come back here and see what i posted)</p>
<p>Thanks for replying! :P Although I did everything you said, well I had already unmounted it, and checked and I only have 1 drive that appears. When I click&nbsp; on it, it says that "this device is working properly" so i'm not sure ... I'm going to do the fixit
 thing right now and see if that works, and then i'll tell you. But as for now, it's still the same :(</p>

<p>:((( I ran the fixit and it said that the disk was not readable. I still think that it is because maybe that stuff is mounted, I'm not sure ... But i know for a fact that I unmounted the stuff (or at least told it to!) and there is only 1 drive running.
 No CDs are detected, because I think the mounted CD is blocking it.</p>
<p><br />
Open for suggestions though!! :) Please help</p>

</p><p>I have the same problem as many of you out there and I have read through the many &nbsp;suggestions from Microsoft to try and fix the problem, but it looks like nothing has worked for any of you, with the exception of one person who used "Wise Cleaner"(Free Download).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, come on Microsoft, do you really have a FIX for this error messsage or are you atleast trying to find one for all your customers? Please do let us know on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone out there has in the meantime found an answer to this problem, please let me know. Thank you.</p>

<p>I used other repair apps wisecare, and systemcare to check for issues, nothing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>if <strong>I right click the image </strong>and select the image to be opened with
<strong>photo gallery</strong> instead of the new photos app? it works. great.</p>
<p>When trying to open photos in the apps selection? the button is dead. it will not engage the app. not so great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So realizing I'm at an impasse where there seems to be no solution from Microsoft, and my needs to be met, So I just
<strong>changed the default settings to photo gallery</strong>, and ill just accept that free (nothing is really free is it?) windows 10 update is the reason for this issue, and the new apps are still buggy and unreliable. of course this does not fix the situation,
 whereas now I'm concerned that my windows 10 is not running properly, and i do NOT want to lose information thats irreplaceable, But its my only option. a Band aide over a gashing wound. Microsoft find the solution please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll admit, at first i was terrified that all my images were compromised by this new OS. now I'm hoping a fix is coming? because returning to windows 7 is starting to look like a better idea. Or next time ill just slide over to a Mac.</p>

 be able to restore with no problems.&nbsp; <span>
If you don't have a disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another
 computer if necessary). <span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>I posted this&nbsp;in another thread&nbsp;titled "1984",&nbsp;BEFORE the report came out about the NSA.&nbsp;Kinect or no Kinect, you're being watched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no privacy in today's world. The average city dweller is caught on video 75 times per day and the average suburban dweller is caught on video 12-20 times per day. Lots of people have smart-phones right? Well, your smart-phone is tracking
 everywhere you go, all of your interests, all of your friends, and all that data is going somewhere you may not want it to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got a car that was built in the last 10 years? Well guess what, your car is keeping data on how you drive, and many cars are being tracked via satellite as to where you drive. Got a digital cable box? Maybe a DVR? Well, everything you watch is being saved
 and analyzed in order to sell you things and anticipate what you like and dislike. I know this because I work for one of the largest multi-media companies in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Got a bank account, credit cards, store rewards cards, ect.? Everything you do with those cards is being monitored and analyzed. Remember 9/11 and the birth of "Homeland Security"? Be careful what you search and watch on the net, you could be put on the
 Homeland Security watch-list and not even know it. I could go on and on with the things that infringe upon your privacy. People still believe that they have privacy, well guess what, you don't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>George Orwell's vision of the future in "1984" is already here in many more ways than you can imagine. Unless you are living out in the middle of nowhere, growing your own veggies, killing animals for meat, sewing your own clothes, not using electricity
 or any technology, totally off the grid, then you are on the grid and you do not have privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not having a Kinect in your home gives you some sort of cozy feeling of privacy, then by all means do not buy one. If you truly want to have privacy, sell off all of your possessions, close every account you ever had, buy a bunch of survival gear (with
 cash!), and head on out into the wilderness. I mean way, way, way, out in the wilderness. Good luck with that, I'll still be here in the matrix.</p>

<p>We all know that they do these things people just need to draw a line microsoft has been in bed with them for years probably its a cash source. My two biggest worry is did the NSA have a hand in the development of the xbox one if so what and the data monitoring
 is another since E3 microsoft has been bragging about there new upgraded servers and cloud storage. Im concernd the cloud is the actual back door for the NSA and that they helped devolp the kinect sensor for data gathering. All in all its a matter of Gross
 criminal neglagence and misconduct on Microsft and the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;United States Government.

<p>Does anyone truly realise the kick *** connection required to up load all that video without bogging down the connection let alone 24/7. Nsa has just over 30,000 employes. Say 2 million people buy xbox1. That is 66.6 consoles per nsa employee to watch. Than
 there is the argument "well they will just take audio and convert it to text" well thanks to the good ol patriot act they can already do that through ps3 and xbox 360 via headset. Complete privacy has been a thing of the past along time ago. I can say without
 a doubt nsa is not going to be "watching you". But I am a sheep that follows the herd blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Motor, it doesn't have to record actual video meant for human eyes to manually watch. It could conceivably just keep tabs on your general behavior, like your habits at home, your daily routine, facial recognition of you and any other people it can see in
 your house, what kind of things you say etc. They can aggregate the data from your Facebook profile to predict within a very reasonable margin of error what your politics, sexual orientation, general level of intelligence and education, psychological traits
 and health, consumer habits, religious and moral values and basic daily habits are. Not to mention all of the people you communicate with and the circles you run in. Imagine how much more detailed it would be if they had a piece of monitoring and aggregation
 hardware watching you with sophisticated sensors in your home.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that's what they are going to do with the Xbox, but it is well within the realm of possibility. Sure, even if they did do it, you wouldn't have a personal guardian angel over in Fort Huachuca watching a direct video feed of everything you
 did 24/7. And, of course, if you didn't do anything really suspicious you would just be another binary snowflake in the white noise. Still, that is not how most people would like to be treated if they really thought about it, and the question is WHEN is something
 they already do within the safety of their rights and privacy going to mark them as a target?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I know one thing for sure. If I were actually important at all I would never go near one of these things. You want to know who I think they're really watching? Not us, because we're not doing anything interesting. They're watching people of political and
 commercial influence for purposes of power brokering. Big Brother? More like the Big Digital Mob Don.</p>

<p>Holy crap raging pwner it is a welcome delight to have an intellgent post about a debate, without actual name calling, flamming etc. You sir, are a welcome sight. Its amazingb when two people disagree, they can still be civil. With that being said. What
 about the people not connected online? The people that unplug the kinect when the systems. Off not counting the people that are going to live shark? (I dont remeber the exact program name) every thing going out from their respected connection, just looking
 for an excuse to completly blow this whole thing wide open. Im not saying its not possible, mothing on this day and age is impossible. I am saying it is very, very unlikley. Im more concerned about that people switching to ps4 thinking their privacy will remain
 intact. They may not have a "spy camera", but they have headsets all the same.</p>

<h2>            Registry file load fail</h2>
                    After the most recent windows 10 update the honeywell remote program we use will not open. When you double click the icon it pops up a box that says registry file load fail. Then when you close the program it says access violation at address 0063873C in
 module remote.exe read of address 0000045C. I've tried everything I know to fix it with no luck.

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am using Windows 8.1. I tried to play 2 games "<b>Need for Speed Most Wanted 2012</b>" &amp; "<b>Blur</b>".&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I'm getting an error <b>"The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application."&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>My system configuration is <b>i3 processor, 4 GB ram with 64 bit Configuration</b>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I installed in my friend's laptop, it worked perfectly. His system configuration is
<b>Pentium 4 processor, 2 GB Ram with 32 bit configuration</b>.</div>
<div>I thought it was because of 32 bit and 64 bit but in other friends laptop whose configuration is 64 bit, it worked perfectly.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I tried to re-install the game too. I even tried <b>System Refresh.</b></div>

    <title>Active Window Does Not Come to the Top from Taskbar or When Clicked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faithfulfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Active Window Does Not Come to the Top from Taskbar or When Clicked</h2>
                    <p>Since the last Windows 8.1 upgrade (on 2/11/15) I have had this problem.</p>
<p>When I click on an open window icon from the task bar, it seems the focus does switch to that window but the window does not come to the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on a portion of that window, while showing as active, it still does not come to the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can expose the window is to minimize anything on top of it.</p>
<p>Alt-Tab will show a list of windows, but even then when I click on the desired window it does not come to the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution would be appreciated. &nbsp;It is very time consuming to operate this way.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App Help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrzero5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App Help</h2>
                    I have been asked to set up surface tabs running windows 10, and using the mail app I have tried to add the exchange accounts that we use. The problem with this is that the exchange server is being hosted by an outsourcing company. Typically I would use
 a proxy to connect to exchange using HTTP. I do not have access to the server because it is hosted outside of my company, and I am receiving the error code 0x80072efd saying that it cannot connect to the server whenever I try to sync it. I am using the server
 name I typically do "mail.domain.com" whenever I connect accounts elsewhere. Does anyone have any knowledge of what I may be doing wrong, or how to connect to exchange with a proxy through http? Thanks for your time.

<h2>            Xbox Insider Hub Unenrolling</h2>
                    (All of this is on Windows 10) So I have 2 Xbox Accounts, hence I have 2 Xbox Insider Hub accounts. So I enrolled into the Minecraft Beta, now I would like to play with my friend who are not in the Beta. So I attempted to leave and it just kept saying
 Pending and I made sure I was on the account I enrolled in. Infact I was in the correct account. So I thought deleting my Insider account would fix the problem. So I did and uninstalled Minecraft to see I was still in the Beta, on both accounts. Now when I
 try and load on the deleted account it says " We're currently working to close your Xbox Insider account." So now I am stuck inside the beta. Also Microsoft please implement a feature of where you can install a game on a certain account not in the Beta and
 not be in the Beta, and a account in the Beta get the Beta of that game.

                    <p>I just updated from Windows 7 SP1 to Windows 10. &nbsp; I have tried all the fixes that I could find on this site and on the internet without purchasing software to supposedly do the fix for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what I do, the Windows Update will not work. &nbsp;Also, Microsoft Edge Browser will not work and I did an uninstall/reinstall on it &amp; now it's not even showing on the installed programs list.....it comes up but always says it can't find the page. I
 am so frustrated!!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, it will not let me make Google Chrome my default browser??</p>

<h2>            Keyboard not working in any application after switching from pen to keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 that all of a sudden didn't want to accept keyboard anymore in any application!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booted the machine</p>
<p>opened edge browser</p>
<p>detached the keyboard from the tablet.</p>
<p>tapped on the url field, the keyboard input appeared but was in pen mode</p>
<p>changed from pen mode to keyboard mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>=&gt; No way to use they onscreen keyboard, absolutely no application accepted input coming from the onscreen keyboard although i could hear the sound when i touched the onscreen keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i switched back to pen input, the url field would accept input, switching back to keyboard still didn't allow to enter anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What good is a tablet without a working keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating, i had to reboot the machine to fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd expect that on a surface, things like this wouldn't happen and that the keyboard will always work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody else experienced this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            <p>The problem is not receiving emails on the virgin media account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise I did not explain fully, my problem is that It thinks that my virgin media account is an exchange account, but I cannot change this because it is locked to my microsoft account since I am logged on to this instead of a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched this and found other's having the same problem. My sister does not have this problem since she is logged into a local account on her own computer and could add it without Microsoft restriction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a way to stop it from thinking it is an exchange account and think it is a POP account, but I cannot edit or delete this account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help.</p>

    <title>How to set system TEMP and TMP to a different drive in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenscamper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set system TEMP and TMP to a different drive in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I noticed my user account is using my settings from Win 8.1 but the SYSTEM account is still using my C: drive. I'd like to change that, I don't reboot often and the SSD C: drive isn't very large. I'm rapidly running out of room because of the temp directory
 being there. I can go in and manually delete the files or run CCleaner but I'd rather just set it to one of the HD partitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

            <p>I cannot mark this helpful because it was not. From my posting you would have seen I want to move the SYSTEM temp folder, not the USER folder which is already moved. You would have also seen I can delete the files manually, or run CCleaner, so Disk Cleanup
 wouldn't make any difference since I can do all of that manually in a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span><span>To change the location of the System Temp folder, follow the steps given below.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<span>Right click on Computer and click on Properties. In the resulting window with the basic
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You may see both TMP and TEMP listed in the section labeled User variables for (account). That's the common location; each different login account is assigned its own temporary location.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the Variable value Edit box you may specify the path to the directory that Windows and many other programs will use for temporary files.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Be sure and repeat that process for both TMP and TEMP.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You'll need to restart any running programs for the new value to take effect. In fact, you'll need to restart Windows for it to begin using the new value for its
 own temporary files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To change the location of the Internet Temp folder, follow the steps given below.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> That Internet Explorer moves cookies to the new folder and the old folder is removed. Additionally, the
 following message is displayed when you attempt to move the Temporary Internet Files folder:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Moving the location of your Temporary Internet Files folder will delete all your subscription data.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Create a new folder to store the files. For example, if you want to store the files in a folder named Ietemp on drive D, create the following folder:
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>D:\Ietemp
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For information about how to create a folder, click Start, click Help, click the Index tab, type
<strong>new folder</strong>, and then double-click the "New Folders" topic. </span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Start Internet Explorer. </span></span></li><li><span><span>On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>On the General tab, click Settings.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click Move Folder. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Click the folder you created in Step 1.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click OK, click OK, and then click OK again.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Restart your computer </span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can change the location of Internet explorer temp folder; there is no security threat to your computer.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it is a new computer contact the seller and ASUStek Support. As OEM ASUS is responsible</p>
<p>for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is<br />
theirs to fix. Keep in mind the more you do the more they will claim it is something you have<br />
done. Added that even if you are somehow able to resolve the issues they still need to be<br />
documented just in case there are further problems down the road.<br />

If you really want to troubleshoot the issues (which I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND on<br />
a brand new computer) :<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />
and Start Screen.<br />

<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>

<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You said you are not very good with computers and it is a new computer with full warranty.<br />
Please contact the Seller and ASUStek Support NOW!.<br />
<br />
=============<br />
<br />
As indicated above :<br />
<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You were running McAfee for the first BSOD and TrendMicro for the second. There is no clear<br />
indication either was involved in those events however I would uninstall Trend and use Windows<br />
Defender which is a full antivirus in Windows 8. After the issues are resolved you can use one or<br />
the other of those if you really want to do that.<br />
<br />
Note that if you do a Refresh that will remove ALL installed programs. If you do a Reset that removes<br />
everything and it is back as it was when you got it.<br />
<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
The Bug_Checks were&nbsp;0A CAUSE&nbsp;USBXHCI.SYS&nbsp;and 3B CAUSE win32k.sys both are Windows
<br />
components which means something else drove them into Fault.<br />
<br />
BugCheck A, {208, 2, 0, fffff800aa5632b4}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : USBXHCI.SYS ( USBXHCI!TransferRing_PutScatterGatherList+40 )<br />
<br />
BugCheck 3B, {c0000005, fffff960004808fe, fffff88009387f00, 0}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : win32k.sys ( win32k!OffsetChildren+2a37b6 )<br />
<br />
New computer think hardware - do a Refresh and if needed a Reset. <br />
<br />
If those do not help then contact the Seller and ASUStek Support (which you should do anyway<br />
on a new computer). You don't know what caused it - the BSOD just started to happen.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you don't do a Refresh or Reset (which you should)<br />
<br />
Either could be due to hardware especially memory.<br />
<br />
Check the memory very thoroughly :<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />

<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />

<h2>            Win7 x64 explorer.exe startup failure</h2>
                    <p>I had to do a double recovery last week because I made the mistake of not going far back enough to uninstalling a program that was the wrong version type. Specifically I was uninstalling Kies 3 for the earlier version. Anyways, the recovery screwed up my
 antivirus (Mcafee All Access) to the point where I had to uninstall it and reinstall it. Somewhere along the line I started getting errors every time I started up my computer telling me that explorer.exe has stopped. I followed the advice on the forums about
 a clean startup - msconfig/selective/no startup programs/disable every service besides Microsoft's. This didn't help. I've gotten different errors every time I start up my computer. The last 2 were:</p>

<h2>            My laptop won&#39;t connect to my school wireless internet, but works fine at home. May need updates, but I can&#39;t get them.</h2>
                    Hi, I'm using a Compaq Presario F750US, I know its older, but it runs Windows 8 Pro WMC very easily. I've gotten help from Microsoft Support Live Help with no luck. One of the reps gave me a program from Compaq's download center called Driver Tuner, which
 found me 20 updates. The problem is it requires a product key to download the updates. I can get on the internet with a Tenda wireless USB adapter, but my internal adapter won't connect. My internal adapter is running a driver from 3/13/2012. Please help,
 thanks in advance!

            I've ran the troubleshooter with no success. I can't contact the network administrator because he/she is with the district, not the school, and I have made no prior changes that I know of.
