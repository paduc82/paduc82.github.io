    <title>Lost Video Tags&#47;MetaData updates from Windows Photo Gallery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost Video Tags&#47;MetaData updates from Windows Photo Gallery &#40;Names, Rattings, Text Tags&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I have a couple thousand home video clips I had organized by adding Ratings, People Tags, Text Tags etc using Windows Live Photo Gallery....</div>
<div>The prime reason for me choosing Photo Gallery vs Google Picasa and other software was that the meta data was supposed to be stored in the individual files. &nbsp;And this seemed to always work in my early testing... at least with photos.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently tried connecting my Xbox 360 to the PC using Media Center over wi-fi and it kept locking up...</div>
<div>I presumed it was because I had shared that folder of all the video clips and it was to much to refresh over wifi.</div>
<div>So I removed that folder set from the Library and I think it must have also removed it from Photo gallery.</div>
<div><br />
When I re-linked that folder system to Photo Gallery, I noticed all the ratings were gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone explain what meta data is attached to the files what is stored outside each individual file?</div>
<div>I was able to duplicate this problem very easily by assigning ratings and tags to the same videos and then take that library out of the Gallery Rollup and then bring the folder back in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does it do that for all files or just some?</div>
<div>Is it limited to the MTS or certain other types of videos?</div>
<div>Does removing a folder from the Gallery View wipe everything or just some things?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>The files I noticed the problem on were all MTS file extensions from my HD Cam Corder.</div>
<div>I hesitate to do much testing on other things where I might loose more info.</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 Professional 64-bit and have had the same OS and Photo Gallery installation for a few years.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>Any help is appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in response. I understand that you are having issues with the information you set on some of your files in Photo Gallery. Upon simulation on our end, the metadata of MTS files cannot be changed using Photo Gallery. The information
 you set was only stored in Photo Gallery so making some changes to the file or folder may remove the information. As for your other question, popular files such as .jpg files should still save the metadata on the file itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<p><br />
Thanks for your reply Richard,</p>
<p>I was wondering if you or anyone else knows of a possible alternative that would store the metadata in MTS files that Photo Gallery would still be able to read.&nbsp; Personally, I evaluated a lot of photo editing and management tools (particularly tagging, rating
 and facial recognition) and found Photo Gallery seemed like the best overall solution so I don't want to change that.</p>

Please feel free to reach out Western Digitals technical team. The issue is completely not supported in this Microsoft forum. Just as BulldogXX said above, they might have to release a compatible program version for your current Windows build.

Should there be more, keep us posted. </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup failure to Iomega drive</h2>
                    I'm trying to back-up my laptop onto an external&nbsp;1 TB Iomega Prestige Desktop Hard Drive (USB 3.0).&nbsp; I'm using the Windows 7 backup system, applying the standard recommended settings which allow Windows to determine what files to backup, but I keep getting
 the same error message - Error code 0x8078002A.&nbsp; Seems like it gets quite a long way through the process (181GB registered on the external drive) and then stalls.&nbsp; Space definitely isn't an issue (total backup size is less than 200GB).&nbsp; My laptop is a Dell
 XPS. Any ideas?

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion...I have indeed just&nbsp;followed&nbsp;your suggested approach and&nbsp;given up trying to get Windows 7 backup to work with the drive....Iomega ended up providing software that seems to have worked OK, but I do find it slightly baffling that
 two such major companies as Iomega and Microsoft don't seem to be able to get something as fundamental as backups working in a way that doesn't mean you have to install extra software.&nbsp; Anyway, got there in the end, so thanks once again to all who gave me
 much appreciated pointers.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>

    <title>Will Windows Movie Maker support .mod files for editing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will Windows Movie Maker support .mod files for editing&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p><b>From:</b> cilge</p>
<p><b>Message:</b> Hi I have a new PC with Windows Vista Home Premium. I also have a new JVC everio&nbsp; GZ MG 330 camcorder. This came with its own software for downloading from the camera, editing, and supposedly
 creating DVDs. I have downloaded and edited my clips into a movie but it refuses to burn onto DVD. I am chasing this up with the software people.</p>
<p>However my question is, when I tried to use Movie Maker instead, ie to import the clips and edit them, the programme crashed out after starting the process. I understand that JVC have used a file extension
 .mod (a version of Mpeg2 ?) which Movie Maker doesn't apparently support. It imports them OK, but then doesn't want to play.</p>
<p>Is Microsoft planning to include an update to allow this "new" type of&nbsp; file to be used by Movie Maker? Or is there some method of converting the files to a more normal type. I can't get JVC's software to
 save them as either avi or mpeg.</p>
<p>This type of camera seems to be popular at the moment so I may not be alone here, any help gratefully received thanks</p>

            <p>I also have this same "device" and we are screwed because the hard drive says 32GB Internal Storage, HOWEVER 12GB is reserved for some Windows restore system and the remaining 20GB is further diminished by pre-loaded trial software and and anything you have
 saved or installed on it.......leaving around a WHOPPING 6GB available for use.</p>
<p>And the Windows 10 upgrade requires what? 30GB of space!!!! This is why you get an error, you have no hard drive space available for installation.</p>
<p>I'm super angry about this, especially with the promises from Acer that this is Windows 10 READY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supposedly you can add some thumb-drive or SD card and put Windows 10 on it, or so I've read. If anyone wants to reply with instructions on doing that, I guess it will be my only option to get 10 on this thing.</p>
<p>Did I mention how pissed I am?</p>
<p>Anyone want to class-action a lawsuit against Acer for its false promises?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some helpful reviews of this laptop from Walmart's website, where I got mine. Wish the reviews were there BEFORE I bought this!!</p>

To upgrade, download the ISO (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) onto another computer and copy from there to a USB or other portable device. Reset the laptop to its factory original making sure to disconnect all WiFi routers it can
 possibly update through. After reset, immediately right click the ISO file on the portable device, select Mount. Then double click the setup file. Once the latest build is installing, you can plug the routers back in.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
There is no other way to do it short of nagging Acer for a bootable USB with current build (3-8 days FedEx). No guarantee that will work. I haven’t seen their media yet to see if it works. Expect to have less than 10GB left on the drive, even after uninstalling
 all their unnecessary extras.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue and I tried everything including turning off my anti-virus, disabling all my drivers, turning&nbsp;off my network adapters&nbsp;but nothing worked.&nbsp; So here is what I highly recommend on doing. I might have tried the upgrade 20 times</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to windows explorer and select c:\.</p>
<p>2) Select folder options and click show hidden files, folders etc</p>
<p>3) Open C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther\setuperr.log</p>
<p>4) If it gives you access denied when you try to open it, simply copy it to your desktop and open it</p>
<p>5) Go to the end of the file and it will give you the error which is causing your update to fail.</p>
<p>6) If a file is causing it, you might want to rename it if you determine its not needed. for me it was windows.live.calendar.ctl that caused it to abort. Please note that the second_boot error is NOT causing it to abort. You will have to read few lines above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Woohoo! &nbsp;Fantastic, thank you, thank you, thank you. &nbsp;I didn't quite make it to 20 attempts, but after 3 or 4 failed attempts to upgrade to Windows 10 and trying any number of other suggestions, only your suggestion worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the issue was associated with files associated with AppData for Microsoft.Bing. &nbsp;Deleted the files (heck, I just deleted the directory) and the very next attempt to upgrade was a success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that Windows is unable to configure the imaging device for your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check for Windows update&nbsp;to look for&nbsp;latest drivers for imaging device installed in your computer, which might incorporate new features at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below Microsoft Help Article on <span><span><strong>Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong>, written by one of our MVPs,
<strong>Andre da Costa.</strong></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If Microsoft Lifecam driver for Windows&nbsp;10 are not available, you may download drivers for Windows 7 or 8 and install it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. <strong><span>Download </span></strong>the latest Microsoft Lifecam driver for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
b. <strong><span>Right click </span></strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>”.<br />
c. Select “<strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong>” Tab.<br />
d. Place a <strong><span>check mark </span></strong>next to “<strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode</span></strong>” and
<strong><span>select Windows 7</span></strong> from the drop down list.<br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></p>

            Do you mean Ambassador Community or the Xbox Community altogether. If it's Ambassador Community, then you should be posting this in the Ambassador section. Which is under the private categories at the top of the page.

<p>As StuartATrueRed states, it depends on which community you are referring to. It would have been made clearer if you had shared some of your own thoughts and it is always a good way to kick of a deeper discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, I will take it that you refer to the Xbox gaming community as a whole. The community is a fantastical place, filled with diverse people who under normal circumstances would propbably never form friendships. From all over the world we gain friends,
 with one common interest "gaming" together we play as teams, laugh together, discuss life issues and form lasting bonds. My friends are from all sorts of differnt social backgrounds, ages, gender (if you want to associate as a rainbow glitter unicorn thats
 fine by me) we all respect each other. There is plenty of general banter between us and teasing when we make mistakes in a game, all of which is totally fine and never gets out of hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The community is a relatively safe place, self policed by fellow gamers. There are the trolls, dysfunctionals and generally toxic gamers out there. That is the same in real life too. Xbox has given us the tools to deal with them, through privacy and online
 safety settings. Also the mute, block and report features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Ambassadors it is up to us to help create a safe gaming experience and help guide others towards creating a greater gaming community. Personally I feel that the community is a good overall environment and the majority bump along in harmony.</p>

            hi, i think the xbox community is great. it's easy to get help. in the clubs you get to know nice people quickly and easily. of course there are always people here and there who want to annoy you but the number is fortunately very small. so far i've only
 had positive experiences.&nbsp;

            I think it's moving in the right direction. Since joining the ambassadors program, I've also noticed alot of people who are genuine and here purely for help, guidance, gaming and all out fun, which is what it's all meant to be about. Here in Australia,
 i haven't really had many run ins with hostility or trolling, abuse etc. It's pretty much been about good clean fun. I've played games online and both won and lost, sometimes big win, sometime dismall losses...lol, but there's always been a pleasantry exchanged
 in messages or on voice with "good game" "great playing with you" "nice shot" etc. Yes i have had the odd message that was a bit unnecessary, especially when it's your first time playing that game....lol. We were and are all newbies at one stage or another....People
 need to learn and respect that. But overall, My experience has been great with the coomunity, both Xbox and Ambassadors. I'm still yet to run into an ambassador in online games, but i'm getting to know a few names and have chat

<p>I think like any community it has facets. What you get in is what you get out of it, if you are friendly and helpful you will draw those like minded people to you. If you are toxic and nasty you will tend to see the same around you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think with the Ambassador's program we have a common tie, if you get involved you get to know each other, sometimes game together, get to know each other.</p>

<h2>            How I can I restore MS-DOS backup &#40;.bak&#41; to Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old MS-Dos set of 3.5" disk created with BACKUP command of MS-DOS. In MS-DOS the RESTORE command would have been used<br />
to restore this backup set but this command is not supported under Vista's CMD mode.<br />
<br />
Any help/ideas would be MUCH APPRECIATED!<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Experiencing stuttering when attempting to download files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> technificent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Experiencing stuttering when attempting to download files or watch videos on the internet after 2&#43; hours of uptime</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem where Windows 10 will lag when I download anything after 2 hours or more of up-time.<br />
<br />
My maximum download speed is 20MB/s (megabytes not bits)<br />
And my system can move data internally up to 300MB/s without lag.<br />
<br />
before the 2 hours are up, I can download anything without any lag at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that 2 hours are up, i get crippling system lag when I download litteraly ANYTHING. (mouse, video, and audio will all lag at the same time when downloading, the system experiences Stuttering)<br />
<br />
Edit: some people I've shown this too seem to think that i was trying to download for 2 hours at a time. this is not the case. the 2-hours up time meant the time my computer had to be booted up before the issue would present itself.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution to this?<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:<br />
-change timer setting to "False" via bcdedit<br />
-change steam bootstrapper to automatic<br />
-ensured my network drivers were up to date<br />
-updated to .NET Framework 4.7<br />
-cleared cache in multiple applications<br />
-set a manual page file size<br />
-disabled several unnecessary services via service manager</p>
<p>-used Windows Memory Diagnostic to detect for memory faults (No errors were detected)<br />
-Updated from Window 10 1607 to windows 10 1703 with a clean reinstall and redid all the previous performance tweaks.</p>

            1. No I have not, I have done a clean reinstall of the operating system to try and resolve the issue and the issue persisted.<br />
2. Yes all my drivers are up to date.<br />
3. I have conformed all my hardware is not the cause of the issue.<br />
4. Safe mode with networking produces the issue as well.<br />
<br />
I have narrowed it down to a potential problem with windows 10 managing memory. But I have tried multiple things to resolve it and none have been successful.

            No, ISP's cannot affect a computer in this way, its simply impossible. My computer is stuttering while donwloading after it has been powered on for 2 hours or more. Before these several hours are up I can download anything without any system-side stuttering
 at all. Rebooting the computer temporarily resolves the issue for another 2 hours or more.<br />
<br />
This is a resource management issue in windows. And what I'm looking for is some sort of registry fix that can resolve this.

<p>
</p><p>I didn't install the software (laptop is from work), but it is 5.8.1 version. That could be a problem. But a collegue also has the same laptop, windows 10, same filemenu tools version and he doesn't have the problem. But it is definitly better to use the
 latest version. I'm gonna try that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my previous latop (windows 7) I could use filemenutools and files explorer without a problem. With this laptop I got it with filemenu tools already on it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>At first thank you for your attention. My answers are listed below in order:</p>
<p>1.OLAD8</p>
<p>2.No, It's Longman contemporary Dictionary.</p>
<p>3.Yes,I was. at that time my OS was windows 8 and my anti-virus was bitdefender total security 2013.</p>
<p>4.No. I just open app but unfortunately they don't run.</p>
<p>As I said before updating to new versions both windows and anti-virus,I had this problem and with disabling firewall for one time they run but now this way don't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<h2>            Ethernet Connection not the correct name&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have an ethernet connection on my computer that is suppose to show my router name as if i was using wifi. (For example, If my wifi name was "Joe's Network" and if I connected via ethernet it would show that name) But instead it shows "Network" as the name!
 It's giving me serious troubles for Nvidia Shield tablets to recognise my computer is on the same wifi. Can someone help me know what's happening and if there is a fix?</p>
<p>This Photo is showing the issue. It is showing the name is "Network" instead of the real connection name.</p>

<p>Hi Jovani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Changing the network name is easy and it would really save a lot of your time as you follow these steps carefully:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Control Panel</strong> and change the <strong>View by</strong> category to
<strong>Large</strong> icons.</li><li>Open <strong>Network and sharing center</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change adapter settings</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the <strong>Network card</strong> that you want to be renamed and select
<strong>Rename</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Rename</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We hope that the above steps answers your question.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. Not with Ceaser, but Marcus. The company is same so I think it's not the computer's fault. I will try to contact the Shark Gaming and find a solution.&nbsp;</p>
