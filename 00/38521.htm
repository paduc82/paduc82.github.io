 screen although i know its there because i can click things on the game screen yet i cant see it. &nbsp;So i was looking around the game forums and found out that in order to solve this problem i should change my mouse pointer to the default one from windows. &nbsp;I
 have triyed for 2 days now without any luck. &nbsp;I have triyed this 2 guides posted here on this forum:</span>

<div>
None of them works. &nbsp;When i change my mouse pointer to the default one it doesnt change at all, the weird thing, is that when i restart the pc, in thoses few secs that it takes to the pc to actually restarts the mouse pointer changes to the default one, once
 it restarts it keeps showing as the default one for 2-5 secs but then it changes back again to the red mouse pointer i have right now...</div>
<div>
<br />

<div>
So please if anyone could help me to change my mouse pointer to the default one i would really glad.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;José,
<div>Your mouse cursor is stored in your user profile, so while rebooting it's normal for it to show the default cursor when it has logged out of your profile and is in the default system account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All the technical details aside, this usually means the mouse properties in Control Panel is having trouble saving to the registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This can be caused by several things, and the recommend solution is to create a new user account on your computer. &nbsp;However if you are feeling brave, here's how to dig into the registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>!</b>&nbsp;Important - Before you go further, type 'restore' into your Start menu's search box and choose "Create a restore point", so you have a backup if any registry changes cause problems. &nbsp;I don't anticipate a problem, and these are simple steps, but
 a backup is very important to have. &nbsp;Microsoft will also point out that you should back up your entire system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Okay, do this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows-R to open the Run box, type <b>regedit</b>, and press OK. &nbsp;Registry Editor will open (you may be asked for an administrator confirmation).<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the folder list to the left (they're actually called <i>keys </i>in the registry), open up this path:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Cursors<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>In the right, you'll see the cursor file names being used for various cursors. &nbsp;Edit the Arrow cursor file name to modify the default cursor style.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Reboot to take effect.</li></ol>

<h3> danwithadell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB 64bit will not install</h2>
                    <p>I have two identical Windows 8.1 computers less than a year old.&nbsp; They are NOT Dell computers.</p>
<p>Both are 64 bit.</p>
<p>Since I have limited bandwidth, I chose to download onto a USB drive so I could update both with the one download.</p>
<p>So, first I downloaded the "MediaCreationToolx64.exe".&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I ran it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took about 12 HOURS to download !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It indicated I had completed the Windows 10 setup files successfully and I clicked on the "finish" button.&nbsp; I then removed the USB drive (properly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inserted it into the other computer and ran the "setup.exe" file.&nbsp; As usual I told it yes, I really want to run the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then an error message popped up and said I was trying to install the WRONG 32 bit version and to use the other disk for the 64 bit version.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, DUH, I am NOT using a disk, I am using a USB drive.&nbsp; Since I used the "MediaCreationToolx64.exe", why does
 it think I am trying to upgrade to the 32 bit version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, NOT a happy start with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint:&nbsp; I am NOT going to try to download using the MediaCreationToolx64.exe again.&nbsp; I don't have another TWELVE hours of my life to waste.</p>

<p>The problem is that the Windows designers are (I think) trying to be too clever -- if your computer does not have an HDMI cable plugged in to it, and you don't have an HDMI device at the other end of the cable (like a TV or surround sound amplifier / speaker
 system), then, Windows will just ignore that the Windows software driver for the HDMI is loaded.<br />
<br />
And even when you DO have an HDMI device plugged in and turned on, sometimes, Windows doesn't see that it's there. So, it won't bother letting you set that device's parameters.<br />
<br />
Now... to start looking. Go down on the system tray (that bar across the bottom edge of the screen), and find the Sound icon -- looks like a little speaker. Click on it, and click on Playback Devices. On my computer, I get a SOUND window, and it only shows
 the one device (Speakers / Headphones).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't have an HDMI device plugged in right now. But I do have the device drivers loaded.<br />
<br />
Just recently I tried to plug this same laptop in to my HDMI TV, and... of course, Windows won't see that the HDMI devices are there and plugged in. Again.<br />
WHY? I don't know. But what I had to go through two years ago (same laptop) was about four cycles of uninstall the HDMI device driver, reinstall it, turn things off, unplug them, turn them on, plug them in,.... and suddenly it started working.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft is still watching this forum, and has any answers other than "Windows 8", I'd love to hear them too!<br />

            Hello LoquercioMLJ,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; It seems that you might have to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows 2000 as this is an older game.&nbsp; Directions on how to run in compatibility mode are list below.&nbsp; Also I would suggest checking the games&nbsp;support website for
 patches and/or updates.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make older programs run in this version of <span>
Windows</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most programs written for <span>Windows</span>&nbsp;XP also work in this version of
<span>Windows</span>, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of
<span>Windows</span> doesn't run correctly, use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>If changing the settings does not fix the problem, go to the program manufacturer's website to see if there is an update for the program.</p>
Warning
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not use the Program Compatibility Wizard on older antivirus programs, disk utilities, or other system programs because it might cause data loss or create a security risk.</p>
</li></ul>
Run the Program Compatibility Wizard
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click to open the Program Compatibility Wizard.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the wizard, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The wizard is not designed to work on programs
 that have an .msi file name extension.</p>
<p>To change compatibility settings manually for a program, right-click the icon for the program, click
<span>Properties</span>, and then click the <span>Compatibility</span> tab.</p>
Please let me know if this helps you.&nbsp;

 account but still I am having the same problem. I can't play games online or use Sky player or anything because i keep being signed out of my account and xbox live because i am apparently being signed in from somewhere else. it all started after playing a
 few games of halo matchmaking earlier today and has been happening every 5-15 minutes. It is impossible to do anything and I don't know what else I can do :(&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HP Deskjet 895cxi</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a HP Pavillion P6 and my printer (HP Deskjet 895cxi) worked initially on this computer but has now stopped working.&nbsp; The printer works as it should when connected to my laptop.&nbsp; On connection via USB to the new Pavillion computer
 it detects the printer and begins to 'install driver software' but then it 'Fails'.&nbsp; If I try to 'add a printer' it tells me the spooler service is not running but when I try to 'start' the spooler service in 'Adminitrative Tools' ... I get an 'Error 1053'
 message.<br />
I use Windows 7 64 bit.<br />

            &nbsp; It sounds like you could have a virus, corrupted system files,&nbsp;or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need
 to scan in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

&nbsp;Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at <br />

&nbsp;If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.&nbsp; Click the box that says Show more restore points.
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do that click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `<br />
&nbsp;When you get your system back in good working order, I urge you to back your system up to an external hard drive and make regular periodic updates to it.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

                    <p>Honestly since they updated the operating system or whatever I really haven't been enjoying my time on the dash. Here are some of my complaints:</p><p><br /></p><p>-it's slow</p><p>-it may be pushing ppl to buy an Xbox one X</p><p>-I'm never looking at things I wanna be looking at</p><p>-it may be really add driven</p><p>-not pretty</p><p>-not fluent</p><p>-etc</p><p><br /></p><p>Please talk about your feelings towards it because I already miss the prior setup. I'm really hoping for a change to something smooth and simple in the near future.</p>

            <p>I do enjoy the argument of "it doesn't affect me so it shouldn't bother you either," that many people employ.<br /><br />Why would people spend time on the dashboard?&nbsp;Browsing for apps or games that are no longer on their most frequent list. Installing apps or games from their My Games &amp; Apps section. Perhaps they want to browse the latest offerings on the Mixer, Community, Entertainment, or Store panels.<br /><br />It really isn't unreasonable for people to want options that Microsoft add&nbsp;to the console to run well. Personally speaking apart from the occasional bit of stutter I don't find the current incarnation of the dashboard to run that terribly, I tend to put issues I am having down to being in the Preview Program.<br /><br />Not fluent. My only issue is that you just can't move the analogue stick to the side and have the mini-dash popup any more. I find that really annoying for some reason.<br /><br />Advertisement driven is a weird choice for you to make. Microsoft really

<h2>            Hard-Scoping. Really&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I happened to be in a lobby the other day and I actually had three guys moan at me for aiming down the sights with my Ballista. I was told that I'm awful at the game and have no skill due to the fact that I can't 'Quick-Scope'. So basically, I'm being moaned
 at for doing what the game INTENDED for me to do with that weapon. It's not the first time it's happened either and I just find it so hysterical that people deem you as a bad player for not doing something they like to do. Oh how Call of Duty does make me
 laugh, does anyone really think that being able to 'Quick-Scope' makes you a much better player than anybody else?</p>

<p>haha No, quick-scoping does take some sort of skill though. But it's a sniper rifle and in Call of Duty you can use it in multiple ways. Just don't let those people get you down. They're either complaining that you killed them or they're just not having
 a very good game. Sniping is perfectly good!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm curious how "skilled" these qsers would think their enemy was if they started getting ohk'd constantly by smr or fal users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Would anyone really feel that the smr or fal were difficult weapons to use if they did 90 damage with 2x multipliers to the head and 1.5x multipliers to the neck, torso and upper arms?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I ask this because I learned how to qs in black ops, oddly enough, being the only cod that actually made qsing difficult. I played a lot of hc mode using the m16/acog.. In hc mode the m16 was likely a ohk at any range and I found that instead of aiming
 I could just lt/rt in the general direction. If I aimed I'd sometimes miss, and sometimes get a hitmarker with one burst. But qsing with it was almost always a ohk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I've been ranking up my fal lately playing dom. The other night I kept running into people using smoke to cap. So .... I started defending b flag by sitting somewhere facing that general diirection. &nbsp;When the announcer said enemy was taking b I'd make
 a sweep across the flag and when I felt a nudge I'd lt/rt and get a hitmarker. .... the following shots woyuld miss however. So I'd lt/rt for a couple shots, then drop and lt/rt again. Its quite effective and an easy way for someone to come to understand just
 how much difference the lt/rt makes as opposed to aiming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone wants to learn to qs, I'd suggest using a semi auto or burst weapon in hc mode. The damage and fire rate&nbsp; will allow them to have a competetive weapon, while training themself on the timing and general concept of qsing. After a while they can
 switch to a sniper ri9fle in core mode and be fairly good at it without a major drop in k/d while learning.</p>

            Actually, Sudarshan is incorrect in my opinion.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>There isn't really an "Xbox Live Account," as your Xbox account is your Microsoft account which ties in access to all of Microsoft's services. As an example, if you have a Hotmail email address it works across Windows Live, Bing, Windows Phone, Xbox, etc.
 You do have an Xbox subscription, but the account is for all Microsoft services.
<div><br />
<div>You do NOT need an Xbox to have a GamerTag. Every single Windows Phone user is assigned an Xbox Live GamerTag if they did not have an Xbox account when they logged in to their Windows Phone for the first time (using a Windows Live ID or a personalized
 email address). This has been the case since the first Windows Phone 7 was released over two years ago.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As an example, my mother who has a Windows Phone but has never owned an Xbox console or subscribed to Xbox Live has a GamerTag as PLAYER1234567 (player-random number). If you signed in to Windows 8 using your Microsoft account, and you've never had Xbox
 before when you open the "Games" app on Windows 8 for the first time it will probably generate this random profile for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then, using the links provided by Sudarshan you can edit/modify your <a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live profile</a> and GamerTag, all without ever owning an Xbox.</div>

<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How do I unsinstall Windows Update service&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epic_geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unsinstall Windows Update service&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 7 Ultimate continues to automatically enable automatic updates, <br />
I disable automatic updates but it continues to re-enable it's self over and over.
<br />
when I start my computer I am greeted with "Configuring Windows Updates 0% complete, do not turn off your computer"
<br />
this sits at 0% for about 10 minutes, I don't want to stare at this screen, I want to use my blasted PC.
<br />
<br />
So I check the settings for Windows Update, sure enough it has enabled "Install updates automatically"
<br />
so I tell it "Never check for updates" a few weeks later it says "Configuring Windows Updates 0% complete, do not turn off your computer"<br />
and over, and over, and over again. <br />
I purchased Windows 7 Ultimate, it was about 300USD<br />
I do not want to sit here and stare at a blue screen of updates, please tell me how to uninstall the windows update service/application completely. I do not need it, I never wanted it. I just want my PC to boot to a desktop that is usable when I need to.
<br />

            Thank you for the reply, but I had no updates in queue, as soon as I installed Windows I turned off the automatic updates. It continued to turn it's self back on.<br />
<br />
I no longer experience the permissions error, I have since re-installed Windows, but also installed a script which allows me to right click and "Take Ownership" after this, I have had no permission related errors.
<br />
<br />
maybe my computer is posessed<br />

<p>•Click the Start button , right-click Computer, and then click Properties.</p>
<p><br />
•If "64-bit Operating System" is listed next to System type, you’re running the 64-bit version of Windows 7. 64=64</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows?</b> </p>
<p>The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows are designed for use in computers with 32-bit or 64-bit processors, respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a great explanation for these architectures (processor types) on wikipedia:</p>

<p>Hey Piano Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! If your controller does not turn on, even after connecting it to the console via USB cable, it might require servicing. We suggest you refer over to our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support</a> site. There you will be asked to register your console and the system will let you know if it is eligible for a repair/replacement.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> roypcampbell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not get console to update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,<br />
I have just bought a second hand Xbox360 Pro which has not been updated since 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment it has the 12625 dashboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only have one console connected.<br />
I have a Virgin Superhub - UK cable provider - made by netgear and have port forwarded the relevant ports as per the guides on Xbox.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a router and modem and I am using a wired connection.<br />
The update error codes I get are a combination of:-<br />
"Can't process the update " 3143-417f-1680-2203-c000-0001<br />
3143-0000-0000-0100-8007-0651<br />
3151-3f45-1600-0915-c000-0185<br />
I have tried updating from USB and CD but all of the updates stick at the last section of the green bar and then the console switches off.<br />
I have tried using sequential updates from the wikipedia list of software updates but none have worked.<br />
I have tried factory resets etc etc.<br />
When I try to enter xbox live I am told it is unavailable at present and get the code:-<br />
8b05008-2a163c39-88e4fcf1<br />
I have checked the console number to see if it is a banned box but as far as I can tell it is not listed - using Xval V2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is not definitive.<br />
UPnP is enabled.<br />
Any advice or suggestions would be gratefully received as I have exhausted every measure I can think of at present.<br />

<p>Thanks Mr Beep, &nbsp;Have tried everything now with HDD and USB drives with no joy. &nbsp; &nbsp;I can still play a game on the console but not get online to xboxlive. &nbsp; &nbsp; The Consol was from a car bootie which cost very little so I'll look for another and see if I'm
 luckier this time.</p>
<p>Regards and many thanks.</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker and WebM</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to import WebM files into Windows Movie Maker. Now I can't! I need to fix this as I am not going to pay money for a better screen recorder/an online converter service. Please help!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Microsoft employees, I am fully aware that Windows Movie Maker lacks support for this file type. That is why I am asking this question.
</p>
<p>And for the record, I am sick of Microsoft Employees answering people's questions with the problems they seem to be having. Thank you.</p>

            <p>You are correct that the .webm video file type is not directly supported in Movie Maker. It's possible it may work if you load the correct DirectShow filters, but I'm not sure how well this is supported. Check the
<a href="http://www.webmproject.org/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WebM Tools</a> page for details on loading DirectShow filters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quick question, are you able to play the .webm files directly in Windows Media Player?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, a recommended workaround is to convert the file to a supported format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for whether there will be a "fix" to allow webm files to work seamlessly in Movie Maker, I would guess (given that the program hasn't been updated since 2012) that the answer is "no". But I'm not associated with Microsoft, just a fellow user of Movie
 Maker imparting what knowledge I have on the subject.</p>

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

</p><p>I tried the Check for New Hardware 3-4 times and changed the BIOS setting for SATA3 from Auto to CD/ROM but&nbsp;Device Mangers still does not display the Blu Ray burner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manger does see and&nbsp;list&nbsp;the (2) internal HDDs, the External SATA, the Media bloc and the USBs and Fire Wire connectors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I correct this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, cvt</p>

            <p>Thank you for that reply. However it did not (completely?) solve the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After that Registry&nbsp;edit(?), addition(?),&nbsp;my Win10 Device Manager still did not display a line "DVD/CD-ROM".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the result I needed I had to select and Uninstall, via the Device Manger Menu, the last two "IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, first the last entry "Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller" then the next "Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller" above
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a restart (which took&nbsp;longer than I was expecting) re-configured(?), re-populated(?) Device Manager and the "DVD/CD_ROM driver" line is now present and lists BH14NS40, my Blu Ray burner.</p>

            <p>I have since run 4 BluRay burning sessions so the problem has gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as I said the Registry "add" did not solve the problem until I deleted the controllers from Device Manager and restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still don't know why/how the SATA cable came off but I am buying&nbsp;a replacement cable that has a clip!</p>
