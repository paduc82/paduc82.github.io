<h2>            CHange Primary Account User Details</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to delete my current primary account user details (this is the information for the subscription account user) and enter a new one.</p>
<p>Because I am changing my ISP, the email account and information that I opened the MS Account with will be no longer in service so I need to change it to a generic one (ie., gmail). As I pay my subscription monthly it's important that this is done properly
 the first time without any of the usual microsoft drama's.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How best can I do this?&nbsp; As this is in the process of happening now (changing ISP) I need to enact this very soon.&nbsp; Thanking you in anticipation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Denise</p>

            Hi Denise,
<br />You can log into your Microsoft account and add a new alias - make sure you check your recovery information too. 
<br />
<br />I recommend adding the new address and setting it as primary but do not delete the old one - the Office subscription is tied to it.
<br />
<br />To add an alias: <a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/names/Manage</a>
<br />To change your recovery info: <a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/basic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/basic</a>

<h2>            Deleting contacts in my outlook.com account don&#39;t get deleted.  Suggestion&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot delete contacts from the people page on my outlook.com account.&nbsp; I am trying to sync my desktop Outlook 2013 contacts, I have deleted all the contacts in Outlook 2013 and it says it has sync'd with my outlook.com account, but there are entries still
 there there on outlook.com&nbsp; I cannod delete them from the outlook.com page.&nbsp; For example, there is now only 1 entry under F.&nbsp; I select it, and delete, it isnt deleted.&nbsp; In fact whether I select one at a time or a group, they appear to be deleted, but they
 reappear.</p>
<p>Next, there appears to be a bug in the user interface.&nbsp;When i select people one at a time&nbsp;by checking on the little boxes in the left column, if I then click outside the box (for example, on the silloutte icon for another contact, all of the checked boxes
 are unchecked.</p>
<p>Also, there appears to be no way to select all. I have read prior posts, but they seem to be for the old UI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found other posts relating to groups and invitations&nbsp; I am not a member of any groups, there are no group invitations,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to unsync your web based account to Microsoft Outlook 2013? If not yet, please do so as this may be the reason why you still cannot delete the contacts from your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your second concern, I tried replicating your issue and got the same result. It's by default that the check mark will be remove if you click it outside the box. As for the select All option, yes, it has been removed on the upgraded version of Microsoft
 Hotmail. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused you. For now, you can write your feedback on us by signing in to your account and go to your Inbox page. Click on gear icon next to your username and select
<strong>Feedback</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Unsyncing my web based account doesn't help me. I can "delete" 10 contacts and they instantly reappear.

<ul>
<li>What are the steps that you've taken when deleting your contacts?</li></ul>
I check the box beside the contact (one or more checks), then click on "Delete. The contacts will disappear for a second or so, then reappear.&nbsp;I'm using Windows 8 and Outlook 2013 on my laptop. I've
 tried logging onto my computer locally (without syncing with SkyDrive) and still have the same issue.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Does the same thing happen when you're using different computers and browsers?</li></ul>
<div>Yes. Same on different computers and with different browsers.</div>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting an error message? If you are, please post it here.</li></ul>
<div>No.</div>
<ul>
<li>What particular email program did you sync your web based account?</li></ul>
<div>Outlook 2013. My calendars, mail, and tasks all sync properly. My online Outlook contacts keep multiplying. Although I have about 1,800 locally, online I have nearly 20,000 filled with duplicates.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I would really like is for Microsoft to completely delete all of my contacts on Outlook.com and reset it so I can use it again. I don't understand why Microsoft doesn't have this ability. Even if the Outlook.com Contacts started working properly today,
 I'm not going to &nbsp;manually delete 18,000 duplicates ...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help. Thanks.</div>

After extensive research on the web, and MS support site.......there doesn't appear to be an answer. &nbsp;At least one that I can find. &nbsp; So...... I will continue to highlight the issue on the Community website, in hopes that someone comes to help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>the alternative is to give up on MS tools, and just go back to Apple eco system, or to go to Google.....because they don't seem to have these problems.....</div>

</p>
<p>Stating as you did that "it is NOT a bug" certainly comes across as if you claim to be an expert. Sometimes when people say that it precedes a statement along the lines of "because it has this positive benefit you probably hadn't considered."</p>
<p>The fact that similar behavior occurs in other Microsoft products reminds me of an old saying: two wrongs do not make a right.</p>
<p>In this case, I can't think of a reason why you would ever want a UI that once you have selected N items, a slight imprecision of cursor placement would then unselect them all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you?</p>

            <p>Sounds a lot like the installs are corrupted. You may be able to do a repair install, BUT don't go using the downloaded upgrade option via a reset because all they use is the current download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to make a ISO and load from that either by DVD ( for the laptop) or USB drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using a fresh .esd convert to ISO. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download 14393 .esd's -- Just found them tonight, see the following thread, look for my name, links in the post&nbsp;

<p>Go to settings, System, Apps &amp; Features</p>
<p>You will then see all you aps where you tap on an app and then select advance settings. There is a Reset button which re-installs the app.</p>

<h2>            No ASAP Utilities tab on Excel 2007 for one computer but it appears on another one</h2>
                    I have two Windows 7 32-bit computers running Microsoft Office 2007. I installed ASAP Utilities on both systems and an add-in for CIM loads. On one system the tab appeared on the ribbon for Add-ins and&nbsp;the ASAP Utilities tab&nbsp;but on the other system the
 ribbon did not change for either install. I have no way to access or use the utility and the add-in is difficult to access. Any suggestions why&nbsp;the ribbon does not change?&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use OneNote 2016 on Windows OS, as the Learning Tools add-in may be corrupted, I'd like to suggest the below methods to check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; click Programs and Features &gt; Learning Tools for OneNote &gt; Change &gt; Repair. If Repair does not work, please click Uninstall and then reinstall the&nbsp;<a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/D/9/9D9ADEBD-452A-4BE4-A0F8-BF1764B5CACE/LearningTools.Setup.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Learning
 Tools Add-in</a>.</p>
<p>You may also need to uninstall and reinstall the program that hijacks the Voice-to-Text control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still occurs, to better assist you, could you please provide the below information?</p>
<p>1. A screenshot of the error message if there is any.</p>
<p>2. Which program is hijacking immersive reader?If you close it, does OneNote work properly?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Your operating system version and Office version.</p>
<p>For Office version, you can find it by clicking File &gt; Account &gt; Product Information. Please capture a screenshot of the entire information under Product Information to show subscription, version
 and channel information.&nbsp;</p>

 of ways, but I see nothing I can do to accept her as a contact so that we can Skype. No viable link! &nbsp;Also, I have taken Skype off my iMac and reinstalled it several times according to online instructions, which includes emptying the trash and shutting down
 the computer. &nbsp;I believe I have been thorough. &nbsp;I cannot find an answer for this. &nbsp;Please help.

<p>
</p><p>If you are seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pending contact request" on your screen that means you are the one who requested to be added, it also means the Accept button will be available on the other person. The Accept button will only be visible on your end if it is the other
 person who requested to be added on your Contact List. You need to advise your friend to Accept the request on his/her end.</p>
<p>

            When this popup appears, just click OK/accept, or if you are using your 3G/GPRS/EDGE service press the red hangup/close key for 5 seconds. It will then ask you to close connection, so press OK. Make sure you are not using WLAN connestion as well. If you
 are, then try closing it from the wireless option under settings&gt;connectivity&gt; wireless networsk. You also need to make sure there is no application requesting an internet connection.<br />
Be aware that the *#7780# reset does not format you device. It only reset its setting.<br />
Good luck.

<p>After a couple of minutes it is possible to reset the N97. So the cause of action is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Switch on the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Go have a pint at your local</p>
<p>3) come back home and reset the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hold the left shift key, the spacebar and the back key then the power key, *hold them until the device asks for the country etc.<br />

If your device fails to boot up or gives a contact the retailer message then a hard format on boot will usualy sort the problem.<br />
<br />
<font color="red">WARNING</font>&nbsp;doing a hard reset will&nbsp;<font color="red">DELETE</font>&nbsp;all user data on the device memory, including contacs, calendar entries and any apps etc you have installed to C: drive, your mass memory/memory card will remain unafected
 so any data will still be there, however you may have to reinstall some apps even if they are installed to mass mem/mem card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to hold the buttons untill you are asked to set your country, date etc, then release, try it again, if it fails you may need to visit a Nokia Care Point !</p>

<h2>            Emails not coming through</h2>
                    <p>I have tested several emails to&nbsp;( Outllook.com, Hotmail, MSN, ECT). They all say they where delivered okay, but I never receive the emails from my organization.&nbsp; I work at a school and many parents are not getting our emails. Is there a way to find out why
 on our end it says delivered, but when I open the Microsoft mailbox it never shows the emails? I have checked junk, deleted and all areas and don't find the email. The only way I can get the email to come through on my personal account (outlook) was to add
 a contact for the email address. Any suggestions on where to go to ensure my emails go through, because they are legitimate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand&nbsp;you, along with the other parents, can't receive mails from&nbsp;the organization. I'd like to thank you for providing details on the issue and with this information, we determined that its best you contact the system administrator of the organization
 to have this checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be your best first step in getting this resolved. Should you need further assistance, kindly let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Data connection and 3G settings</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, dumb question but can somebody explain to me the relationship between the 'Data Connection' setting and the '3G' setting?</p>
<p>My understanding is that if I enable 'Data Connection' then I get data flowing to and from my phone over my mobile/celluar providers network (e.g web/email etc...). If I enable '3G' then I assume the phone will hunt down 3G networks and use them in preference
 because of higher bandwidhth, right? So far so good.</p>
<p>But, here's the question,&nbsp;if I turn off 'Data Connection', what exactly is the point of that 3G setting? Without 'Data' enabled, what exactly am I going to do with this 3G network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            By the way.... switching these options off when you don't need them (Data + 3G) really does save battery life!!!

<h2>            Change email address used by Office 365 Home</h2>
                    <p>I created my O365 Home account with my Gmail address several years ago. I'd like to change that now to my outlook.com address but can't seem to find out how to do that, and support gave up and directed me here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my billing email address to my @outlook.com address but that does not change the sign in address. I then went to “Manage how you sign in to Microsoft” and tried “Add email” but when I try “Add an existing email address as a Microsoft account alias”
 I get the error message “This email address is already taken. Please take another”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            If the outlook.com address already exists, you can't add it to the home subscription (as the owner - you can share the home subscription with it). Sorry. 
<br />
<br />If you wanted to make a new address, you could add it to the Microsoft account as an alias and set it as the default.

<p>Hi BarbaraCampbell,</p>
<p>If a license was removed from a mailbox, the mailbox’s data would be kept for 30 days. Within this period of time, if reassigning a license to the mailbox, all its data will still be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the cancellation period for this user within 30 days?&nbsp;<br />
If so, it’s possible to recover its data. If not, it nearly impossible to recover the data.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<h2>            Download problems</h2>
                    I had to download the skype for windows desktop. I have win 7 professional. After down loading latest version and logging in, my account does not show any history, contacts, my picture, or subscriptions&nbsp; etc. Although it shows all on skype website when
 I go to my account. I cannot make any calls as if I have no account, although I am logging in with my email and receiving the login code and getting verified under my old email and phone number.

<p>There is no available Classic Skype Download for Desktop only for windows tablet and phones. If you know where to obtain the Classic Skype Download for Desktop as at 1 July 2018 it would be appreciated by many people. My father is having exactly the same
 issues after updating his Classic version of Skype. He uses Windows 7 on his desktop and it will no longer allow him to sign in since updating nor is he able to access his contacts.</p>

<p>There is no "bug" in Skype 8.x that looses your contacts and the ability to call. Many people simply log into a different account. For example, if I sign in with my Skype name in Skype 8.x (on one of my accounts), I have all my contacts. If I sign in with
 my email address used for that account, I get a different account. You need to isolate which account is which, and sign in with the appropriates account. If you are unable to determine this, you can always contact
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
live chat</a> for assistance.&nbsp;Inability to sign in may be due to using the wrong account or a firewall blocking the 8.x release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to any loss of data.&nbsp; Skype 8.x simply pulls the last 30 days of history from the cloud. It can download up to 2 years if you scroll up enough. Since Skype has access to up to 2 years of cloud history it intentionally does not have a need to import
 history from classic Skype 7.x. You can always export your 7.x history, that may contain more than 2 years of history, for archival reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to reinstall classic Skype (7.x), you can download it from the following links...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest 7.x downloads (should all be 7.41.x.101 when downloaded from Windows 10, if it downloads an 8.x version or the link is broken on your OS, try the direct links):</p>

                    <p>****, Microsoft, who green lighted this change, whose idea was it to put in a new touchpad driver with build 10049 that disabled touchpad settings, like undoing the reverse touchpad scroll that you put in? &nbsp;I want to be able to slide my fingers downward on
 the touchpad to have what's in the window slide downwards and you broke that. &nbsp;Look at this screenshot, you disabled the settings so I can't turn on the reverse setting you put it on:</p>

<h2>            How to add microsoft purchase to my account</h2>
                    Hi, I have purchased a physical Microsoft office at a licensed store and recently my Microsoft had some issues and I reinstalled it. Microsoft then asked to download the copy from my account however, since I did not download/purchase from the online store,
 I do not find any subscription associated. I was wondering if I could associate this copy with my account for easier downloads and set up in future..

Doesn't work well for me, despite trying many many experiments.&nbsp; I know this sounds crazy but: it seems erratic.&nbsp; Sometimes pasting one column short of my selection, sometimes omitting the column adjacent to the hidden column.&nbsp;

<p>Hi JasaTutor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up. So we can help you accordingly, please allow us to ask some questions. First, we’d like to know the phone model and version of Windows you’re using. If it’s Windows 10, kindly provide us the current operating system (OS) build
 installed on your phone. You would be able to check this by going to <strong><span>Settings</span></strong> &gt;
<strong><span>System</span></strong> &gt; <strong><span>About </span></strong>&gt; <strong>
<span>More info</span></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you referring to an application that is getting slow when you say “my WA getting slow”? If yes, please also indicate the exact name of the application. Have you tried any troubleshooting steps? Which Internet connection are you using?
 Is it Wi-Fi or mobile data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            Deleting an Outlook profile that I initially messed up</h2>
                    Upon setting up Outlook 2013 I initially used the wrong type of account (microsoft exchange) to try to get into my gmail account. &nbsp;This seems to have corrupted the "Outlook" file and now everytime I try to open Outlook it gets stuck on the "Loading profile"
 portion of the bootup. &nbsp;I get the error "The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. &nbsp;Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action." &nbsp;It then throws me to a Microsoft Exchange prompt which is again not what I'm trying to set up. &nbsp;After
 hitting cancel or ok, it then tells me via prompt that "Cannot Start Microsoft outlook. &nbsp;Cannot open the Outlook window. &nbsp;The set of folders cannot be opened. &nbsp;The file c:\etc.... is not an outlook data file." &nbsp;I circumvented this by correctly setting up the

<p>
</p><p>I have the blue screen with a sad face on my Lumia 520.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/71518705-c080-4d34-8ffb-e6a1254c4818" title="AR_12">

<p><span>It is not possible to change an account's <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?q=skype+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Skype name</span></a></strong>. When&nbsp;Skype accounts
 were migrated to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016,&nbsp;</span>the option to create a custom Skype name is also no longer possible. The account creation process would prompt new users to create their accounts using either an
<strong>email address </strong>or a <strong>phone number.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can&nbsp;change your <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA110/how-do-i-change-my-skype-display-name?q=display+name" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">display name</span></a></strong> or create a different
 account. Note that an account created using an email address will have a system-generated Skype Name that will show as
<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@.</strong></p>
