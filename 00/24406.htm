<h2>            feedback on new skype</h2>
                    <p>I KNOW that this is not helpful, and i have to</p>
<p>say it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE this new skype with a passion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost none of the tools to customize settings to&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY preferences are available</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chat list is crazy - disorganized... i lose people</p>
<p>in the crowd - even right after i respond to&nbsp;</p>
<p>something, the person disappears and i have</p>
<p>to go hunting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this "favourites" has absolutely NOTHING to do</p>
<p>with me - why and how have YOU decided that</p>
<p>these are my favourites?&nbsp; How do i get rid of&nbsp;</p>
<p>that?<br />
<br />
how do i return my chat list to the same set up</p>
<p>as 7.40.... ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do i view profile?<br />
<br />
how do i set the font to what I want to use and</p>
<p>the size i want it in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "settings' are very limited/rudimentary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i get the emoticon settings back?<br />
<br />
You've taken away a number of emoticons i&nbsp;</p>
<p>use regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you've reduced the size of emoticons to TINY</p>
<p>if they are coupled with text or combined with</p>
<p>a few other emoticons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of emoticons that i use for</p>
<p>celebrating people/events (at least 20) and</p>
<p>i can no longer use them... WHY NOT?<br />
<br />
i'vee been paying for a skype number and</p>
<p>minutes for quite some time ... pissed off</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />Under the 'Chats' tab, it should say 'Recent Chats'. Click on the little drop-down arrow beside it, and select 'Hide Favourites' to hide the favourites.
<br />
<br />If it says 'Recent Chats' underneath the 'Chats' tab, then it means all of your communications are ordered in order of the most recently messaged. You can click on it to change this to another setting.
<br />
<br />To view your profile, select your profile picture at the top of the screen. To view another person's profile, right-click their name under either the 'Chats' or 'Contacts' tab and select 'View Profile'.
<br />
<br />The font size and settings in Skype are using your default font settings in your Windows Settings. Changing these should change the ones in Skype.
<br />
<br />You can get all sorts of better emojis and emoticons by clicking the Blue '+' button on the bottom right of the chat when you are communicating with someone.
<br />
<br />I understand your frustration, and our developers are trying to implement and fix all the issues that are currently going on. I hope this somewhat helps.

    <title>New College Office 365 Account Questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyvignola  say:</h3>
<h2>            New College Office 365 Account Questions</h2>
                    
<p>I have created an Office 365 account for my college email account and classes; &nbsp;moreover, I downloaded the available "for a free trial period" Office 365 software to my personal computer from my school account. &nbsp;I also joined Microsoft Community. &nbsp;I can
 only access my Microsoft profile through my school website. &nbsp;When I try to sign in as a private Microsoft account it indicates no such account. &nbsp;So, do I have a private Microsoft account in addition to my school Office 365 account or not? &nbsp;I have questions
 regarding whether or not my personal profile information I allow to be shown for my college User List is also posted publicly to a separate Microsoft account website somewhere. &nbsp;My Microsoft profile that I can access through the college Office 365 website
 indicates that "everyone" can see certain personal information of mine such as my school email address, and it cannot be edited to "only me." &nbsp;I do not know exactly what that means. &nbsp;Who can answer my Microsoft Support questions such as these? &nbsp;All the official
 Microsoft Support I find needs me to "log in," and when I attempt to do this, it will not recognize my Microsoft account. &nbsp;As I said, I can only "log in" to my Microsoft account through the school website, but I cannot find any official Microsoft Support to
 answer exactly what type of Microsoft accounts, website memberships, and public personal profiles do I have? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi anthony,</p>
<p>to answer your questions:</p>
<p>1.<em><strong> do i have a private microsoft account in addition to my school office 365 account or not?</strong></em></p>
<p>actually, you don't have. i need to clarify first that office 365 account and microsoft account are absolutely different, since they are associated with different services. since
<strong>you have created an office 365 account for your college email account and classes</strong>, your school email should be an office 365 account
<strong>other than a microsoft account</strong>. if you want to make your school email(office 365 account) also be a microsoft account, you can sign this email as a microsoft account

here</a>. once finished, you can use your school email address to access other microsoft sources you mentioned.</p>
<p>note: in fact, we don't suggest the user uses the same email address for both office 365 account and microsoft account, see my reply with screenshot in this&nbsp;thread. you can simply create another free outlook
 account, it is indeed a microsoft account.</p>
<p>2.<strong><em>my microsoft profile that i can access through the college office 365 website indicates that "everyone" can see certain personal information of mine such as my school email address, and it cannot be edited to "only me."</em></strong></p>
<p>please understand that this profile you mentioned is office 365 profile not the microsoft profile. the following user' profile including some hided information is controlled by the global admin not the user himself.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4b6c9917-8a95-44b5-93b4-24c66cb68154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4b6c9917-8a95-44b5-93b4-24c66cb68154" /></a></p>
<p><br />
in addition, you can log into <a href="https://portal.office.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">office 365 admin portal</a>&nbsp;with your office 365 account -&gt; click
<strong>delve</strong> -&gt;<strong>me</strong> on the left pane -&gt;<strong>profile</strong> -&gt;<strong>edit profile</strong> to edit
<strong>other profile</strong> not listed in the above, such as pictures and so on.</p>
<p>if it is helpful, please mask it as yes which will also benefit other community members.<br />

<h2>            N8 - Message Received notification flashes on and off &#40;not the envelope problem&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have the phone screen locked and I receive a text message. I unlock the screen and the large box at the bottom of the screen that says '1 New Message' appears for me to press the button to open the message and read it. However, sometimes when I unlock
 the screen the '1 New Message' box appears then disappears and just flashes on and off. I am unable to press any on screen options and can only access the message by going into the main screen and into messages etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; It began a few days ago and now happens each time I receive a text message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have subsequently installed the recent significant firmware update, but no change.</p>

            Just to add:<br />
I searched both google and the forum, this is the only topic I found.<br />
I've been through the FAQ<br />
I've been through the guides on the Nokia website - both Messaging and Hardware<br />
I've tried to contact Nokia, but having completed every field correctly in their form, the submit button simply won't work. Screenshot available for anybody who doesn't believe that. ;-)

<p>Spent about an hour on the phone to a nokia employee who lives far far away, who was difficult to understand and who struggled to understand my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very frustrating and it seems that Nokia know nothing at all about this problem, however he eventually had me perform a factory reset, which solved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the reset also removed all user settings, data, etc, including the facebook homepage widget, which I've not been able to find anywhere for download again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, a thumbs down to Nokia.&nbsp; I really can't imagine that iPhone users get the same support experience...</p>

<p>The same thing hapenned to my N8 recently. I noticed that the Received Message flashing only started after I had installed an&nbsp;additional line of widgets/apps shortcuts on the desktop which occupied the bottom part of the desktop screen, where the Received
 Message normally appears. I moved the bottom line of widgets/apps shortcuts to higher up on the desktop leaving that bottom&nbsp;area clear, and the flashing stopped. Try it, hope it works.</p>

<p>if you're talking about the homescreen wiget of notification, then just tap on in or click it to clear missed calls or messages, everything will still be intact under messages and call logs.</p>
<p>but if you find it annoying then remove the widget.</p>

    <title>Windows Phone 8.1 Internet Explorer Favorites Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phnoasthetic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone 8.1 Internet Explorer Favorites Folders</h2>
                    <p>I just got my new Nokia 635.&nbsp; A while back I let Windows backup my Internet Explorer Favorites.&nbsp; I haven't been able to get it to overwrite that backup or remove it.&nbsp; I finally deleted all the system backups on OneDrive (I pray that worked).&nbsp; Sadly, before
 I did that, my phone decided to sync all my favorites to it.&nbsp; The problem now is I have this list of favorites folders on my phone.&nbsp; I have been able to empty all the actual folders of favorites, but I can't get the folders to actually delete.&nbsp; I've tried
 pressing and holding (like I did to delete the favorites), but that just leaves me pushing on the screen.&nbsp; Checked the file manager and plugged it into my Surface to see if I could access the favorites there, but that didn't work.&nbsp; How do I delete these folders
 from my phone?&nbsp; I really don't need a list of empty favorites folders.&nbsp; It's really a pain.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you have synced Internet Explorer Favorites from your Windows to Windows Phone. Unfortunately, there is no option to delete Folders in Favorites on Windows Phone. The only option would be to do a hard reset. Remember to back up your stuff first:</p>

<p>When you do clean install, you have to do custom install and wipe out all old partitions and let windows create new ones for you. Just in case you need this, good refresher:</p>

            This is a worksheet level setting. Hence, you can't turn it OFF for entire workbook or entire Excel.
<br />
<br />You can do it at 2 places
<br />1. View tab &gt; Uncheck headings
<br />2. File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Under Display options for this Worksheet, uncheck Show row and column headers

    <title>Motorola Q hangs on startup, totally unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guy from liberty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Motorola Q hangs on startup, totally unresponsive</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.&nbsp; I'm a computer technician for the City of Liberty, Missouri municipal government.&nbsp; My experience in troubleshooting and servicing mobile devices is nil, so thank you for being patient with me and my inexperience.&nbsp;
 I've been presented with a silver Motorola Q smartphone (model: Q, Date code: 2006) from Verizon Wireless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS:</p>
<p>When phone is powered on, it displays the Verizon splash screen (black background, red and white logo) for about 20 seconds.&nbsp; Then it displays the Windows Mobile spalsh screen (sky-blue background).&nbsp; After the Windows Mobile screen has been
 on about 7 seconds, the "musical chimes" startup sound begins to play for about 1.5 seconds, then abrubtly cuts off.&nbsp; At this point, the phone is "frozen" and completely unresponsive to any button input whatsoever - even the power button.&nbsp; The only way to
 turn the phone off by then is to remove the battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT I'VE ALREADY TRIED:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*swapping out 2 other different batteries</p>
<p>*using no battery at all, just plug-in AC/DC adapter</p>
<p>*holding down the&nbsp;* + E buttons during power-up to try and force a reset</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Motorola's own support website doesn't provide any solutions.&nbsp; In fact, I could not find any other reports of any similar experiences.&nbsp; Any useful feedback - even if just to say definitively that there's nothing I can do in-house to
 fix it - is appreciated.</p>

<p>As soon as it boots you need to keep trying to get that Hard Reset to occur .... hopefully it will catch. If not, I think the only option will be to get a replacement.&nbsp; If it is still under warranty, I would cjoose that option ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that the Hard Reset for the Q was done by pressing down and holding the red power key and the center silver selection button simultaneously before the Verizon logo appears. You may have to try this several times. You should then see
 a black screen and a dialog box to ask if you want to reset your Q.</p>

            Yes, the hardware hard reset would be to pull battery out, plug battery back in, simultaneously press and hold the red power/hang up key along with the center/ok key on the "five way navigation pad" between the "home" key and "back" key. Keep holding both
 until the screen shows something along the line of "Are you sure you want to perform a Master Reset?". Then press the right soft key for yes I believe.
<br />
<br />
If it does not even want to be hard resetted, then definitely take it into a full service Verizon Wireless store and they can check to see if it's under the 1 year manufacturer warranty. If it is, most VZW stores have Silver Motorola Q's in stock (atleast in
 the Houston area) and can swap it out at no cost as long as their technician cannot "fix" or hard reset the device either and that there are no signs of physical or liquid damage. If that phone is out of warranty, then there will most likely be a $50 replacement
 fee. <br />

<h2>            Excel - pasted values don&#39;t act like numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem where I copy formulas, paste them as values, but the values don't act like numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after formatting&nbsp;cells to 'Numbers', functions like AutoSum don't work on the pasted cells.</p>
<p>When I highlight the column it only shows the number of cells, not the average and the sum, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recalculated the sheet &nbsp;and it still didn't consider the pasted cells 'numbers'.</p>
<p>The only way&nbsp;I could fix the problem was to click in each individual cell and hit enter.</p>
<p>As soon as I do that the number aligns to the left and all functions work as they should. (Even though formulas are calculated automatically in the spreadsheet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you let me know&nbsp;how to make pasted values act like numbers?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            MSN premium keeps shutting down.</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new computer with Windows 10 installed. I also upgraded my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10. MSN premium was shutting down occasionally on Windows 7, but now on both computers MSN Premium shuts down shortly after navigating to
 a different website from MSN Premium home page. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software on both computers; ran the MSN repair tool ; still keeps shutting down. When I surf the Web on Internet Explorer or the new Edge browser; no shut downs. I really
 liked MSN Premium when it worked; but now I question why I should be paying for software that crashes all of the time. Any help would be appreciated.

            Another solution that worked for me is go to settings and go back to the previous build, then select windows update and reinstall the new version. Everything works fine with MSN explorer now.

</p><blockquote>I think I found the solution to my problems with MSN Explorer shutting down by going to settings in MSN Explorer&gt;IE options&gt;Privacy Settings&gt;Programs tab&gt;manage add-ons. Disable all add-ons that you don't recognize and some
 that might be suspect such as antivirus add-ons. Sign out and then sign back in to see if MSN Explorer works properly. If you don't experience any shut downs or other problems then it is obvious one of the add-ons is the problem. Sign back in and repeat steps
 to access manage add-ons. Enable one at a time and sign out-sign in and test the compatibility. I dixcovered that a third party add-on might be my problem, since when I enabled it, MSN shut down. It was a "&nbsp;shockwave flash object" add-on. Time will tell if
 this is my solution, but right now I am able to surf all over the place on MSN Explorer without any issues.

<strong>Solution is simple -&nbsp;one of the latest&nbsp;updates&nbsp;for windows 10&nbsp;messed up Flash as per Microsof just delete update kb3132372 and everything works fine</strong>

    <title>How Can I Calculate HOURS ELAPSED between two Time of the Day&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kindivity  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Can I Calculate HOURS ELAPSED between two Time of the Day&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Communitarians,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to do something seemingly very simple, but can't figure out (or find information about) how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need to have a cell calculate the time that has elapsed between the time specified in one cell and the time specified in another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw in related posts/questions that those solutions involved a command called "elapsed," but all attempts to use that command does nothing but tell me that there is unrecognized text. Apparently, "elapsed" is not a valid command in my version of Office
 &amp; Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer to have only the time in each of the two source fields, and to use a 12-hour clock (e.g., 10:30 am, 4:30 pm). But I tried using "elapsed" as well as "sum" with a 24-hour clock formatting as well (e.g., 16:30 for 4:30 pm). No difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried making the field include the date as well as time (which I don't want to have to do), but that didn't make any difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 365 (updated), Home version (incl. Word, Excel, Outlook, etc.), within a Windows 7, 64-bit OS environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had "11:30 AM" in cell A1, and "2:35 PM" in cell B1, and I wanted cell C1 to display the amount of time that elapsed between them (i.e., it should yield a result of "03:05" to indicate 3 hours, 5 minutes), HOW can I make C1 display that elapsed time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if the answer involves using a command called "elapsed," then it seemingly won't work for me, unless I need to use some syntax different from the variations I've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, typing into C1 any of the following only results in "#NAME?" being displayed in C1, and hovering over the exclamation point error info icon for C1 says "The formula contains unrecognized text.":</p>
<p>
</p><p>[e.g., of what DOES NOT WORK: ] "=elapsed(A1,B1)" and "=elapsed(A1,B1,TRUE)" and "=elapsed(A1:B1)" and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is able to help me, &amp; willing to enlighten me, as to what to type into C1 to get the amount of time that has elapsed between times of day entered into two other cells (each with one and only one time of day), I'd be immensely appreciative!</p>

    <title>Unlocking an out-of-contract &#39;3&#39; 6630 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hpteenagewizkid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unlocking an out-of-contract &#39;3&#39; 6630</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I know that there a lot of questions on this issue, and a lot of conflicting responses. would be grateful if someone in the know could advise me.<br />
<br />
I had a Nokia 6630 on the '3' UK network that was locked. I am now out of contract. I did try to get it unlocked by the network when in-contract, but they were charging £300 for the privilage. Anyway before that I had tried to unlock it myself, using codes
 that were given to me on forums and via (that i now) fake unlock code generators. It was only than, once I'd used up my 5 tries for the unlock code, that I found out through research that its a BB5 algorithm for the code and not DCT4.<br />
<br />
I know that you can reflash the phone, and plan to do this using the Nokia Updater. I know this won't remove the locks, but I did read here somewhere that it can reset the unlock attempt counter?<br />
<br />
At the time i was trying to get this done, it was around February/March, and at that time knowledge of the codes was still restricted - there was only (apparently) one guy in the UK that could do it for real and he charged £10k a batch (my local The Link manager
 told me).<br />
<br />
Now for the reason I'm asking this. i phoned up '3' as instructed after my contract was over. They are still charging me £250 to unlock it, which I think is really unreasonable. I know why operators lock the handsets, and also why they charge so much to unlock
 them to their customers. But now I am not a customer, they had promised me an unlocking fee of £25, but now have gone back on their word.<br />
<br />
I also phoned up Orange, as I read through several forums via google that they did it for free to everyone, but they told me that as I am not an orange customer, this was not the case - never mind that I do have a contract with them with another phone.<br />
<br />
I'd really appreciate any advice on this. I know it'll have to be hardware unlocked, and if at all possible I'd like to do it myself with the cables and such. Can anyone guide me on what needs to be downloaded/bought, or if that's not possible, a reliable company
 that can do this for a low cost?<br />
<br />
Thanks, and sorry for the long post.<br />
<br />
Hussein.

            This topic has been discussed over and over again.<br />
<br />
If you require an unlock code, you need to contact the network from which the phone has come from.<br />

Now, I am closing this thread...<br />

            Charging £250 for unlocking after you have fulfilled your contract sounds unreasonable to me. Perhaps you should also contact a local consumer affairs ombudsman (or whatever they're called in your neighbourhood), or the local telecommunications regulatory
 body of your government (they might have something to say regarding this, too).

            The only people who can unlock it is the network is was purchased on.<br />
<br />
Only 3 can provide the unlock code. Normally a charge of £30 is levied. Online generators do not work with smart phones, and as you've found you've borked your phone. So first visit is a Nokia service centre to get the unlock try bar lifted, then 3 to provide
 the unlock code.

 (did not happen before!). My PC has 2 permanently Installed Hard drives, and one removable drive which has Win-10 directory&nbsp;installed in it, if I disable the drive, the PC boots from XP directory. To me the other Windows versions have the most needed data.
 My question; how I can access the boot table, the config.bat, and Auto.exe file for possible alteration. I looked for these 2 file in all of Windows version. Please if you have an answer, forward it to Ramsey

<p>When I looked at my partitions using Partition Master I noticed that the clean install of build 10130 did not create a system reserved partition as has happened in all other builds. I wonder if this is what is causing my dual boot problem.</p>

            <p>Yea if you want a system reserved partition you need to make a partition to install 10 on</p>
<p>Otherwise 10 won't create one.</p>
<p>Which isn't a bad thing most people do not want a system reserved partition anyway,</p>
<p>The only exception would be&nbsp;people wanting to use bitlocker</p>

            Hello, I am glad to see that others are exploring the dual-boot solution. As you know, mIcrosoft warns of possible bootup, data loss, crashing, app malfunction or damage, etc. I thought dual-boot would be the way to go to get through these debacles, as
 I only own one useable computer. Will MS accomodate me and install W10 to a new p[artition if I opt to download one of these builds? Does MS have download and install instructions for dual-booters? Do you recommend MS utilities for partitions, as someone seems
 to be using third-party software for this purpose.<br />

            <p>I would only dual boot in the sense that 10tp should never be installed while another os or data drive is connected,</p>
<p>Install 10tp on a totally separate&nbsp;hdd or ssd if you want to take it for a spin,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>to get a boot menu, you need to install 10 to a separate hard drive or partition. you can the d/l and install EasyBCD boot manager to set your default os or just use the arrow key to boot into whichever os you choose from the boot menu. I currently have
 6 operating systems and boot to whichever I want whenever I need to.</p>
<p>installing 10 without have any other operating system drive connected defeats win 10 in creating a boot menu.</p>

            <p>Yes that's the point,</p>
<p>Keep 10tp from messing with any existing system reserved partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until final and upgrading having tp on a dual boot is premature imho it will in fact have to be removed and properly upgraded to a qualifying existing os.</p>
<p>Otherwise it will cost 199.99 for 10 pro to keep that dual boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's pointless to dual boot this late in the game.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing that you need to have when you’re going to close a Skype account is access to it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype account cancellation must be done on the Skype user’s end. Skype support doesn’t have any access now on deleting Skype account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I strongly advise you to recover the Skype account first for you to be able to close it. You may answer our online recovery form on this
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a> to get back to your Skype account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

<h2>            Lync 2010 Hybrid with Lync Server 2013</h2>
                    
<p>We are working on building hybrid infrastructure with our existing Lync server 2010 .This Lync 2010 infrastructure is fully functional and accessible from the public internet used only for IM, Conferencing, Sharing and Mobile connectivity.</p>
<p>Current users on Lync 2010 :3000 users&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planning for &nbsp;migrating &nbsp;using hybrid : 300 users</p>
<p>Consideration : Use Lync Server 2013 servers for Hybrid ( To introduce a newer version of Lync 2013 in our environment and later we will expend this Lync 2013 Server infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRE-REQUISTES</p>
<p>Microsoft Lync Server 2010 with Cumulative Updates for Lync Server 2010: March 2013 (or later update) applied, and the L<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>ync Server 2013 administrative tools installed on-premises</strong></span>.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The federation Edge Server and next hop server from the federation Edge Server must be running Microsoft Lync Server 2010 with the March 2013 (or later) cumulative updates applied, or Lync Server 2013.</strong></span></p>
<p>Question :</p>
<p>Can i use multiple &nbsp;Lync 2013 Front end servers &nbsp;for my Hybrid with Skype for business in Office 365, i don't want to install any other roles in &nbsp;Lync Server 2013 &nbsp;example like Edge servers and reverse proxy for internet connectivity.I would like to use
 existing Lync 2010 Edge servers pool and reverse proxy servers for my remaining users in on premises. By doing this can i still be able to build the federation with Skype for Business Online ?</p>
<p>can i install L<strong>ync Server 2013 administrative tools on my Lync 2013 Front end servers ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the roles i can collocated&nbsp;in my Lync server 2013 Front end pool ?</strong></p>

<p>Hi asyed,</p>
<p>1. <em>“Can i use multiple Lync 2013 Front end servers…… By doing this can i still be able to build the federation with Skype for Business Online?”</em></p>
<p>As far as I know, it is feasible. By doing so, you can deploy hybrid with Office 365.</p>
<p>2. <em>“Can i install Lync Server 2013 administrative tools on my Lync 2013 Front end servers?”</em></p>
<p>After research, short answer is yes. The prerequisite is that Lync 2013 administrative tools should be installed on a separate server that can connect to Lync Server 2010. So, we can install it on Lync 2013 Front end server.</p>
<p>3. <em>“What are the roles i can collocated in my Lync server 2013 Front end pool?”</em></p>
<p>Upon researching, I find no official article has clarified this very clearly. I will do some consulting. I will let you know the update.</p>
<p>Moreover, as you will deploy Lync server 2010 + 2013 coexistence environment, I also suggest you post at our Lync server forum. They are more proficient at Lync server configurations:

<p>You can use the latest version Lync 2010 edge as the Lync 2013 front end. We can also keep the old reverse proxy server as usual. We don't need to install additional role on Lync 2013 server.</p>

<p>I have added this Discussion Board Web Part in a publishing page.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/838bce45-304a-4c1f-8808-e0a2f29ce925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/838bce45-304a-4c1f-8808-e0a2f29ce925" /></a></p>
<p>Here are my questions and look forward to your advise:</p>
<ol>
<li>By clicking the discussion title or new discussion, it will enter a full page. Is it possible to show in a dialog form like other list?</li><li>Since discussion requires two-way communication, is it possible to @ certain people or send notification to people?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>1/ Selecting "yes" under settings&gt;advanced&gt; "open forms in a dialog" <em><strong>should
</strong></em>open new items in a dialog but doesn't, due to the shoddy, inconsistent development practices in Sharepoint. Properly designed platforms would consider this a bug - Msft just ignores it.</p>
<p>However, dialogs use the built in OpenPopUpPage function so one option is to manually add a link to open the&nbsp;NewForm.aspx page in a dialog. Something like this:</p>
<p><span>&lt;a class="" href="javascript:OpenPopUpPage('/listname/newform.aspx?IsDlg=1',null,800,600);"&gt; New discussion &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ No, Sharepoint is an archaic, legacy platform and doesn't include any kind of tagging or dynamic alert mechanism.<br />

<p><span>We are running outlook 2007 on exchange 2003 in an XP environment.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a user that only has inbox folder showing up in a shared mailbox. Her&nbsp;personal email has deleted items,&nbsp;outbox, sent items. She is wanted to have those show up in the shared
 mailbox. I checked the security level and she has "owner" access. I rebuilt the outlook profile and added the shared mailbox in again but we still only have the inbox. i even tried the DumpsterAlwaysOn reg key edit and nothing happened</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have any ideas. Am I missing something? Thanks!</span></p>

<p>I found that when I seperately give permissions to a subfolder of the inbox, the subfolder then appears to the person to whom you have granted privledges.</p>
<p>Is there a way to pass privledges to all subfolders when the top folder is shared and given privledges?</p>

<h2>            How do I duplicate &#40;copy &#38; paste&#41; questions while creating online Excel survey&#63;</h2>
                    I am in the process of creating SkyDrive hosted Excel survey. Several of my questions are very similar, with just a minor variation and same set of answers (5 choices.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They occur in sets of there and I'm finding it very redundant retyping data (or copying pieces and parts one box at a time) to create the 2nd &amp; 3rd of each set.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Is there any mechanism to copy &amp; paste existing questions?</b> Then it would be very easy to edit the copy and make the simple change where necessary.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If there is, I'd suggest making it more intuitive, as I've looked and can't find it.</div>
<div><br />

<div>If not, please consider this a feature request as it would save a lot of time.&nbsp;</div>
