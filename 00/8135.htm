                    A user claims that until recently she was able to use&nbsp;Ctrl-Shift-F9&nbsp; in Word 2010 to convert automated paragraph numbering to plain text. I can find no docs/articles that supports this. I typically do Copy Paste Unformatted. Does anyone know if this was

    <title>How do I reorder the sheets within a workbook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tri-countyassociates  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reorder the sheets within a workbook&#63;</h2>
                    I don't use the full version of Excel so opening the file there isn't an option. &nbsp;I want to reorder the sheets in my web app workbook, but can't find a way to do it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As an alternative I could just create a new sheet, but it has to be at the far left, and the best I can do with that method is to make the sheet the 2nd from the left (even if the leftmost sheet is highlighted and you create a new sheet it does so to the
 right).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand the web app is a stripped down version and I might just be stuck. &nbsp;Any help will be appreciated.</div>

    <title>Outlook 2016 with multiple account setup using the wrong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kashifb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 with multiple account setup using the wrong &#34;From&#34; email when replying or forwarding messages</h2>
                    <p>I have set up my Outlook 2016 with my Outlook email account using the "<strong>Auto Account Setup</strong>". Outlook added this as a Microsoft Exchange account. I also setup a few of my other IMAP accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that with the setup above, when I reply to or forward an email from one of my IMAP accounts, the "<strong>From</strong>" email has been populated with my Outlook (Exchange) account. I can however manually change this. If I don't change this and
 send the email, the recipient sees "<strong>Email from IMAP account on behalf of Outlook account</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want this behaviour. How can I change this so the email in the "<strong>From</strong>" field is auto selected with the email address of the email account being used, for example, my IMAP account? Is this by design or a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When creating new emails, this does not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a workaround which did not work for me:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When setting up additional accounts in Outlook, there are two options you can choose from. These are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Send email using Outlook's server (recipient may see your Outlook address).</li><li>Send email using your provider's server (recipient will not see your Outlook address).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check if your account is set to <strong>Send email using Outlook's server</strong>. This maybe the reason why your recipients see the "On behalf of" message. You can set this option in the SMTP settings.<br />
<br />
You can also try to remove the email account and then add it again. Make sure to select
<strong>Send email using your provider's server</strong> in the SMTP settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes for us to assist you further. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>

            <p>So you're saying that I set one account as the default and it will always be selected in the"From" field regardless of whether I'm replying to or forwarding an email from a different email accounts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion this is completely wrong. No other email client does it like this even older versions of Outlook did not do this. Microsoft shouldn't be telling us what the default is, they should provide the user with settings and configuration to allow them
 to chose themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why does it not do this when creating a new email? When creating a new email, the "From" field is selected correctly. This is definitely a bug in Outlook. There are other people complaining about this exact same issue. Microsoft should do the decent
 thing, admit that it's a bug and tell us when it will be fixed.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. If I start a new email Outlook correctly selects the "From" address as my IMAP account but if I reply to an email it selects the Outlook.com address, even though the default account is the IMAP one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only happened since Microsoft forced me to remove the EAS connection to Outlook.com and replace it with an Exchange connection.</p>

            <p>I totally agree. My original setup with two emails worked fine ,them MS insisted I change one of my passwords for security reason's probably because I had logged into my email web Outlook a/c to try and sort the problems of a non working email address.</p>
<p>The whole account now is a mess .Like you I send from my wife's email which is exchange&nbsp; the same as mine but her one sends but says its from my email address and her one although sends does not receive from my email address.</p>

            <p>This problem is ridiculous. &nbsp;Since reconnecting Outlook 2016 to Outlook.com I've had nothing but headaches. &nbsp;Before I had to reconnect everything worked properly. &nbsp;I have a Windows Phone (which I still think is absolutely insane that it cannot sync with
 Outlook '16 without going through Outlook.com), but my calendar and contacts synced. &nbsp;After reconnecting, every time I hit "Reply" or "Forward" it sends from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, blah, blah, blah. &nbsp;I have to change that every single time.
 &nbsp;My default Email server is set to my Pop3 and my default Data is set to Outlook.com because I want that calendar to sync with my phone. &nbsp;Can this not be fixed???!!!! &nbsp;It is a Microsoft phone and program. &nbsp;It should work seamlessly.</p>

            So when you tap on IE, your device has to try to connect to the net first.&nbsp; Once it is connected, it then tries to download the site&nbsp; you are trying to access.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, do you connect to the net?</p>

            It's not possible to uninstall Internet Explorer because it's built into the OS. but a hard reset should resolve your issue. Just make sure backup your data.

<h2>            OneDrive Permanently Signed In</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to get OneDrive to sign out of multiple devices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed my password several times, but doing so does not restrict access on devices that are already signed in. For example, after changing my password on the Microsoft website, all my OneDrive files are still accessible on my PC and Cell Phone, despite
 not updating to the new password on these devices. I also tried using the option to "Remove all trusted Devices" from my Microsoft account, but all my OneDrive files are still accessible on all devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how do I remove access to my OneDrive on devices I do not have direct access to? If I log into OneDrive on a PC, does that PC now have permanent access to my OneDrive, even if I change the password?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am talking about logging into OneDrive through the PC app on Windows 10 (in which it becomes a folder under windows explorer) and adding OneDrive as an account on my mobile phone. Changing my Microsoft password associated with the OneDrive and removing
 all trusted devices DOES NOT restrict access to the folders and files in the OneDrive on these devices. Therefore, if I am unaware of any way to log out of/restrict access to my OneDrive account on devices I no longer have physical access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hope is that there is actually a way to remotely remove access to my OneDrive on devices I have do not have access to. Changing the Microsoft Account/OneDrive password does absolutely nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p></div>
<div>A <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsb/g/bsodbluescreen.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Blue Screen of Death</a>, also called a STOP Error, will appear when an issue is so serious that Windows must stop completely.</div>
<div>
<p>A Blue Screen of Death is usually <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termshm/g/hardware.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hardware</a> or <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsag/g/term_driver.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
driver</a> related. Most BSODs show a <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/supports/g/stopcode.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
STOP code</a> that can be used to help figure out the root cause of the Blue Screen of Death.</p>
<p><strong>Did your PC restart after the BSOD?</strong> If the blue screen flashed and your computer rebooted automatically before you had time to read anything, see Tip #3 at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Below are general Blue Screen of Death troubleshooting steps. Please reference my
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/tp/stop_error_list.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
List of Blue Screen Error Codes</a> for individual STOP code troubleshooting steps. Come back here if I don't have a troubleshooting guide for your specific STOP code or if you have no idea what your STOP code is.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some of these steps may require you to <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/f/windows-safe-mode.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
start Windows in Safe Mode</a>. If that's not possible then skip those steps.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty: </strong>Average</p>
<p><strong>Time Required: </strong>It might take you several hours to fix a Blue Screen of Death, depending on the STOP Code.</p>
<p><strong>Applies To:</strong> Any version of Windows, including <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/windows-8.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 8</a>, <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/a/windows-7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7</a>,
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windowsvista/a/windows-vista.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Vista</a>, and
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windowsxp/a/windows-xp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows XP</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's How:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The most important Blue Screen of Death troubleshooting step you can take is to ask yourself what you just did.</p>
<p>Did you just install a new program or a piece of hardware, update a driver, install an update, etc.? If so, there's a very good chance that the change you made caused the BSOD.</p>
<p>Undo the change you made and test again for the STOP Error. Depending on what change you made, some solutions might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/f/start-windows-last-known-good-configuration.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Startup using Last Known Good Configuration</a> to undo recent registry and driver changes.</li><li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/f/windows-system-restore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use System Restore</a> to undo recent system changes.</li><li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/f/roll-back-drivers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Roll Back device driver</a> to version prior to your driver update.</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Verify that a minimum amount of free space is available on your Windows partition. Blue Screens of Death and other serious issues, like data corruption, can occur if there's not enough free space on your primary
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsp/g/partition.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">partition</a> used for the Windows
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termshm/g/term_os.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">operating system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft recommends that you maintain <em>at least</em> 100MB of free space but I regularly see problems with free space that low. I usually advise Windows users to keep at least 15% of a drive's capacity free at all times.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/virus-scan-malware-scan.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Scan your computer for viruses</a>. Some viruses can cause a Blue Screen of Death, especially ones that infect the
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsm/g/masterbootrec.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">master boot record</a> (MBR) or
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsb/g/bootsector.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">boot sector</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure your virus scanning software is completely up to date and that it's configured to scan the MBR and boot sector.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/keepingupwithupdates/f/windows-updates.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apply all available Windows service packs and other updates</a>. Microsoft regularly releases
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsp/g/patch-fix.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">patches</a> and <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termss/g/servicepack.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
service packs</a> for their operating systems that may contain fixes for the cause of your BSOD.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/f/driverupdate.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers for your hardware</a>. Most Blue Screens of Death are hardware or driver related so updated drivers could fix the cause of the STOP error.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check the System and Application logs in Event Viewer (7/Vista</a> |
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XP</a>) for errors or warnings that might provide more clues on the cause of the BSOD.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Return hardware settings to default in Device Manager. Unless you have a specific reason to do so, the
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termss/g/systemresource.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system resources</a> that an individual piece of hardware is configured to use in
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsd/p/devicemanager.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a> should be set to default. Non-default hardware settings have been known to cause a Blue Screen of Death.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Return BIOS settings to their default levels. An overclocked or misconfigured <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsb/p/bios.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BIOS</a> can cause all sorts of random issues, including BSODs.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you've made several customizations to your BIOS settings and don't wish to load the default ones then at least try returning clock speed, voltage settings, and BIOS memory options to their default settings and see if that fixes
 the STOP error.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Make sure all internal cables, cards, and other components are installed and seated properly. Hardware that's not firmly in place can cause a Blue Screen of Death so try
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsr/g/reseat.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reseating</a> the following and then test for the STOP message again:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/reseat-power-cables-data-cables.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reseat all internal data and power cables</a></li><li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/reseat_memory.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reseat the memory modules</a></li><li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ss/reseat-excards.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reseat any expansion cards</a></li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Perform diagnostic tests on all hardware you're able to test. It's highly likely that the root cause of any given Blue Screen of Death is a failing piece of hardware:</p>

<li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/tp/memorytest.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Test your system memory</a></li><li><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/tp/tophddiag.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Test your hard disk drive</a></li></ul>
<p>If a test fails, <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/upgrades/f/replace-memory-replace-ram.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
replace the memory</a> or <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/upgrades/f/replace-hard-drive.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
replace the hard drive</a> as soon as possible.</p>
</li><li>
<p><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Update-Your-Computer%27s-BIOS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update your BIOS</a>. In some situations, and outdated BIOS could cause a Blue Screen of Death due to certain incompatibilities.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Start your PC with essential hardware only. A useful troubleshooting step in many situations, including BSOD issues, is to start your computer with the minimum hardware necessary to run the operating system. If your computer starts successfully it proves
 that one of the removed hardware devices was the cause of the STOP message.</p>

 i get paage not found errors ALL THE TIME then i get that STOP ERROR &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Billy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to disable hardware acceleration, Hardware acceleration is a new feature in Internet Explorer 9 that lets Internet Explorer move all graphics and text rendering from the&nbsp;CPU to the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Since you are getting BSOD while using
 IE11 disabling this feature might help to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable hardware acceleration, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Click the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;icon in the upper-right corner, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Internet Options.</strong></li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then under&nbsp;<strong>Accelerated graphics</strong>, select the
<strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering</strong> check box.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue still persists there might be issue with Video card, update the drivers and check. Follow the troubleshooting steps from this link:</p>

<h2>            Nokia E63 cannot receive UMTS &#40;3G&#41; network</h2>
                    My Nokia E63 supports 3G. But it doesn't get 3G network even if I insert 3G SIM in it. It doesn't receive 3G network even in the 3G coverage areas. I have tested it by changing network mode from 'Dual mode' to 'UMTS' but no result. It still doesn't show
 3G coverage and if I try to make a video call, it fails. It shows 'Video call is not supported by network', though there is 3G SIM in it and 3G coverage.

            With the E63 being an old obsolete model it only supports a limited number of 3G bands. If you are certain that your sim and area supports 3G then it's likely that the old phone doesn't support the 3G band in use by your network.<br />
<br />
Also back when the E63 was released in 2008 there were two models, one designed for 3G in most countries and one for the US and a few other countries so it's possible you have the wrong model for your country.<br />

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a Lumia 950 that came with Windows 10 Mobile version 1511 (TH2) build 10.0.10586.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything runs fine, I'm connected to my home Wifi (which I'm currently using to install / update store apps) and to my phone provider... but "check for updates" doesn't find anything, so I'm currently&nbsp;stuck with TH2 / 1511 / 10.0.10586.0. I'm also expecting
 the firmware update that enables "double-tap to wake" but this won't come either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to force upgrade to RS2 / Creators Update?</p>

<p>Hi Silas,</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to show global and shared contacts in the mobile devices. However, you can search the directory when sending a message out.</p>
<p>Here is a workaround: add these contacts to the personal contact one by one. Then these contacts will display in contacts of the mobile devices.</p>
<p>Also, you can submit <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273494-outlook-and-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
feedback</a> to our related team. Your providing feedback is the best way to perfect our products and services.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Zoey</p>

<p>Hi Zoey,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help! As far as I can tell, searching the directory will only show global contacts, is that correct?</p>

<p>Hi Silas,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>No. If you configure the account via Exchange Active Sync, when composing the email and searching the directory, synced contacts, phone’s built-in contacts and global address book will show up.</p>
<p>If you have any further question, please feel free to let us know.</p>

            <p>I've tried some changes which so far seem to have resolved the issue, but only time will tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the wife's PC, where she mainly just uses email and internet browsing (so little additional software to worry about), I did a clean install using the 1607 ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC, where a clean install would involve a lot more work, I've just&nbsp;done a full reset of IE 11 (tools -&gt; internet options -&gt; advanced -&gt; reset).&nbsp; In the reset I also deleted all files.&nbsp; So far, so good ....</p>

            <p>The problem has sadly returned on my PC too, but not to the same extent.&nbsp; However it's still there. So far the wife's PC has not suffered the problem at all since I did the clean install. I'm just about to do a clean install on&nbsp;our 3rd PC to see if that
 cures the problem there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On mine I've disabled all add-ons except a couple that I do use.&nbsp; One of these is Flash player (the built-in version that comes with IE 11). Its add-on is called Shockwave and I have this morning disabled it.&nbsp; It means I can't watch video clips in news web
 sites, for example, but I'm keen to see if this is actually the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any MS support engineers prepared to comment on this problem?&nbsp; There are now 7 people reporting this issue so it can't be due to the configuration of individual PCs.

            <p>I am coming to the conclusion that Adblockplus is causing the problem. Over 2 weeks ago I did a clean install on the wife's PC&nbsp;after she suffered repeated problems with IE11 freezing. Since then she's had&nbsp;no recurrence of the problem. Until yesterday, when
 she complained about the adverts and I realized I had not re-installed Adblockplus. So I did that (latest 1.5 version)&nbsp;and within an hour she had 4 failures, so I've removed it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my PC I found disabling it did not fix the problem so assumed it was not the culprit.&nbsp;Yesterday morning I completely uninstalled it. I've been having several problems a day, but since the uninstall there have been no more failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be interested to know if the other people who've reported this problem are also running Adblockplus. In which case, if you uninstall it, does the problem go away?</p>

<p>I have also been running Adblock Plus. &nbsp;Tried a disable &nbsp;which didn't help either. &nbsp;Will try uninstalling it on 2 of my pc's and see what happens. Thought maybe MS are forcing us on to Edge Browser which does actually run better on the anniversary edition
 of Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Interesting discussion. I did have this issue before the Anniversary update, but it is definitely worse since I updated my system 3 weeks ago. IE 11 "stops working" several times a day, but usually recovers itself without going down completely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have Adblockplus installed on my system so I doubt that it the full story.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have to go to "Edge" if it doesn't improve!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install last November (after Start Menu issues - which fixed those) but I have not done a clean install with the Anniversary update - and I have not had any other significant problems.</p>

<p>Do you have any other add-ins installed? It could be something in the interface has changed, and&nbsp;more than just the ABP add-in could be affected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have the problem before the AU, and not had it with the AU since ABP was uninstalled.

            Office Professional Plus 2010 is a volume license edition of Microsoft Office that large companies use to roll out to many computers. Some corporations provide Office as part of a Home Use Program, its possible your copy Office is a part of this. My suggestion
 is either to try downloading again or contacting your company about obtaining physical media.<br />

            <div>Terrible answer. If someone can manage to get to these forums, I think they can click on the message body.</div>
<div><br />
<div>tboves, I've semi-frequently had the same problem with both Hotmail and now Outlook. I only just now found a way around it, but it's still pretty ghetto:</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I first load the New Email page, I see the cursor for a moment before it's replaced by the Type Your Message Here. Obviously, when I click on there, there's no cursor and I"m unable to compose a message. I can still use the subject and address lines.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I tried reloading the page (f5), and the instant I saw the cursor in the message body window, i clicked there and spammed the keyboard. Seems it worked, and I could then delete the spammed letters and compose a message normally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems fairly easy to do. And if you fail, use the f5 hotkey to try again quickly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And I'm on Vista 64, Chrome 21.</div>

<p>That is at least pasrt of the reason.</p>
<p>Suggest you update your FF. The latest is FF 15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An alternative, if you insist on keeping FF 8.0.1, switch to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>The latest IE is IE9.</p>
<p>I use IE9&nbsp; ( Win 7 ), and i don't have the problem you are facing.</p>

<b>Shift</b> + <b>Del)</b> key, check all the boxes when <b>Delete Browsing History
</b>windows pop up. Click <b>Delete</b> and then <b>OK</b>.<br />
<br />
For other browser, please refer to this </span><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>link</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>If the issue persists, we’d like you to provide us the answers to the following questions that I have enumerated below. These will help us to investigate and eliminate the possible causes of this
 issue&nbsp;your concern:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•Is your browser updated on its latest version? if you’re not using an updated browser, some parts of Outlook might not work
 and it might not display properly.</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the issue happen when using a different computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>•Do other Outlook.com accounts encounter the same issue when using your computer?
</span></p>
<p><span>•Does the same thing happen when you access your account from the same computer with a different browser?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p></span>

<h3> kha422  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide Zeroes on Pivot Chart</h2>
                    <p>Excel 2003 ... Many records on my Pivot Table reflect a "0" value ... I am ok with this.</p>
<p>However, I wish to supress these same records from appearing on my Pivot Chart ... At present, I have many Bars (should say "no" Bars) because of the "0" value ... Not only do I wish to supress the "0" from the Chart (I can do this by revising the Chart
 Scale to .01) ... I also wish to have the record supressed ... I do not want a spot for these records on the Pivot Chart ...
</p>
<p>In other words ... I only want Bars on the Chart that are &gt;0 &amp; I do not want place holders for the records that are =0.&nbsp; Can I do this?</p>
<p>Thanks ... Kha</p>

            To clarify Ashish's suggestion, AutoFilter won't work directly in a PivotTable, you have to select the blank cell to the right of the Grand Total heading and then highlight this blank cell and the cell containing the Grand Total heading (so if Grand Total
 was in cell G4 you would highlight H4 and G4 - it is important to highlight from outside the PivotTable to inside, this tricks Excel into ignoring the PivotTable).&nbsp; When you have done that you can click on Data -&gt; Filter -&gt; AutoFilter and click the filter
 arrow beside the Grand Total heading.&nbsp; Select 'Non-blanks' if your empty row contains blanks or alternatively select 'Custom' and set the filter to display values that are greater than zero.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may filter the total column in the pivot on &gt;0.&nbsp; In Excel 2003, the way to get a filter for the totoal column is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Select the cell adjacent to the word total (last column of the pivot)</p>
<p>2. Click on the Filter icon</p>
<p>3. Filter on &gt;0 in the pivot table</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Diane. Thanks for the reply. Never knew I could set sync schedule. Just set it to 240 minutes. Another question: the sync seems to occur almost every time I send an email. Maybe it's just coincidental with the 30 minute sync setting that I found. I will
 monitor the situation.

            Are you using the g-suite sync utility? That runs on its own schedule. (240 min might be a little high too. :)) 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Another question: the sync seems to occur almost every time I send an email.
<br />It should only send outgoing mail, not check all folders. The sent folder may sync though.

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span>I too am having difficulties as&nbsp;</span><span>TL_840&nbsp;</span><span>since last week.
</span></p>
<p><span>I can log in into my account but cannot access my inbox. My wife logged into her inbox perfectly on the same computer.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>After every log-in attempt the following page appears like this:</p>
<p><em>Help us fight spam email&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>We're sorry to have to ask you to prove you're a person. Most spam comes from automated programs, which can't solve puzzles like this.&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>Enter the characters you see</em></p>
<p>I'm asked to enter captcha which I do very carefully without making a mistake. but even after putting all the characters of the captcha correctly I'm taken back to the same page and asked to do the same this has been happening since yesterday. I've tried
 logging in numerous times from different browsers but no luck.</p>
<p>The problem I have is definitely not related to Safari, or Google Chrome or Internet Explorer or Android or even to Apple OSX or Windows operating systems. Also, not related to my modem or router or PC or network.<br />
<br />
I have tried using several devices, which contain these softwares, such Mac desktop, Macbook, iPad, iPhone and Sony desktop, and still have not managed to access my hotmail account after login and get it fixed.<br />
<br />
As highlighted, my wife's outlook account does work when using the devices that contain the softwares.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hence, after all the above unsuccessful checks and trials, it seems my problem is certainly due to some "bug" in my Hotmail account, which can only be reset by someone from Microsoft Support team.<br />
<br />
I hope all the above is clear and will be grateful if you can help to fix my problem.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
John<br />

<p>Hello Jose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for getting back to me and looking into my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually found out that I could access my mailboxes on outlook.live.com. before I got your message, without clearing the cache and browsing history of the browser.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I explained in my previous communications my access problem was definitely not related to Safari, or Google Chrome or Internet Explorer or Android or even to Apple OSX or Windows operating systems. Also, not related to my modem or router or PC or network
 or any device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, I would be really, really interested why there was this access problem with my account, and why it took several weeks to fix it and what was done to fix it so I do not get subjected again to this inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again, as well as all your colleagues before who looked into my case and offering their suggestions on what to do to resolve my case.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is good to hear that you are able to login to your Outlook.com account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you were unable to access your account was an outage where Outlook.com users were affected. There was an issue with the server.

<h3> striff-74  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Lens Android Sign in loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have an Android phone running Marshmallow OS.</p>
<p>Have Office Lens installed (been using it previously on Windows mobile and Another Android Phone)</p>
<p>When I go into Settings &gt; Manage Accounts &gt; Sign In</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on the + (Add an account)</p>
<p>Type in my Outlook.com email address &gt; click Next</p>
<p>It then loads up a new page prompting me fore my Password&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enter my password and click Sign In</p>
<p>It then very quickly throws up the "Manage Accounts" page, then another pages (To fast to see what the title is)</p>
<p>Then back to the image scanning screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check in Settings, and it has not signed me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing and re-installing the app.</p>
<p>Clearing data / cache etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always the same issue.</p>
<p>This makes the app not usable as I'm unable to select which one of my OneNote books to save to, let alone the page as an example. (affects Saving to my OneDrive as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have Outlook / OneNote or any other Microsoft app that requires a login, uninstall the app or remove your account for these apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then sign up to Office Lens.</p>
<p>It must be the 1st Microsoft app that you sign in with your account.</p>
<p>It then sticks, you can then go back to Outlook / OneNote / Skype / OneDrive and sign back into these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cumbersome but works</p>

            This worked for me, if your phone is rooted or has developer options, deselect or unchecked the box of "Don't keep activities" option. I discovered this by installing One Note and it let me disable the said option/setting before I could use it. Because
 it is preventing Microsoft applications from doing its job.

    <title>Currency values in the excel sheet are not reproducing in the proper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karenpetersensuzuki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Currency values in the excel sheet are not reproducing in the proper format in my mail merge Word Document</h2>
                    I am using fields from an excel file (exported from Salesforce) to create a mail merge letter in Word, but the dollar amounts are not reproducing properly. &nbsp;I tried changing the format in the excel chart from Currency to Text and then to and manually entering
 the dollar sign and the commas, but it isn't working. &nbsp;In the Word document we are getting too many places in the decimal point ($1,769.54 is showing as 1769.5400000). &nbsp;This has to be an Excel formatting setting, right?

            <p>You got it exactly backwards. Word ignores any cell formatting that you do in Excel; you have to specify the currency formatting in the Word merge fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/formatting_word_fields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/formatting_word_fields.htm</a>&nbsp;and look at the field codes discussed under the heading "Format cash amounts to 2 decimal places".</p>

<h2>            Receiving  multiple mail loops</h2>
                    Hello-My problem is similar to those posted on this Forum. My problem is emails sent to me are sent in large numbers that the&nbsp; webmaster considers&nbsp; too large to download. I get a message that the problem could be associated with a mail loop. I am having
 my Hot mail sent to Comcast,net in case&nbsp;my Hotmail account is highjacked I will do the same for xfinitty connect.&nbsp; I need to know if this is the cause of my problem and how to correct it? If it is a security problem,I will change my PW. Thank. I am using xfinitty
 connect,IE11 and Win8.1

<h2>            Mixed Reality Portal</h2>
                    <p>I just recently updated my PC with the new Windows 10 update 1703 with the build 16281.rs_3 release with the Windows Insider Program. &nbsp;I wanted to get my pc to operate the Mixed Reality Portal, but unfortunately I don't have the proper hardware for it. &nbsp;I
 need a some kind of a graphics card that is slightly higher than mine. &nbsp;I have a EVGA NVIDIA GTX 580 and I believe I need a 620 and above and I also need a Quad core pc instead of my Dual Core. &nbsp;How can I get my pc up to date or will it cost me too much to
 do that? &nbsp;I also need a higher USB and Bluetooth support. &nbsp;Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Mixed Reality Portal is a new app that is available for users in the Windows 10 Creators Update. The app lets you place holograms in a Mixed Reality environment of Mixed Reality Portal. To assist you with your concern, here
 is the minimum hardware requirement: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Intel dual core Mobile Core i5 processor (Kaby Lake)</span></li><li><span>Intel HD Graphics 620 (DirectX 12 support required)</span></li><li><span>8GB dual channel RAM</span></li><li><span>HDMI 1.4 (2880 by 1440 @60Hz) or HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.3 (2880 by 1440 @90Hz)</span></li><li><span>100GB SSD or HDD (SSD is preferred)</span></li><li><span>USB 3.0 Type-A or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alternate Mode</span></li><li><span>Bluetooth 4.0 (for accessories)</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Keep in mind that this is the minimum required, and it should be possible to meet the performance requirements with a mix of different components. You can also easily boost the performance by switching to a dedicated GPU. Extra
 RAM is also going to help significantly. Preferring a Solid Sate Drive (SSD) over a hard drive is recommended based on the performance between the two.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
