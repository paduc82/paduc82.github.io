<h2>            Xbox one behind Meraki MX64 security Appliance STRICT NAT</h2>
                    
<p>I am having trouble getting NAT set to anything other than STRICT for XBOX ones behind a Meraki MX64 security appliance. &nbsp;All ports are already forwarded. &nbsp;I get "Your network is behind a port-symetric NAT. &nbsp;Has anyone been able
 to get this working with a Meraki MX yet?</p>

            <p>Heya cwtoz.</p>
<p>Security appliances aren't supported for network connections on the Xbox One unfortunately. Have you tried bypassing the MX64 and plugging directly into your modem to see if there's a change in your NAT type?</p>

    <title>copying mp3 files to a USB pen drive and seeing them on another device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrensmithgbr  say:</h3>
<h2>            copying mp3 files to a USB pen drive and seeing them on another device</h2>
                    
<p>I am experiencing a problem that is bugging me and wonder if anyone can help.</p>
<p>My partner and I have recently got a USB pen drive to combine all our MP3 music together so we can play it on our hifi system which&nbsp;has a USB input.</p>
<p>We both use media player to convert our CD's to 192Kb/s MP3 with copy protection disabled so it should work!</p>
<p>I have then copied all my music to it and&nbsp;my partner&nbsp;has done the same. When I plug the usb pen into our hifi or&nbsp;into another computer we see music folders but approximately 20% of the files.</p>
<p>Disk properties say that the drive has 21/32GB in use but when I look at the file properties, is says size&nbsp;4.1GB in use. I can see all of the files i copied when I plug the drive back into the&nbsp;my&nbsp;computer and my partner can see all of hers when its in her
 laptop. Is there a permissions issue that I need to work through to play all of these files?</p>
<p>The drive is formatted as FAT32, all the computers we have and our Hifi can see the full size of the disk and read it...just not all the files on it.</p>
<p>I have tried a different usb drive with the same results and&nbsp;I have also tried copying all of&nbsp;our music to one PC, we can then see all of the tracks on that&nbsp;but get exactly the same problem when we copy the files to the USB pen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can anyone offer any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks for your help</p>

<p><span>Hi darrensmithgbr,</span></p>
<p><span>Try changing the File system from FAT32 to NTFS and check if it makes any difference.</span></p>

<p>thanks for the suggestion Divya, Before I converted the stick in question, I converted a smaller&nbsp;usb drive&nbsp;( a 256MB old thing) to NTFS as i was unsure if it would work on my Hifi, went through all the convert for optimal performance, convert /fs:ntfs and
 all and then tried to read a couple of tracks but the file system is incompatible with my system so I guess that idea won't work either. It obviously has to be formatted as FAT32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks again for your help</p>

<h2>            Arc Touch Blue Tooth Mouse no longer seen by PC after Windows 10 Creator update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a grey Arc Touch Blue Tooth mouse that I've had for years.&nbsp; After the Windows 10 Creator update, the mouse is no longer discoverable.&nbsp; I've pressed the Bluetooth button on the mouse until the red/green flash occurs and have searched under Action Center
 &gt; Connect and it does not find the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the latest Windows 10 64 bit mouse and keyboard drivers, as well as tried&nbsp;<strong>Settings
</strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>
Find and fix other problems</strong> and tried both Bluetooth and Hardware and Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed the batteries on the mouse and restarted the PC several times and yet it seems Windows can not find the Microsoft Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Method 1 and 2 and there has been no resolution to the issue. &nbsp;Under Method 1, I have tried
</p>
<p>a: Settings &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Fix and Find other problems &gt; Bluetooth</p>
<p>This said "Problems found: Check Bluetooth radio status &nbsp; Fixed". &nbsp; &nbsp;However, problem persists. &nbsp;I've tried this several times and get the same answer that there is a "Check Bluetooth radio status" and that it is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: The "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center" (downloaded latest), simply says "No supported device detected".</p>

TaoTronics Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless 4.1).&nbsp; When I went to Action Center &gt; Connect I could see my Bluetooth headsets (with the word "Paired" in grey).&nbsp; When clicked on the headsets to connect a yellow warning appeared under the headset saying it could
 not connect.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I went to Bluetooth Devices &gt; Show Bluetooth devices and removed the headset.&nbsp; I then put my headset in "pairing mode" and selected "Add Bluetooth or other device".&nbsp; In the Add a device dialog I selected "Bluetooth".&nbsp; My headset
 did not appear with the warning "Make sure your device is turned on and discoverable.&nbsp; Select a device below to connect".&nbsp; As mentioned, it didn't appear.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">To make sure it was not the headset, I removed my headset from my cell phone (they were paired and I removed the pairing).&nbsp; I then placed my headset back in "pairing mode".&nbsp; My phone detected the headset and I successfully paired
 and connected the headset to the cellphone (Nexus 6p).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">In Device Manager, I see under Bluetooth 3 choices:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have right-clicked all three and selected "Update Driver" &gt; "Search automatically for updated driver software" and all three return with "The best drivers for your device are already installed".</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thus it appears I not only can not connect my Microsoft Arc Bluetooth mouse but cannot pair other Bluetooth devices but the device manager reports all Bluetooth drivers to be the latest available.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>There might be a problem with your disk, make sure its clean, and has no scratches. Another thing to try, is when it says "Connect to the EA servers" If theres a cancel button, press it. (It may be lagging you out). Another thing is try installing the game
 to your harddrive and playing it like that!</p>
<p>Hope i helped!</p>

                    I accidentally deleted files from Downloads Folder using Clean Now button (it can be found in Settings - Storage - Click on "Change how we free up space automatically". I forgot that I didn't have a back up copy of all my files in the Downloads Folder

            Hi elenjoy84
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Storage sense doesn't send the files to Recycle bin. You can try free version of Recuva to recover the file (note - it is not always successful, hence you require some luck also)

<h3> petemanufan  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Windows Media Player 12 to open Media Guide automatically plus other linked problems.</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently obtained a new computer with Windows 7 installed. All my files from my old XP computer were professionally transferred. When I open WMP the screen shows "contacting on line store" and then rapidly switches to " the requested page cannot be
 found or no longer exists". Underneath that wording is a link to <a href="http://www.windowsmedia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.windowsmedia.com</a> which when clicked takes me to the required screen.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;when clicking on "browse all on line stores" I get a screen with "Choice of online stores" and 7 lines of how this choice is only one click away but no link is provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although next to the "Help" question mark top right of screen&nbsp;is a web address of "onlinestores.metaservices.microsoft.com". Clicking on this address has no effect. I have noticed on a Google search that there is a website "<a href="http://www.metaservices.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.metaservices.microsoft.com/servicesswitching</a>"
 which does seem to get me to the onlinestores website.</p>
<p>It appears that either my WMP12 has been programmed with the wrong web addresses or there is something already in its "web address box" that is corrupting the web address it is searching for.</p>
<p>Help please as this also appears to be preventing WMP searching for a website to renew my media usage rights and is stopping me playing my legitimately downloaded tracks.</p>

<p>John, thanks but I have tried that several times. Once it hinted at a configuration problem but I assume it sorted that out itself as has&nbsp;identified nothing since.</p>
<p><strong>However Tim de Baets has just&nbsp;resolved two of my three problems. By clicking on control panel, then Region and Language and then changing the setting from United Kingdom English to United States English the media page now automatically appears. Also
 when clicking on "Browse all online stores" the page headed "Choice of online stores"&nbsp;has&nbsp;the 7 lines of script&nbsp;now also has 4 links to online&nbsp;stores on the screen.</strong></p>
<p>WMP 12 still cannot locate a page to renew my media usage rights for my previously, legitimately downloaded music but 2 out of 3 isn't too bad.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could let me know if this is how&nbsp;WMP12 should work and if Microsoft&nbsp;could provide an update,in due course,&nbsp;to allow me to revert to UK English (nothing against United States English) and also help many others who are experiencing&nbsp;similar problems.&nbsp;Any
 other ideas regarding the media usage rights?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Son&#8217;s Xbox one S mix constantly muted</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can offer some advice. My son has had his xbox one s console for one year and has been using a headset to talk to his friends as they play for around 6 months with no issue until the last month. There is constantly a mute sign beside his battery
 life whether his headset is plugged in or not. So far ive bought a new headset and a new controller but this hasn’t worked. Ive rebooted the xbox, checked audio settings and started a party but even the it says headset is not detected. Ive tried the headset
 and controllers on a friends xbox and they worked fine, even the old ones which is really annoying. I have also checked on the enforcement website and it says he has a perfect record although recieved one recent feeback rating 1 for voice, so not sure whether
 this would result in a communications ban but i cant see that he has one anyway. Ive tried to ring microsoft today and was promised someone would call back but they did’nt. Hoping someone can shed some light on this issue??</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>

<p>Hey Nina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! I see you have tried quite a bit of troubleshooting to no avail. The headset and controller work fine, and they &nbsp; were working just fine on your console up until recently. I want you to try a factory reset while keeping your games
 and apps by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>
Select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>All Settings</strong>. </li><li>
Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>. </li><li>
Select <strong>Console info &amp; updates</strong>. </li><li>
Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Make sure to have your email and password as you will be asked to sign back in to your account. Let us know if this helps! :D</p>
<p>

<p><span>J1</span> tire une bonne balle dans le torse d'un ennemi ( carabine Enry ou Evans ) puis
<span>J2</span> achève celui-ci ( pistolet GP ou Mauser ) et normalement il doit s'afficher en bas à droite de l'écran

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search, Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Now install Hide Updates Tool from this link:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/307393...</a>
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  
<br />
<br /> Type "Task Scheduler" in the search bar next to the windows icon in the lower left corner. A window will pop up.
<br />
<br /> On the left hand side, click Task Scheduler Library&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;UpdateOrchestrator. Once you click on "UpdateOrchestrator", you will see a list become populated in the center upper portion of the window.
<br />
<br />Disable "UpdateAssistant" and "UpdateAssistantCalendarRun".  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, turn back on Windows Update service,   Immediately open the Hide Updates tool to Search for Updates until it shows Version 1709 Feature Update, Hide the Update.
<br />
<br />Now you can wait until you're ready to manually run the Upgrade by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />What I would do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist there are other methods to block Windows Update here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>.   There are good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver

            My apologies. Here are step by step instructions<br /><br />Type “View Installed Updates” in the Search box and then click on View Installed Updates – Control Panel from the Search results.<br />To uninstall the unwanted update, select it from the list and then click Uninstall.<br /><br />To temporarily prevent the update from being reinstalled until an updated fix is available, a troubleshooter is available that provides a user interface for hiding and showing Windows Updates and drivers for Windows 10. You can obtain and run the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter by downloading it from the Microsoft Download Center:

            Barb<br /><br />I am sorry to hear that you have not found this advice helpful. You can try to uninstall the upgrade assistant altogether if you like. To do this please follows these steps<br /><br />Open Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Windows 10 Update Assistant <br />Select it then click Uninstall <br /><br />Open C:\ drive <br />Select the Windows10Upgrade folder <br />Then delete it

            After uninstalling the Upgrade Assistant and deleting it's folder from C, I would also immediately run the Hide Updates Tool to catch and hide the Version Upgrade before it starts installing again. This tool can be found here<br /><br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

            If you cannot do this then the only way to block the Upgrade from reappearing is to set your connection as metered to stop Windows Updates.<br /><br />I hope that this helps you. Please let me know if you need any further assitance

I was under the impression that it is only shown if the other user is offline or in status "do not disturb"/"presenting" upon me sending the message. However, I also witnessed the message as I sent an IM to a user in Status Away (I checked twice to make sure
 the user's status was "Away". Why would the user not have received the message if in status "Away".</p>
<p>Can someone explain why this happened and in what cases this message is displayed.</p>

<h2>            ClearType issue in portrait resolution &#40;1200x1920&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there any solution to use ClearType in portrait resolution? I'm using 1200x1920, and it doesn't look very good...</p>
<p>1920x1200 looks like a charm...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess it's because of the sub pixel orientation in ClearType? When I turn my screen 90º this happens... letters don't look as good... Some actually look quite bad... I've tried using ClearType tuner, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to fix this? I'll appreciate any help you could give me!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you[]</p>

<h2>            Added HDD&#39;s to WIndows 8 machine already formatted NTFS and with data on them, can&#39;t access&#33;&#33; Help&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
As the topic says, I put a couple of hard drives into my new Windows 8 computer.&nbsp; The hard drives are already formatted in NTFS format, and have files and data on them.&nbsp; These drives show up in Disk Management as being 100% free space, and have no drive letters
 associated with them.&nbsp; I can't do anything with them other than delete them, all other options are greyed out.<br />
<br />
On all other operating systems I have used, I have been able to install a hard drive, and access the files on it, if the hard drive was formatted in the same format as the operating system, and sometimes even if that is not the case.&nbsp; Is this possible with
 Windows 8.1? And if so how would I go about doing that?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; I would love to be able to access all the files on these hard drives without having to first use an external device to copy them all !!!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            OH WAIT!!! I just remembered something...<br />
<br />
these hard drives are NOT NTFS, they were EXT4 hard drives!<br />
<br />
I forgot about that.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If only Windows would be so kind as to be able to read other disk formats.&nbsp; Ahwell, I guess I just answered my own question.<br />
<br />
Disregard!&nbsp; Sorry!!! I tried to delete my post, but it won't let me.<br />

<p><span>Pool Corruption are caused due to Registry Handle Leak. This leak occurs because an application continuously reopens a registry

            Hi  jmann, yes TRIM should always be enabled on an SSD for it to function efficiently
<br />
<br />By default Windows will will manage TRIM on your SSD without any user input
<br />
<br />To check that TRIM is enabled:
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt Window and run this command:
<br />
<br />fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify
<br />
<br />If that command returns 0, trim is already enabled on your SSD
<br />
<br />If 0 is not returned, run this command to enable TRIM:
<br />
<br />fsutil behavior set DisableDeleteNotify 0

<p>There's nothing you can do. Microsoft doesn't show people any proof of the matter. If you don't cheat, Microsoft still thinks you do. Believe me, I have a lot of friends who could vouch for me and stand behind me when I say "all my achievements are 100 percent
 legit", but MS just doesn't care. That's why they lose customers and respect. So just like me and the millions of other people they can't show proof about, you have to deal with it, or quit gaming on the Xbox like I am going to do.</p>

 least you'll have a little something...<br />
<br />
To get Reset you have to use either External Software or Profile Glitching. Which was it? MS doesn't Reset Gamescore for fun nor is it random.&nbsp;

<p>I think Microsoft realizes that the people who appreciate the fact that they try to keep their service relatively cheater-free far outweigh the very few cheaters who get banned, say they will never pay again, and actually follow through on that. &nbsp;I would
 bet that the vast majority realize that they have done wrong, get over that sore butt, and pony up the cash for another Gold membership. &nbsp;When you do that, please don't cheat again.</p>

<h3> stevewild  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com account</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed microsoft. I can get into my Microsoft account (using a gmail address which is my predominate email address). I had to open a outlook email address. and got an email from the Outlook team welcoming me aboard 2 weeks ago, but never used
 it to send an email to anyone. I use outlook to connect the calendar between my computer and phone. Today i keep getting messages to supply my password to the outlook.com account for both my computer and phone to access the outlook email in the outlook app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I supply my password, I know it correct because I WROTE IT DOWN WHEN OPENED the account, but which it does not now accept.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to fill in the reset password form, and I don't have recent (or any) emails, 2nd time i submit the form I provided my credit card details, and still get the generic message from microsoft telling me they can't identify me, and how much they value
 my security. FORGETTING MY PASSWORD, NOT RECOGNISING MY CREDIT CARD&nbsp; AND KEEPING ME OUT IS NOT REASSURING ME!! I am directed to resubmit the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAVE NO OTHER INFORMATION TO PROVIDE, and no way to get a real person to reset this password.&nbsp;</p>

            I would recommend that you should contact Microsoft Windows Accounts and Billing Support to get this resolved. Use below option to reach out to Microsoft Windows Accounts and Billing Support. Here you get Live agent support not virtual agent support.
