<h2>            No pen and touch input is available for this display on HP Pavilion 15-n258nr &#40;Energy Star&#41; preinstalled with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have an HP Pavilion 15-n258nr (Energy Star) Notebook preinstalled with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The touch screen has not worked since it was taken out of the box.&nbsp; The system information states "No pen and touch input is available for this display".&nbsp; I have searched
 the forums and have checked theDevice Manager and the touch screen is not listed under Hardware and Sound.&nbsp; I have gone into pc tablet setup and the touch screen is not listed there either.&nbsp; I have just about done everything I can including Windows updates
 as well as HP updates and nothing works.&nbsp; I have tried most of the solutions suggested on the forum.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can get the touch screen to work since it is not listed in the control panel?&nbsp; Thank you.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The 4G in your slim is not really a hard drive at all, it is in fact flash memory. There are certain games that require a physical hard drive be present to use certain features of
 that game such as Halo and Black Ops for their theater modes. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You can buy the official MS brand 250Gb hard drive online and in some retail shops for less than $100USD. That would be well worth the investment.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Of course if you don't play any games that need a hard drive you could always just download them to the 4Gb and then move them to a USB flash drive. Just make sure the flash drive
 is an Xbox Compatible one. (I will provide a link below). And yes, you can re-download any of your content from the XBL servers at any time (so long as the Game Developer doesn't pull it from the servers-only affects a very small percentage of items) by going
 to your Download History under Account Management. </span></p>

<p>I'm having trouble with my USB storage device(there is a compatibility list here)

            Hi
<div>I have had an issue where my HP Pavilion G6 laptop keyboard stopped working and I couldn't log into the laptop unless I used the on screen keyboard via Ease of Access.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have been able to resolve my problem today by doing the following:</div>
<div>1. Make sure laptop is switched off</div>
<div>2. Remove battery and AC power lead</div>
<div>3. Hold power button down for 30 seconds</div>
<div>4. Replace battery and connect AC power lead and boot up</div>
<div>5. Press Esc repeatedly to access boot up options like System check etc</div>
<div>6. Keys should work like arrow keys, if so exit Set up screen and continue boot up normally&nbsp;</div>
<div>7. Keys now work</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck. This worked for me</div>

<h2>            MS Wireless Laser Mouse 6000. whenever I  try to scroll&#47;arrow bouncing backwards and forwards</h2>
                    I have a MS Wireless Laser Mouse 6000. For a while it was fantastic but now, whenever I&nbsp; try to scroll/arrow through columns of docs, pictures or Emails the items being moved together with the slider (at the side, or on the bottom) starts bouncing backwards
 and forwards and the items on view move up and down (or left and right uncontrollably. To increase the frustration, sometimes things work normally for a short while before the fun starts. When I change back to a basic mouse (USB) there are no more problems

    <title>Arial Bold 9pt - bad TTF hinting with ClearType enabled on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Arial Bold 9pt - bad TTF hinting with ClearType enabled on Windows 7 &#40;vs. Windows XP&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I've bought a new machine with Windows 7 (64-bit) and I've noticed the following rendering difference compared to my old Windows XP machine:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/lSJZx.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/lSJZx.png</a> (Appearance Settings)<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/gMVVu.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/gMVVu.png</a> (Arial/ClearType/Windows 7)<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/Hcmeb.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/Hcmeb.png</a> (Arial/ClearType/Windows XP)<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/1YXnQ.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/1YXnQ.png</a> (Arial/No font smoothing/Windows 7)<br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/5jCO1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/5jCO1.png</a> (Arial/No font smoothing/Windows XP)</p>
<p>Basically, if you compare the ClearType rendering of Arial Bold at 9pt/12px font size between Windows XP and Windows 7 you'll notice the letters 'd', 'g', 'h', 'n', 'u' appear rendered too condensed on Windows 7.&nbsp; Other letters also exhibit this behavior
 but the given ones appear worse.&nbsp; Is this a regression in Windows 7?</p>
<p>The rendering when no font smoothing is enabled appears the same on Windows 7 and Windows XP.&nbsp; It is interesting the given quirk is mostly visible with exactly 9pt Arial Bold - the italic variants appears the same on both systems.</p>
<p>I've also found the following similar post:</p>
<p>"<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7pictures/thread/a303c901-777f-4369-a6a0-04a28789aae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Arial Bold dont work on Windows 7!</a> "</p>
<p>which doesn't have an useful resolution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately none of the given resources answers my question - I have previously found and read them:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not ClearType tuning related, and I have the ClearType tuner on both the WinXP and Win7 systems;</li><li>I haven't really understood what are the <em>"Engineering Changes to ClearType in Windows 7"</em> apart from ClearType been made the default (compared to WinXP);</li><li>The <em>"Advances in typography and text rendering in Windows 7"</em> is all about new DirectWrite API and doesn't apply to GDI which seems to be used in the standard UI and in Internet Explorer 8;</li><li>The <em>"FONT PROBLEMS - Arial font Family reduced to italic and bold in Windows 7"</em> doesn't seem related at all.</li></ul>

<p>Hi,<br />
The comp I use has had a bluescreen crashing problem ever since I built it. I had windows vista installed on it for a long time and just put up with the intermittant crashes. Just a few days ago I installed windows 7 on it and just recently experienced another
 BSOD. <br />
<br />
Here is the error code:<br />
Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;1033</p>
<p>Additional information about the problem:<br />

&nbsp; C:\Users\James\AppData\Local\Temp\WER-193987-0.sysdata.xml<br />
<br />
My only idea as to why this is happening is a driver conflict error with my Win TV HVR 1600.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks</p>

<br />
Unfortunately, there's not enough info there to be able to tell you what the issue is.<br />
<br />
Please create a public share on <a href="http://skydrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://skydrive.live.com</span></a>.&nbsp; Then look in c:\windows\minidumps.&nbsp; Copy the files there to the public share you created.&nbsp; Then post the link here.<br />

What makes you suspect the TV tuner?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Ok Ive set up the account.&nbsp;I found 3 files in the minidump folder and put them in the public folder there. Here is the link:<br />

<br />
whichever one works.<br />
<br />
I only suspect the tv tuner because it's a fresh install and it has only crashed while watching tv. Although I dont claim to know anything about programing or computer code so I hope that you will be able to tell.

            Understanding what was happening at the time of the crash is often helpful in making sense of these files.<br />
<br />
Of the 3 crashes, only 1 specifically references the TV tuner driver.&nbsp; You might want to check their website to see if there's a newer version available.&nbsp; The other crashes may be caused by the tuner driver, but I don't see anything conclusive there.<br />
<br />
One of the other ones referenced memory corruption.&nbsp; That can either be caused by a bad driver, or by bad RAM.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest running the Windows Memory Diagnostic (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-Administrative-Tools" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-Administrative-Tools</a>).&nbsp; Let it make several passes.&nbsp; If that doesn't
 find any problems, let me know and I can give you some other steps to try to track down the bad driver.<br />
<br />

I am also having the exact same problem as Shawn.&nbsp; I installed Windows 7 the other day and have seen BSODs occassionally since updating from XP.&nbsp; I am not sure what is causing it.&nbsp; the last 2 times it occurred while I was running Firefox and looking at Facebook...
 I have created a live account as well and upload 4 dump files to the following folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
http://cid-6ea578345b019030.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public?uc=4<br />
<br />
If you can look at them and see if you can find what might be causing it, I'd really appreaciate it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also...I already did the memory diagnostic like you suggested to Shawn and everything came back fine.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
I see no obvious cause for the crash in the dump files you uploaded.<br />
<br />
I think the fastest way to track this down is to use a testing tool called Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
If this tool finds a problem, your machine will crash again.&nbsp; Hopefully with it enabled, it will allow us to easily identify the bad driver.<br />
<br />
Enable driver verifier<br />
1) Open an elevated command prompt<br />
2) Type "verifier /standard /all"&nbsp; (no quotes)<br />
3) Reboot your machine<br />
4) Use machine again until it crashes (hopefully this will be fast :)<br />
<br />
After the crash &amp; reboot, go into safe mode.&nbsp; <a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/323ef48f-7b93-4079-a48a-5c58eec904a11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Disable driver verifier<br />
1) Open an elevated command prompt<br />
2) Type "verifier /reset" (no quotes)<br />
3) Reboot your machine<br />
<br />
Then&nbsp;post the updated minidumps on your skydrive share.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I figured I would get an email when you posted a response, but did not.&nbsp; So I decided to check this page today.&nbsp; Glad to see you replied.&nbsp; Thanks!
<br />
<br />
I tried what you suggested.... but, windows wouldn't even boot after I enabled the driver verifier... I got a BSOD during startup and then Windows 7 tried to do an automatic repair?&nbsp; I uploaded another mini-dump file (http://cid-6ea578345b019030.skydrive.live.com/browse.aspx/.Public?uc=4),
 but I don't think it was from the start up with driver verifier enabled.&nbsp; Where can I find that data since windows didn't even fully start?<br />
<br />
Can you recommend anything else?&nbsp; Should I do something in the automatic repair area?&nbsp; It told me that it couldn't automatically repair the problem.&nbsp; I can do that whole process again and post the result file (need some help knowing where that is).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
All week I have been trying to updates some drivers and start my computer with some start up programs and some start up services disabled.&nbsp; I works a about an hour or 2 at a time and then BSOD.&nbsp; and, I usually have just been surfing the web.&nbsp; I thought it was
 my touchpad possibly, but I updated my drivers for that and it still BSOD'd. &nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know if there are any problems with an Asus laptop X83Vm-X2?&nbsp; That is the computer I'm using and it has an NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GS video adapter.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Chris - There have been some issues over the last week or two related to email alerts not working.&nbsp; (Only mentioned in the "forum support" forum, for some reason)<br />
<br />
Can you please try uploading the file again?&nbsp; Looks like it might be a corrupt dump file.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't know what automatic repair does, so I can't offer any suggestions there.<br />
<br />
Looking at some of your previous crashes, here are some of the oldest drivers that you're using.<br />

Like I said earlier, the crashes didn't point at a specific culprit.&nbsp; But I'd probably start by looking at some of the oldest drivers here first and trying to get those updated.&nbsp; For example, you mention that you updated the drivers for your touchpad.&nbsp; But
 I see the driver is still from 2007.<br />
<br />
Also, the file nvoclk64.sys is part of some package to make it easier to overclock your machine.&nbsp; You're not overclocking, are you?

<br />
I tried uploading the file again.&nbsp; see if you can look at it now.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I also found this page on Asus homepage which has some windows 7 upgrade tips (http://support.asus.com/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.aspx?SLanguage=en-us).&nbsp; I will do what it suggests there and look through the list of drivers that you suggest.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I might also just uninstall a lot of the pre-installed Asus software.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am not overclocking... I know my way around a computer (basically), but I don't even know how to do that.&nbsp; I'm using my laptop in an "out of the box configuration".
<br />
<br />
Do you know of any problems with Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite v9.1? <br />
<br />
Thanks for you help on this...<br />

<br />
<br />
My suggestions:<br />
1) If you're not overclocking, uninstall any overclocking tools.&nbsp; A quick internet search suggests that the nv drivers mentioned above might be a part of NTune.<br />
<br />
2) Since you've updated a bunch of drivers, it might be a good idea to try enabling driver verifier again per my steps above, just to see if it'll find the issue.&nbsp; And again, if it finds an issue, it'll crash (in a specific way; the crash you just posted was
 not related to verifier)<br />
<br />
3) For each of the drivers mentioned above, find the file in c:\windows\system32\drivers.&nbsp; Right click on one of the files, select properties, then go to the details or digital signatures tabs to see if you can find out which vendor they're from.&nbsp; That should
 help you figure out which device uses them, and then you can find the right drivers on the vendor's website.&nbsp; If you get stuck, please post here and we can help.<br />
<br />
Hints:&nbsp; The RTK file is probably for something from Realtek.&nbsp; The NV files are likely from Nvidia.&nbsp; The RIM files are most likely for a blackberry.&nbsp; The SN files might be related to a webcam.<br />
<br />
4) You mention that you have ZAIS installed.&nbsp; But the driver kl1.sys is a driver for a different security suite.&nbsp; Do you have 2 AV apps installed?&nbsp; If so, I'd suggest removing one of them.

            Good thing to warn people. Don't forget that all communications apps&nbsp;update togethers, so mail, messaging, people, calendar. It&nbsp;is upsetting to have things not working anymore. I guess you&nbsp;can mostly&nbsp;thank google for that. Personally I'm annoyed with google's
 attitude towards users with Microsoft products and and started&nbsp;to move away from google. moved my docs to SkyDrive, mostly use Bing search and the last thing will be to ditch Gmail, though that'll be the complicated one to do.

That's certainly true, and I'm really angry at Google for doing this. I also switched to bing when I found out they were blocking google maps for windows phone users (even though I don't have a windows phone), because I thought it was anti-competitive and a
 bit outrageous.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>That being said, I did have EAS set up with my surface before the end of January, and without warning, these mail app updates completely wiped that out. I rely quite a bit on shared google calendars for scheduling, so switching to outlook.com is not an
 option for me, and not having lock screen calendar updates for my google calendar makes my surface RT orders of magnitude less useful. The way I see it, for arbitrarily destroying my access to google EAS, and by making absolutely zero effort to integrate support
 for things like CalDav or Google Calendar API, Microsoft is every bit as anti-consumer as Google. And if that's the way the Windows Team wants to play it, I'm going to think twice before I shell out another $600+ for any Windows product.</div>

<h2>            How to edit photos without importing them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to edit pictures on my flashdrive the import box keeps popping up for me to import pictures to my computer, which then does not let me edit without importing. I do NOT want to import them. I used to be able to edit and save them back to the flashdrive.
 How can I get the import box to stop popping up?</p>

            <p>Hello seriba73,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are being prompted to import photos before editing it. I would like to clarify if the USB flash drive destination was on your included folders in Photo Gallery. If not, I suggest that you include it by following
 these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Photo Gallery and plug-in the flash drive.</p>
<p>2. Press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>3. Click <strong>Include folder</strong> and select <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Browse for the flash drive and click <strong>Include folder</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case issue persists, I would like to ask for the exact procedure you are trying to do in editing the photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

                    <p>I had to adjust the time settings on my new laptop, but I noticed something odd. Right now I'm in The Netherlands so I changed the timezone to the "right" one. Here's a screenshot of my current settings:&nbsp;https://i.gyazo.com/69924f47e903658652e60518c952747b.png&nbsp;</p>

    <title>I cannot open the Registry and Windows Explorer will not boot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I cannot open the Registry and Windows Explorer will not boot</h2>
                    Okay guys, so I restarted my computer after running some updates. I got a blue screen of death but it ended too quickly for me to get whatever data I needed from the screen. I did some research and found that I could possibly fix the Windows Explorer issue
 with some registry key files, and figured I would go ahead and look at what all is there. I attempt to open the registry editor andI get a pop-up which says that the ulib.dll is not designed to work on Windows or is not intended to run. I am at a loss as to
 what else to do now. <br />
<br />
I replaced the ulib.dll in hopes of making a change, but to no avail. Any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sterling<br />

            Hacking the registry is hardly ever the best method to fix a Windows problem. Your first step should be to perform a System Restore in order to set Windows back by a few days.

"Did not work" is wide open to interpretation, e.g.
<div>- Could not launch System Restore</div>
<div>- Could launch System Restore but there were no suitable restore points.</div>
<div>- Could launch System Restore but it failed to run to completion.</div>
<div>- System Restore ran but non of the restore points fixed the problem (how many?)</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would also be a good idea to report how far you get with Windows and what error messages you see. Saying "Windows Explorer will not boot" does not mean anything. It's the operating system that boots, not Windows Explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Did you try Safe Mode?</div>

            I restored the system to two days prior when everything worked properly. I cannot access Windows Explorer through safe mode either. The way I have been accessing the files is by opening the control panel through the task manager, and selecting a different
 location in the top bar. It is as if the explorer is partially functioning, but I cannot access my desktop or the task bar.<br />
<br />
In either regard, when I attempt to start the explorer through the task manager, it appears for a second in the processes and then disappears.<br />

            I would try one or two different Restore Points.
<div><br />
<div>To make the explorer problem more visible, I would launch it like so:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Launch the Task Manager with Ctrl+Shift+Esc</li><li>Create a new task, cmd.exe.</li><li>Type these commands in the Console window:<br />
taskkill &nbsp;/F &nbsp;/im &nbsp;explorer.exe<br />
explorer.exe</li></ol>
<div>If you believe that an update has caused your problem (or more likely: an incompatibility between some software on your machine and one of the updates) then you can remove it by following this path: Control Panel / Windows Update / Installed Updates.</div>

Google for the message "&nbsp;Windows User Profile Service failed". You will get a very large number of hits. As I do not have a miracle cure, you need to try the various suggestions yourself.

That which program does not exist? What is the verbatim error message? When did it appear? (We're working on catching a glimpse of your screen through the ether but have not been very successful to date . . .)

<h3> gauravmehta9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery Not Charging</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Single Lang. on a Dell Inspiron 15 3537.</p>
<p>The ;laptop was showing a not charging, plugged in message in the battery box.</p>
<p>I restarted and then the laptop says that it is charging but in the end nothing happens. After half an hour nothing has happened . It has stood at 45%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Dell Support Assist Battery tests and it passed.</p>
<p>There is no problem with the AC adapter as i removed battery and then was able to power on .</p>
<p>After 1 hour the battery increased to 46 %</p>
<p>All battery tests say that the battery is perfect. ( The battery is performing normally.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is with the driver as the battery is not that old either.</p>
<p>Please Help Me ASAP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<h2>            Problems installing Windows 10 Anniversary Update &#40;v. 1607&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I'm trying to install Anniversary Update in my laptop, and it becomes impossible. I did before in 2 differents PCs and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Upgrading through Windows Update. All times the process stops after first reboot (30%). I waited several hours, point cicle was moving, but the Hard Disk didn't write or read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Formatting the whole Hard Disk and using the Media Creation Tools ISO. It stops "finishing up" (just before the first reboot). I waited a long time and no Hard Disk activity was detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Formatting the whole Hard Disk, installing previous version (1511) and updating. It happened the same described in 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why I can't install the 1607 version. My laptop is a Vaio i7 (not an old one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help will be welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Now I have a clear installation of version 1511 without problems. I think all the log of the installation problem have been gone with the Hard Disk format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have selected the "Defer updates" option, so the update is not shown. I don't know why a clean install of 1607 didn't solve the problem. I tried using a USB and a DVD made using Media Creation Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others PCs was updated without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know another users with the same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your patience.</p>

</p><p>I've noticed the error code while updating 1607 is: 0x8024200D. It seems to be a common error.</p>

<p>But
 now the install stucks at 32% with this error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xC1900101 - 0x30018<br />
The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during SYSPREP operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is fully compatible (I have version 1511 without problems) but now I think version 1607 has problems with a driver. I read it can have problems with NVIDIA drivers, and I have the NVIDIA Gforce GT 740M.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the controller, but it stucks in the same % (32%).</p>

    <title>Missing Operating System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phatboy415  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Operating System</h2>
                    As soon as I turn my netbook on it goes straight to the screen with the commands &lt;F-9&gt; = change boot device order &lt;F-10&gt;... and so on. From there it goes to the splash top screen, once i click the bottom left hand button (start windows button) the next
 screen that comes up is Missing operating system. I'm not sure what to do I've tried putting Windows 7 back on the system via usb drive but when I do that it says bootmgr is missing. Can someone please help me fix this problem.

<p>Repair Boot Manager <strong>(Credit MVP JW Stuart) </strong></p>
<p>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7:<br />
<br />
a) Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot. (<strong>In your case, your USB drive)</strong><br />
<br />
b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.<br />
<br />
Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the dispay.<br />
<br />
c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”<br />
<br />
d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.<br />
<br />
e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.<br />
Note that on your Dual Boot system there now should be only one operating system listed. Click the ‘Next’ button.<br />
<br />
f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.<br />
<br />
g) At the DOS prompt type the following three commands:<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sounds like either the USB drive has a problem, or the Windows 7 installation has corrupted.</p>
<p>How to install Windows 7 on a Netbook from USB drive<br />

<br />
Can you put the USB stick into another Windows 7 computer and run this on it from an Elevated<br />

<br />
chkdsk X: /f /r<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Use this method if you have a Windows DVD (it can be a borrowed one as long as its the same<br />
32 or 64 bit as your system uses - just use your Product ID - you can copy it as they are not<br />
copy protected - the Product ID determines which version is installed).<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Best to check with a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores)<br />
or the System Maker's Support. Maybe try another USB drive. Have you tried the USB drive in another<br />
computer to see it that will boot to the device?<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Error when playing Minecraft</h2>
                    Original title: Blue Screen Error<br />
Hello. Just recently I've been getting these odd random Blue Screen Errors on my computer, and they occur only when I play Minecraft for around 10-20 minutes. After I re-boot it, this pops up after I clicked on information about what happened:

 me out on this, and I can provide some more information if needed.</div>

            0x124 is a good indication that a piece of hardware is failing on your computer. &nbsp;It is possible this is not the case, but I would take your computer in to a repair shop to verify that the hardware is working correctly.

    <title>How to disable sub-pixel anti-aliasing in cleartype for one monitor in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable sub-pixel anti-aliasing in cleartype for one monitor in a multi-monitor setup</h2>
                    <span><span>Hi.<br />
                    <span><span>Hi.<br />
I'm running two monitors on a Windows 7 system, one portrait and one landscape. I like cleartype, however as one on my monitors is running in portrait mode (rotated by 90deg) cleartype ruins text giving it a nasty afterimage (as the subpixels are now vertically
 arranged rather than horizontally)<br />
<br />
The cleartype text tuner illustrates that cleartype can have different setting on different monitors. I'd like to set my primary monitor to use the normal sub-pixel (colour based) rendering and my secondary to use the older opacity based whole-pixel anti-aliasing.<br />
<br />
Or if Windows can do cleartype based on vertically stacked sub-pixels that would be fine too.<br />
<br />
BTW I'm happy to hack the registry. I doubt the UI is capable of handling this setup.</span>

<p><span>Hello CurtisMF,</span></p>

<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried disabling this particular option in graphic card controller?</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortuanetly, you cannot disable sub-pixel anti- aliasing within windows, however you may have to change this in graphic card controller if your
 graphic drivers support this particular option. If you not find this particular option in graphic card controller, then I would suggest you to contact your manufacturer.</span></p>

<p>This "answer" from Microsoft Support&nbsp;is not helpful and misleading - first of all the original poster did not ask about disabling standard sub-pixel anti-aliasing. He is asking if ClearType could be disabled on the monitor that's running in portrait mode.
 You&nbsp;can disable ClearType for all your monitors in Control Panel &gt; Fonts &gt; Adjust ClearType text &gt; and unchecking "Turn on ClearType". This same wizard allows you to fine tune the settings independently for each monitor so it certainly seems like you should
 be able to disable it for a monitor. Secondly, what does this have to do with our graphics drivers? I can reproduce the issue using standard SVGA drivers, NVIDIA drivers or ATI drivers - none of which have any kind of settings for font anti-aliasing ClearType
 or otherwise.<br />
<br />
The ClearType registry settings are documented here:<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970267.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa970267.aspx</a><br />
<br />
I added the "PixelStructure" key to my portrait display with a value of 0 but it doesn't seem to have an effect.</p>

            I ran procmon and noticed that cttune was changing registry settings for DISPLAY2 even though my portrait monitor identifies itself as "3" - after setting pixelstructure for display2 and rebooting I now have ClearType on two monitors and standard AA on
 the 3rd! w00t :)

            I second the comment about multiple displays.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, it lets you adjust it for one display, but then it takes effect on both.&nbsp; Can someone from Microsoft clarify what registry settings control the font smoothing settings on each individual
 display?&nbsp; If I manually adjust them in the registry, do I need to log off to have them take effect?&nbsp; Can I change it to use B&amp;W font smoothing on one monitor but use LCD cleartype RGB on another monitor?

            I'm having a similar issues with ClearType Text Tuner in Windows 7 <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/how-do-i-adjust-windows-cleartype-to-render-in/ba5711ac-c4b7-4b18-a503-db9b6ac8de21">
[my request]<br />
</a><br />
It would be great if we could just turn off the sub-pixel rendering as this will enable one to have anti-aliased fonts on all displays (regardless of pixel stacking, LCD / CRT etc.)<br />
<br />
I'm really starting to believe there is a bug in ClearType Text Tuner in Windows 7; It seems that the problem lies in the fact that even though I select the grayscale rendering (the right most selection in screen 3 of 4), it still renders with sub-pixel sampling.<br />

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me mad. All I want to do is play the Forza Horizon 3 demo I have already downloaded to see if my PC can handle the game</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet I cannot do that because "I need to sign in" - I don't see why, its a demo I've already downloaded, and now thanks to faulty MS services I can't access it
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far I have -</p>
<p>
</p><p>uninstalled xbox app via PowerShell and reinstalled it, both via PowerShell and from the Microsoft Store. Neither made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to Services and changed every Xbox related service to automatic then clicked run service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked Windows for updates, I have all the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set my time in Settings to automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed my Sign in Account and re-added it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed on the MS Store, under DOwnloads &amp; Updates there is an Xbox Identity Provider app. I can't uninstall it (so I can reinstall it). I can launch it and it just sites there with the Xbox/Windows logos and 5 dots that continuously run left to right</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works. I continuously get this error. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the account, I can sign in with email &amp; password to the point where my profile pic comes up, but then when you click next it closes and goes to error page.</p>

            When this happens, you need to perform a repair upgrade:

<p>Hello I've just managed to solve this issue myself (though it took me all evening to get there)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed an app called the Xbox Identity Provider in Downloads and updates in Windows Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I launch it, it does nothing, just loads. I launch it anyway so it shows up in CCleaner under tools then I uninstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I googled Xbox Idenity Provider and found a link which launches it in Windows Store. Redownloaded the app and when I launched the Xbox App it worked finally.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator has no FONT change options&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>What person at Microsoft would think that taking away features from the latest Windows 10 Creator would be a good idea? My system was set up before this download with Menu, Icons, System fonts, and Program font options to change size and boldness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 30 in screen and I can barely read the text under my icons! This is crazy!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Someone suggested to download a program called <strong>
Winero Windows 10 Tweaks</strong>, but I don't really like 3rd party Ad-On operating on my system. Plus it was not available on Download.com so don't really trust it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you take away the best way to customize our computers??? Please bring this back in the next update!!</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>See how cool it is to change font sizes?????</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Peace,</p>

            Agree. It's like MS has set a rule that you can only have 16 options in any application, so if you add one you have to remove one somewhere else. Only explanation I can think of to explain it. They've been doing the same with the other apps. Photos also
 keeps getting new features but at the expense of existing ones.

            <p>Yes, a lot of users are giving out about this option being removed!</p>

</p><p>With regards to the text on your icons, right click an empty part of your desktop, press the Ctrl button and use the scroll button on your mouse to resize your icons and icon text to the required size . . .</p>
