    <title>How to Prevent a Chart Object on a Template from Randomly Resizing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kim hsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Prevent a Chart Object on a Template from Randomly Resizing Itself&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My supervisor recently purchased licenses of Office 365 for everyone in our office. When she made the change from Word 2007 to Word 365 on her Microsoft Surface Pro 4, she had no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our company uses Word templates for reports (".dot" files), and several of these templates have graphs ("Chart Objects") embedded within them. Previously, when trying to alter these graphs, we were able to "Stop Protection" on the template, and then double-click
 the Chart Object in order to edit the values. Doing this would select the Chart Object, as well as open a small Excel-type window in order to edit the "Data Series". When done altering the values for the chart, we could simply click outside of the Chart Object/Excel
 window, and the Chart Object would "close", we could re-protect the sheet and move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, however, when my supervisor attempts to edit one of these Chart Objects in the same fashion that she used to, the Excel window with the data series shows up as an almost microscopic box that you can barely see, let alone type into. When exiting the
 Data Series, the chart itself will suddenly blow up to twice the size it normally is!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've made sure her Windows and Word both have all of the necessary updates. Other computers in the office running Windows 8 or even Windows 7 have not had any issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance with this conundrum!</p>

<p>Good morning Allan! Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change made to the computer that seems to be causing this issue is install of the new Office/Word 365. Templates worked fine on my supervisor's computer before the update with her previous version of Word, but after updating to the new version,
 they do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have only tried the basic troubleshooting methods: rebooting the computer, making sure the copies of Office/Word are up-to-date, and reinstalling Word. We have also attempted to reconstruct the template's graphs on one of the computers where the graphs
 work (like mine), sent the template to my supervisor, and my supervisor still experiences the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched over her shoulder with this issue, and here is some further detail on how she opens the file and the issue she experiences:</p>
<p>- Regardless of whether she double-clicks the file or right-clicks and chooses "open", she experiences the issue.</p>
<p>- She enables macros, then goes to Review to unprotect the template.</p>
<p>- Regardless of whether she double-clicks the graph/"Chart Object", or right-clicks and chooses to edit, she experiences the issue.</p>
<p>- When she attempts to edit the graph, it will open the Excel data series window, but it's extremely tiny as though it's zoomed out 50% or so. The whole Excel window, not just the text!</p>
<p>- At this same time, the graph itself will resize MULTIPLE times on its own. It flashes anywhere from three to six times, changing its size larger and larger, until it finishes and is easily 5 times as large as the original graph.</p>
<p>- When she attempts to exit the data series and graph and stop editing them, the graph will EITHER stay the same giant size OR will disappear entirely.</p>
<p>- When she tries to retrieve the missing graph, or resize the oversized one, it will change into text saying "Error! Not a valid embedded object."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! Let me know if I can provide any other information! Thanks again for your assistance!</p>

<p>Thank you for the detailed reply. It is possible that some components of the latest update
<strong>Office 365 </strong>has some redundant bugs. To troubleshoot this kind of issue, we recommend repairing your Office application. To do so, kindly follow the steps indicated on this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thanks for your reply Allan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My supervisor attempted the fix you recommended, but she says as the repair was nearly complete, her screen flashed, and then her computer notified her that Office had been uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She's not keeping me in the loop very well on this, but she was obviously upset to see this message. I believe she'll be attempting to reinstall Office and hoping it keeps all of her settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this an intended or possible result of the walkthrough you linked to? Does this help indicate what the issue might be? We will see if things work for her when she reinstalls, I just wanted to reply to explain that this "fix" seems to have broken things
 even more, and my supervisor is NOT happy!!!</p>

<p>The fix is intended to repair Office applications and not necessarily uninstall it. There might may have been some other factors which could've caused that incident. Maybe a third-party application, some bugs on your supervisor's PC, or maybe a virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us when the installation of Office is finished.</p>

<h2>            Suspended Account</h2>
                    Is there anyway to lift the suspension on my Microsoft account? I am starting school in a week and there is a temporary suspension for 30 days on my account and I cannot wait that long to be able to access things other then Skype.... this is extremely
 inconvenient and while I understand the security purposes of it, the fact I have to wait 30 days seems ridiculous to me.&nbsp;

            Hello TAYLORWARD1,
<br />
<br />Im afraid you have to wait for it, but meawhile have a try to these steps:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a> and sign in to your suspended account.
<br />Enter a phone number to request a security code be sent to you via text message. This can be any phone that can receive text messages. 
<br />After the text arrives, enter the security code into the web page.
<br />Change your password to complete the unblocking process. Use the tips in Help protect your Microsoft account to create a strong password.
<br />
<br />If still not working try contacting a Microsoft Engineer:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us</a> (click talk to a person)
<br />
<br />Give a phone call ( by region)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for replying.<br />
<br />
Creating a new profile is to test whether the issue is with the profile.<br />
<br />
Hence, I suggest&nbsp;you to&nbsp;add IMAP and other two accounts to check if issue re-occurs.<br />
<br />
<span>I look forward to your reply to assist you further.<br />

Thank you.</span><br />

            <p>Thanks, John - Project for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My MS Project version is the same as you mentioned (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">14.0.7173.5000)</span>. However I have tried many ways but failed. At last i came with a solution after trying 4/5 hrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did save the file as Project 2007 file.</p>
<p>- Then opened the file and saved as 2010 file and it is OK now.</p>
<p>

    <title>Incorrect timestamp on incoming text messages on my Samsung Focus. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanoffewwords  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect timestamp on incoming text messages on my Samsung Focus.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Samsung Focus on the Rogers network. I am in the Central timezone (my time is set to automatic in settings). All of my incoming text messages are timestamped one hour in the past. All outgoing text messages, and incoming and outgoing call logs are
 timestamped correctly. I've tried setting my time to manual, different time zones, etc, but the outcome is always the same. At least the text messages are threaded correctly.</p>
<p>Rogers took a month to look into this and after being unable to figure anything out, told me that this was a manufacturer problem. Is anyone else having this issue? I'm pretty sure it's a carrier issue, not a device or OS issue as I am able to find very
 little information on it, but I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with my carrier.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to correct this on the device end? Would an app even be able to adjust something like this, or is this type of access off-limit to apps?</p>

<p>Hello AManOfFewWords,</p>
<p>Time stamps for Text messages are encoded and sent from the carriers MMSC message system.&nbsp; If the time stamp is showing up wrong, that is because it is being encoded wrong from the carriers network.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is nothing that can be done device
 side, you'll want to focus your attention on Rogers in this case.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>"Unknown File Type" Security Alert issue started after the most recent (Sept 2016) Windows 7 updates when try to open Internet shortcuts from the Favorites folder. (I do a lot of searches in this folder, so access it a lot.) Get the same message when switch

            <p>Update: &nbsp;Several others have picked up on this on other sites and three other posts in this forum and a fix has been offered that is supposed to work until you add another favorite to the folder following which they say the process must be repeated &nbsp;This
 is a variation on one attempt I made (that failed). &nbsp;In command prompt enter (two commands in sequence):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; PUSHD C:\Users\user_name\Favorites<br />
2. &nbsp; ICACLS *.URL /L /T /SETINTEGRITYLEVEL MED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your user name must be inserted, of course, and/or the path modified to your location of the favorites folder. &nbsp;I ran this and it does the job. &nbsp;I cannot yet say if adding another favorite will cause it to revert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from an uninstall of the KB or creating the alternate favorites folder, this seems to be all available to date.<br />

    <title>Problems using Report Manager in Excel 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhl1951  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems using Report Manager in Excel 2007</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am trying to use Report Manager in Excel 2007.&nbsp; My OS is Win XP.&nbsp; I actually have the report manager in the add-in but I'm not getting it to print.&nbsp; Searching this forum I found one similar post, and one problem I have is, I don't see the add-in from the
 VIEW menu in Excel 2007.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Even though I don't have RM in the view, I setup the print parameters using the Custom Views option in the ribbon.&nbsp; However, when I try to print one of those views, something entirely different prints.&nbsp; I've tried to delete all print ranges and re-try the RM
 print, but it still prints a print range which I don't want and can't seem to delete.<br />
<br />
Help is appreciated<br />

            Re response to this useless page, a sequel to dozens of other useless pages I've surfed this morning:  http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/using-the-excel-2002-report-manager-add-in-HA001034658.aspx  There's a reason people really get to hate Microsoft. When you offer a feature like Report Manager and discontinue, rename, move it, you should provide people help on where to find it. I was using it in Excel 2007 and now have upgraded to 2013 but can't find any help, anywhere on this subject - and the webs a pretty big place. And it's like Microsoft's never heard of tags, eg "report, reports, reporting, manager, settings, generate, save, saving, 2003, 2007, 2013, excel, office, etc." I don't know any programing but I do know how to name a file (including web pages) so that I and others can find the info. I do know about tags and synonyms. Even if you discontinue a feature you should make it easy for people to know this. Apple and Google won't defeat Microsoft because they're better, they'll

            You will need to modify a registry to achieve that. Download a free registry editor at www.phm.lu. Bear in mind that you do this at your own risk. Go to Hkey_current_user/ControlPanel/Sounds/SystemStart. Delete the entry in Sound.

    <title>Nokia E5 software update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ujjal784  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia E5 software update</h2>
                    My Nokia E5-00 needs latest update. I am wondering that updating the software through internet without using Nokia PC suite will cause some software error issues. Moreover i don't have Nokia PC suite installed on my device. The procedure which i am infering
 is as follows:<br />
Go to Menu&gt; Control Panel&gt; Software Update as on Nokia E5 menu style.<br />
Is the procedure for updating the phone safe? Would it cause issues such as memory reduction, startup failure etc. Once i updated my previous device after the update the phone memory had reduced and many applications failed to initiate. A fruitful reply is
 expected

            I personally never had issues to update firmware over air using my E72. But I am wondering if Nokia still offers this service today. With Nokia Suite, it seems still working.<br />
<br />
What's your currenr firmware version? Better first double check if it is really necessary to do update, especially if you already have the latest version for your product code.

<p>After a lot of reading, I decided NOT TO UPGRADE my E5. I have in my device with version 042.014, and after reading the numerous problems some users had... serious issues... so I decided that the risk is too high to do it, considering that is not a OS version
 change, are general updates for some applications like mail or Internet browser... the core seems to be the same.<br />
<br />
And I can live with that... all in my E5 works perfectly well... there are some minor bugs out there but nothing serious.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you to decide ...<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;although your judgement is welcome, to create ones decision, it would help to get references/links to concrete issues you found. Then, we can judge together if these issues outweigh the security patches which a firmware update delivers usually.</p>

<p>Updating from 042.007 to 071.003 screwed up my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot remove preinstalled software (eg. Friendster; Hi5; MySpace; Bloomberg;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battery runs out quickly even without making any calls.</p>
<p>Tried the same battery in an E5 without updated software ... it runs for days without problems (making many calls).</p>
<p>Purchased a NEW battery ... same problem in the phone with version 071.003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the battery symbol displays a black dot ... looks like rubbish ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do i reinstall the original software? (042.00x)</p>

<p>Officially, downgrading is not possible. Therefore, did you try the <a href="http://download.fds-ncom.nokia.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/NokiaSoftwareRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>Nokia Software Recovery Tool</u></a>, already? It does a reset plus a clean install of all firmware components. If that does not help, and because the latest firmware is 91, you should consider to alter your product code as well. Officially, a change of
 the produt code can be done by Nokia Care Centre only, officially.</p>

            Recover Tool sounds a bit risky based on the result of updating from 042 to 071. (will consider it as a last resort)<br />
Product code? not sure what you mean by that.<br />
Besides, we dont even have Nokia Care Centres in Sweden ... all are gone ... guess Nokia doesnt want us using their products.

<p>Well, I have no problems with that tool. Actually it is much saver as the over-the-air or the Nokia Software Updater / Nokia Suite because it is a clean, refurbish of the whole software. No old user-data can interfere. No incremental update. Product Code
 is the code printed on the label of your phone. That determines the firmware variant and that variant determines the version you get. If you do not have any Nokia Care Centres anymore, you can send-in your Nokia&nbsp;phone to Nokia Care.</p>

If so then unfortunately your phone is not an N97 mini or any other Nokia product. What you have is a Chinese made phone thats made to fool people into thinking it's a Nokia. It does not contain Nokia hardware or software.<br />

What you have is not a Nokia product, you have bought a counterfeit.<br />

No Nokia smartphone currently has dual sim capability.

            Give it a while.&nbsp; It can take a few hours for Windows Update to notice an upgrade your status from 'defer upgrades' to willing to accept.&nbsp; In the meantime, click the "Get started' and follow the directions.&nbsp; The Windows Update servers are probably running
 at 105% right now, dispensing the Fall Creator's Update, the new Insider Build and virus definition updates.&nbsp; You get it all done correctly and it'll happen.&nbsp; ;&gt;)

<p>I know the 4G limit. but like you said it should show 3.68 or thereabouts not just straight 3.00, curious as to why usable memory is not shown. My point was actually referring to running enterprise with those specs. I haven't researched but is it not possible
 that updates are failing on FCU or new insiders due to higher memory requirements now.</p>

            The video system requires a protected area of memory.&nbsp; Video data must be processed onto the video card as rapidly as possible so it is put in the protected area so that the video card can pick it up.&nbsp; The video data is dumped to the protected area without<br />
the usual checks and safeguards user data gets so as to not slow down processing unacceptably for rapid video display.&nbsp; Consequently, it must be in an area of ram not visible to user programs because the usual checks and safeguards against user programs also<br />
writing to that area are not present.&nbsp; The ram is there but if it was available to your programs your monitor would soon display garbage.

<p>Your concerns are legitimate.&nbsp; I didn't even know there was a 32 bit version of Enterprise until I read it here and went and looked to confirm it.&nbsp; It too would seem to me to be absolute borderline and on the edge of&nbsp;overloaded at 32 bit, but hey, it's<br />
Microsoft.&nbsp; ;&gt;)&nbsp;&nbsp; My guess on the missing RAM may be the new compressed RAM feature even we on 64 bit see.&nbsp; Per haps taking that and compressing static data is how they fudging Enterprise&nbsp;to run in&nbsp;32 bit ?</p>

<p>MSE can't be used as an on demand scanner. 100 mb of ram seems a lot. Do you have conflicting software such as other antimalware programs installed? Is Windows Defender turned off (uninstalled in Windows XP)?</p>

<p>MSE is not an on demand scanning solution.</p>
<p>Uninstall it and use an online scanner for on demand scanning. I assume that you have another a/v product installed along with MSE, hence the resource issue you note.</p>

<h2>            Big problem&#58; How do I view message headers in SENT emails in Outlook 2010&#63; Re Lost emails.</h2>
                    Hi all, I am having a real problem.<br />
<br />
About one in 500 emails sent by me is either not received by the sender - (not in their junk box or on their black list), or the email sent by the sender is not received by me. Neither party receives a bounce-back that the message was not delivered, so each
 assumes the other is not responding. Those are only the ones I know about.<br />
<br />
I've had contacts send me messages in linkedin saying they can't reach me!! In business that creates a real problem.<br />
<br />
There doesn't seem to be any pattern that I can determine. Sending emails back and forth to those same contacts before and after the missing email works fine.<br />
<br />
The hosting company says the only way to track down the problem is to view the message headers. I've read some other threads on this site and can view a header in my inbox (file, view, properties), but when I try that with 'sent' emails it is blank.
<br />
<br />
Hosting company says either provide headers or use another email program ie not outlook to try and identify the problem<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
1. Is it possible to view the headers in 'sent' emails and if so, how do I do that?<br />
2. Any other ideas for 'mystery' lost emails either sent or received? Obviously, unless someone lets me know I'm not responding, I have no way of knowing what is or isn't delivered.<br />
3. Why am I know getting an 'undeliverable' if the person isn't receiving the email?<br />
4. Any other ideas I'll take them!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much to anyone for helping me try and resolve this issue.<br />
<br />

Hi, thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
The problem is I am not receiving an 'undeliverable' error message. The occasional emails seem to be simply falling into a black hole. The senders are also experiencing the same problem; no 'undeliverable' email or error message or bounceback; I'm simply not
 receiving it. The sender thinks I'm not responding, and I of course am unaware of the situation.<br />
<br />
My email is a POP account.<br />
<br />
sorry typo in question #3: should read " Why am I not getting an 'undeliverable' or error message if the person isn't getting the email?<br />
<br />
I can certainly add 'deliver' receipt to my outgoing messages (would be clumsy and fill up my email box) but it wouldn't be professional to send an email to all of my contacts and post on my website that everyone should add a 'deliver' receipt because our email
 is unreliable :-)<br />
<br />
Hosting company want my headers in my 'sent' emails but there are no 'headers' that I can find.<br />
<br />
We are with a very large hosting company - same one for last 10 years - so this is a new problem with the same company.<br />
<br />
Can you help?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email is connected to a domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I view the headers in 'sent' messages? That is what my hosting company is asking me to help troubleshoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can ask for confirmed receipts but I can't ask others to do that when sending me email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
