                    I have had Skype for years with the same tlf. number. I have resently payed for new 1 year period&nbsp; regarding my Skype number and after that every thing looks fine, only no one can call my Skype number. No matter where I look I find no way to get in contact
 with Skype support og Microsoft support. Only virtuel agents and this community. How is it possible to get a problem solved when it is impossible to contact support eather by mail or phone

<p>Could be a problem with the disc. Is the disc in good condition? </p>
<p>Or, if you have it installed, maybe uninstall it and play it from the disc and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Sorry, thats all I have. Hope you find a solution. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is something I never thought of...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only setting for the CPU Fan would be in your Bios... Mine is under the Hardware Tab...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if there would be a setting to force the shutdown or not.... I'm not sure it would be a good idea to do it though... it is hard to say what type of heat damage might happen... Maybe none, but it is hard to say...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A better solution might be to keep it from getting that hot to start with...</p>
<p>Maybe a external fan or tray with fans to sit it on... Probably not what you want to hear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you could just prop it up a little to allow better airflow...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 installation on custom built PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> memecrisps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installation on custom built PC</h2>
                    <p>So I recently built my PC and I booted it up first time and text appeared onscreen telling me to hit Delete or F11 to enter the BIOS. After that message it told me something about my memory/ storage and gave me the option to look over the parts installed
 or enter the bios. Not knowing what to do I put in the USB for Windows 10 and nothing appeared onscreen so I turned off my PC and turned it back on. Now nothing appears onscreen and the monitor can't detect any input. I tried switching monitor cables and checking
 my own cables and it still isn't showing anything onscreen, however the fans are spinning</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Also, the PC won't turn off unless I hold the power button for a few seconds or turn off the power supply.</p>

            The OS is registered to the hardware. You should use your own login to access the device. Does it have the previous owners login and are you using that or had the previous owner removed his login details.

I'll do some research on how to reinstall. Will I need to buy Win 10 discs from some store such as Best Buy, or can I get them from Microsoft?&nbsp; Thank you for your help!&nbsp; I'm 71 and still learning about computers.&nbsp; I'm sort of like the fellow with a fancy car;
 as long as it starts, all is ok, but don't ask me to do more that put gas in the tank! :o)

<p>
</p><p>If you want to transfer Windows from one computer to another, is this a retail copy of Windows or an OEM copy? If it's an OEM copy, you may not do this.</p>

<h2>            Skype status keeps reverting to Active</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since installing the latest version of Skype (8.28.0.41) on my Mac (High Sierra 10.13.6), my Skype status - Invisible - automatically reverts to Active whenever I log out and log back into Mac OS, or when the computer goes into sleep mode and I wake it up
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my status to remain Invisible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or is this behaviour intended? &nbsp;Either way, is there a way to prevent the status from changing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Hello  rabbit<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such as lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning the classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to

<p>Hello Forsythia.&nbsp; Could you try the following please and post back if it helped or not:<br />
<br />
<b>Solution 1: Clear your System Cache.<br />
</b></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-xbox-live-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing your Xbox 360 system Cache</a>&nbsp;and restarting your console.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Solution 2: Clear your Marketplace system cache</b></p>
<p>The Xbox 360 console also stores temporary files for Xbox LIVE Marketplace. Clearing the Marketplace cache may fix this problem. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, go to <b>Settings</b>, then select <b>System</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Storage</b> and then select your primary storage device. </li><li>Select <b>System Items</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Marketplace System Data</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Delete</b>. </li><li>Restart your console. </li></ol>

<p>I only have this problem with this profile, other profiles on my 360 don't have this problem. And it only happens at the main screen. When I enter the Marketplace (through the Guide button), the tabs appear just fine.</p>

<h2>            No internet after security update</h2>
                    The Anniversary update killed my internet connection, so I reverted back to version1511. Everything was fine for a month. Then KB3201860 downloaded, and it's the same mess. I've gone through the "fix network connections" doc--- no success. I'm still on
 version1511. Do I have to go back to Windows7? I'm really sick of spending hours trying to fix what should not have been broken.

            <p>I'd already done all of that, after the Anniversary update, and after this latest one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after nothing worked there or via the telephone support, I went to the Microsoft store. &nbsp;We don't know exactly what worked, but the technician uninstalled my Zone Alarm Firewall and a couple of other old programs I no longer use (WinSCP and a work-related
 one) and used ADWClear to clean out adware. &nbsp;After that, the problem was solved. (He did some other tweaking, not sure what.) &nbsp; So, some other program was interfering with the update software. &nbsp;(Note: It was not AVG, which kept running.) &nbsp;I haven't yet re-tried
 the Anniversary update, but the Flash update went through smoothly and did not interrupt service.</p>
<p>So - shout out to the guys at the Mall of America store.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Was your problem that you were stuck in Airplane Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happened to me, nothing would fix it - <strong>until </strong>I pressed the Airplane Mode toggle on my keyboard. It shares a key with "PrtScr", &amp; the Fn key must held to access it. It is a broadcast tower with sound waves showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The toggles in Action Center &amp; at "START, Settings, Network &amp; Internet, Airplane Mode" would not work to undo Airplane Mode when set that way. Otherwise, they do work. (It wasn't always like that.)</p>

            <p>No, this didn't work they're still in the photo gallery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to delete the files in my photo folder in my personal files, which is where&nbsp;these were but they did NOT end up getting deleted from the photo gallery on the "new Windows 8".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed when I go into my documents file and go to my libraries and then try to open the Pictures Library (which has 6.41KB in it) that it won't let me open the folder - it does nothing, no message, nothing. When I hit&nbsp;Properties&nbsp;in the drop down screen
 it&nbsp;is says "Properties for this item not available."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It use to be in my old Windows OP System (which was XP not Windows 7 btw) that you just went into your documents opened the "My Pictures" file you could EASILY delete, edit, do whatever with your photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "new Windows 8" application for Photos apparently captures these photos loads them and then won't let you delete them - even if you are to sole administrator or user on your computer. It gives you a message that says "Make sure another app isn't using
 this file and you&nbsp;have permission to delete it"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your solution did NOT work... Windows 8 Photos locks these files.... great feature (NOT).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would happen if I deleted the entire app? Will I lose those photos from my PC? Are those photos being stored in a cloud or somewhere elsewhere they will still end up existing?? I would like to be able to PERMANENTLY delete these (and any subsequent)
 photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You've got some kind of "bug" in the Photos app that obviously needs some fixing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry if I am being rude, not meant for you personally... just for the "new Windows 8" - nowhere near as intuitive of easily functional as my old XP - it looks prettier though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer... and good luck.</p>

            You can try refreshing the Picture Gallery. I hate the gallery since it causes too much clutter with too many folders. You can set up Libraries instead by choosing which folders to include. Try setting up the Pictures Library and choose the folders yourself.
 Skip the gallery. Check Help in the Gallery to see what you might do. Backup all your photos by copying to external media before making any changes such as removing gallery or deleting folders.&nbsp;

    <title>Odd Windows 10 GUI Boot Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murraychristopherson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd Windows 10 GUI Boot Bug</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing strange behavior when booting into Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC was built for Windows 7, and after I upgraded to Windows 10, I noticed during the boot cycle, the boot GUI for Windows 10 was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, the motherboard's BIOS boot GUI would show, followed by the Windows 10 boot GUI, re-using the BIOS boot GUI image, but obviously animating the spinning dots/throbber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what it should look like:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWIXlSXqWI</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what it does look like (apologies for potato quality):</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWDlASl5AlU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>MSI Z97 PC Mate (MS-7850), and it's BIOS is fully up-to-date</p>
<p>QuadCore Intel Core i5-4590, 3600 MHz (36 x 100)</p>
<p>EVGA e-GeForce GTX 760</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I should also mention, as a workaround, if I turn off the BIOS POST GUI, the Windows 10 boot GUI works fine. I can continue doing this workaround, but I'm interested if this can be fixed instead.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download themes Microsoft Solitaire collection with error code 107</h2>
                    <p>Problem with MS Solitaire collection, I have no problem playing, logging in or connecting to the Xbox app but when I try to download the solitaire card themes I receive the 107 error, I've turned off my Norton firewall &amp; everything else which could possibly
 be preventing connection but it still fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strange thing is that I downloaded them when I first set up the new laptop &amp; nothing has changed apart from Windows updates.</p>
<p>Is there anything else to try?</p>
<p>I have already uninstalled &amp; reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original titles: Solitaire can't download themes.</p>

<h3> sillyrachel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble connecting to LG Cinebeam &#40;PH550&#41; projector from Surface Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have a small LG projector (Cinebeam PH550) that I wanted to connect to wirelessly for presentations and I cannot seem to get my Surface laptop and the projector to "talk".&nbsp; When I follow the steps to connect the two devices, the laptop is able to detect
 the projector and attempts to connect.&nbsp; The projector first says "connection" and then "signal detection" before I finally get an error code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1) to update all network adapter drivers.</p>
<p>2) to change the resolution to match the resolution of the projector</p>
<p>3) changing the channel settings on the projector.</p>
<p>4) changing the display settings (duplicate, extend, etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to successfully connect the projector to my HP Elitebook8470p without problem but that is not the laptop that I travel with so I need to either resolve this problem or find a small, wireless projector that is compatible with the Surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>I am afraid to tell you that there is no option to remove your profile picture. On the other hand, I suggest you change it to a random one. The steps on how you can do so can be found on this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA3571/how-do-i-change-my-profile-picture-in-skype?q=change+profile+picture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How

<h2>            I need to talk to the enforcement team</h2>
                    <p>MY&nbsp;CASE&nbsp;NUMBER&nbsp;IS [<strong>mod removed</strong>]</p>
<p>Hello, My name is Dylan and I was banned. The reason they banned me is because I was purposely "CHEATING" but that is not the case!</p>
<p>I was playing Black Ops 2 on the Xbox 360 and went on to matchmaking. It joined right away. It was a modded lobby and I wouldn't let me leave. It gave me everything unlocked and ruined my stats. It kicked me from the game after.</p>
<p>I was annoyed about this so I reset my stats on black ops 2 so I wasn't accused of cheating.</p>
<p>I try to play the next day but I said on my 360. this account wont be able to sign in until the 18th of jan. I was really annoyed.
</p>
<p>Later I try to go on to my Xbox One and I cant go on any multiplayer games or join parties. All because of some guy with mods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I DID NOT TRY TO JOIN ON PURPOSE&nbsp;THE MATCHMAKING PUT ME IN THE SESSION</p>
<p>THANK YOU </p>

                    <p>I am the administrator for my personal machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of another issue I was trying to solve, I attempted to create another user account. However, when I logged into the PC for the first time as this new user, the Task Bar would not display the application icons;&nbsp; There was merely blank space or the
 blank white piece of paper looking icon. The Start button and everything else on the Task Bar will not respond. The Windows Key will also not open Start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I clicked on one the blank paper icons or an empty space where an Icon should be, I got an error message saying "Explorer.EXE: Class not registered" . I attempted the fix suggested at the following link:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">I have tried rebooting several times, but this hasn't changed anything. I was going to simply "Remove" the account, however this doesn't appear under the Settings menu; only "change account type" and "block" are options. It's as

<h2>            Does Microsoft not help customers using their computers without being connected to their organization&#39;s network&#63;</h2>
                    I purchased Windows 10 Edu with my university' email account. My CD Key is XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX (I'll tell you my CD key if you agent privately email me and ask for verification). I tried to get a support from an agent in Microsoft Korea. However,
 he asked if where I am currently using the Windows, and I said I'm using it on a laptop. Then he said I am only supposed to use this Windows within my university's "physical" network, and even if I belong to the university I am not supposed to use this Windows
 without being physically connected to my university's campus network IP. However, I don't understand the logic of this agent. First, some employees can use Windows only offline without using internet. According to what the agent says, people not using Windows
 with an internet connection to the company's network are not eligible to get Windows support. Secondly, some people can use Windows installed on their company's or university's laptop and use it during business travel or re

            <p>The agent is clearly clueless. What I think the agent is misunderstanding is whether you are using a Windows 10 Enterprise or Windows 10 Education.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Enterprise sometimes might utilize KMS volume activation, which requires that you authenticate on your University's network either by logging into a Windows Server domain or VPN.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of Windows 10 Education this is not required since its similar to a retail license. Whats strange, normal Internet activation should activate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help confirm the channel license, please do the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>Enter the following:</p>
<strong>
<p>Licensingdiag.exe -report %userprofile%\desktop\report.txt -log %userprofile%\desktop\repfiles.cab</p>
</strong>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>Copy and paste the results in a reply to this thread for further analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try chat support again and properly explain your license and indicate its Windows 10 Education (not Enterprise).

<h2>            iCloud extension for firefox already enabled</h2>
                    I'm just setting up the options for bookmarks in iCloud and the extension for Firefox is installed but when I apply the change after including the FF bookmarks I get a message that says the extension needs to be downloaded.

<p><span>Just watched the latest trailer for Black Ops 2,it looks like we will be getting a riot shield that works.</span></p>
<p><span>From the trailer you will be able to plant the shield (like Gears of War)and shoot you weapon from behind it at last i might get some kills with it rather than being cannon fodder</span></p>

<p>If its half as good as the Mw3 one you will just walk around the side and shoot,but seriously they will have considered how to get around a corner camper,maybe the stun/electrical grenade will shock you long enough to sort them out</p>

<p>I stop people from doing that with the plethora of equipment that the TA games give you in bundles as oppsed to the IW games that make you choose.&nbsp; I will be happy to introduce these types, as I always have, to a noob tube or RPG where appropriate.&nbsp; But
 the best has got to be the tried and true "flip the C4 over the top" move.&nbsp; My fav.</p>
