<h2>            Customising sound in Windows 10.</h2>
                    Why can't I put a custom wav file sound into System Sounds in Win10? I want my own email notification and 10 won't do it.

            <p>You can insert the excel spreadsheet into OneNote. To do so, go to Insert &gt; Attach File, or Insert &gt; File Printout and choose the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can print the spreadsheet and choose Send to OneNote printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using OneNote 2013, it also has Insert &gt; Spreadsheet, which inserts it as a live preview, which updates as you update the sheet.</p>

<h2>            Problem with MS Word 2008 - styles - too much space</h2>
                    I have had this problem with MS Word 2008 in the past and got the right answer here.&nbsp;I saved that answer and have followed it each time I have had to reinstall Word 2008.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This week I reformatted the hard drive on my White iMac and on my Intel iMac and reinstalled Word 2008. I have followed the instructions, or thought I did:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Format&gt;Style&gt; Click on Modify.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then Click Add to Template, click on Format - Choose Paragraph - change the spacing to 0. Click OK, OK, APPLY.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It worked without a hitch on one computer and today I went to perform this action and it's stuck on TIMES 14 point - in other words it is perfect as long as I stay on 14 point Times. If I make the font 16 or 12 or any other size there is a huge line space
 again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't have the instructions with me (it's my office computer) and I am wondering - I might have clicked Format/paragraph etc. THEN Add to Template. If I do that sequence is that wrong and perhaps that's why it's not working on all font sizes? &nbsp;But it
 IS working on 14 font size. &nbsp;Is there any way to reset to the way it initially was and start over or can I fix this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />

            Are you actually referring to Line Spacing - The amount o space between the lines of the same paragraph? If so, the Space Before/After have no effect on that. Those settings control the amount of additional space added between paragraphs in addition to
 the amount called for by the line spacing specified.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you may have the Line Spacing set to something other than Single, such as Exactly ___ . That would keep the line spacing from adjusting when you change font size. Reset the Line Spacing to Single.<br />
<br />
If that isn't the solution you'll need to be more clear about the problem.<br />
<br />
When you modify a style it makes no difference what order you change the settings. Any changes go into effect when you OK out of the dialog.<br />
<br />

Bob J.<br />

            Thank you, Bob J.
<div><br />
<div>Sorry to be confusing - yes, I meant the spacing before/after.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Except for 14 pt Times, which is my default font, every time I hit ENTER to make a new line in any other font it is using that 10 pt before/after, even though when I go in to check the settings it still shows it is 0 pt for each.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, it's my work computer and I will have to check into this again tomorrow. I can do screen captures if that helps. But I am pretty sure line spacing it still on single.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the info that it doesn't matter about the order as long as I hit OK, which I do.</div>

            Ok, I am at the computer in question. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The line spacing is definitely set at single.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>OK - FORMAT &gt; STYLE &gt; &nbsp;Next window shows Styles: &nbsp;Default Paragraph Font - No List - No Spacing - Normal - Table Normal in the top lefthand corner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>List: &nbsp;Styles in use</div>
<div><br />
<div>Font: (Default) Times, 14 pt, Left, Line spacing: single, Widow/Orphan control</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click on MODIFY:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Properties: Name - Normal - that is the only slot available to change something in</div>
<div><br />
<div>Formatting: &nbsp;Times - 14</div>
<div><br />
<div>Font: - same thing as last window.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click on ADD TO TEMPLATE - then click on FORMAT drop down menu and pick PARAGRAPH.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The next window - PARAGRAPH:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Alignment - left. &nbsp;Outline Level: Body text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Indentation - left and right 0.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Spacing - Before shows 0 pt. After shows 0 pt. &nbsp;Click on OK, OK, APPLY.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go back to my document. All is fine as long as I keep 14 pt. Change font to 16 pt - huge space before and after. &nbsp;Type a word, hit ENTER and there's a huge gap - like double spacing. SELECT ALL and change font back to 14 pt and the spacing between lines
 is fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>

            Hi Judie - I'm afraid that's the case... This new forum construction makes it very difficult for anyone to follow up on prior postings, especially if the thread is dormant for a few days. Now that you're back, there are a few questions &amp; tests.<br />
<br />
Does this happen in <span style="font-style: italic">all</span> documents or just a certain one?<br />
<br />
Was the document created on a different computer? Using a different version of Word?<br />
<br />
Is Office 2008 fully updated? Version 12.3.0 is the current build.<br />
<br />
Do you see the same thing happen if you hold Shift while you log in, then launch Word?<br />
<br />
If you hold the Shift key while you launch Word does the same behavior occur in a new document?<br />
<br />
If you run Word in a different User Account does the behavior persist?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Bob J.<br />

            Answers to above questions:
<div><br />
<div>It happens in all NEW documents I create. I have a ton of old documents from my old computer and when I open them they retain the formatting and I can change sizes of fonts with no problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not sure about Office 2008 being fully updated. I think I tried and it would not let me update. I believe I have version 12.0.0.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I held the shift key down and opened a new document it didn't even open with my default settings - and it was doing the same thing, not retaining the line spacing as it should.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I haven't tried it on a different user account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was tinkering around with it the other day, though, and I've come up with a work-around. When I change fonts and it leaves those huge gaps I go into Format&gt;Paragraph&gt; and I just set the spacing for EXACTLY the font size I'm using and that works. It's
 a pain, but at least it works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's not imperative to fix it at this point. It's annoying but I can live with it. Thanks for all your help!</div>

            Hi, Judie,<br />
I have had the same problem in the past, and I have realized that there is a very simple solution to it. If you go up to the "Format" tab at the top of your window and select "Paragraph" (it is the second option down, right underneath "Font"), a separate window
 will pop up with some options. Under this first tab, labeled "Indents and Spacing", there are two categories: Indents and Spacing, respectively. Directly beneath the "Spacing" section, there will be two input value options, the first titled "Before", and the
 second titled "After". Set both of them to "0 pt", without the quotation marks, and then hit the "OK" button. That will solve the problem, but only on the current document. As of right now, I am working on figuring out how to set the defaults in this version
 of Microsoft Word so that the spacing between lines will automatically be 0 pt.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps, and please let us know if you have any more questions or need any clarification on the answers provided.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />

<div>Unfortunately, setting them to 0 doesn't even work. I have to make them EXACTLY a font size or they just have tons of space all over.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been working like this for well over a year and it's working for me. I don't want to reinstall everything but I'm thinking I might one day. I also bought a new version of Office 2008 for Mac Home and Student which I'm going to install from scratch
 one of these days.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you ever figure anything out I'd be willing to give it a try. :)</div>

    <title>SD memory cards in Nokia 6230i - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ford_prefect---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            SD memory cards in Nokia 6230i</h2>
                    Hi Folks,<br />
Has anybody tried using an SD card instead of an MMC card?<br />
SD cards are cheaper for the same capacity but the Nokia phone manual says only use MMC "because SD cards are a different size"!<br />
This is not true, they are exactly the same size and in all my other devices they are interchangeable.<br />
Anyone tried it?<br />
Regards.

            The size of MMC and SD card is the same when you only look at length and width.<br />
<br />
But there is one difference: Thickness<br />
SD is 2.1 mm<br />
MMC is 1.4 mm<br />
<br />
This means you can't insert SD cards in the 6230i (because it has MMC card slot), but you can insert MMC cards in your other devices (because they have SD card slot).

            <b>G'day Brian,</b>
<div><br />
<div>In order to get Hotmail to to sync properly with Microsoft&nbsp;Outlook you need to install the
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Hotmail Connector</a> installed. After you have that installed you should be able to set your messages and&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;as your default and see your appointments that are stored in Hotmail.</div>
<div><br />
<div><u>However</u>&nbsp;you can't sync your calender to one account (.pst or profile), so if your asking to have&nbsp;separate&nbsp;calendars&nbsp;on one system, that is not possible in the current versions of Outlook. If you need help configuring your Outlook account with your

<h2>            Planner - task multiple assigment works but emails only report 1st assignee</h2>
                    <p>Planner now allows us to assign a task to multiple assignees (this is great), but the email that goes out to the associated planner distribution list (group) only shows the first person. &nbsp;Example if 1 assign a task to 5 people in one go, I get 5 emails but
 all say task assign to person 1 (not person 2, person 3 etc...) - is there a way around this?</p>

    <title>OneNote Maximum Number of Shares - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#91;&#93;sarah wilson&#91;&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Maximum Number of Shares</h2>
                    <p>I have a OneNote notebook that I created to share with a large group - approximately 50 people for now, but it could grow. I first tried sending an invite to the entire distribution list at once. OneNote gave me an error stating that I could only send to
 20 people at a time and to remove some addresses from the list. I did that, and was able to send an invite to the 20 people. Then Microsoft locked out my account for suspicious behavior. I dealt with that and got logged back in. I was able to send invites
 to another 6 people individually, and now it's telling me that there are too many recipients anytime I try to share with even just a single account. This is all very annoying. MS online support was pretty useless so I am hoping to find some answers here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a maximum number of email addresses that you can share a notebook with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Has anyone dealt with this 'too many recipients' issue and know how to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is there a better solution out there for sharing notebooks with large groups? I'm not impressed with this experience and am happy to look at another app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra details in case it helps:</p>
<p>- Purchased Office 2016 and installed on Windows 10, not using O365.</p>
<p>- Getting the same error whether I use the desktop application or OneNote online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you connected to a private network?</li><li>Are you sharing your notebook as <strong>Can edit</strong> or <strong>Can view</strong> access?</li><li>Have you tried using the <strong>Sharing Link</strong>?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong> <strong>Link</strong> is useful for sharing with large groups of people, or when you don't know the email addresses of everyone you want to share with. To get the
<strong>Sharing</strong> <strong>Link</strong> for your notebook, click <strong>File</strong> &gt;
<strong>Share</strong> &gt; <strong>Get a Sharing </strong>and then <strong>Create Link</strong>. You can either generate a
<strong>View Link</strong> or <strong>Edit Link</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can share your notebook with as many people as you want. The access permissions are not managed by OneNote, rather by the file system, SharePoint or OneDrive depending on where it is stored.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using my private home wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sharing as Can Edit, however the few people that did get their invites were not actually able to edit, so something seems broken with that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the sharing link and it did not work according to my recipients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using OneNote online and the installed application, as mentioned. I am not sure what other troubleshooting steps to try here, so please advise. Clearly, there is a bug somewhere. Are there local logs that I can look at? Are there server side logs
 that can be lined up with my attempts to send? The product is not working in the resilient, always available, no upper limit way that it is proposed to support.</p>

    <title>Passing a named range to a formula from a vlookup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Passing a named range to a formula from a vlookup</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to have a named range be passed to an index/match formula so that the range queried is actually a named range.</p>
<p>=INDEX(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,2),MATCH($B2,VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,2),0),MATCH($I7,VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,3),0))</p>
<p>The vlookup is querying the below table:</p>
<p>Worksheet Table &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Head</p>
<p>01 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN01Data FN01Head</p>
<p>02 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN02Data FN02Head</p>
<p>03 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN03Data FN03Head &nbsp;</p>
<p>26 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN26Data FN26Head &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where M3 is the value to be match in the define range whereby FN01???? is in worksheetA, FN02???? is in worksheetB and FN03???? is in worksheetC.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong or is it at all possible by formula?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>

<p>Biff,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding so quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the formula would now look like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,2)),MATCH($B2,INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,2)),0),</p>
<p>MATCH($I7,INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,3)),0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is now returning a #na while the previous returned a #Value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Kevin</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ok, the MATCH function lookup_array MUST be a 1 dimensional array (a single row or column).</p>
<p>I guess that complicates things even more!</p>
<p>So, you'd have to wrap the INDRECT inside an INDEX function and tell it what column of the named range to use.</p>
<p>MATCH($B2,INDEX(INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$V$27,2)),0,1),0)</p>
<p>In the above we're using column 1 as the lookup_array in the MATCH function from the named range being returned by VLOOKUP.</p>

<p>Biff,</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help. &nbsp;It worked after a tweek to have new named ranges for the IDColums. &nbsp;So the formula looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=INDEX(INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$W$27,3)),MATCH($B$2,INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$W$27,2)),0),</p>
<p>MATCH($I7,INDIRECT(VLOOKUP($M$3,$T$2:$W$27,4)),0))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the queried ranges table now looks like this:</p>
<p>Worksheet IDColums Table &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Head</p>
<p>01 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN01IDNS FN01Data FN01Head</p>
<p>02 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN02IDNS FN02Data FN02Head</p>
<p>03 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN03IDNS FN03Data FN03Head</p>
<p>26 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FN26IDNS FN26Data FN26Head</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5800 usb modem driver &#40;windows xp&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got myself a 5800 and installed the latest version of PC Suite (7.1.26.1) and it finds the phone and what not. What doesn't work thou' is the usb modem. In the device manager windows states that Nokia 5800 XpressMusic USB Modem and CDC Comms Interface
 isn't installed properly. When I manually try to install them it fails complaining about an error in the INI-file.</p>
<p>I did see a INI-file in the Software and driver section for my phone but that did nothing. I also tried uninstalling the Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver integrated in PC Suite and installed the stand alone version, with the same result as above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do I get windows to install the modem driver for my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>OpEx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. If the only advice you have is uninstall PC Suite, use the cleaner, and reinstall. Don't waste your time. I need constructive solutions. DS.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a fix for this yet? I have the same problem - both running XP sp3 and Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>It worked fine with previous version (6.?) of Nokia PC Suite, failing after installation of &nbsp; 7.1.30.9.</p>
<p>I have now re-installed the&nbsp; Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Bluetooth Modem and this works (but much slower, as expected).</p>
<p>Strangely this shows up as duplicate in the control panel list :&nbsp; "Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Bluetooth Modem #2" but there is only this one in the PC Suite&nbsp; One Touch Access dialog.</p>

<p>I contacted Nokia Support and promptly received helpful email (extract below) suggesting uninstall and re-install.&nbsp; Wasn't too optimistic as installing that started the problem, but it did fix it :-)&nbsp; .&nbsp; I skipped rebooting the phone but used the rest of
 these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address your concern, let us first reboot your phone. This is a temporary measure as it acts to refresh its memory. The steps are:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Turn the phone off.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Remove the battery, SIM card and memory card for at least 15 minutes.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Reassemble and turn the phone on.<br />
<br />
Then, let us remove all Nokia components from the PC and reinstall Nokia PC Suite. Here is a guide for you:<br />
<br />
Please uninstall all existing Nokia components (in the following order) and restart the PC prior to installing the latest Nokia PC Suite:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Nokia Connectivity Solutions (if applicable)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Nokia PC Suite<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Other Nokia Components<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• On the PC, click:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panels &gt; Add/Remove Program (if Windows XP and older is used).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Start &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panels &gt; Programs And Features (if Windows Vista is used).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Scroll down the list of programs, select a Nokia component and press ‘Remove’.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Repeat the steps above for all remaining Nokia components.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Restart the PC.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Open 'C:/My Computer/Program Files' and delete the 'Nokia' folder (if available).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Open 'C:/My Computer/Program Files/Common Files' and delete the 'Nokia' folder (if available).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup &gt; C: Drive<br />
<br />
To clean the PC:<br />
(Only applicable if Nokia PC Suite version 6.83 and above was previously installed)<br />

<p>I had this issue and have just fixed it without any reinstalls etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to device manager and find the cdc and usb modem failed device installs, right click on them and update the drivers, choose install from a specific location, tick include this location in the search and in the box paste</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Nokia\Nokia PC Suite 7\Inf</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go through the process and voila it works, repeat for both the failed device installs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that works for you, let me know?</p>

<p>I shared the same sentiments with you.</p>
<p>What I did is to have both OS(xp and vista) installed on my laptop. If I want to connect to the internet using my N5800 as modem, I choose Vista. If I work with with some softwares which were not compatible or been rejected by Vista , I choose XP. You can
 install xp and vista in different drives.eg: C: XP ana D: Vista.</p>

    <title>Microsoft edge is slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantsheppard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft edge is slow</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;think the ads on webpages are a big part of the problem. The ads need to load which uses a lot of memory.&nbsp;The last ten years the number of ads on webpages have increased significantly. Outlook.com for example runs so slow because of these ads. When i log
 in it takes a few seconds for the ads to load,&nbsp;before they load&nbsp;its fine but as soon as the ads load it starts getting slow. It also randomly freezes!&nbsp;What frustrates me is that we dont have control over these ads. You cant turn them off! I understand that
 the ads pay for a lot of services that we customers use but why do companies need to be so aggressive with their ads? I dont want to be tracked but there's no control over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: Today i tried to log into my email account on chrome, i got a prompt from microsoft saying: I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MUST&nbsp;</span>enable/allow cookies for me to be able to use the service! WHAT? Like i said no control! Cookies track you're every move on the internet so companies can provide us with tailored ads. I didn't ask for that!
 Did you? So why must i enable cookies? I dont want companies to decide for me! All i want is to use my email account without the ads. Now, like i said before, i understand ads pay for a lot of services that we use but if you gonna use ads make sure they work
 properly with the services you provide. This the internet today people, companies want to know everything about ya. My only question is, why? Even if they know everything about us, what's the benefit? If i dont want to buy a product i wont buy it! No matter
 how appealing the product looks, no matter the price or discount or even getting it for free i wont buy it simply because i dont want it!!! So companies can track me all they want its not gonna work! If i want something ill go out and buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an option:&nbsp;Charge a small fee for email services so you can eliminate the use of ads on those services. The companies that provide these services get their money, we the users dont get to see ads anymore, everybody's happy!</p>
<p>I doubt that will ever happen but i thought&nbsp;it would be a good idea to mention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try this: Go to you're bank's website, usually you land on the login page where you have to log in first in order to proceed.
</p>
<p>You dont have to log in, but the page is ad free! i just want you to see the difference between a site without ads and one with. Because there are no ads the bank login page will load quickly! Now go to outlook.com or a similar site with ads. Did you notice
 the difference? It takes way longer for the page to load fully!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft, for a company of you're magnitude, you maintain a poor attitude!</p>

    <title>N8&#58; System error popup during power-on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> apodida  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8&#58; System error popup during power-on</h2>
                    
<p>Each time I turn on my N8, I get a popup "System error" and an "OK" button; nothing else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some sort of log, where I could find out what sort of System error I'm dealing with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, if I get nothing else out of this discussion, could you change that "OK" button to "Bummer", please.</p>
<p>It most definitely is <u>not</u> "OK"... and at least I could get a smile out of a "Bummer" button. :smileyhappy:</p>

<p>Unfortunately not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try rebooting your phone by pressing and holding the power button for at least 8 secs until the phone vibrates 3 times in quick succession. If this does not help, remove any sim and memory cards and try powering up your phone again. If none of the above
 works and your phone still refuses to power up then you may have to consider hard resetting your phone which will unfortunately mean losing all your data unless you have a previous backup.</p>

<p>Rebooted (with 8-second "Off") and the error came back.</p>
<p>Removed the SIM and repeated; the error came back.</p>
<p>There was no SDHC card in the slot (I bought the phone used). Maybe this is the source of the error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 2Gb SDHC card from my previous phone, Should I try that in the memory slot? It has nothing of value on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have nothing of value on the N8 that I cannot recover from my PC, so a "Hard Reset" is OK at this juncture. I presume this is a "Factory Reset", as documented in the user guide?</p>

<p>Mine also works after the "System Error" popup. Strangely, if I close the popup quickly enough, another one pops up, until about 3 seconds have elapsed. So far, my record number of popups is four. It's a sort of game that I play whilst I'm waiting for the
 phone to turn into something useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will the Nokia OVI software be able to re-install the Anna level of the OS that I currently have? I'm thinking about the availability of the Anna code, rather than the physical ability to install it. The problem started when an installation of Belle failed,
 so I'm a bit leery about trying another system install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm starting to think that I've stumbled on a universal law: "There's no mobile phone that won't annoy you sooner or later"</p>

<p>I fixed it:</p>
<p>-first connect your phone with the charger connected to the external socket.</p>
<p>-press the power button for 8 seconds till u feel 3 vibrates.</p>
<p>-after that turn ur phone ON by pressing the power button</p>
<p>-This bug will definately be removed now...:D</p>
<p>reply me ur observations best of Luck</p>
<p>Dont forget that charger part....</p>
<p>i know u must have tried it without charger...</p>

                    I really have been quite disturbed with the slowness of Edge due to Ad Pop Ups.I am to the point of using Google or Mozilla.Is there a way of using Edge without the ad pop ups and a way of getting rid of them

    <title>Open .pwi file in Ms Office 2010 64bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivanr53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open .pwi file in Ms Office 2010 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I wonder if Ms has a solution for opening .pwi files in Ms Office 2010 64bit?</p>
<p>The system - OS Windows 7 Pro 64bit running Ms office 2010 Pro 64bit.</p>
<p>The result;</p>
<p>1) WDMC can no longer be used to Sync Notes,calender, tasks and contacts between WM 6.5 device.</p>
<p>2) WDMC does not convert&nbsp;files like Active Sync used to do on 32bit systems on Win XP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the long way around by "Copy and Paste" of .pwi Notes into Ms Word on the WM 6.5 device but would prefer a more direct route on the PC system.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Unfortunately Word is not designed to handle .pwi files, so the work around mentioned by you should work.</p>
<p>In case if you have Works installed on the system, it should be able to read the information from the .pwi files and then convert to .doc files.</p>

<h2>            No network connection after upgrading to Mojave &#40;MacOS 10.14.5&#41;</h2>
                    Upgraded to Mojave 10.14.5. Upon launching Outlook, received a "No network connection" error. So, did a complete uninstall of Office 365 per directions found here in support (trashing all supporting files/folders) and then did a fresh install of Office
 365 for business. But still receive same "No network connection" when launching Outlook. I do however have have complete network connections and can go anywhere on the internet and mount local servers and connect to various other machines on the network, so
 I have network connections. I can even login via web browser to Office365.com and check my email there so I know my login works but I really need to be able to use Outlook if at all possible. I've checked my network setting in System Preferences and everything
 looks good, no firewall settings or proxies preventing connections.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0110635-51b9-4048-8310-f01f94086f1b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0110635-51b9-4048-8310-f01f94086f1b?upload=true" /></a>

            I read through the link and tried several of the options that others had success with and I had partial success with one option. If I boot into safe mode I can get Outlook to connect and work normally. However, I can ONLY get it to connect in safe mode
 which is not really a viable alternative as safe mode is not a normal working mode on a mac. When booting normally, I still cannot get Outlook to connect. Any more suggestions?

<p>Hi Donny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>MacOS safe mode is a way that starts your Mac with only required kernel extensions and default font. You can see this KB from Apple for more:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-hk/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use safe mode to isolate issues
 with your Mac</a>. It has instructions for the case that issues go away in safe mode but come back in normal mode:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-hk/HT201262#issue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">If an issue doesn't happen in safe mode</a></p>

<p>Hi Chad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It indicates that it’s an Outlook client issue. We’d like to suggest the following information to troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-Outlook-e-mail-profiles-9073a8ac-c3d6-421d-b5b9-fcedff7642fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new Outlook profile</a> and then set up a test account with less email in the new profile (help reduces the synchronization
 time). </p>
<p>If there’s no issue with the test account, it indicates that the profile and Outlook is fine. The issue could be related to the previous profile where the affected account is set. We suggest you set up the affected account in the new profile and wait for
 the completion of the email synchronization. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persist with the test account, there’s could be something with the Outlook client.
</p>
<p>a. <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Repair Office from Control</a>.</p>
<p>b. Use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=36852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool</a> to analyze the potential Office issues.
</p>
<p>c. If the account is an Office 365 online account, we have a tool named <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SaRA</a> that can do a great job with the Outlook issue. You can give it a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

<p>Hi Chad,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean that the issue occurs with the test account in the new profile either?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there many emails in the Inbox folder?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, if the SaRA cannot resolve the issue, we can see the error message. Was there an error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s your detailed Outlook version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>
        </p>

    <title>Activesync doesn&#39;t sync contacts on Android - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig9pct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activesync doesn&#39;t sync contacts on Android</h2>
                    I use Exchange ActiveSync on my Android phone to sync email, calendar and contacts.<br />
<br />
The email and calendar sync properly, but the contacts don't sync.&nbsp; I have deleted the account from the phone and set up again several times.
<br />
<br />
I know this is a known bug, and I know that Moderators have been making adjustments on the failing accounts, usually fixing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you make the adjustment on my account.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hello, I have the same problem but the above steps do not help. My issue is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was a former OneNote user a long time ago and now I need a powerful tool to manage my projects so I downloaded a fresh copy on my Mac, signed in and created a personal and a work notebooks. I can see these notebooks in OneDrive but those are empty. The
 app won't sync the contents to OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating all of the steps above and also creating a new Notebook, dragging all the sections and content to that and syncing. Nothing. I have important work info there which I must absolutely not lose and being able to work on the notebooks across
 different devices is the main reason I chose OneNote in the first place. Having all my notes in one device is not practical for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello, this issue has been resolved for me now - I went a little crazy and deleted all the notebooks in the drive, then created new ones in the online version of OneNote then opened those in the app on my mac and finally I am able to sync then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is convoluted but that was before your reply and it seems to have worked so I am happy enough. I am still dumbfounded as to what could have caused the problem. Thank you!</p>
