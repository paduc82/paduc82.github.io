                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am having an issue where a BSOD appears multiple times a day. &nbsp;When I placed the minidump file in BlueScreenView, it showed the bug check string as PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No recent hardware revisions, the computer is Win 7 with SP1 and latest updates. &nbsp;I tried system restore to a configuration before the crashes started happening, but no luck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could someone take a look at the minidump file? &nbsp;I've shared it below:</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check was 50 CAUSE ntkrnlmp.exe which is a Windows component which<br />
means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 50, {fffffa800a343000, 0, fffff80002c8fac0, 0}<br />
Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt! ?? ::FNODOBFM::`string'+4514f )<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x50_nt!_??_::FNODOBFM::_string_+4514f<br />
BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_0x50_nt!_??_::FNODOBFM::_string_+4514f<br />
<br />
Since there was no specific help in the minidump you will need to take a broard yet
<br />
systematic approach to troubleshooting the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known<br />
issues. Update the <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the
<strong>major on-board and separate<br />
device drivers.</strong> Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without<br />
Dump in their names (see driver update methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly.&nbsp;Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all
<br />
errors such as the tiny speed differences between memory modules that appear to be
<br />
identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations<br />
and patterns (see the memory test methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Norton/Symantec may be involved in the issue.<br />
<br />
First check for RootKits using TDSSKiller.exe.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS
<br />
ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the<br />
name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean
<br />
you should not check with the other methods below.<br />
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684</span></a><br />
<br />
If no RootKits are found uninstall Norton/Sysmantec as a test. Uninstall it the run the Norton<br />
Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use MSE while testing.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible)<br />
- actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Use ALL the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />

<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and<br />
memory when you get to those sections and then return back to the trouble-<br />
shooter as needed.<br />

<strong>Bug Check 0x50: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA <br />
<br />
</strong>The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code </strong></p>
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA Parameters</strong> </p>

<p>If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE_STRING)
<strong>KiBugCheckDriver</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Cause </strong></p>
<p>Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><strong>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</strong> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied
 by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</strong> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your
 computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</strong> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.
</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</strong> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between
 the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.</p>
<p>Remarks </p>
<p>Typically, this address is in freed memory or is simply invalid.</p>
<p>This cannot be protected by a <strong>try - except</strong> handler -- it can only be protected by a probe.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

    <title>HDMI crackling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfc tyler  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI crackling</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone, well I recently got a new tv and when I attempt to play xbox the tv audio is making a weird crackling sound when certain tones and sounds are played, if I use my original (non HD) componet cable, the audio works perfectly. Ive also tested
 it on my TV downstairs and the audio was fine. I then tried using another HDMI cable but no dice, if anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it. ( Also sorry if this is the wrong forum)</p>

Also, maybe the hdmi input on your tv is defective even though it's new. Try the steps in the link as well as the other links there to see if you can find a solution. Good luck. Keep us updated.</p>

<p>Alright well I've tried different settings but still. A few more details on the matter is that I've exchanged the tv for another of the same model so I dont think its a defect in the TV. &nbsp;I've adjusted TV settings as well as console but just cant seem to
 find a solution. Maybe its the model of tv or the cable?</p>

<p>Try any other device with an hdmi port on the same tv you are having problems on to see if it works. A dvd player or cable box will do fine. If you can rule out the port on the tv as a problem, then you have a good starting point.</p>

<p>Tyler, I've been having an issue that seems extremely similar since the update a few weeks ago. I tried all 3 HDMI ports on my TV and went back to component this morning. I'd blame the cable if the audio problem were constant, not intermittent. It happens
 on mine about every 20 minutes and last for about 2 minutes.</p>

<h2>            photo gallery can&#39;t open this picture or video. this file is not supported or don&#39;t have the latest updates to photo gallery</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP computer with windows 8. </p>
<p>I previously had no problem with this, &nbsp;but now I do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go into Google Chrome and log into a Holiday company&nbsp;website. Then I try to see a video clip but the video does not work . There is then a link for play video in external player and this used to bring up a box&nbsp;to play the video.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it says do you want to open or save 587.asx (125 bytes) from media.thomson.co.uk
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I open ... then a pop up box titled&nbsp;&nbsp; 587 -&nbsp;Windows live photo gallery</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>says ......photo gallery can't open this picture or video. this file is not supported or don't have the latest updates to photo gallery
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clue as to what to do to get this video to play like it did before.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Nikola</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have recently (via a usb stick) downloaded a home&nbsp;video that someone else took. This plays and I hear sound but no picture... so don't know if this related to this problem???????</p>

            <p>Hi Nikola,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you able to play online videos when you access other websites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try accessing the website using Internet Explorer desktop version to check if you face the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>If you are again redirected to a link for an external player then try using Windows Media Player and check if it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check if there is any pending update related to Windows Live Photo gallery in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update</a>. If yes, install the updates and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post with the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I am able to go onto you tube and access videos or if I go onto the BBC/Daily Mail&nbsp;website I am able to access the videos.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my desktop the only access to internet I have is google chrome (i.e the icon is on the bar at the
</p>
<p>bottom of the screen along with a file symbol and hp symbol) &nbsp;not sure If I did that or it was there when&nbsp;I bought it?? &nbsp;and it does the same thing on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you are going have to talk me through how to gain access to Windows Player?? I may already be doing it without knowing the actual names.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3 . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently bought a programme to update drivers etc on my computer through windows ( as having that problem where a video I have downloaded from A USB stick plays sound all oK and the bar shows the video playing, &nbsp;but I have no picture. (which still does
 not work after purchasing the driver update) I recently looked to see if there were any updates on Windows media (as long as I was looking in the right place so maybe you can give me instructions for this also?)</p>

<p>OK like I say I am a bit stupid...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;lots of different&nbsp;tiles on my front screen. I have one that says videos and one that says photos. Is the photos&nbsp;tile that same as &nbsp; windows live photo gallery?? If not what is the windows live photo gallery?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have an&nbsp;'e' tile on my front screen with all my other tiles but when I click on it nothing happens??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press Windows Key + R&nbsp; and type in iexplore.exe it comes up with <a href="http://news.uk.msn.com/video-clips/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://news.uk.msn.com/video-clips/</a>&nbsp;on one tab and&nbsp;on the 2nd&nbsp;tab &nbsp;(which it automatically opens)&nbsp;it just says&nbsp;MSN.&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets me look at lifestyle, sport , money, video, trending now etc. When I click on videos it just starts playing videos of today's
 news? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have downloaded my own personal video that I am also having problems with. That I can only hear sound and no picture &nbsp;this video is saved&nbsp;to my desk top... When I right click the options that come up are... open up with iTunes, Photos, Video and Windows
 Live Movie Maker. Windows Media Player does not come up as an option. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live movie maker plays the video as I&nbsp;can see the minutes and bar move&nbsp;but no sound
</p>
<p>or picture? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my front screen there is a video tile. When I click it goes to personal videos. It is also here but this is where I can play the video with sound but no picture</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to clarify at the moment I have 2 issues </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Not able to play the videos from Thomson Holidays to show the hotel (even though I seem to be able to see videos from Daily Mail Newspaper and other websites OK</p>
<p>2. I have downloaded a personal video which plays sound and no picture</p>

            <p>OK just a last update to the reply I just posted. Just went back onto my front screen with the 'tiles' and clicked on the 'e' Internet Explorer again and it does come up with the MSN where again I can click lifestyle, news etc etc. (Funnily enough it will
 only do this when I am not typing here, whereas I can open all the other tiles?)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never use this 'e'&nbsp;tile as I have saved Google and have a tile named Google which I always go to as didn't like the MSN page.

            <p>Another Update... Just inserted a SD Card for photos and video taken on my camera as I wanted to download these onto my photos tile. . When I did insert the memory card the top right hand said to import to Windows Live Photo Gallery. &nbsp;I have downloaded and
 it has downloaded the videos and these play ok. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These videos and photos are only on my' Photo' tile on my front screen and not in the video tile which is OK but just saying.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You might be facing this issue since you are trying to open an .asx file. This format file is used to stream media files. From what you have described in your first post, it appears that the computer is trying to open the
 file with Windows live photo gallery. The Windows live photo gallery is Microsoft application that is specially designed to view photos. So this application might not support the .asx file format. So, I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>First, I would suggest you to open Internet Explorer by pressing Windows key +R and then typing
<b>iexplore.exe</b>. You may be taken to MSN website directly as this website is set as the homepage for Internet Explorer by default. Now type the website address for the holiday company website in the address bar. I have attached a screenshot showing the
 address bar.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now, check if you are able to view the videos in the website. If it doesn’t play, click on the link to view the video in the external player. If it prompts you to open or save a file as earlier, click save and choose a location
 where you want to save the file. By default the location would be the “downloads” folder. Once you have saved the file, open the folder where the file is saved, right click on that file and select “open with” and then choose “Windows Media Player”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are unable to view Windows Media player, click on the “more options” button at the bottom and then check if you are able to select Windows Media player. Now, check if you are able to view the video.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>You have also mentioned that you are not able to view some of the personal videos that you have saved in the desktop. If you are not getting an option to open these files with Windows Media player when you right click on
 them, then you can open Windows Media player first and then browse and open these files from within Windows Media player. Refer to these steps:</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>a)</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>In the front screen/ start screen, type Windows Media player.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>b)</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>You will see the Windows Media player tile in the search results in the left panel.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>c)</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>Click on Windows Media player tile to open it.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>d)</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>Once you have opened Windows Media player, press the control key (Ctrl) and O key simultaneously.</font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Auto rotate still on when Type Cover attached on Surface Pro 6</h2>
                    <p>When my Type Cover is attached to my Surface Pro 6, the display still rotates if the device is rotated even though the rotation lock is turned on. Is there any way to fix this? I've tried doing a fresh install of my system and the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have the Type Cover removed and I lock the display in portrait orientation and then reattach the Type Cover, the display will still be in portrait orientation instead of switching to landscape.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 CFU - Constant headache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atta ullah asmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 CFU - Constant headache</h2>
                    <p>So I got a new Dell Vostro machine which came with Windows 10 Pro Education ver 1609. I was forced to update to Creators; Fall Update, after which I was welcomed with glitching apps. I rolled back and did a normal update using Media Creation Tool; still
 the same results. Then AGAIN rolled back and tried updating via Update Assistant; still the goddamn glitches. I was not able to open apps directly from their tiles, rather I had to SEARCH for them, then open it. But it was a pain in the ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast Forward 2 weeks, I updated my Windows. Now, for some reason, the Microsoft Store was back. Apart from that, now the Weather, Groove Music and Xbox app are glitching hard time. As a regular music listener, I struggle to open Groove. I have to go to Store,
 search for 'Groove' and open it from there. Same is the case for other apps. When open, they don't show up in taskbar. Their tiles are glitched out in Start menu. These apps are showing up in 'Apps' section in Settings. I've tried resetting them(repair option
 is not available), nothing happens. I'm attaching some screenshots. Please help me out.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ff0663c-8deb-4807-8aab-9b6b42baa225?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1ff0663c-8deb-4807-8aab-9b6b42baa225?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" multiple times
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

[/quote]Me too.&nbsp; The way they all come running at you in a full blown sprint in the L4D games really takes the zombie effect out of it.&nbsp; Zombies are supposed to be slow, not competing for track records.

<p>No you weren't. "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows home folder location" means you're running Linux on Windows. What you're after is Ubuntu Bash Shell on Windows 10. Be clear next time.</p>

</p><p>The Windows version of the Bash shell doesn't support relocating the home directory to my knowledge. From memory Ubuntu runs in usermode, so it doesn't have the full fledged functionality of Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A workaround to your problem is symlink the home directories to the other volume and move the data across.</p>

            <p>To be clear... "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows" is a much clearer representation than your "Ubuntu Bash Shell on Windows 10", even the redundancy of "Bash Shell" reduces your clarity since the name (BASH) is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would want to be wary of using workarounds this early in the beta process. You may want to check the various feedback resources for implementations and submit any ideas for consideration.</p>

            <p>No problem. :-)</p>
<p>If you want, you can also run an "X" server (as Xming) on Windows and run an X apps
</p>
<p>when you export the DISPLAY variable like this :</p>
<p>
</p><p>export DISPLAY=":0"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then,&nbsp;you can run gedit (instead of vim ;) ) or any other "X" apps you like and "see" them on your Windows desktop.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1803 Network Don&#39;t see other computers</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 10, version 1803 none of the other computers on the network can show in network except on computer that is acting as the server iot can see all the other computers when you access the network from Windows explorer.. I know that
 home groups have been removed. Each computer can still see their mapped network drives but no new drives can be mapped. Everything worked ok before window updated. all computers have been updated to version 1803. Because of this a printer on one of the computers
 cannot be shared. it has been set to share printer. This computer printer is connected using a USB cable. Also all security settings are same as before. The Server can print to the shared printer. Other network printer shows up ok.

<p>Your profile setting are probably set to not allow user content. Go to Xbox.com, then sign in and click "My Account" and then click "View Profile" and then "Privacy and Online Settings" Then go to "Custom" and scroll down to "Member Content" and chose "Everyone".
 Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Unable to boot to Windows 10 after an unfinished update.</h2>
                    <p>I hope that somebody can help me here because the problem might be quite complex.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was downloading an update for windows 10 which was successful. The problem occurred when it was being installed, if you don't know what i mean it's the stage where you're told not to turn off your PC. How ironic is it that that's exactly what happened.
 There was a power cut in the middle of the installation. The power cut happened during the restart, and that's all that was shown on the screen. . . "Restarting" . . . and BOOM, a power cut.</p>
<p>I thought that it wasn't the problem because the installation had finished although the "Restarting" was on the screen for a while. The update that was being installed is as following: ---&gt;2018-07 Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems
 (KB4100347)&lt;---. The reason I know this is because i figured that my laptop hasn't been updated with the same update, so I opened it up for the sole reason to see which update was in the installation progress before the power cut on my PC . Now when i try
 to boot to Windows the Diagnosing your PC starts running and later fails.</p>
<p>I have the Windows installation media which is in DVD form. I tried to refresh my PC While keeping my files, but upon opening it says that a problem has occurred despite having enough of those. I tried a lot of different ways to boot to Windows using the
 command prompt but with no success. I just need to point out that i have a lot of important files on my hard drive and that clean installation is not an option. Another thing is that i have two hard drives in my PC. One has the "Unusable Windows 10" and the
 other Kali Linux. I think I'm a pretty smart guy so feel free to get Technical. The thing is, I just can't find a way to solve this problem alone which is the exact reason I'm here. I will give you all the information necessary to solve this problem if i can.
 OOOOoooooo Yeah. . .One more thing, I am running windows 10 Home. With all that said, somebody please for the love of God, HELP ME !</p>

            Hi, Thank you for the reply. I am running check disk /f /x currently. So far I'm on a stage 4 where it's looking for bad clusters in user file data. I think think it's completely useless and it's ETA is 4:33:11. But i did see a mention of a roll back to
 previous version. Which just throws me an error that something went wrong. I will keep looking for further solutions but I'm just letting you know where I'm currently standing. I just don't know why I can't preform the roll back.

<h2>            blue screen and stop error 0x00000024 on when SLave drive is plugged in USB port</h2>
                    A few weeks ago the family laptop computer blue screened (running XP) and ever since has not be functioning, keep blue screening on boot up. Have tried every thing including recovery from disk, but system keeps blue screening. So to get the data off the
 drive, I removed the laptop hard drive put a jumper across pins to&nbsp;configure&nbsp;it as a&nbsp;slave and placed that drive into an IDE hard drive enclosure. Now I&nbsp;took a spare hard drive running XP placed that into the laptop and booted the machine and everything works
 find with the spare until I connect the external "Slave" drive. It recognizes the drive and start to read it then I get the blue screen again. I have tried safe mode as well same result once the "slave drive" is plugged ino tthe USB port the computer bule
 screens. Is there anything that can be done?

            Sounds like the disk is bad. I'm not sure if this will help but you could try to place the jumpers on both the master and the slave to CS.&nbsp; If you find the disc is bad, Bitfender has a rescue program which you can download to a cd disc and run and recover
 your files on the corrupt hard drive. The program is downloaded as an ISO image and must be burned to a disc using an ISO image burning software. I use CDBurnerXp for this. It is completely free.

Once loaded
 there is an instruction leaflet on the desktop on how to use the software to recover files. The disc operates on a Linux system so Windows will not load hopefully preventing the BSOD.<br />

            Thank you for the advice. It would have been my next step but prior to me reading your post I tried a linux program "Knoppix" that allowed me to boot my computer from a CD and the Linux environment seems to be immune to whatever is causing the blue screen.
 I can have my corrupted hard drive connected anf the system does not crash and more importantly&nbsp;I am able to see all the files on my system ( i mount the drive to the linux environment)and pull them off the hard drive.
<br />
<br />
My next step is to rebuild the drive once I have all the data stored on another external drive...<br />
<br />
Thanks again...

            You are welcome. I am glad you were able to recover your files atleast. Reformatting is no big deal until you can't get all your files then it becomes a head ache. Good luck!

<h2>            Windows 10 Randomely Doesn&#39;t Recognize My Password</h2>
                    Since upgrading my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10, Windows 10 randomly refuses to recognize my password.&nbsp; Sometimes it works on the first try, sometimes the second or third. I am certain this is not an input error. I can fix it by restarting my Surface.&nbsp;
 Has anyone else seen this issue?&nbsp; If so, are there any known fixes? Thanks.

<p>You bought the computer from Dell, correct? Is the sound system the one that came with the computer? You should have been given a driver CD along with the re-installation CD, among others.</p>
<p>Contact Dell and have them send you another driver CD.</p>

</span>The troubleshooting guide in Logitech tells me that my camera is already in use, but I have made sure that Skype is not active at that time.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Networked PC&#39;s are no longer viewable in File Explorer Network after the Win 10 Update 1511.</h2>
                    <div>After the 1511 Win 10 Update, I have a problem with viewing my two&nbsp;networked computers. Both PC's run Windows 10 Pro and are in the same workgroup.&nbsp; Before the 1511 update, all was great with my private network. After the update, the computers were no
 longer viewable in the File Explorer Network. I tried changing the computer names to all uppercase to no avail. Finally, I removed the numbers from one PC's name which did nothing. I tried many things and rebooted too many times to no avail. I have uninstalled
 and reinstalled the network adapters; MS Client for MS Services and File and Print Sharing on both PCs. I have restarted my router multiple times.
</div>

<div style="text-align: left">
<p>What I have now is PC1's File Explorer Network shows PC 2's Public Folders which are accessible, but File Explorer Network does not display PC1, see attached picture.&nbsp;
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6e3c61a-7d6f-4040-ab29-1dc504f897b5" /></p>
<p>If I change PC1 to the default workgroup, &nbsp;WORKGROUP; then it appears under File Explorer Network like PC2's shown in the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC2's File Explorer Network shows both PC1 and PC2 under Network, see attached picture. I noticed that PC1's Network and Sharing Center has Network 2, but PC2's is Network, see attached picture. This worked prior to the 1511 Update.

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's the Network and Sharing&nbsp;Center&nbsp;for both PCs:</p>
<p>PC1</p>

            Thanks for the reply. Both PCs are in the default workgroup, WORKGROUP. I tried the suggested
<p><span><strong>netsh advfirewall reset, </strong>but it did not fix the issue. I use a local account for both PCs; therefore no Ms account login. As a work-a-round, I can map the invisible PC so I can access the Public folders.

</p><p>I wasn't aware of the net view problem.&nbsp; I only had it in my VM and it only&nbsp;was fixed by the service changes you mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW I also noticed both lltdsvc and devquerybroker were stopped* so I tried starting them too but they immediately stop?&nbsp; Still

<p>
</p><p>So you can now do&nbsp; net view ?&nbsp; That's all that was promised.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I'm into that "protocols are missing'' thing right now.&nbsp; The troubleshooter is really obnoxious.&nbsp; When I try to open its Network Diagnostics Log for some reason that opens with the full path in an IE Address bar.&nbsp; Copy that and try to open it in Windows
 Explorer and get "File not found".&nbsp;&nbsp; But that's a lie because if you back off enough of the path eventually you will discover that you're not authorized to go that deep that fast.&nbsp; So now I can try to look at it with NetMon.&nbsp; Whoopie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this is after KB3120677 so whatever that does (undocumented, of course) it didn't help me get my Homegroup working but&nbsp; net view&nbsp; is still working just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Can’t Connect to Networked Computers</span>
<ul>
<li><span>I can see my Bros Computer but Cannot Connect to it</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Get Windows Login asking for Network Credentials</span></li></ul>

</li><li><span>Ping shows that my Bros PC does see my PC</span></li><li><span>Worked fine till: Windows Update, Router Update, Unlimited Internet Update.</span></li></ul>
<p>When I woke up this morn after TS'ing the problem all night, the problem seemed to be fixed... for all of 5 minutes! As soon as my Bro Restarted his computer, the problem came back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Router works, My switch works, Both machines are running the same version of Win 10, I can see his computer, he cannot see mine, but I cannot connect to his. I set up a Homegroup on his machine and connected via mine, but again, this only lasted about
 5 minutes! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been networking these two machine for 3 years without issue, whatever the issue is, it is recent.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ac0a305-83f9-4418-ae62-4d2fe45af30c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ac0a305-83f9-4418-ae62-4d2fe45af30c" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<p>Update 11/27/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't connect to my Bro's computer without seeing the "error" (cause it shouldn't be there!) above. He, however is able to connect to my PC (via mapped drives) and stream content again. The issue, at least from his end seems intermittent, whereas
 I have yet been able to connect to his computer, even though I can still see it on the network. &nbsp;Also I should point out that I don't always get that login message, sometimes it says "dell-pc" is not available or something like that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Phoning mobiles and landlines with a contract</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an unlimited minutes contract but can't get my laptop to call (calls just drop after ringing a couple of times) and Skype on my PC shows that I have no subscriptions while Skype on my Mac is showing I have a subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm logged into the same account on both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>XP games for windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XP games for windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I want to install XP's games onto my 64-bit&nbsp;windows 7 home edition but I deinstalled games from the xp and I cannot find my installation disks for xp in order to (re)install games. I have read in several sites including Answers that 'all' I need is the cards.dll
 and the solitaire .exe's.&nbsp; Per another post, I went to&nbsp;'add/remove windows components' but games aren't showing up.&nbsp; I also checked my trashcan but&nbsp;nothing there.&nbsp; I don't know anyone who has the XP cds.&nbsp; I checked out some of the 'free games' on the web but
 free isn't really free of course and they all wanted to add stuff to my IE.&nbsp; Is there anyway I can obtain those files?&nbsp; It goes without saying that my XP software is legal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks, Cattyjoan</p>

    <title>Corsair Void Headset stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zerotango92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corsair Void Headset stopped working</h2>
                    <p>My Corsair Void Pro Hybrid headset has worked perfect for 8 months, but it has recently started to lose connection, and now has stopped working completely. My Xbox One S,&nbsp;Elite controller , or my back up controller will not recognize the headset. I have tried using the 3.5mm Jack and the USB adapter. Neither will work.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have connected the headset to my PC and it works fine with 3.5 mm jack and USB. Both my controllers are up to date. Can anyone help with this issue?</p>
