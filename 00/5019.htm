    <title>How do I stop the authenticator on my Windows phone 8.1 Nokia 925&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susielawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop the authenticator on my Windows phone 8.1 Nokia 925&#63;</h2>
                    I started the authenticator to loading what I thought was security codes. The screen on my phone has Microsoft Authenticator accounts and has been running for 24 hours with different codes. I even turned Microsoft Authenticator settings off to see if that
 would stop it. It doesn't. I also been having problems signing into my Microsoft account. I finally got signed on on my computer, and now I can't sign on on my phone. I have spent way too much time on this, and I am so confused and frustrated. I don't even
 know why I started this process. At this point I just want it off my devices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            I took my phone to the mobile department at our computer store and showed it to a Technician. He said the authenticator continually gives codes as additional security for my account. It is my understanding that if I need a code it is available and changes
 often for security purposes. I have not had a situation where I have used this. Therefore, I am not use about that. At the bottom of the Authenticator are options to add an account, and settings where you can disable this feature and stop communication between
 Authenticator and Microsoft Acc. I have not tried that in fear that it won't restart. I mention this because originally I made the statement that I just wanted it off my devices. The jury is still out on that one. There is also an "about" option. There is
 a lot of information there. If anyone has more experience with this or anything to add, I would like to know your experience, etc.

            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5d863f56-2bcd-48e3-aee0-553e8440edb2" title="SusieLawson">
SusieLawson</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. It is correct that the authenticator app is for additional security for your Microsoft Account. If you do not want to use the app anymore, we'd recommend disabling and uninstalling the application. Also,
 the "about" that you saw under Settings contains the information about your phone. Let us know if you have other questions.

            <p>3-31-2015 FINALLY got another Band. &nbsp;Only had it a couple of days but heartrate seems to be working on this one. &nbsp;Sleep shows HR graph, workouts show HR, and just turning the Band on shows HR as expected. &nbsp; Intererstingly, the Band HR matched nearly exactly
 the HR on my recumbent bike during this morning's workout, although I don't have the greatest confidence in the bike HR (its the kind where you grab the handles of the bike, not a chest strap). &nbsp;Anyway, some progress. &nbsp;Fingers crossed.</p>

<h2>            Filling in forms&#58; What used to be simple, in 2000, now confusion in 2010.  There has to be a simple way&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In Word2000, I created simple forms that allowed me to</p>
<ol>
<li>create a document </li><li>add fill in blank merge fields </li><li>protect non field areas from change </li><li>copy and paste the entire document [a few paragraphs] to another applications entry form</li><li>clear the fields and start over </li></ol>
<p>I did this by</p>
<ol>
<li>placing blank merge fields of 5 characters, which showed as grayed areas. in/around the other to-be-protected text</li><li>I protected the document, which allowed me to only write in those data entry fields.</li><li>I moved from field to field with a tab key, and typed data into the blank fields.&nbsp; Because the fields were 'selected on entry', if i typed a space, the field shrunk to 1 tolerable space characters</li><li>When I reached the last field, 'tab' cycled to the first </li><li>I then hit ctrl a, ctrl-c to copy, switched to the other application and hit control-v.</li><li>To clear the fields I simply unprotected and reprotected the document.&nbsp; Or I could just loop around and keep going, tho this isn't 'safe' to data integrity. &nbsp;</li><li>I placed that protect/unprotect toggle into a toolbar, therefore accessible with a single click.</li></ol>
<p>In 1 minute, I could create variations on that theme, for different purposes in the non-office applications' data entry, and distribute the documents to a large number of folks, who could use the form simply.&nbsp;&nbsp; With no instruction on how to use it.</p>
<p>NOW.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office 2010 ____.</p>
<p>Nothing is simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything that can be done takes 4 clicks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many things are hidden or are no longer doable.&nbsp; Frankly, this sucks, and I regret buying a new laptop, and buying Office2010</p>
<p>Or maybe I can't see the simple way?</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to accomplish the steps above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an engineer/attorney with years and years of software use, from WordPerfect DOS through Corel's Office and MSOffice.&nbsp; I have always tinkered and maximized useage of all of the software.&nbsp; I am handy at this; VB/VBA/Macro useage savvy....&nbsp;&nbsp; If I find
 it awkward and un-doable, I wonder what typical retail customers think.</p>
<p>Unless someone points me in the right direction, I would promote OO, Word2000 or Corel.</p>
<p>My thanks.</p>

<p>I should mention:</p>
<p>I can manage to set all the text box controls to red type, to at least highlight them, and if I use the mouse to select the first control, I can tab from one to the next, skipping intermediate content, but I can't protect/unprotect the form, easily , I can't
 empty the text boxes [though I can rely on the 'select' to type in spaces, on 20 of 25 blanks spots...not helpful, MS...]</p>
<p>And whatever happened to context sensitive help.&nbsp; Go to the Content Control Properties, and<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the worst</span>
</em>help system comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's the trick to getting help on a single check box, so I can explain to someone else what it does, without endless experimenting.&nbsp; This<strong>terrible</strong> help system is pervasive office 2010.&nbsp; Worse, whatever help you

<p>I feel like I have been duped, as MS placed a funky GUI and more over what are obviously the existing OfficeSystem object dialogs.</p>

            <div>You can use the legacy forms controls in Word 2007 (and I assume in 2010 as well). You must first show the
<strong>Developer </strong>tab in the Ribbon (in Word 2007, the check box is at <strong>
Office Button | Word Options | Popular</strong>); the <strong>Legacy Forms </strong>
controls are part of the <strong>Legacy Tools </strong>in the <strong>Controls </strong>
group on that tab. Note that the palette doesn't include the <strong>Lock </strong>
button, but you can add this to the QAT.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One difference is that, beginning in Word 2002, I think, unprotecting and reprotecting the form using the Lock button doesn't clear the data; using
<strong>Tools | Protect/Unprotect Document </strong>does. The recommended way to get a new form is to make the form a template and create a new document based on it rather than keep reusing the same document.</div>

<p>I thank you for your suggestion.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are suggesting that I create a template, and set a QAT for each template/document, rather than me just selecting a toolbar?</p>
<p>And I know that the MVPs that chime in to support the products are not the reason all these issues happen, and their efforts are appreciated....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, as is typical of MS Product lines, now, the information on legacy was not readily available in the help file.&nbsp; I spent 1.5 hours trolling around it to no end.&nbsp; It is really terrible.</p>
<p>Also, regrettably typical for MS Products and software, since I first started using them back when FoxPro disappeared as a stand alone entity, and though and including all current MS Products and product lines [Office, VB, Server...etc.]...</p>
<br />
<p>There is a propensity for MS to "recommend" usage patterns, instead of designing the software to be usable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example....&nbsp;</strong> I can put a Lock button on the QAT, or on my own tab on the ribbon, but accessing them requires excessive mouse clicks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless I leave my Ribbon tab exposed and do no other function on the ribbon, that is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I can't make
 non-relevant tools disappear -- with the QAT its all or nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the ribbon, its everything, always, or nothing, and nothing accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With toolbars, I could plop it on top, to the side, anywhere appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2000, if I wrote a pleading, I could by a single mouse click:&nbsp; access buttons attached to macros on a legal toolbar, macros that renumbered pleadings, and a host of other functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 No more.&nbsp; I'm sorry to say this, but MS has a long, long history of creating functionality that forces my workflow to be adjusted, instead of aiding workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do I have to think like MSGroupThink?</p>
<p>Really: Read the licensing material on Ribbons and Runtimes:&nbsp; They didn't want a toolbar that helps users, and did want a ribbon bar they could use as a marketing ploy and to assert an intellectual property right.</p>
<p><strong>Example....</strong> MS thinks I should have to re-load a 'new' copy of a template document each time I want to rewrite the contents of the form?&nbsp; Am I hearing you right?&nbsp;&nbsp; During the course of a day, while in the field, I might use a template 10-20
 times an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reload?&nbsp; Close and existing open a template.&nbsp; Why does MS get to manage my workflow.&nbsp;&nbsp; OO doesn't.&nbsp; Mozilla doesn't.</p>
<p>And the alternative....create templates, and attach macros to them, explicity?&nbsp; what if I have 20 templates that come and go each season?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, a collection of annoying steps to attach macros to their QAT?</p>
<p><strong>Example....</strong> I can't one click clear, anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I want to do it now, I have to write a macro [tho macro recording shuts off, now, with the protect function, something that used to NOT happen.&nbsp; Now, I have to LOOK UP the context for commands,
 instead of just recording a macro. &nbsp; Now I have to write a macro to do what was simply accomplished, before.&nbsp; Why ?&nbsp; because MS has a recommended work flow pattern, rather than giving me the tools to assist my work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example....</strong> Toolbars had been context sensitive by&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>user command, not MS fiat</em>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Example....</strong> I regularly use Excel to create flow diagrams for work processes, or to create, for planning, or for collecting information on major loss events.&nbsp; Why Excel [or Quattro, for that matter?]&nbsp;&nbsp; It has the flow diagram tools, arrows
 and etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could bring on the drawing tool bar, and set it at the bottom, or side, and keep working with speed.&nbsp; No interruptions in my workflow, just to bold something, or access some other item on some other tool bars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I have to click around, and
 then click back.&nbsp; Thanks MS for making my life more complicated to preserve your intellectual property</p>

<p>I should mention that I already had been using the Developer tab...&nbsp; The part of the help file that I find lacking is beyond that.</p>
<p>For example....there is an item on the customize area, for "lock field".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the trick for getting context sensitive help for that, explicitly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often, in this kind of situation, I feel like I should hit F1, but this no longer works.&nbsp;&nbsp; And often,
 I find that if i type the matter/item of interest, into the help box search box, I get nothing, as was the case here, with "lock field"</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still can't hit Ctrl-C, to copy the document until i UNPROTECT it, this, a new behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why does protecting a form now need to include prohibiting the copy function?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I missing something</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is a template a solution?&nbsp;&nbsp; What distinguishes a "template" from a "document", other than the location in which it is stored?&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the years of seeing "templates", I have never seen anything it "does".&nbsp;&nbsp; If we're talking, opening as read only....
 then this wouldn't be a solution to my issues.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've already created a protect toggle button/macro, which addresses clearing, but still have issues on the Ribbon usage, vs a toolbar.</p>

<p>I note that unprotecting, selecting all with CtrlA and then typing F9 does something goofy.<br />

In my macro, I just turn toggle off/on the protection;&nbsp; Turning it On clears as part of that.</p>

            In email addresses it doesn't matter whether you use upper or lower cases. If you don't get an undeliverable notice, most likely the misspelled address is valid, so you sent it to any unkown person.

<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RFC 5321</a>, the standard that defines how email transport works, lays down the email address case sensitivity issue
 thus:</p>
<pre><code>The local-part of a mailbox MUST BE treated as case sensitive. Therefore, SMTP implementations MUST take care to preserve the case of mailbox local-parts. In particular, for some hosts, the user "smith" is different from the user "Smith". However, exploiting the case sensitivity of mailbox local-parts impedes interoperability and is discouraged. Mailbox domains follow normal DNS rules and are hence not case sensitive.</code></pre>

If you have done everything you have said this can't be happening. Re-evaluate what you have done and repost.

<h2>            Build 10130 Cortana only briefly working</h2>
                    <p>When I first boot up, Cortana will work one or two times only. &nbsp;After that, nothing. &nbsp;But when I reboot, whether it be immediately or after some time, I get the following Application Error always. &nbsp;I've done this several times now and immediately rebooted
 as soon as Cortana fails to operate, and I get this very same error message as my computer is shutting down. &nbsp;Here's the image:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Seems there must be some connection between Cortana failing and this error message.</p>

            <p>I get the same error message on shutdown, but if I wait for about 10 Seconds it disappears and shutsdown.</p>
<p>Also Cortina works fine on my Toshiba laptop and on my Surface 2 Pro tablet. The only malfunction is that my hidden taskbar does not hide after bringing up the start. I found that if I open Cortina the taskbar will then hide. Overall I like build 10130.
 I never got the build before that to work properly.</p>
<p>Will be glad when the final version comes out. I think that Windows 10 is going to be better than Win 7 or Win 8.1....</p>

            <p>There is another thread up on the shutdown issue and (note I have not tried this yet myself) if you right click the start button and shut down from there then the message does not occur and apparently it both shuts and reboots faster (I'll try when I get
 home from work tonight).&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Yup. I'm running Office 2003, 2007 and 2010 on my machine. </p>
<p>However there are a couple of things you will have to do to beat them into submission:</p>
Working with Multiple Versions of Office (Dual Install)
<a href="http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=762</span></a>
Personal Supplemental instructions
<p><span>MS tends to put everything in separate folders and with long wordy names.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided to consolidate things somewhat.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I navigated to the “Start” menu and edited folder and shortcut names to be more concise.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created a single “Microsoft Office” folder and migrated all of the shortcuts into it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I created shortcuts to the 3 “2003 to 2007 Interactive Command References”. Then I started renaming the shortcuts.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In my case I had Office 2003 and Office 2007, so I renamed them as follows:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>“2003 Excel”<br />
“2003 PowerPoint”<br />
“2003 Word”<br />
“2007 Excel”<br />
“2007 Excel 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint”<br />
“2007 PowerPoint 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
“2007 Word”<br />
“2007 Word 2003 to 2007 Cmd Ref”<br />
etc…</span></p>
<p><span>Or</span></p>
<p><span>Word 2003<br />
Word 2007<br />
Word 2010<br />
Word 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
Excel 2003<br />
Excel 2007<br />
Excel 2010<br />
Excel 2003 to 2010 Mapping<br />
etc…</span></p>
<p><span>As well, I decided to keep both sets of ``Office Tools`, so I kept one folder and renamed the shortcuts using the same pattern, ie starting
 with the year.</span></p>
<p><span>I also do custom installations, specifying unique installation folders to further separate the installations. It isn't completely successful,
 some common folders are still used, &nbsp;but it seems to help.</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft's recommendations are incomplete regarding Word - see
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.gmayor.com/Toolbars_in_word_2007.htm</span></a>
 for further recommendations with regard to shared resources that are better not shared.</span></p>
<p><span>Office apps also work better also if their startup folders are not shared.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Excel I&nbsp; would relocate the contents of the (Excel 2003) XLSTART folder to a new sub folder of the existing XLSTART -The start-up
 folder location is stored in the registry at<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common\Xlstart</span></p>
<p><span>Set the value to match the sub new folder name e.g. Office11XLSTART. That should sort out Excel 2003. Create a similar sub folder and registry
 entries for Office 2010 i.e.Office14XLSTART and at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\Xlstart</span></p>
<p><span>The same idea applies to Word’s startup and template folders.</span></p>

                    installed OneNote Web Clipper. Tried to clip article and found the list of default locations does not include the notebook I'd like to drop the clip in. How do I update the list of default locations to drop clips in?

            Dear Tony,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products. <br /><br />Does this happen only with one particular sender or all of them ? Please check the rules in first place as it seems that there are some that are moving those emails to another folder.

<br />In order to check the rules in Outlook please use this guide <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/manage...</a>
<br />
<br />Also you can use search to localize where exactly you have all the emails from that sender <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/find-a-message-or-item-with-instant-search-69748862-5976-47b9-98e8-ed179f1b9e4d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/find-a...</a> and this one will help to narrow the results <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-to-narrow-your-search-criteria-for-better-searches-in-outlook-d824d1e9-a255-4c8a-8553-276fb895a8da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-...</a>

Hi Briana,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks for the query and I will try my best to help you.</p>
<p><span>First, I would like to explain that the license
</span><span>“</span><span>The latest Desktop version of Office” is related to Office client, if you want to install Office to your computer, you need this license:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a371573-bfa4-4cc6-b323-16fdb49d93e4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a371573-bfa4-4cc6-b323-16fdb49d93e4?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
According to your description, the issue may be relayed to no the license.</p>
<p>
You can check if via <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
As you are told that you can install Office on 5 computers, you should have the license, to better understand the situation, I want to collect the following information for further analysis:</p>
<p>
1. The screenshot of <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Subscriptions</a>.</p>
<p>
2. The screenshot of <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#installs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Install status</a>.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Regards,</p>

<h2>            Groove OneDrive just doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft claims I can stream music from OneDrive account if the music is in a folder called 'Music', the problem I have is that this doesn't work on any device. I have two computers and an Android with all installations of the Groove app fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only get music into Groove if I tell it to look in the actual local folder for the OneDrive music folder on Windows 10, the Android app has no chance of this. Has the ability to play music from OneDrive been pulled?</p>

<p>I have the same issue. I have been trying to get this to work for the past week. I've done extensive research and seems that we aren't the only ones with this problem yet Microsoft is silent: They haven't officially said if the feature was pulled or provided
 proper support to assist customers with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is identical to yours. Going to the&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?id=music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Onedrive Music Folder</a>&nbsp;as mentioned in their&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3080138/groove-and-onedrive-faq#troubleshoot-onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooting
 guide</a>&nbsp;creates the "music" folder if you did not already have one, if you did, it converts your normal folder called "music" into the music folder to be used for groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any music that I place in that folder does not show up in the Groove app on Windows 10 or the Groove app on Android (running the latest version of Groove Music and Android Marshmellow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read on reddit that some users found the music synced after a day or so but I've still been waiting for that to happen. In any case, this is an unacknowledged issue by Microsoft and I wish they would either fix it or say they
 dropped it so I would no longer waste my time trying to get it to work.</p>

<p>Yes, I've had the same issue, and deleting the database from the AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.ZuneMusic_[random]/LocalState/Database folder, which used to be a more or less foolproof fix for sync issues, isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly music management, and OneDrive music management in particular, is not on Microsoft's priority list.&nbsp; They make no money by having you sync music you already own; it seems they are determined to steer people toward paid-subscription services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use CloudPlayer on Android for a good solution in accessing my OneDrive music.&nbsp; It's fast, and is far more functional than the Groove player for Android.</p>

            Onedrive sync is still working for me, hopefully they don't pull it as I don't know any other music service that supports streaming libraries seamlessly from cloud storage. Make sure you're signed into the same MS account on everything (Groove, Onedrive)<br />

            I gave up with Goove - tried CloudPlayer, but didnt feel like giving it access to my OneDrive!! After some funkying around figured out how to sync files to a folder on my phone via OneDrive (a very non-intuitive process)... so I can finally play my files.

<p>I have since switched to Google Play Music. <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplaymusic/answer/1143668?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6230774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
You can add up to 50,000 songs to Google Play Music from your personal music collection</a> while
<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/04/21/google-play-music-samsungs-new-default-music-app-galaxy-s8-complete-exclusive-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Samsung phones and tablets include the option to upload as many as 100,000 tracks to the cloud for streaming at no cost.</a> I have already fallen in love with it since all the songs I add to my library
<strong>immediately </strong>syncs to the mobile and web app. Additionally, there is a desktop client that allows you to
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplaymusic/answer/1075570?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6230985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
automatically upload your favorite songs from your computer to your Google Play library.</a></p>
<p>There are apps for mobile devices (both iOS and android), computer, or Android TV.</p>
<p>It's basically everything that Groove music should have been. I really encourage you guys to look into it. No one should have to jerry rig software to get it to work.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error that you are experiencing when playing videos on your phone could be software related, app-specific, file issue and other factors. To look further into this, are you playing the videos on the built-in video app in the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you play the downloaded video to a different video player from the Store. You can also try downloading a different video and see if you will encounter the same error message. If you are still getting the error, perform a
<strong>soft</strong> <strong>reset</strong> to refresh your phone and open the video again. This will
<strong>not</strong> <strong>remove</strong> any contents on your phone and it is safe to perform. Press and hold the
<strong>Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> <strong>
button</strong> at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

<p><span>I want to nest using IF. IF the result of the SUMIFS is more than zero, ie there is a result leave this as the result, but if the result is zero
 then the result should be the result of the next formula which retrieves a number using INDEX MATCH and adds a variance of +/-10%.<span>&nbsp;

            Hi Judy,
<br />What type of account is giving the error just the type so what ever is after the @ sign. Error one could be due to authentication so knowing what type of account it is will help to determine how to proceed. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

    <title>Groove Bug while using Twitter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Groove Bug while using Twitter</h2>
                    Yesterday I encounter a bug while playing music on Groove on my 930, I opened the Twitter app and suddenly the music stopped playing. I pressed play again, the music continues, I go back yo twitter and the music stops again. I had to turn of my device
 to make it work again.

</p><p>I just tried it on my 950XL and it seems to work fine. I started playing music on Groove then went to Twitter and used it for about 10 minutes with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was there anything specific you were doing so I can try it on my device?</p>
