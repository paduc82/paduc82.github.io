            <p><strong>Things to remember:</strong></p>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your&nbsp;commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of testing Windows 10 on a physical&nbsp;partition&nbsp;or hard disk&nbsp;versus a Virtual Machine include full access to the hardware, which includes memory, graphics and input/output performance of the local disk in addition to the ability to fully experience
 all features of the operating system that are not accessible in a virtual environment. The biggest benefit is, you don't lose your production installation of Windows and you can reboot into it at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things to consider before:</strong></p>
<p>Backup your current installation of Windows. Because you will be making signifcant changes to your computer, you should always backup before doing so. It is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">strongly</span></strong> recommended! See links to resources about backing up by clicking the link for the respective version of Windows you are running:

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a bootable disc and try the installation and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error code basically means it is unable to search for the updates.</p>
<p>

    <title>Use Word for Windows 10 Mobile Offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander deeb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Word for Windows 10 Mobile Offline</h2>
                    It seems that basic editing and renaming capabilities require internet connection on Microsoft Word for Windows 10 Mobile. I always create documents and store them locally on my phone, so I have no intention of using Word online. Yet, Word requires me
 to have an internet connection to create, edit, and rename documents locally on my phone.<br />
<br />
This seems like a flawed design to me, and I was wondering if it is possible to use Word on Windows 10 Mobile offline. Receiving an error message that I cannot rename a file unless I am connected to the internet seems quite ridiculous when the document is saved
 locally.

            <p>Hello Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you are renaming it within the Word app. As you said, it shows the error "requires internet connection to rename files". But there are few ways or workarounds to overcome this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st method: <strong>Did you try renaming from the folder (local) where you have saved??</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try this as it doesn't require to start Word app. You can simply go to file explorer and browse for the files and rename it. Once done, open Word app and browse for the renamed file. You may remove the existing file from the recent or pinned list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2nd method: Within Word app. <strong>What about creating a copy of the original file and saving to a new name in the location you prefer to.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Word app, open file and select Save. Under Rename, you will see "create a copy of this file". Doing this will also enable you to rename the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, to get the traditional way of renaming files within Word app, give your feedback in File &gt; Feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you have any queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I recommend you disable it or any security utilities you might have, since they can interfere with setup.

            <p>Microsoft assumes, probably correctly, that anything that arrives as an email attachment or as a download from the Internet is a possible security risk. Therefore, the default action for such items is to open them in Protected Mode until you can verify that
 they're clean. At that point, you can click the Enable Editing button in the yellow banner. (But if you intend to make changes and save them, always do a Save As to save the document as a separate file on the hard drive, because otherwise the changes go into
 a temporary file and then vanish -- see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/outlook_attachments.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/outlook_attachments.htm</a>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A preferable alternative is to always save attachments from Outlook to regular files (right-click the attachment and choose Save As, or choose Save All if there are two or more attachments in the same message) stored in a trusted location such as My Documents.
 Then they'll open normally in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to throw away Protected View's protection, you can turn it off.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click File &gt; Options. On the left side of the Options dialog, click Trust Center, and then click the Trust Center Settings button.</li><li>On the left side of the Trust Center Options, click Protected View.</li><li>Uncheck the third item, which refers to Outlook attachments. Then be careful about what attachments you open.</li></ul>

<p>To answer your questions</p>
<p>1) no</p>
<p>2) haven't tried another file as I am desperate for the date on the file I cannot open</p>
<p>3) I cannot open the file on any other device</p>
<p>4) not sure what you mean by this....</p>
<p>the message read on my iPad excel can' open this workbook. When I try through my desktop, I get something like the file is corrupt or may have different file formats....something like that.</p>

<h2>            IE11 cannot load Office 365 Portal&#63;&#33;&#33;&#33; Seriously&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 8.1 64bit, IE 11. When i go to the Office 365 login at portal.microsoftonline.com and enter my credentials, IE 11 crashes, auto-reloads, then crashes again and takes me to a completely un-helpful "opps" error page. Most other sites work fine. How
 in the world does MSFT release... no, FORCE IE11 on 8.1 uses when it won't even load it's own freaking websites??!!!??
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cleared the browser cache multiple times, restarted browser several times (had to anyway), rebooted once, uninstalled IE11 then re-installed, Put the site in the compatibility list, checked and unchecked the 'use MSFT compatibility list' option, checked
 and unchecked 'use compatibility mode for intranet sites' option, disabled all addon's (there were only the default ones)...... I don't know what else I could have tried.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So now I am using Chrome to browse MSFT's own freaking website. Unbelievable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, to top it off, I find I can't even install IE10 to WIndows 8.1. It say "IE 10 already installed"m despite the fact that I currently I ave removed IE11 From the Windows Components section.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So.... how to fix this? How do i get IE 10 on Windows 8.1? IE9 maybe?&nbsp;</div>

<li><span>ADFS integrated domain, large O365 client (Redirects to local ADFS servers for authentication against internal AD).</span></li><li><span>Per MS best practices, added O365 related domains to IE "Local Intranet" Security zone (*.microsoftonline.com, *.sharepoint.com, etc.) via GPOs.</span></li><li><span>IE crashes when redirecting from O365 sites to O365 Admin menus. &nbsp;Tries to open portal.microsoftonline.com, then redirect to login.microsoftonline.com (And our local ADFS infastructure) for SSO. &nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<div><span>The good news is, at least in my case, I was able to resolve the issue by making a change under
</span><b>Compatibility View Settings</b><span>. &nbsp;Click the gear in upper right of IE 11, choose "<b>Compatibility View Settings</b>" and&nbsp;remove the check mark next to
<b>"Display intranet sites in Compatibility View</b>". &nbsp;Once I removed this option, the site opens up like a champ. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><font>So, there is some component either on the login.microsoftonline.com or the portal.microsoftonline.com site that causes IE to crash while viewing in&nbsp;</font>compatibility<font>&nbsp;mode. &nbsp;I believe the Display intranet sites in compatibility
 view is enabled by default. &nbsp;</font></div>
<div><font><br />
</font></div>
<div><font>Anyway, give it a try and see if this resolves the issue for you. &nbsp;Hopefully this will help MS support find a permanent resolution. &nbsp;</font></div>

<h2>            Problem with watching a TV show I bought in Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p><span>I bought The Originals Season 3 from Microsoft Store. Yesterday I couldn't watch or download episode 16, but a Moderator in another thread said they would look into it and after that, I can watch episode 16. However
 now episode 17 (which I could watch yesterday) has the same problem. What is the problem? I get an error message with "</span><span>0xc10100b2" and "this item is not available".&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Jenny, how are you, thanks for posting in our microsoft community, I'm here to help you solve your problem, I hope this information helps you<br /><br />Let's work around with this. Follow these steps:<br />Clear Windows Store cache &gt; Press Windows key + R and type WSReset.exe &gt; then press Enter.<br /><br />If the issue persist let’s try to reinstall Windows default apps and check if it will make a difference. Follow these steps:<br />Press Windows key + S and type Windows PowerShell &gt; Right-click the first result &gt; select Run as administrator &gt; Copy and paste this command: Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml".<br />And that’s it<br /><br />Let us know how it goes.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards<br />Maya M.

            This does not solve the problem unfortunately. I don't think that the problem has to do with the Microsoft Store app itself, it's just that there is something wrong with the files with the TV show episodes&nbsp;

            Sorry to hear that. But you get that error message only with that tv show or with all your previous purchases?<br /><br />Try checking the information in this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3078121/help-with-movies-tv-app-problems-on-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/307812...</a><br /><br />If any of these options works refer the problem to the App troubleshooter.<br />Run the troubleshooter for Windows appshttp: //windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps<br /><br />Hope it helps you, have a nice day!

<p>I only get the error message when trying to play this particular episode (episode 17 "Behind the Black Horizon" of The Originals Season 3). However yesterday I had this problem with episode 16, then this morning I could suddenly play episode 16 but not episode
 17. And yesterday, I could play episode 17.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Yep when reading.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My cursor is always hovering within the email message if that's what you meant?</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the UP / DOWN buttons don't work, I will have to click once on my mouse (within the message) and then the UP / DOWN buttons will work. But for some emails, I don't have to click the mouse and the UP / DOWN buttons will just work fine.</div>

<h2>            Updating .NET framework</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Surface Pro (the ORIGINAL Surface Pro) and I must say that it has been a wonderful, trustworthy device since new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running on the Slow Ring and, recently, been seeing the Red Screen of Death upon boot-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also get an occasional error message regarding un-handled exceptions in the .NET framework... I believe that my .NET is old. How do I check and how do I update that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through the device drivers and looked for updates for each one as well but found no necessary updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>.NET is included with Windows 10, so you should already have the most up-to-date version. You can check under Turn Windows features on or off via Control Panel - Programs and Features. Maybe your .NET messages have to do with earlier versions that you have
 installed for some purpose.</p>

<p>You must have installed some App or software that requires .NET 3.5 or earlier. Maybe such an App is constantly running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try a clean boot. Use <strong>msconfig </strong>to disable all non-Microsoft Services and Task Manager to disable all Startup items and Restart. Then see if you can remove .NET 3.5 and Restart. Then add it back in, re-enable all of your Services
 and Startup items and Restart again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are downloads for .NET, but with Windows 10, I think it is best if you can install them using the Windows Features dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates I linked above are firmware updates for Microsoft Surface Pro. I don't know if those all come in automatically via Windows Update.</p>

<p>Did you read any of the forum? as many postings about the same issue, some even have some tips. As insiders it is important to keep informed by reading the forum and Feedback Hub.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that this works:</p>
<p><span>Is to watch the the download and when it has completed and&nbsp;</span><strong>before it starts</strong><span>&nbsp;to install remove the system from the internet and let it install might take a long time seems to hang around
 70% but it does complete as I just finished number 4 also caution people to remove any 3rd party virus programs, unplug anything&nbsp;in USB's except wired KB/Mouse and remove any SD cards.</span></p>

<p>Apparently, before the Windows 10 update starts, the setup program will first attempt to run the setup program for Office if you have Office installed (it seems to do that to run its "repair" option before proceeding the installation option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this build 16199 is incorrectly running "Setup360" for verifying your installation of Office, assuming incorrectly it is a version of Office 2016. This fails immediately (at 12%) if your version of Office is Office 2013.</p>
<p>And Windows 10 setyup will abort and will reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visibly this is a broken build: Microsoft added this step for Office but tested it only for Office 2016, not for previous versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the solution to uninstall Office 2013 first will not work properly: Office 2013 can no longer be activated if you uninstall it: you'll get "ERROR_MISSING_PARTNUMBER" when reactivating your existing licence of Office 2013 (even if you bought
 that liecnce from Microsoft itself, because Microsoft has deactivated all past vendors of Office 2013 (including itself) and the "associated ID" (of the vendor) can no longer be found in the Microsoft database (Microsoft has also incorectely deleted/lost all
 information about our existing licences of Office 2013, ven if they were already activated and are still activated). All what Microsoft knows now is that your licence activation code is correct, but it can no longer check it, so you cannot reactivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is a combination of two severe bugs (in fact more):</p>
<p>* one about Office licences activation (loss by Microsoft of vendor info): you'll need Microsoft support to reactivate it</p>
<p>* one about Windows 10 incorrectly running "Setup360" for Office 2016, even if you don't have it (and have also not used the Office 2016 free trial, but only used Office Online), this is a bug of the new setup program for this build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's other severe errors related to Microsoft Online accounts:</p>
<p>* you cannot logon successfully with other browsers than Edge (or IE). Using Chrome will not work correctly logon (including for writing on this forum, it's impossible to sign in, it just fails and you are back to the signin page). Using Edge solves this
 problem. You can however connect and go to you Microsoft Online account, but not on all other Microsoft website such as this one, or download softwares from Microsoft download sites (for example ISO images), and cannot logon to Office Online.</p>
<p>* On some other sites, even if you are successfully logged in, the Microsoft site will display you as "currently logged off", and your avatar shown at top of pages may display the user account (email, personal name, photo...) of someone else in your neighboorhood
 (even if that user does not use Windows 10, and has a different IP, using another ISP or using a mobile ISP different than yours): Microsoft attempts to match people by their (incorrect and weak) geolocation (IP-geolocation or phone-number geolocation), or
 by their street address registered in their personal account (but it thinks that the other person found at this address may be you, even if it's the same street name, street number, city, country: Microsoft does not differentiate the possibility this could
 be a different appartment; using street addresses there is compeltely wrong). Tryuing to sign out and sigtn in again does not work, you still see that other person (as if it was connected) but still considers you are disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has then severe adminsitration problems on its servers for managing security, authentications, privacy, and separation of user accounts, and more managing licences you have bought and validated. It is even unable to find your old purchases or payments
 that are more than 2 years old !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Microsoft is also unable to properly test its software for basic functionalities, and it randomly adds new features assuming that everyone uses them. Microsoft is unable now to manage its own lifecycle of softwares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, Microsoft is completely unreliable. Visibly its own technical teams are now largely understaffed, and Microsoft has fired its own QA teams, because all is now made for free by its Insider programs (using a very small team for following insider
 programs): this is visible with now the huge delays to get direct support for your bought products (now more than 1 week when it was about 24 hours a couple of years ago) and by the fact that Microsoft is notoriously absent from these support forums and does
 not follow them. Even what we post the "Hub" application is almost unused, Microsoft just follows there a few items that people voted for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary: Windows 10 is largely unsupported because it is now compeltely understaffed. Microsoft should better transform Windows 10 into a fully opensourced OS (like Linux) and Windows will be better supported by other parties (Red Hat, Canonical, IBM,
 HP, Oracle...) that will create their own distributions (like Linux).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should then stop using Windows as its primary OS and develop for the web or start really working for MacOS, iOS, Android, webapps, Linux -- Windows is now a dying project that has no future or that will finaly become only an environment (a subsystem)
 on top of another OS (which may be Linux). Microsoft whould seriously think about helping the development of portability of Windpws Apps on Windows emulators for Linux, and helping to the development of Linux kernels. WinRT and UWP is just the start for abstracting
 all the Windows API&nbsp; and remove the dependency about the OS core kernel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even for all new developments in Windows, Microsfot actually does no longer develop them, Microsoft no longer how its OS really works internally, all its own competent programmers are no longer working for MS. windwos is now a patchwork of proprietary extensions
 made by many third parties that better know how these extensions really work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even for Microsoft's own sites, Microsoft has extremely poor management of its content and is unable to correctly assembly the compoments and have all subsites working correctly together. its website is constantly changing dramatically, it is very unstable,
 it has TOO MANY "404 page not found" errors when just following the links: Microsoft does not know how to maange its online content and constantly ignores all recommendations. Searching anything on MS sites is a nightmare (Google, Oracle, Mozilla, the W3C
 are much more reliable for this task). This is what heppens in a company whose only remaining activity is purely commercial (Microsoft has lost all its technical knowledge and competence, and almost always now, problems in Windows have their solution not found
 by Microsoft, but by their customers that often better know what is really happening on their systems)</p>

 to upgrade to 16199, it's important when posting is to supply sources so as not to mis-info others.&nbsp;

<p>On my insider machine I have MS Office 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't update to build 16199 thru Windows Update. But I used the downloaded files to create an iso and upgraded to build 16199 via the iso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no problems whatsoever regarding the Office 2007 product or its activation after upgrading. So this Office issue you are mentioning does not sound true to me. There must be something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that some of MS links fall into oblivion with 404 error. But I think this is due to the fact that there are design changes of the sites regarding the feel and look. Due to this reorganization of the sites some links have their destinations
 changed. Therefore, collateral damage occurs and we get 404 errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is not only in MS sites. There are other sites that have the same 404 issue due to the reorganization of the sites. I have sent e-mails regarding these 404 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I do not share the same opinion with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is also true that big companies are inert and bound to failure if they insist on remaining inert and resistant to change and to following current trends. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Virus&#58;Win64&#47;Sirefef.A - MSE unable to disinfect file</h2>
                    Hello, I've infected by Sirefef malware machine (Windows 7 x64). MSE detects infected file (C:\Windows\system32\services.exe as Virus:Win64/Sirefef.A) and a bunch of other Sirefef components (mostly in User profile directory). However when disinfection
 begins MSE terminates services.exe (obviously for disinfection reasons) and Windows popups message about needs to be restarted because of "critical error encountered". After reboot infection still in place, services.exe still infected and nothing from other
 Sirefef components are not removed. I can manually remove infection, but I want to MSE be able to deal with this malware automatically. Is this a bug and can such behaviour be fixed?

<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi Yan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I unmarked ahaap's response as an answer because you said it wasn't.&nbsp; After reading this, which I believe answers what you asked (at the beginning)&nbsp;but does not resolve your problem (whereas his response is a step in that direction, and closer than suggested
 by your reply, as is what follows below), you may remark it or both or something different if you get further responses or none if your issue remains unresolved.&nbsp; If you mark the thread&nbsp;as answered (one or more responses)&nbsp;while it is still unresolved, you
 are less likely to receive further assistance.&nbsp; If you're satisfied with one or more responses as answering your issue and resolving the problem, then mark one or more as Answers.&nbsp; I will not unmark anything you mark as an Answer the next time you do it even
 if you come back and say it did not resolve anything - then it&nbsp;will be your responsibility to do it if warranted or leave it as it is (I did so here only because I thought perhaps you did not understand how and when to use the feature properly and in your
 best interests).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To submit feedback (it's all the same - there's no way to differentiate a program bug from a suggestion) to MSE, use the following link:&nbsp;
<a href="https://feedback.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/default.aspx?productkey=morro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://feedback.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/default.aspx?productkey=morro</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To submit a file (or many, but one at a time) for analysis to see if it is infected and get a report on it, use the following link:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I happen to think you are still infected with Sirefef which takes more than just MSE to get rid of it as a general rule.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft information on the variant you named is here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Virus%3aWin64%2fSirefef.A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Threat/Encyclopedia/Entry.aspx?Name=Virus%3aWin64%2fSirefef.A</a>.&nbsp; Note that it talks about detection but does not address removal (yet).&nbsp; I suppose one man's "MSE cannot remove it on its&nbsp;own" is another man's "MSE
 has a bug."&nbsp; But in the end, I again believe you remain infected and MSE cannot clean this infection though it tries and fails in the manner you described instead of simply saying "MSE cannot clean this" -&nbsp;and the truth is we still need to remove the infection.&nbsp;
 Even if it were a bug as you call it, you do not want this infection on your system one nano-second longer than necessary and "bug fixes" can take weeks or many months (or longer) - but not minutes or hours and that's the timeframe we need to be thinking here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend proceeding as follows to get rid of this very, very nasty infection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, disable System Restore and then re-enable it to clear restore points from which this problem may be coming. When finished and everything is fine and the problem is fixed, create a new restore point so you'll have one if needed and it will eventually
 repopulate to the maximum you have allocated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though that family is not normally associated with Java, the following cannot hurt and may even help (not likely here, but potentially by avoiding something else or removing something else being hidden at the moment).&nbsp; Delete and remove all versions of Java
 on your system and then download and install the most current applicable version from
<a href="http://www.java.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.java.com</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete the Java cache: <a href="http://java.com/en/download/help/cache_virus.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/help/cache_virus.xml</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Use Disk Cleanup to remove all temporary internet files and all Windows temporary files (and anything else you feel comfortable cleaning up in the process). Then, to be sure, download and use Old Timer TFC to truly get rid of all temporary files:
<a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/files/file/187-tfc-temp-file-cleaner-by-oldtimer/</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Reboot and empty the Recycle Bin. Then update and run a full scan with the updated MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Even if MSE comes up clean (I doubt it will, but who knows), if you want to be more sure, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span> and SuperAntiSpyware:
</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and Spybot Search and Destroy:
<a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html</a>.<span> T</span>hen run a full ESET online scan:
</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.<span>
</span>I'd also try Microsoft Safety Scanner: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span> and TDSSKiller:

 get rid of it before you become compromised (if it already isn't)&nbsp;or it burrows in so far nothing can get to it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try Windows Defender Offline to see if it helps. The best instructions are this tutorial:
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-windows-defender-offline.html</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing some infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Since we don't know what we're dealing with here other than the initial infection (which
 may or may not be the same in the other locations and may or may not include other infections not&nbsp;even detected due to the infection or possibly in general)&nbsp;and there are no manual removal procedures available for it yet, it's sort of like needing to use a
 minigun instead of a sniper rifle to resolve things.&nbsp; After this comes professional help and/or validation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a>
</span><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)
 in the US at this time. After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><span><a href="http://Support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Support.microsoft.com/security</a>
</span><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you find that too costly, some free malware-removal forums (which take much longer - both to get someone to respond and then to go back and forth working the problem, are forum-based, depend a great deal on the "luck of the draw" concerning who
 gets assigned to your case, and are not guaranteed, and often do not include repairs to damage but just removal of the infection -but your symtoms seem more like a redirect infection than damage to me, but I've seen them help a lot and I've seen them not help
 much at all - and suspect it has more to do with the person assigned than with the sites themselves) include:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>That is simply the default subtype for the Currency format, based on accounting conventions:&nbsp; red and parentheses for negative numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change, right-click the cell, click Format Cells, and click on the subtype that you prefer.&nbsp; For example, for black with minus sign and no parentheses:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54fcbd93-b982-4d11-9d34-5cd921b5a97a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54fcbd93-b982-4d11-9d34-5cd921b5a97a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if you want PMT to return a positive number, either change PV to -1000000 (my preference), or change the formula to =-PMT(5%/12,360,1000000).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, Excel functions use signed cash flows to distinguish inflows and outflows.&nbsp; It is arbitrary which direction that you call inflow and which sign (plus or minus) that you use for that direction, as long as you are consistent in each formula.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arguably, it depends on your point of view:&nbsp; borrower v. lender.&nbsp; I prefer to adjust my point of view :-) so that financial result of each formula is always a positive value.&nbsp; I am careful to assign the appropriate sign when I reference the positive values
 in financial formulas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that might be difficult if the concept of signed cash flows is new to you.&nbsp; In that case, I suggest that you use negative values for amounts that you spend or invest, and positive values for amounts that you receive.&nbsp; Thus, the PV of a loan should be
 positive because you receive that amount from the lender; and PMT should be negative because you pay that to the lender.&nbsp; (I'm assuming you are the borrower.)</p>

<p>In search programs &amp; files text box if you type Word does that reveal the shortcut?</p>

            The only easy "accidentental" deletion of Office is the shortcuts.&nbsp; In the Start menu, search window try typing WinWord.EXE and pressing enter. If word starts, then the program is still installed, you just deleted the shortcut.<br />

            It is the version that was preinstalled on my laptop. How I deleted it, was that I was in programs &amp; files. I clicked on it and hit delete or whatever it is that takes it out of there. Now it is gone. It does not show up in the programs folder at all and
 when I click on the shortcut on my desktop it takes me to the website. I am pretty sure I goofed. For the longest time when pc's were first introduced into households I accidentally deleted the main driver on our computer. I can really mess things up sometimes.
 For many years my husband would say that I was not allowed around the "delete" button. I think I may have royally messed up again. I did not mean to delete it. Now I don't even remember why I was in there or even why I did that. But I do know it wasn't intentional.

            <p>Ok. I'm sorry. I originally meant the Programs &amp; Features folder, not programs &amp; files like I said in the last reply to you. I apologize. Yes, I typed into the programs &amp; files "Word". A blank page came up. I typed in "this is a test" and saved it to my
 desktop. It is there now. So, is this the way that I will need to get to microsoft office word from now on? I know, I'm an idiot. I can hear ya'lls wheels turnin, lol. But when I type "spreadsheet" it says "no items match your search"</p>

<p>I'm certain you still have the programs installed. Check your Recycle Bin to see if the deleted desktop shortcuts are still around. If they're not, it's easy to recreate them.</p>

            Thank you again for your reply. I'm sorry, I should have thought. Yes, I realized when I read your reply that I should have put in Excel instead. So I did. I went to the programs &amp; files and typed in "Excel". It said the same thing. "no items match your

            <p>What do you see if you click Start... All Programs... Microsoft Office? If you see Access and Excel and Word there, you can select them and drag them to the desktop. If you don't see them, try looking in \Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\ and
 look for files named "EXCEL.EXE", "WORD.EXE" and so on. You can rightclick each of them and choose "Create Shortcut" and ask to have it put on the desktop.</p>
<p>The details may be a bit different depending on your version of Windows and of Office, but given that you can open Word, I'm sure they're there someplace!<br />

            Hi  MartinKing2,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience you are experiencing. Does this also happen if you sign out and sign into Skype too? 
<br />
<br />It could be an issue with your Skype installation.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Skype.
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.34.0.78.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem is resolved.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />That's very weird, the first thing that I would try is to sign out from Skype 8 then sign back in and see if the issue persist.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work the next step would be to reinstall Skype and see if the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />If none of those methods works, give a try to a System File Checker and see if that helps.
<br />

<p>dbs.Execute " INSERT INTO Client "</p>
<p>&amp; "SELECT * "</p>
<p>&nbsp;&amp; "FROM [Client1];"</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note : in the execute statement a 1 is added to Client, is is access that ads the number because the two tables have the same &nbsp;name.</p>

<p>I'm getting this message : SELECT * cannot be used in an INSERT INTO query when the sourcce or destination table contains a multi-value field.</p>

Do you have&nbsp;a multi-value field or is the error wrong?

            Hi Adeline,<br />
<br />
For your situation, please make sure whether there is any prompt/notification message (or something like that) while you tried opening your Outlook for Mac. From the past experience, if there is something wrong with Outlook 2016 for Mac especially the database
 of it, Outlook 2016 for Mac will prompt with a notification about how to take action.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since the issue might be related to deleting something related to Outlook, I suggest you try creating a new profile for your Outlook 2016 for Mac and then configure your account under the new profile. For more information you can refer to
