<h2>            restore to phone</h2>
                    I have been burnt too many times to mention when using Activesync for the first time (I sync with various work and home PC's when needed) and losing all my contacts on my phone. So my plan is to use MyPhone as my backup. Sound reasonable?<br />
<br />
OK, my question is this: If I should happen to "accidentally"&nbsp;delete some contacts on my phone, how can I restore them from MyPhone? I only ask because I have been experimenting with this&nbsp;issue by deleting a contact from my phone and attempting to restore it
 by ticking the contact in MyPhone , then clicking Manage&gt;Restore to Phone - but nothing seems to happen.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

Says:<br />
<br />
"If you have an active connection with Microsoft Exchange server (which is frequently used for corporate e-mail), My Phone will not synchronize your contacts, calendar appointments, or tasks."<br />
<br />
You should delete all the active sync&nbsp;connections and try syncing again. Note that this might some times send all your connections on the myphone site under "deleted items". If this happens just restore them and sync again.<br />
<br />
This worked for me and I got my connections back.<br />
<br />
P.S: Thanks to&nbsp;Prasad Ramani Mahadevan and Seth Manheim who helped me to find this.</span></p>

<p>Doesn't seem to occur w/ Details pane selected.</p>

<p>Hi Barbara,<br />
<br />
Regarding the issue, could you try the following steps to see if there is any improvement?<br />
1. To exclude the impact of the software confliction, please try a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> and see the result.<br />
2. Could you try downloading and installing the latest version Office via the <a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to see the outcome?<br />
3. To confirm if the issue related to Office client, please uninstall the Office client completely according to the following
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-Windows-computer-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-NZ&amp;ad=NZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Kyle
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 system Restore is basically defunct and no longer reliable . . .
<br />
<br />Large Windows 10 updates will automatically delete all your Restore Points to maintain System integrity. 
<br />
<br />This is because so many Windows System files are changed during these updates, there would be the possibility of old and new system files being mixed after a system restore, resulting in an unstable system . ..

            Hi Kyle, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />The restore point has limited disk space usage, so if they're too many restore points and get to the limit, it'll be removed automatically. If you wanna keep more restore points, you should increase the max usage of it.
<br />
<br />1. Press windows key + R to open the run command.
<br />
<br />2. Type sysdm.cpl and press enter
<br />
<br />3. Click on "system protection" tab and click "configure"
<br />
<br />4. Under Disk Space Usage, move the Max Usage slider to the right to increase the disk space usage for System Restore points
<br />
<br />5. Click "ok" and close the window.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d96fd4db-a6c7-4ebf-b7a0-b08bc86ef69a?upload=true" />

</blockquote>
<p>A restore point is <em>not</em> a backup although it's frequently confused with a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two types of backup: a file-and-folder backup and an image backup. A file-and-folder backup backs up individual files and folders all at once. It's ideal if you want to backup your personal data (documents, pictures, music, videos, downloads, etc.)
 There are very many great file-and-folder backup programs, like <a href="https://www.backup4all.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Backup4All.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>An image backup is an exact copy of a hard drive, for example, your C: drive. If you store your personal files on the C: drive, as most people do, then an image backup also includes your personal files. Here, too, there are many great image backup programs,
 like <a href="https://www.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macrium Reflect</a>&nbsp;(which also comes in a
<a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">free version</a>,)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/personal/computer-backup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis True Image</a> and
<a href="https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EaseUS ToDo Backup</a>&nbsp;among many others. An image backup is the only way to backup Windows and your software. Imagine never needing to reinstall Windows, ever again - that's the advantage of making image backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've learned how image backups work, and how to make and restore an image, you'll see how quick and easy it is to make image backups every day - automatically! And it only takes minutes to make (and to restore) an image. It's the ultimate protection
 against computer problems. Why waste time and become frustrated with trying to fix a computer when you can easily send it back in time to when everything was working well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find terrific backup software, and to learn more about backing up in general, Google is your friend. You can find reviews of backup programs written by professional testers to help you make a choice.</p>

<p>If you are on Insider Builds each time you install a new build System Restore gets turned off and all existing restore points are deleted. I think they delete the restore points because they don't want people to accidentally go back to the previous build,
 but I can't understand why they turn it off every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the latest Insider build and I have used System Restore with no problems between builds. I always take a restore point right after I install a new build and also keep my regular backups up to date.&nbsp;</p>

            And then there are clones. With a clone, you can log in to it as if it were your normal OS. I maintain two clones on my desktop and three on external hard drives that I rotate. If&nbsp;my main drive fails I can log on to one of the clones then clone it back
 to the main drive.

It has recently come to my attention that someone has been using my identity to run scams involving online sales of electronics.&nbsp; This person has created a hotmail.com address using my amateur radio call-sign, k1wav, and has pretended to be me via the callsign.
 &nbsp;An amateur radio callsign is a unique identifier, and any use of one by someone who does not hold that callsign is almost certainly illegitimate. &nbsp;In this case, there is clear evidence that this email is being used for illegal activity.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">In an attempt to curb further expansion of this scheme, I have registered several other related aliases on my own account
 to protect them. &nbsp;The address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** was already registered, and is not mine.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
If it is possible, I would like to see both the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** accounts shut down to help prevent the scammer from continuing this particular scam.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Further information and confirmation of this matter can be found in a forum thread on eham.net, discussing the problem (<a href="http://www.eham.net/ehamforum/smf/index.php?topic=95935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eham.net/ehamforum/smf/index.php?topic=95935</a>).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Thanks for any help you can offer,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">

            Amateur radio call signs and email addresses are completely unrelated. &nbsp;It is certainly not illegitimate to create a mail address that matches someone's call sign. &nbsp;You my own the call sign on the radio waves, but you don't own it in the email universe.

            <p>Thank you for your replies. &nbsp;I am already aware of the points made in both answers, but as I was directed here by the Online Safety folks at Microsoft, I thought I might as well give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already pursuing several other avenues, including filing a report with the local police, but I fear that there is probably very little I can do in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone here has dealt with this sort of thing directly before, I'd appreciate any tips you may have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I get an error message when using my device to update. What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>"Remote server not responding"</strong></p>
<p>Most likely your Nokia device cannot connect to the Internet or the server is not available. Internet connectivity problems may have several causes, such as a temporary network failure in the operator's network or Internet, or missing or incorrect access
 point settings for the device updates (or web browser) application. Remember that if your device supports it, you can also use WiFi to connect to the Internet and update.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You also need to have Update Server settings programmed into your device. These can be operator-specific settings (contact your operator for help)</font>, or standard Nokia settings as shown below:</p>
<p>Key&nbsp;<strong>*#0000#</strong>&nbsp;into your phone's home screen or go to Device manager (consult your user guide if necessary).</p>
<p>Select&nbsp;<strong>Options &gt; Server profiles &gt; Options &gt; New server profile &gt;</strong>&nbsp;Copy = No</p>

    <title>Please cache OneDrive photos &#38; make thumbnails smaller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cachehole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please cache OneDrive photos &#38; make thumbnails smaller</h2>
                    <p>Photos are important to me, as I'm sure they are to many of you. I have literally thousands (about&nbsp;10 years worth) in my OneDrive separated by month/year, and while the new Photos app is a good start at handling these, it could use a lot of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really starts falling apart the more photos you have,&nbsp;especially if they're in OneDrive. Syncing is often slow &amp; ongoing. It would be great if the app cached all the thumbnails at first launch. It may already do that or it may not, but each load of the
 app &amp; scrolling through your list suggests that it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, speaking of thumbnails, they're WAY too big. Like I said, I have thousands of photos, as I'm sure many other users do.&nbsp;So having big collage-like&nbsp;thumbnails, while pretty,&nbsp;isn't the way to go for everyone.&nbsp;It really needs an option to shrink those
 down so you can see many more on the screen at a time, or else you'll never be able to find anything. The app should treat our photos like&nbsp;the giant database that they probably are &amp; cache these images, even in online-only mode, while making an option to shrink
 the thumbnails.</p>

<p>Oh I absolutely agree!&nbsp; I have been searching for the option to use small thumbnails but there isn't one.&nbsp; Microsoft - please develop an option to use large or small thumbnails.&nbsp; It takes so long to load them in the larger size.&nbsp; I know you will say get
 a faster computer - I have a tablet and a Windows phone - the PC is just for storage but I do like to manager my OneDrive photos on the computer.</p>

    <title>Problems Syncing Tasks From Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chasro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Syncing Tasks From Outlook</h2>
                    I've got a Motorola Q9c running WM6.1. I sync it between a desktop running Vista and a laptop running XP Pro. I have MS Office installed on both PCs.<br />
<br />
If I delete tasks on one PC, they are not getting delete from the phone. Worse yet, they are getting synced over to other PC, setting up a never ending loop.<br />
<br />
This is on top of the fact that the sync relationships keep getting broken. If I sync to one PC, I have to delete and reestablish the sync relationship on the other.<br />
<br />
Not only this killing my productivity (the entire reason I bought a smartphone in the first place), it is getting very frustrating.
<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            Yes, you can export your tasks to a text file (CSV format) and then you can import the CSV file back into Outlook on your other computer....I export and import tasks all the time and it is really quite easy.&nbsp; Let us know if you need any help.<br />
<br />
You can also backup the Outlook.pst file on the other computer before you delete all your tasks.&nbsp; That would just require copying the Outlook.pst file to a another folder on your computer.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across this link:</p>
<p>https://www.msoutlook.info/question/736</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I was so happy that I found something to solve my problem with syncing my sent mail items on different devices I directly changed my&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">Root
 folder path</span><span><span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)"><span>&nbsp;in Outlook to “Inbox”.
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">Unfortunately I didn't read till the end of the article where it says backup local folders. My folders never had a mark with (This computer only) behind it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">Now it seems like I lost this sent folder and all my sent items.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">Is there a way to retrieve this sent mail items?? I really don't hope the are all lost.</span></p>

            Well, if you send an email from webmail, where does the sent copy go?&nbsp; If you have your IMAP service setup in webmail to NOT save sent email, it could explain a local sent folder, though this would be the first case I've seen of a local folder not being

<p>I'm talking about mails that were send from my Outlook.</p>
<p>The fact is then from the moment I <span>changed my&nbsp;</span><span>Root folder path</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;in Outlook to “Inbox” I miss a sent folder and it's items. Can it be retrieved
 if this was the the local (this computer only)?</span></span></span></p>

            Sadly, no.&nbsp; If this was a (This Computer Only) folder and the .OST (Offline STore) file that held it was modified, that folder and it's contents are history, unless you backed them up to a local .PST (Personal STore) file before modifying the Root folder
 path. &nbsp; .OST files are volatile and cannot be used to store anything, .PST files are permanent.

            A restore point before you made the change will likely bring it back.&nbsp; If it does, the very first thing to do is to get all those sent items stored in a .PST file so they won't be disturbed again.&nbsp; The next order of business is to get some kind of Sent
 Items folder into Outlook.&nbsp; This would be whatever folder webmail uses for them.

    <title>Word 2010 automatic word count - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jd_shep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 automatic word count</h2>
                    Every ~5 minutes Microsoft Word 2010 does an automatic word count of my document. I am working on a procedure with review comments which is over 160 pages and over 45,000 words. So every time this word count calculates it takes about 30 seconds and prevents
 any work from being done in the document. This is extremely frustrating.&nbsp;
<div>Auto save is set at 10 minutes.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have removed the word count from the status bar.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have searched high and low for a solution and have not found one.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Best regards,</div>

<h2>            Does Office 2010 University have a perpetual license or does it expire when I am no longer a student.</h2>
                    Someone has said that if you purchase Office 2010 University as a student it has to be re-registered every twelve months and if not still a student it will no longer work.&nbsp; Can anyone verify if this is true or not please? Thank you, Lynda

            MS hasn't been completely clear about the University discount that replaced the "Academic" discount.&nbsp; I am assuming (yes, I know that is dangerous) that MS will treat University the same as Academic.&nbsp; If you look at any of the MS License Terms you'll only
 find "Academic" listed in the "Retail" license section. <br />
<br />
That means your license is "perpetual". You have the right to install on up to 2 machines at the same time. You have the right to transfer those installations to new machines as needed.<br />
<br />
All Office licenses are periodically re-validated.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough I have found links to 2 very different "University" discounts programs. One is for Office Pro with a "retail" license. The other is for Home and Business with a Product Key Card license. Both cost US$100

            Hi, Dhiyaapeace.<br />
<br />
If you are asking for an update for the said app, please refer to mattfrayage's response. Another way for you to update the browser is to check if an update is available for the software of the phone. Go to Settings &gt; Phone &gt; Device Updates.<br />
<br />
You can also try to check for other items that are similar to Nokia Browser from the Store. Just refer to the link provided below:<br />

If the software is up to date, try to reinstall it. Kindly click on the highlighted word 'reinstall' to start the process.</p>

            It is possible that 16.9 version of Office has this bug as many issues are being reported in this new version. 
<br />
<br />Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognised by your Office.
<br />
<br />Another option is roll back to previous stable version which you had. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as this will be looked into by MS Product team also. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet.

<p>
</p><p>The MediaCreationTool works nice to Reset This PC from desktop. But it did not fix my Outlook Indexing problem. I also ran the tool to fix MS-office 2013. which also did not help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indexing options &gt; indexing is not running</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the Modify and Pause are grayed out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicked on advanced options and clicked on Rebuild - Rebuilding the index might take a long time to complete. some views and search results might be incomplete until rebuilding is finished. I let this run for over 30 min.....did not work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot search and indexing seem to not fix the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to go into the Windows Search and could not start it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still searching for a fix or solution. Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, we suggest that you troubleshoot Outlook Instant Search. This will also help you resolve Outlook Indexing concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to verify that indexing is complete: </p>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook, click in the <strong>Search</strong> box.</li><li>Click the <strong>Search</strong> tab, click <strong>
Search Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Indexing Status</strong>.</li><li>When the <strong>Indexing Status</strong> dialog appears, you should see the following:<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Outlook has finished indexing all of your items.</strong></span><br />
0 items remaining to be indexed.</li></ol>
<p>If Outlook has not finished indexing all of your items, note the items remaining to be indexed, wait 5 minutes, and then check again. If the number of items did not decrease, continue to troubleshoot by using the steps in the following sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Make sure Outlook data is included in indexing</span></strong></p>
<p>
This section shows how to verify that Outlook data is being indexed. Try to use Windows Search to search for words or phrases that you expect to find in email messages.
</p><div>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>:</span>
<em>This test does not apply to Outlook 2013. Outlook 2013 blocks the ability to search for Outlook items by using Windows Desktop Search.</em></p>
<p>
If no email messages are returned, follow these steps to make sure Outlook data files are being indexed:<br />
</p><ol>
<li>Exit Outlook.</li><li>Open the Indexing Options.
<ul>
<li>On the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> screen, type
<span>Indexing Options</span>, click <strong>
<span>Settings</span></strong> under <strong>
<span>Search</span></strong>, and then click <strong>
<span>Indexing Options</span></strong></li></ul>
</li><li>In the <strong><span>Indexing Options</span></strong> dialog box, make sure that
<strong><span>Microsoft Outlook</span></strong> is listed in the
<strong>Included Locations</strong> column.</li><li>If <strong>Microsoft Office Outlook</strong> is not listed, click
<strong>Modify</strong>, and then click to enable the check box next to Outlook.</li><li>Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Close</span></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>To make sure that Outlook is configured to return results from the expected data files, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Outlook.</li><li>Click in the <strong><span>Search</span></strong> box.</li><li>Click the <strong><span>Search</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Search Tools</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Locations to Search</span></strong>.</li><li>Click to add or remove data files.</li></ol>
<p>We'll be waiting for your update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Number of items seems random and tends to increase, not decrease over time.</p>
<p>Outlooks is listed (of course) under Indexing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed archive, personal folders from search tools choice and it still comes back saying 103,783 ittems remain to be searched which is by far the highest number I've seen.</p>
<p>This may correlate to having switched from POP to IMAP recently but that was over 6 months ago and the problem only started a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I have a friend who also did the same thing when Verizon switched to AOL and began using IMAP.&nbsp; She saw the same
 problem at about the same time.&nbsp; Maybe it is an AOL problem?&nbsp; </p>
<p>This problem is obviously not unique and the various solutions I've seen posted by MS are generally NOT successful.&nbsp; I would gladly leave outlook but it has become archive over the years and would be hard to replace.&nbsp; I've assumed that somehing I paid for
 (Office) should provide better support than something that is free (Google, etc).&nbsp; Can someone out there please prove me correct in this case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx,</p>

<h2>            Never ever give your credit card number to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Well I have payment every month like a subscription that my credit card company confirm me came from Microsoft. Microsoft confirm me that it's for office, give them my email adresses, they said they can't find my subscription, gave them my credit card number
 where they take me money from, can't find my subscription (that I never took at first place) so they can't cancel my subscription or refund me, then told me the only thing I have to do is to call my credit card company who told me I have to cancel my credit
 card and give me a new one because they can't either stop the payment and only Microsoft can! What a scam! One of the biggest company in the world start to scam people! What a shame!</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">MSFT * E070033004 and <span>MSFT * E070037VWT appear on my credit card. If you have the same problem, complaint to the authority for that in your country</span></p>

            The problem of canceling your cc subscription, not being permitted by your cc company is as a result of your location/legal jurisdiction - its no problem to cancel over here

            It is because it seem that no one at Microsoft can find my subscription even with my credit card number. So no subscription, no cancellation possible. Only took money from my credit card seem possible...

            Read what was said, its everything to do with your location and the rules in place at your location<br />
In any case MS cannot locate a subscription if all you have is the cc number

            <p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact - MS can find your Microsoft Account / Transaction History / Subscription(s) by searching for the associated payment method (may it be PayPal or a debit/credit card).</p>
<p>If it is a purchase made through Microsoft Store, Xbox, Windows Store, or a running Office 365(Personal/Home)/Xbox Live/Groove Music/OneDrive&nbsp;subscription with a payment method attached&nbsp;-
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/contact/menu/billing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Accounts &amp; Billing support</a> can assist in this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not purchased through any of the above mentioned channels/is not one of the mentioned above services - they will however be unable to assist and you would need to contact the relevant department (which can be difficult if you do not know what product
 you are paying for).</p>

            They canot find anything I buy with them but they still able to find the way take money from my credit card. That is absolute hi-tech one way (their way). I have to insist to check with my credit card number and they said they don't find anything so I
 have to cancel my credit card. First time I call the guy told me I have a case number and that he will send me email to help me for my credit card refund. Never send me an email and when I call back, the case number does not exist. They just try to get rid
 of me hope I hang up and leave it for someone else at the customer service if I call back.&nbsp;Useless staff.

<h2>            Multi-level numbering in appendix headings</h2>
                    
<p>I have appendices in my document, A through H.&nbsp; Some have subsections, whose headings I want numbered.&nbsp; So, for example, in Appendix B there could be subsections with headings&nbsp;B1 and B2.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I would do this; so far in Word, I have only seen multi-level headings with numbers, not letters.</p>

<p>Hi hmmm</p>
<p>It's there :-) The numbering just needs to be customized.</p>
<p>Have you been using Heading numbering otherwise in the document? So Heading 1 is probably already linked with numbering?</p>
<p>In that case, it's usual to choose a much lower heading level (Heading 4 or Heading 5, for example) for Appendix headings.</p>
<p>What you'll want to do is to "Define a new list style" (bottom of the menu when you click the Multilevel list button). Click in a Heading, then choose this menu command.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the dialog box, enter a name for your numbering "scheme", such as List Headings.</p>
<p>Go to the bottom left, click Format and choose Numbering to bring up the Numbering dialog box. Click the "More" button at the bottom left.</p>
<p>Starting with level 1 (the list down the left side), check the setting for "Link level to style". Select the appropriate style (Heading 1, etc.) for each level you already have in your document.</p>
<p>When you get to the level you want to use for the Appendix main headings, select the corresponding Heading style. Then go to "Number style for this level" and select "A,B,C". You'll want to remove everything in "Enter formatting for the number" except the
 "A". You'll probably want to change the settings under "Position", as well.</p>
<p>When you get finished, you'll always want to change the style definition for the Heading styles you use in the appendix so that they look like the corresponding Heading style in the main part of the document.</p>

<h2>            ALT key combination causes Excel to stop working</h2>
                    <p>Weird problem.&nbsp; Many key stroke shortcuts using the ALT key cause Excel to stop working or to shutdown.&nbsp; I have tried ALT + and ALT , for different shortcuts and get the same thing.&nbsp; For instance, I tried ALT+P to go to the Page Layout tab.&nbsp; Message box
 comes up says Excel has stopped working.&nbsp; Sometimes Excel shuts down completely, sometimes it restarts. Using Office 365 Home, Windows 10, everything latest update.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I did a repair last night and restarted&nbsp; after it was complete.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; Not every ALT keystroke causes it to shutdown.&nbsp; ALT+ or ALT, A and P cause it to shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried using ALT, for some of these where previously
 I had used ALT+.&nbsp; I will keep trying and experimenting with these to find what may work.&nbsp; Or if anybody here has any thoughts I would appreciate it.&nbsp; I previously had used Excel 2010 and 2013.</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Professional Plus 3 days left to activate while I have an Office 365 home subscription.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting notifications for activation on Office 2016 Professional Plus, while I only have the subscription for Office 365, I have payed the bill successfully. So, do I have to worry about this? Will my Office continue to work as expected with editing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you ask, yes I tried to reinstall Office but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            JPGs not loading - only shown with a red x and warning.</h2>
                    <p>// Powerpoint 2008 mac, v. 12.3.2 /&nbsp;Mac OS X 10.7.2 /&nbsp;iMac 2.93 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB memory //</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Dear Forum,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am working on 200 to 300+ slides presentations and recently I got serious problems when opening my pptx-documents.</p>
<p>About 30% of the pictures are shown as a white square witch a
<b>big red x</b> and two kinds of error warnings&nbsp;(translating from german):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i>"The picture cannot be displayed. This computer possibly has not enough memory to open the picture, or that picture is damaged. If you start the computer again, open the file then again.&nbsp;If the
 red x still shows, you should delete and insert &nbsp;the picture again.</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i>"The picture element with the link-ID rld4 was not found."</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed that the error applies to the last third of slides in my presentation. But the amount of errors increases when I start a second presentation. Powerpoint then seems to have more problems
 to display all the slides correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to that, fonts in buttons of the powerpoint interface sometimes show incorrectly or&nbsp;disappear completely. When I try to touch or replace these pics powerpoint will crash. Restarting the
 computer helps sometimes (i think, especially when I delete all the content in caches folders before I restart the Mac) and the file may open perfectly but an hour later the same problem reoccurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like the problem does not concern a specific file but every file I try to open and it feels very much like a memory problem - but my iMac has 16 GB of memory which should be enough.</p>
<p>I appreciate every hint to solve the issue as I do not feel save to continue working on my presentations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Titus</p>

            <p>You really have to go out of your way to get an image to link rather than embed, and the error msg you reported:</p>
<p><i>"The picture element with the link-ID rld4 was not found."</i></p>
<p>almost certainly doesn't apply to a user-created image link.&nbsp; It's more likely a reference to the way PPT stores images internally.&nbsp; For example, if you insert an image normally (and NOT linked), it's embedded.&nbsp; If you copy/paste that image or in some cases,
 insert the same image again into the same presentation, PPT doesn't store another copy of the image, it references the original copy of the image as an internal link (the kind it's complaining about here).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It can get quite complex when you, say, insert an image, copy it to some other slides, select one of the images on another slide, copy it elsewhere and so on.&nbsp; Now the images link back to links that link to other links and finally back to the original stored
 image.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Normally PPT sorts all this out reliably, even when you delete a slide out of the middle of this "chain of links".&nbsp; But sometimes it loses track, which could lead to the error message you're seeing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>If your images are huge (any larger than necessary to fill the sceen space they'll be using) you might want to create a downsampled set of them and use those in PPT.</p>
<p>If you have access to a Windows version of PPT, try round-tripping the file to HTML and back; that can repair mild corruption in some cases.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>HTML "Round-tripping" to repair corruption<br />

<p>CMYK images or images with embedded color profiles can make PowerPoint unhappy as well.&nbsp; Convert all images to RGB and make sure your image editing software, if any, hasn't embedded a profile.</p>
