            <p>Hey there mgrabowski3!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the update issues! i moved your thread to our Xbox 360 support forum for better visibility.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, try running the update while plugged into ethernet, sometimes that error can be a result of a poor wireless signal. If that dos not help, follow each of the steps on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/system-update-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 Update Help</a> page to try to get the update rolling.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after trying each of the steps listed in that guide, I strongly recommend&nbsp;<span>contacting our chat and phone support agents through our&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact Us</span></a><span>&nbsp;page.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps! :)</span></p>

<h2>            multiplayer glitch</h2>
                    
<p>Why does the game glitch occasionally in multiplayer? mid game,usually during an attack or defend,the game will just stop,and say someone is watching damage affects,even if they do not have them on. then the game will not start untill people leave the game,which
 is really annoying. it happened to my friend and i am still in the game, which is why i am typing this. it happened to me on multiple occasions in magic 2013 and its happened to me a few times in magic 2014. is there anyway to fix this or stop it?? please
 respond</p>

                </div>

<p>The one mono white deck has a flying 1/1 with double strike that causes the glitch to occur. Not sure if its that card or the double strike but about half the time that card attacks it causes the glitch. Not sure about other causes for it.</p>

<p>This glitch occurs when the game has a connection lag and someone skips or continues and the console and host have different game states. That is why when it resolves it displays "game syncing."</p>
<p>To prevent it happening due to you: when &nbsp;you cannot place a card, activate an ability, or use highlighted features do not press Y</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Gen2 bumpers not fit for purpose</h2>
                    <p>Quite simply,&nbsp;the bumpers in the gen2 controller including the "elite" are not fit for purpose!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The fact that they're even in the standard controller is bad enough but to also have that same flimsy, cheap and substandard component in the ¬£120 "elite" controller is,&nbsp;quite frankly, disgusting.</p><p><br /></p><p>I am about to return my 6th elite to the retailer in as many months.

            <p>Hey there C0ldM0use.<br /><br />Really sorry to hear about your Xbox Elite Controller troubles! 6 replacements in 6 months certainly isn't normal, and as a gamer who uses his Elite controller on a day-to-day basis, I&nbsp;personally haven't experienced any issues with my launch day controller. So that we can best help out, can you clarify what's going on with the bumpers of your controller?</p>

<h2>            My skype account was hijacked</h2>
                    <p>Dear all</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend let me known yesterday&nbsp;that my account was hijacked. I haven't&nbsp;used it for a while.</p>
<p>The hacker changed the email address and photo.</p>
<p>I received a message from Skype informing me about it on 27.03. I just read this message yesterday.</p>
<p>I followed the steps to recover my account, but I received the message the data is insufficient&nbsp;and I need to file the case again.</p>
<p>I did it. Luckily&nbsp;I still&nbsp;had open&nbsp;skype&nbsp;on old phone without internet access so I took a photo of my setting details like email, date of birth, friends etc.</p>
<p>I input them as it was requested but got a message that it was not recognized, I believe the hacker changed all the details in the meantime.</p>
<p>I am very concerned as there were lots of photos of my baby in the conversations. I am worried it can be used in the wrong way ......
</p>
<p>Pls can you assist me to recover access to my account?&nbsp;Much appreciated</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have received the screen shots that we've requested. Upon further checking, indeed that the email address has been changed. Can you open this link "<em><strong>account.live.com/addASSOCID</strong></em>"? And kindly follow the provided steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the email is updated. Kindly open this link: <strong>https://secure.skype.com/portal/profile&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>And then, update all the information saved on the account and click on SAVE.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Make sure that you still have access to the account you were trying to recover.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if that works.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;LisaS6,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the screen shots you've provided, it seems that you were automatically signed in to Microsoft and Skype using your email address. The live account is using your email address as its user name. In addition, Skype has been integrated as a Microsoft
 service, when a customer logs in to Skype using an email address (which is not yet associated to any old Skype account) instead of the Skype ID, this automatically creates a<em><strong>new Skype Account</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to sign out and <em><strong>manually sign back</strong></em> in using the
<em><strong>Skype user name </strong></em>you are trying to recover. Then, follow the steps provided on the screen for you to update the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply!</p>

<p><span>Hi LisaS6,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for replying!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Just to let you know why our account recovery process is very strict and hard to pass is because Microsoft wants to secure our customer‚Äôs personal information as it has billing, personal and purchased products information. We are
 very mindful about this data and we always make sure we secure this. The account recovery form is also the best way you can regain access on your account. This is the reason why we are asking our customers to be extra careful with the information provided
 in the account set-up process and always update the security information added in the account so they can easily recover it in case they forgot their account password or in case on any compromised account. In addition, I acknowledge that you had this account
 for quite some time and this is definitely worth another attempt to recover the affected account. You can keep submitting the form up to
<em><strong>2 times per day.</strong></em> If all else fails, we'll resort to the last option which is to create a brand new account so you can start fresh. Also I have some tips to provide that would give you a higher chance in passing our account recovery
 form:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The odds of passing the Account Recover process increase if you would fill out this form from a computer that has successfully signed into that account previously.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The odds of passing also increase if you go through this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While you should fill out as many fields as possible, even if you are not 100% sure or accurate, they do not need to fill out the whole form, just the fields that they know apply to their account. Just to let you know that filling
 out more information on the form increases your chance of passing the password reset request.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I encourage you to keep trying to recover your account using the methods we‚Äôve tried if you remember any new details that might help. Make sure to always provide accurate information on the form. You may also check your previous
 emails from Skype if that has something to do with the orders.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In regards to your hacked account, you may ask your friends to report it as abusive user so that our security settings would automatically trigger the suspension of your account and so that hacker will no longer be able to access it. Steps on how to
 report a contact is provided on this link:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10001/</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you have any questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reply!</span></p>

<p>Dear Rain, I am deeply sad and about to cry. I tried so many times already to pass recovery of my password. I put correct data as I sent you. But the sytem is rejecting them. I believe hacker changed them</p>
<p>I had this account for so many years I dont want a new one. This account holds so many of my valuable conversations, photos &nbsp;and friends details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like Microsoft is supporting hakers in this case&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I trusted in your companx I bought monthly subscription and you basically leaving me with no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I start campaign on social media to recover my account and all my personal data?????</p>
<p>

            Your issue quite unique and because of the amount of devices, its probably best you try seeking donations to purchase the three licenses for each device.

<p>the tuner is the best option if it has a composite in, you can just connect it directly and for sound a female RCA -&gt; male 3.5mm will do just fine</p>
<p>for a direct setup, get a composite-&gt;vga cable and you will probably need an RCA -&gt; whatever speakers you have.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p><p><br /></p><p>It sounds like your account may not own the game digitally, was there another account that may have purchased the game instead that is on your Xbox One? Are you able to see the purchase on the Gamertag you're posting from on our <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Commerce page</a>? If you do not see the purchase on that page, the account you're posting from may not own the game. The&nbsp; best route to take for license issues will be our chat support team on our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#5:0:4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page, who will be able to let you know if you do own the game digitally or not.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also do keep in mind that we work oldest to newest, and bumping your thread may increase the amount of time it takes for us to respond. Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft - Pointing Drawing - Microsoft Hardware USB Mouse</h2>
                    <p>This is one really big annoyance in Windows 10.</p>
<p>a) having given update in the update list</p>
<p>b) it says it can't be installed - offers manual install</p>
<p>c) there is no clear way to ignore this update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found any information what this update would offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, most important thing is: I use a Logitech mouse and I am not interested in any Microsoft Mouse driver update at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to force Windows to ignore this update once and for all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fine with Windows 10 in general but not being able to ignore selected updates is a big architecture fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as we are on it, if those dialogs would visually seperate links to bing and local setting "links" that would be great. I am not interested in bing links to general stuff and I hate it if a settings page opens a browser window to list stuff nobody is
 intersted in.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Windows updates are automatic and there is no such option to stop or deny an update on Windows 10. I suggest you to install the windows update as Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works,

<p>
</p><p>My answers to your questions:</p>
<p>No update number, since Windows 10 just shows (even on "Details" page) "Microsoft - Pointing Drawing - Microsoft Hardware USB Mouse" Waiting for install...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it does show: "Microsoft - Keyboard - Microsoft Hardware USB Keyboard" &nbsp;Waiting for install...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, I've been running windows 7 for a while now. Here recently I just moved. We have a lynksys router. Sometimes my computer will be connected to the internet and sometimes not. But today is one of the days where the internet is not working. I have tried
 various methods and am stumped. I can connect to the network...but have no internet connection while every other machine in the house runs fine. When trying to do the "ipconfig /release ipconfig /renew" method I get an error message along the lines of "actin
 cannot be performed while it's media is disconnected." I have no idea wtf it is talking about. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. This is so frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Let me recap.</p>
<p>There is a Wireless Router and few computers, the other computers working OK and have Internet connection.</p>
<p>Your computer does not. You state the computer can connect to the Network, how do you know that it cam I.e., what you actually do that indicates that it is connected to the Network.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p><strong>If connected to the Network it should have a valid IP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />
<br />
Typical TCP/IP status looks like this.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Description is the card manufacturing data.<br />
<br />
Physical address is the card's MAC number.<br />
<br />
The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).<br />
<br />
yy should be from 0 to 255<br />
<br />
zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.<br />
<br />
The lease date should be valid to the current time.<br />
<br />
*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.<br />
<br />
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
Can you please post the info in the entries that are shown on the Details screen (Copy the list bellow and paste it into a new post, type in the info as shown on your computer).<br />

    <title>Unable to install from MSI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install from MSI</h2>
                    I am not able to install anything(MSI) on my Windows 7 RC. It always says Windows Installer is busy or not available. But I&nbsp;confirmed no other installation(including windows update) is going on. This happens even I restart the system. Also I am not able
 to stop or restart Windows Installer service(options seems be disabled).&nbsp; I desperately want to install latest Silverlight and VS 2008 SP1

            Seems like I got the real culprit :)<br />
<br />
I first disabled all the services using system configuration tool and manually started the windows installer service after system reboot. This time I tried to install Nokia PCSuite. Nokia installer reported me that an installation for Microsoft Visual Studio
 for Application 2.0 is currently suspended and I must undo the changes before the current installation to continue. I said Ok. Though the undo operation failed(may be because i cleared the installer folder as part of troubleshooting ), the Nokia PCSuite installation
 continued and completed without any error.<br />
<br />
Then I started other services one by one and found one service to be culprit. There is one .NET Runtime optimization Servcie v4.0 causing this problem. In one attempt, I could install one more software after stopping this service(there was one msiexe process
 running, even after I stopped this service.&nbsp; I manually "killed" this process using Task manager). But for the subsequent installation, I faced the same problem. When checked, I found that this service got started again. So finally I disabled this service
 and never faced the problem again. <br />
<br />
And the end of the story is that I moved back to Windows 7 RC again :)<br />

<p>Your actual problem, I think, is that you've lost your Administrator account. I can't find a Win 10 thread about it. But here is one that started in the year&nbsp;2010 (Win 7) &amp; did continue to 2015...</p>

<p>In Windows 7 my administrator account has somehow got set to 'guest' so I have lost all administrator access rights on my Dell laptop</p>

<h2>            Female Gamers&#58; XBox LIVE Easter Eggs</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>Alright so!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My name is Christina (SN: TINA DARLING), and I am looking to play with other female gamers. Sure I'll add nearly anyone, but I so nearly desprately crave to play with fellow female gamers. Being in parties dominated by males is fun an' all but being
 the ONLY female in any given game gets a little old after a while. So please, if you're a female gamer please do not hesitate to shoot me a message! I can be super nice and am ALWAYS willing to help out my fellow gamers.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P.S. (painfully random side-note...)</strong></p>
<p><strong>TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY OUT THERE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Even if you're not a female gamer it would be nice to play with fellow LGBT (***, ***, bi-sexual, transsexual/transgender) Gamers. Before I practically fell of the face of video-game world I had several fun friends that I could acutally and literally
 relate too. I miss the days of flirting with fellow women all the while talking fashion with my *** friends.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LOVE,</strong></p>
<p><strong>TINA DARLING</strong></p>

    <title>Whole monitor goes black during Skype calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miss_nikki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Whole monitor goes black during Skype calls</h2>
                    Just within this last week (possibly after latest Skype update), my entire computer screen goes black every few seconds during all Skype video calls. If I keep the mouse moving, it will stay lit and active, but even then, occasionally the screen does not
 come back to full brightness. I use Skype frequently for business purposes and need this resolved! Help?

            You were having monitor blackout issues in Skype, which is definitely not positive. Trying an alternate cable usually would be worth trying.&nbsp; Since you have a laptop this would be more difficult, as it would be internal (if you are not using an external
 monitor).&nbsp; In regards to anything else, you may want to see if there are any adjustments you can make in the newer drivers, to see if anything changes.&nbsp; Your remaining option is to contact Toshiba/AMD and find a release of drivers that do not exhibit these
 flaws.&nbsp; In the end, the problem appears to be driver/hardware-related.<br />

    <title>Close Apps gesture not recognised - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Close Apps gesture not recognised</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Lenovo S20-30 Touch notebook running windows 8.1. </p>
<p>However the standard gesture to close open apps (swipe down&nbsp;from top of screen)&nbsp;does not work - all other gestures work normally.</p>
<p>The only way to close apps is to use the keyboard short cuts or the mouse to click the 'X' in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Please can anyone advise is there a setting or option to disable/enable this gesture?</p>
<p>Is it possibly a 'feature' of this lenovo&nbsp;version of Windows&nbsp;8.1 (although this seams unlikely)?</p>
<p>Any other suggestions or troubleshooting tips...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help / advice.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Adrian,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing us. I understand that you are unable to use close open apps gesture on your Windows 8.1 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get a better understanding of the issue, I want to know:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Were you able to use close app gesture before without any issues?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please follow the method below and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install the latest Windows Updates in Clean Boot state.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine
 if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you boot the machine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer the link to perform clean boot:</span></strong><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install latest Windows Updates.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check for Windows Updates and install all the important and optional updates.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in method 3, check the section

<p>
</p><p>I have tried the troubleshooting steps requested above but unfortunately the issue is unchanged. All the available windows and office updates have been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used a clean boot as described but still apps cannot be closed using the touch gesture. I can confirm that the only changes made to the PC since new were to install Microsoft Office 2010 and Norton 360 and to remove a few unwanted apps supplied by
 Lenovo in the base build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The close gesture has never worked on this PC (I have only had it for 48 hours) but I have other Windows 8.1 laptops where it works normally.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Adrian,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply. I appreciate for the troubleshooting steps you have tried so far.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing could be caused if the antivirus program installed on your computer is blocking some features of Windows to function properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To check the issue
<strong>disable the antivirus program</strong> and test the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>When you disable Antivirus:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your
 computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet
 or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For temporary purpose you can disable the antivirus program and later enable it.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For most Antivirus programs, there is an icon
<strong>next to the clock in the task bar</strong>, you should be able to <strong>
right click</strong> the icon and either be able to disable it from there or you can go into the options and disable it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If the issue still persists, you can turn on your
 Antivirus program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> If you have the
<strong>license key for Norton 360</strong> antivirus <strong>you may also try uninstalling the antivirus temporarily and check the issue.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>If the issue doesn‚Äôt get fix after uninstalling the antivirus, reinstall the antivirus program</span></strong><span>
 and let us know the results.</span></p>

<p>I think W8 should have had some training apps for stuff like this.&nbsp; Then we would know things like position, speed and direction in order to perform these things "correctly".&nbsp; Otherwise, as it is in our "discoverable" UI, we get to flail around until we
 find out through experimentation what works and what doesn't.&nbsp; That may be fun to some but with&nbsp;no feedback concerning our failed attempts it is just an irritating source of frustration for many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I think what works for me is to swipe down as if I was trying to raise the Options bar, e.g. when working with MUF IE its Address bar and tabs will appear,&nbsp;and then keep going until it shrinks and then keep going until you get to the bottom and then
 (optionally) hold and wait while it flips over and then (optionally) either keep going until it's gone or have second thoughts about the command and drag it back up.&nbsp; So, rather than "fast and fluid" I would say my motions for this gesture are "slow and deliberate".</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is the key issue... using the touch screen I cannot drag&nbsp;any app&nbsp;from the top of the screen - the downward swipe (slow / fast and all speeds in between) is not recognised. When on the desktop nothing happens as I swipe down the screen.
 the only way to get to the metro start screen is by using the keyboard&nbsp;or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have made clear before if I use the mouse to 'click and drag' from the top of the screen it behaves correctly - ie initially shrinks the app so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;can then be dragged to the bottom of the screen, if held at the bottom of the screen it flips
 over and closes the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also run the troubleshooter as suggested. It has reset the Windows store but not impacted this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new user has no effect either.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately I have tried a number of times to get this work correctly on this laptop - with no success. I have a number of other Windows 8.1 laptops where it works OK - so I do believe it is a specific to this laptop. (it is a new machine I have brought

<p>

<p>I have tried the suggestions provided by the other contributors to this thread (thanks to all for your support) but unfortunately no change.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reinstalled the graphics driver (it was already using the latest version) and also updated the BIOS and other drivers to the latest published versions from the Lenovo support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided further information too about the fact that it is only the touch gesture that doesn't work - you can use click and drag with the mouse.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Error message - Oregon Trail stopped working and close the program.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Oregon trail 5th edition with vista.</p>
<p>I can't get my oregon trail to work on window vista. I already tried changing the&nbsp;compatibly&nbsp;mode to run on widows 98, but I still get a error message that Oregon Trail stopped working and to close the program. Is there anything else I need to do to get
 the game to work?&nbsp;</p>

            I did finally get the game to work by rolling back the display adapter driver to an earlier version, but that in itself was more trouble. I couldn't get it to go back to the way it was before. I finally just installed the lasted driver, but now it won't
 let me roll it back again to play the game. &nbsp;When I searched the internet it seems there are several&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;problems with playing Oregon Trail on Vista. Is there a way a could use the old display to play the game without messing with my current screen
 settings?

            Had the same issue. I was running it on i5 1st gen 2.3 ghz processor with 8 gb mem and was really surprised at how slow it is. I checked all the drivers and they were installed properly and even then clicking on contra would take 5 seconds for the window
 to pop-up, some games that i play started lagging and even the browser performance degraded. A horrible experience all together. No wonder it was a free upgrade. I just reverted back to windows 8.1.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform a clean boot and also uncheck all the startup items. Then check which startup item is causing the issue (Step 4 in the following link), uncheck the box for that item and it will not be loaded the next time you start your computer.</p>

<p>I'm getting the same thing. &nbsp;I had died on a mission, the screen went black except for the yellow "saving game" icon in the upper right corner of the screen. &nbsp;I waited a few minutes for something to happen before finally going back to the dashboard to start
 the game again. &nbsp;Ever since, the game hangs on the "setting up profile".</p>
<p>Please let me know if you figure this out.</p>

<p>Had the same problem, it's not the game you need to hard reset your console.</p>
<p>Hold down the console power button until the light on the power box turns orange, then unplug the cord 10 seconds. Power back up and you should be right as rain. &nbsp;If TV is setup to come on automatically you will have to turn it on.</p>

<p>it worked for me too but that's such a load of crap having to unplug my console I should be able to hard reboot it without unplugging the machine. &nbsp;That plug is not designed to be used like an on-off switch I've had to do that more than once during the time
 I've owned my xbox one</p>

<p>You don't need to unplug your xbox anymore, just restarting the cache works just as well. Did it now with the bug I just got. Works for me.</p>

<p>That thing is a piece of junk. &nbsp;If I were you I would take it back and get the TX. &nbsp;The TX is a much better quality built wheel. &nbsp;I have had both and am glad I took it back and got the TX because I have not regretted it once.</p>

<p>Any wheel is far better then using a controller so enjoy it but consider getting a wheel stand pro for it because if it's not mounted right it can be a pain in the but.
</p>
<p>I got a wheel stand pro for my Logitech wheel and love it there about 150$-200$ but well worth it very solid.</p>
