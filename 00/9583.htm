</p><blockquote>I have a new web server, with a new ip address (new to me, obviously).
<div>It seems my IP was in the past used to send spam, and so it is blocked by all of Microsoft's domains(live, hotmail, msn). Even though it is now clean, and any blacklist check returns so, such as mxtoolbox.</div>

<div>I have had my server host fill it out. they have done it multiple times, we have waited for more than 2 months, and microsoft won't even reply to let me know what the problem is, or how it can be fixed. what can i do when they are being so uncooperative?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>it'd be different if we had actually done something wrong, but this is by no fault of our own and we are being told by our server company to just switch ips. we've already rectified any problems with every other recipient, i'd really like to not switch
 to another ip and potentially rehash so many issues. as i said we are clean on blacklists, just microsoft is deciding to block us AND not give us any reason or even response.</div>

            <p>I am adding my message here because we are experiencing the same problem listed by the original poster. We are a public school district and it is imperative that our teachers communicate with the parents, some of whom have outlook.com, live.com, msn.com
 or Hotmail.com accounts. I've opened a ticket with Microsoft, got asked the same questions as you posed, but never heard back again. The mail server queue shows errors such as SNT004-MC3F54, BAY004-MC4F7, BAY004-MC2F19 and in the case of Hotmail.com, no errors
 or bounce back messages at all!</p>
<p>We have no problems communicating with yahoo.com, gmail.com or Comcast.net subscribers. Please unblock our domain - cwcboe.org - else, we would be forced to ask parents to not use an Microsoft supplied email account when communicating with our District.
</p>
<p>Thank you for the attention to this matter,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that this is causing an inconvenience on your part due to the need for constant communication to parents using Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also understand that this issue is not occuring when you send an email to other email provider users such as Yahoo, Gmail and Comcast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be happening because the Microsoft system is not recognizing the IP or your domain and is treating it as spam. This feature prevents unwated spams from reaching customer's mailbox. To request for whitelisting please use this

            <p>I've already explained a number of times that we are a PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT in need of emailing parents, some of whom have students with disabilities. Microsoft's unwillingness to assist in this case is putting students at risk!!! You are sending me to
 an URL (the e-form which you refer to in your reply) which is useless and irrelevant. It asks for "<span>Are you currently a Return Path client?", "</span><span>Are you in the Junk Mail Reporting Partner Program?",
 "</span><span>Are you currently a Return Path client?", etc. What are you talking about??</span></p>
<p><span>The issue is simple: you have our domain on your block/SPAM list and it shouldn't be. Please unlist/de-block us so that our teachers and Principals can communicate with the parent population, the same we do with those that have
 Yahoo, AOL, Comcast or Gmail accounts. How come they are receiving emails from us but those on MSN, Live, Outlook or Hotmail don't?</span></p>
<p><span>The messages in the server queue clearly show that emails from us are delayed or refused. Please do whatever is necessary to correct this situation to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. Thank you,</span></p>

            <p>It's not clear to me why you felt it necessary to hijack someone else's thread rather than posting your own question. It's not certain that users who may have been subscribed to the thread you hijacked would be particularly interested in receiving notifications
 about your posts and responses to them.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>Submitting the form presupposes that you are fulfilling all of the requirements detailed on the

<p>
</p><p>I don't think you really expect Microsoft to allocate support resources on some sort of perceived assessment of need. What may seem important to you may mean very little to someone else, while you might be supremely indifferent to what someone else finds
 of paramount importance. Each case will be considered individually; those with complete documentation of their having fulfilled the requirements will of course pass quicker through the mill.</p>

            <p>Interesting thread. I experience the same problems as the OP and Lucian. I never send bulk email or unsolicited emails, I have signed up long ago for the JMRP and SNDS programs, we comply with all the Microsoft policies and guidelines, we are not on any
 blacklist and use a dedicated IP on a DV server. It is not new, we have been using it for years. Yet, our emails to clients with Microsoft domains (hotmail, live, outlook, msn) routinely do not get delivered. No error message or error code, it just does not
 arrive. I have completed the Sender Information form for Outlook.com delivery multiple times, and the result is always the same, I get a reply back saying Microsoft can see no reason why my emails are not being delivered. Have checked my mail logs, no spam
 going out from my server. Still, our email replies to clients who enquire via a hotmail or live or outlook address do not get delivered, unless I use a different outgoing mail (smtp) server, such as my ISP's outgoing mail server. Which shows that my own mail
 server IP is still being blocked by Microsoft, although nobody can seem to identify the problem or tell me how to fix it.</p>
<p>I did post a separate question about it also, but thought I should reply here in view of the response that Lucian has received. Pretty much sums up the Microsoft attitude. "It may be a perceived problem for you, but it is not a problem for us".&nbsp; That's essentially
 what Noel Burgess was saying.</p>
<p>We, too, routinely now ask our clients to avoid using Microsoft email domains because of delivery issues - we always ask for an alternative address. No problems with gmail and other free, non-Microsoft email domains.</p>

<h2>            Excel converts telephone number to formula</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can export customer uk mobile telephone number (starts 07) from my till software into a csv file. As the number starts with a zero it omits this and starts with a 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file can then be uploaded to a seperate app to bulk text my customers. But something needs to be done to make it start with the correct number before i do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what ive tried:</p>
<p>formula: ='44'&amp;(cell number)&nbsp;</p>
<p>creates an entry that is not a number and thus not recognised by the bulling texting app. Ive also tried =44&amp;(cell number) with the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Formula: current number + 440000000000. Eg&nbsp;</p>
<p>7412345678 to 447412345678. 44 is the internal dialibg code for the UK and would work. Unfortunately this is 12 dugits which means excel changes it to a formula 😔 &nbsp;If i format the cell to number or custom format it shows the correct number but csv doesn't
 support formatting 😤</p>
<p>

            Hi Mark:

My name is Ron.

You don't say what version of Office / Excel you are using so I have to guess. And unfortunately this feature is one that is in the process of being changed by MS.

What you need to do is customize the data while you are importing the CSV.  What you have to do is identify the column as Text rather than General.  This page describes the process in general for versions prior to 365/2016. When you start the data import through File Open the CSV file it triggers the "Text Import Wizard"
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba

On the second screen of the text importer you define "delimiters", the separator inserted between columns. Typically this will be commas or tabs.  When you a valid separator, the preview window will show the columns it thinks you want to define.  On the third screen of the importer you can click on a column the define the data format.  So you would click on the phone number co

</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4e7e17b-eb5a-485a-ad6d-5c2bf277a8ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4e7e17b-eb5a-485a-ad6d-5c2bf277a8ec" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is in Outlook 2016 on my older machine running Win7. &nbsp;Hover your mouse over an email message and a cross appears as per the pic above so you can quickly delete it. &nbsp;Fantastic and saves loads of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my new machine it's gone and has moved to the other side of the screen as part of a toolbar, in yellow again. &nbsp;See pic below. &nbsp;Hovering over the email message doesn't bring anything up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39016fd9-83b7-42e9-8647-6eb646151b43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39016fd9-83b7-42e9-8647-6eb646151b43" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to remove toolbar on the right (highlighted in yellow) &nbsp;and restore the shortcuts to the message column in pic one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked that I am running exactly the same versions of Outlook on both machines and I am. &nbsp;The version is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.7571.7095) 32-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to change this toolbar, I'd be most grateful to know because it is so annoying to have lost it with a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            Hello AlexandreBorges4,
<br />
<br />Thank you for posting in the forum. I am an independant advisor and I will try to help you, solving the issue.
<br />Are you syncing your OneNote in OneDrive? Can you login to a different PC and check if the same happens there?
<br />Can you make sure, that you have the latest version of OneNote installed: <a href="https://www.onenote.com/download/?MajorVer=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.onenote.com/download/?MajorVer=14</a>
<br />
<br />Regards,

            <p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The ieframe.dll DLL file is related to Internet Explorer. In many cases, the installation of Internet Explorer causes ieframe.dll errors to appear. Other causes include viruses, certain Windows Updates, incorrect firewall settings, outdated security software
 applications, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly, follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>Run Internet Explorer in no add-on mode and check.<br />
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and then type
<strong>iexplore -extoff</strong> and press Enter.</span></span></span> </p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b. Now, check the issue. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><br />
If you are not receiving any error messages now, then, follow the steps provided to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer to the article: <strong>Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11</a><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, please reset Internet Explorer settings to it's default settings.<br />
Refer to the article: </p>
<p><strong>Change or reset Internet Explorer settings <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings#ie=ie-11<br />
</a></p>
<p><strong>Important:&nbsp; </strong>The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>

Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, we will be able to assist you further.</p>

                    Hi, I have recently synced my gmail and outlook accounts. Since i did this, my outlook account has stopped recieving certain mails, however they are going to my synced gmail account. All mails are being sent to and from my outlook email address, so it
 has nothing to do with being sent to the gmail address. Anyone else have the same problems? Has me stumpted!!

            Since you say you configured gmail to pull messages from Outlook.com, you should have seen it when you configured it. &nbsp;It's one of the options on the second screen when setting up the account. &nbsp;Log into gmail, then click Settings&gt;Settings&gt;Accounts and
 check the account configuation.

<h2>            Strong password, 2 factor auth enabled &#40;for a long time&#41;, and still seeing successful automatic IMAP Sync from other countries.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm posting this here because the 'support' links just lead in circles of template answers without giving me an option to pose the question directly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed *all* the recommended protocols but recently I've been seeing 'successful sync' for automated IMAP sync from Russia, China, Vietnam and Malaysia on my outlook.com account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After changing passwords I see subsequent unsuccessful sync from Sweden and China.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even assuming one of my devices is compromised (Malwarebytes and Windows Defender indicate they aren't) then I still need to know:</p>
<p>a) how does someone copy my inbox from a device in a country I have never visited without 2 factor Authentication being triggered and a message to my phone?</p>
<p>b) why was I not informed of suspicious activity at the time it happened rather than 4 weeks later after multiple successful sync&nbsp;attempts?</p>
<p>c) what, if anything will MS do to ensure it doesn't happen again?</p>
<p>d) what investigations are likely to take place as a result of this report?</p>
<p>e) is there any way to confirm what 'level' of sync was successful? (ie: did it sync the entire mailbox or a few emails?)</p>
<p>

<h2>            OneNote on Android &#47; Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014</h2>
                    I use S-Pen on my Samsung Galaxy Note to take notes. &nbsp;I use OneNote for Android. &nbsp;I take notes using the stylus and then convert to text. &nbsp;Once in text format, I would like to upload them to a OneNote notebook. &nbsp;I copy the text into the clipboard. &nbsp;When
 I try to paste the text into OneNote for Android, it doesn't work. &nbsp;What I have found that works is to export the text from S-Pen to a Dropbox txt file, then I go into OneNote on my laptop and import the txt file. &nbsp;Finally, I have to take the txt file in OneNote
 and clean it up. &nbsp;That is a lot of work. &nbsp;It would be a lot nicer if I could just copy/paste directly into OneNote. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas on how to do this better?

            I figured it out.&nbsp; When you are going to type into OneNote, you have to hold down the alternate keyboard key a little longer.&nbsp; Then the handwriting keyboard will pop up, and you can write and the text goes right in.&nbsp; Makes the whole process a lot easier.&nbsp;
 You can also use the swype keyboard with the stylus, which works pretty well too.

Interesting.&nbsp;

<div>Presumably handwriting / drawing directly into onenote doesn't work? &nbsp;What about pictures - have you been able to paste any pictures with the pen?</div>

            No option to choose this. Skype should include a function called Dynamic mode, which automatically select who's talking during the call and enlarges them.

<h3> bnftzptrck  say:</h3>
<h2>            n95 text problems</h2>
                    how do all.<br />
<br />
got a n95 with 1gig mem card. pretty standard. sometime ago i lent it to a friend, who put in their SIM card, so as to send texts [her phone was broken]. since doin so, my phone will not let me send texts. i can receive them, and still use calls normally, but
 not send texts. this is hacking me off.<br />
<br />
when i go to send one, it takes a while, does nothing, the comes up with a red exclamation mark, telling me the text didnt send. theres an option for 'details', which then tells me, helpfully, that the message didnt send. nothing more.<br />
<br />
does anyone know what I can do? this is really a pain in the neck.<br />
<br />
you stay classy,<br />

<h2>            Font changes and becomes TINY when Replying to Emails </h2>
                    I see that a few other people have asked this in the past but I do not see an answer that works.&nbsp; All of a sudden while in Outlook, when I hit Reply to an email all of the text becomes extremely small- like 4 point or so.&nbsp; So the body of the original email
 that I am replying to, my signature and anything I am trying to type for the Reply is miniscule.&nbsp; I have had this happen to me once before.&nbsp; I think I might have hit some key stroke combination accidentally or something.&nbsp; Eventually - after weeks - i noticed
 it had somehow magically resolved itself.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this?

            Is it really 4 pt or just looks tiny? The usual cause is the zoom setting. Correct it by clicking the zoom button or hold ctrl and roll the mouse when, then immediately close the message - do not send - and the change will stick on all new messages - if
 you send it instead of closing, the changes only affect the current message.

<h2>            Office Pro 2016 CD version</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know of a legitimate source that sells a full version of MS Office Pro 2016 on CD/DVD. I need to install this OS on a stand-alone computer that's not connected to the Internet.</p>

<p>The OP would need to download the installation file on a PC that is internet connected, and then use phone activation, when installing on the other PC</p>
<p>But the problem then arises in that Office calls home every 30 days or so to verify the license, and if the license is not verified then office eventually goes int reduced mode.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent advisor that Microsoft asked to assist customers. I'm an experienced user of Office but do not speak for Microsoft. I've been assisting my fellow users for more than 20 years. I hope I can help you.
<br />
<br />It has been mentioned that users are having problems with version 16.9 and higher of Office. Office for the Mac has undergone dramatic changes in Office 365. Developers are trying hard to make the Mac and Windows versions have the same or equivalent features. They are making real progress. However, fixing one thing sometimes breaks others.
<br />
<br />You can use the User Feedback feature to let them know if they've broken something. There may be a fix coming soon. I’d suggest checking for updates - it may take several tries for Office to recognize that there is an update, so try checking a few times.
<br />
<br />In the meantime, I suggest using a previous update version until it is fixed.
<br />
<br />To do that, you’ll need to uninstall the current version, download the old version, and install it.
<br />
<br />Here are the instructions on how to uninstall for Mac:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-2016-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>.
<br />
<br />Here is the link to install the latest stable version:

<br />
<br />Here is a link to allow you to choose an earlier release:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-go-back-to-office-2016-for-mac-15-xx-versions-from-16-xx-e88ed6c8-6fb4-40a1-9540-529000d3d20f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>.
<br />
<br />Here is a link to UserVoice to let the developers know what is causing you problems:
<br /><a href="https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel...</a>.
<br />
<br />I hope this information helps. Do let me know if you have any more questions or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Is your phone software up to date? Go to <strong>settings&gt;update &amp; security&gt;phone update
</strong>and check for pending updates. Try to download apps over WiFi. If the problem persists, restart your phone. Press &amp; hold volume down and power button until manufacturer logo appears.

<p>Hi Teylyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answer is very close to what I need.&nbsp; Thanks! The only issue is that I simplified my example with only Hi-Mid-Lo, when in reality I have like 20 different values to look up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance it can be done without adding 20 values and its 20 conversions in the array?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you need to sort the data in H:I to be ascending by the value in column H. Then you can plug the ranges into the Lookup function instead of typing them in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(LOOKUP($B$3:$F$5,$H$2:$H$4,$I$2:$I$4)*(A3:A5=B9)*((B1:F1=A9)*B2:F2))</p>

<p>Ashish, with all due respect, but your solution only works if the formula is <strong>
in the same row</strong> as the <strong>name</strong>. Maybe that is not what tabspace is after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if the user has a dashboard where they select name and weekday, then my approach will work fine. But knowing you, I'm sure you can come up with something for that scenario, too! :)</p>

<p>Thank you for clarifying and your kind words.&nbsp; You are probably correct.&nbsp; However, I will wait for tabspace to clarify.&nbsp; I can tweak my formula to take care of that scenario if the situation demands.</p>

                    <p>I want to be able to create pdfs and save then in the same location as ThisWorkbook. BUT ThisWorkbook will have been opened from Sharepoint.</p>
<p>Normally I would use ThisWorkbook.Path, but I don't think that this gives me the SharePoint url.</p>

<p>Hi, I am doing this as a favour for a friend, he doesn't know much about programming, and has been given the job of writing this macro. I know much more, but I don't know much about SharePoint and I don't have access to his system, so I am setting it up
 on my PC at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what version of SharePoint he is using either, but I know that he needs to find the url in order to save other files in the same folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a very complex question? I thought it would be simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi - you misunderstand the question. I don't need the url... I need to know the code that will return the url, so that I can use it to save other files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be certain that this file will always be in the same location. It might be saved multiple times and in different places on the SharePoint system (different network locations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please remember that I am a SharePoint virgin, just trying to help out my friend. I know about VBA, but here, I feel a bit out of my depth.</p>

<p>Hi Mjxhx,<br />
<br />
I've went through the above, my understanding is that you open an Excel workbook which is stored in SharePoint Online document library using Excel client, and now you want to save it back to the same location but save it as PDF.<br />
</p>
<p>You can click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save As</strong> &gt; click the SharePoint location on the left menu (it should look like "Sites -
<em>Contoso</em> - xx") &gt; then choose the site, click on the site name &gt; select and double click on the library. You will get the library URL when you click the address bar in the window.<br />

<h2>            After 1703 upgrade on Lumia 640 phone user and password for WLAN connection get resettet automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I got Windows 10 version 1703 installed on my Lumia 640 those WLAN connections which require a user name and a password do not work anymore. When typing in the user name it gets automatically resetted after 4-5 seconds. So I have no chance to enter
 the password because the user name got deleted meanwhile. </p>
<p>For WLAN connections which require just to enter a key the issue does not occur.</p>
<p>Any idea/tipp? Maybe it's a bug?</p>
<p>

                    <p>I've had these accounts for a long time, way before Outlook so I'm still with a Hotmail email. I have had my Skype way before this link thing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My Skype account is not linked to my Hotmail but when I tried following the steps it was taking me to closing my Hotmail account. When I try the 'Contact Us' page it just tells me to go to the community link which is useless to me, it would be easier if
 I could just contact support to remove my account or just have what most websites do and click a 'Delete Account' button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to delete my Skype account?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We, at Skype, no longer </span><span>have an option to delete accounts. Microsoft aimed to bring convenience on your end and that means you do not need to contact us to process the cancellation.

<p>
</p><p><span>To set your expectation, if you proceed to delete your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all Microsoft products and services.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>The 30- days waiting period helps keep hackers from changing your account’s security info as a way to completely takeover of the account. This waiting period gives the real account owner enough time to be alerted of the change and to cancel it

<p>
</p><p><span><span>A possible reason why the account closure process takes you to your Hotmail email address was you're signed in to Skype using the email address and not the correct Skype account.</span></span></p>
