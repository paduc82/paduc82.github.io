<h2>            Keep Source Formatting doesn&#39;t work on Powerpoint on Mac</h2>
                    I have two Macs that do not display the "keep source formatting" option on Powerpoint. However, it appears on Word and Excel. One Mac has Powerpoint version 16.21 and the other Mac has version 16.16.16. My colleague has the 16.21 version and the option
 also appears for her. I have checked for other updates and do not have any other Office updates.&nbsp;

                    <p>I was just upgraded to Office 365.&nbsp; My prior version of Office had a DIP (Document Information Panel) where I&nbsp;documented all of the revision history of a Word, Power point, Excel document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So now I can't find this information in Office 365.&nbsp; Can I recover it?&nbsp; Also, in 365, what is the best method to document revision history?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I am unable to sync contacts from my PC to my devices after I think a software upgrade</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hi all,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I cannot sync contacts from Windows 10 - 64 bit to my Samsung Galaxy phone S6 Edge. This problem appeared to manifest itself after an upgrade. (In other words I cannot use the stand alone Contacts Icon situated as a standalone at the bottom of
 the page. </span><strong><em><span>NOTE – MY PHONE AND SMS ALSO RELIES ON </span>
</em></strong></span><strong><em><span>These </span></em></strong><strong><em><span><span>SAME CONTACTS WHICH ARE NOT THERE.</span></span></em></strong><span><span>)
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I also have another device which is a Samsung tablet GT-P5100 Android version 4.2.2.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>The same thing happens here as well, so both devices are affected. My Win 10 PC is using the mail App, which I think is using People contact data that is embedded in with the App somewhere? I have found an empty
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>contacts</span></span><span> folder situated in my PC (C:\User\USER\Contacts) is empty, nothing there?
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I also do not know where the People contacts are either, as its Icon is shown at the bottom of the Email app when open, but where is the data stored?
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>I have successfully imported a CSV file into the
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>C:\User\USER\Contacts, but it makes no difference as I think my sync (people contacts) is sent to and from my devices, that are working with the People contact address lists somewhere. There
 is no information in the contact data that is the main contacts Icon (Red box with a blank head, at the bottom) on my two devices. I actually deleted the old data first to see if they came back and they did not, proving there is no synching at this time after
 waiting about 30 minutes. Any new contacts that I have entered onto my PC into the People icon within the mail app. This does&nbsp;sync to the People Icon on the other devices. I can then open the Email app and see some small Icons below within the Email App. The
 icon at the end showing the head and shoulder figure is the People link to access the address book. I know that I have probably repeated myself in different ways, to hopefully into having something that is understandable. My mail and calendar work fine. It
 is just the contacts that are not working.&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Basically I want to start again with the correct settings of phone, tablet and PC so everything syncs off my main Email address
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">***email address has been removed</span><span>*** on my PC. I do not know how or why this has occurred.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>First of all when I said my PC has undergone several updates,&nbsp; I can't blame the upgrades as&nbsp;It was just a suggestion that it may have been the cause. It could be that I have changed a setting&nbsp;somewhere when trying to fix it so as a suggestion I need to
 be informed of all setting in PC and phone to try and get this to work..</p>
<p>* Now to answer your question Nr one. I do not know where the contacts are on the PC? &nbsp;I am not using an App to transfer contacts or synch them, I am merely resetting my account and then deleting it as there&nbsp;was no change. Once I have reinstalled my account
 the problem is still there. Please tell me if I am wrong here. What I am expecting is that all my contacts will&nbsp;be copied from my pc into my Contacts People folder on my phone&nbsp;all at once.,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Nr 2&nbsp; Yes I can do screen shots if you want, but what issues do I take screen shots of? I don't know of any.</p>
<p><em>Remember I said my mobile phone dose search for contacts when typing in the address and that address book works fine, so it appears to be using its own address book&nbsp;.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>It is the address book at the bottom of the main page of my phone in a&nbsp;orange Icon&nbsp;called Contacts (Shape with a white head)&nbsp;and it&nbsp;is empty, no contacts. My phone does not have contacts, nor does messages (SMS). My Email does have contacts,
 See above in question two answer from me.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>&nbsp;Would you also please look into as to why my Contacts file =( C:\Users\USER\Contacts) &nbsp;has no data in it ?</strong></em></p>
<p>My operating system is Windows 10 Home, 64 bit, Version 1607.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>William</p>
<p>

<p>OK, Everyone smile and take a deep breath and relax. The problem is now fixed.</p>
<p>The hardest problems are usually caused by something stupidly simple. I was using a&nbsp;Google mail account and had no further use for it as&nbsp;I&nbsp;had changed over to Outlook and was synching all my devices to Outlook.&nbsp;However&nbsp;my mobile phone being Android still
 needed access to Google and now its all working.</p>

<p>I apologize for the late response as we&nbsp; have high volume of support request. Let me help you with this issue.&nbsp;I would like you to know that the reason why you are not seeing the old Hotmail anymore when you sign in&nbsp;to your account is because your Hotmail&nbsp;is

    <title>Deleting Outlook Birthdays - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleting Outlook Birthdays</h2>
                    I was having difficulty deleting incorrect birthday entries in my Birthdays Calendar. Outlook.com insisted that it is a read-only folder. When I looked at the same calendar on my phone I could delete the entry. Is this a known inconsistency?

            Hi Robert,<br />
<br />
The Birthday Calendar is generated automatically from the Contact's database. We can't modify it directly.<br />

To delete a calendar from Outlook, click <strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Account Settings</strong>&gt;<strong>Account Settings</strong>, selecting the
<strong>Internet Calendars</strong> tab, selecting the <strong>calendar</strong> and clicking
<strong>Remove</strong>.<br />
<br />
Get back to us if you have other concerns.<br />

            July 29.&nbsp; It is a soft roll out meaning first the insiders get it, then over the coming weeks those who reserved do.&nbsp; With a potential 1 billion devices Microsoft must spread out the load on the servers.&nbsp; They cannot even handle the 6 million insiders.

    <title>OneNote for iPad cached credentials not being removed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcletech  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote for iPad cached credentials not being removed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of iPads in my organization that are shared by multiple users.&nbsp; We have our Mobile Device Management software push down the installation of OneNote when a user logs into the MDM login app.&nbsp; A user will use their Office 365 account to access
 OneNote files during the session.&nbsp; When the user logs out of the MDM login app, the OneNote application is removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I am experiencing is, after the OneNote application is removed, whether manually or via the MDM software, the credentials for OneNote are still cached on the devices.&nbsp; This means that when another user tries to use the OneNote app, when installed,
 they are already logged into OneNote with the previous users credentials.&nbsp; Ideally, I would like the OneNote app to behave the same as the OneDrive for Business app where the credentials are not cache after removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sign-out of OneNote before the app is removed or use the <em><strong>SETTINGS - OneNote - Reset OneNote - Delete Login Credentials</strong></em> option before the app is removed, the app will be in the desired state for sign in by another user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer for the users&nbsp;not to have to sign out or use the Delete Login Credentials option every time they go to use the devices.&nbsp; It would be better to have the cached credentials removed upon app removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a clue as to how I might&nbsp;go about&nbsp;solving this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

            AFAIK.. the only way to sign out from office app on ipad is using the reset function. You must probably have the users to reset the app before the user logs out.

<h2>            Outlook in Office Professional Plus 2019 is unstable when checking for missing attachement in a mail at sending</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started using Outlook 2019 a few weeks ago. On the very first day I got the popup message when I was sending a mail, where I forgot to attach a file - and I really appreciate this feature. However it doesn't work anymore. I have tested with different sentences
 with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I started Outlook 2019 in safe mode and saw the feature working there:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/147eb49b-2416-45cf-8fef-e27397686440?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/147eb49b-2416-45cf-8fef-e27397686440?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing safe mode af starting Outlook normally it also worked there - but only for approximately 5 tests, 10 minutes and one restart of Outlook.....</p>
<p>When I re-do the safemode process, I have no luck getting the attachment check to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me troubleshoot this issue? I would like very much to rely on this feature in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in beforehand</p>
<p>Anne</p>

            If you're just wanting to display the drawing grid, then you can certainly do that. The

If the lookup_value isn't found then you'll get the error.</p>
<p>What is the data type of the value being returned? Is it text or numeric? Or, can it be either?</p>

<p><br />
That doesn't account for empty cells in the lookup table when the lookup value is present.</p>
<p>I'm thinking&nbsp;that's why the OP started the formula with:</p>
<p>=IF(VLOOKUP(A3,JHRK,6,FALSE)="","",...</p>
<p>The error is a separate issue.</p>

<p>Excel is not finding the value from A3 in the leftmost column of the table JHRK, consequently the #N/A return.&nbsp; If you "See" the value there and it still don't work then you probably have the classic "TEXT vs NUMBERS" issue with the value in A3 and the same
 value in the leftmost column of JHRK not being the same.</p>

<p>Hi Oldhasbeen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the screenshoots in your post, also, I'm sorry for not answering your question in time. From your description, you cannot edit some chats in Microsoft Teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience and test, the Name group chat icon <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e2e3985-7b13-4abc-a3a1-e53dca083ed2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e2e3985-7b13-4abc-a3a1-e53dca083ed2?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;is available when the first message is sent to a group. Also, after you leave a group, you can not change the name of the group chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, from the screenshoots you provided, I can see other group member can change the name for group "peppers2" and you can access the&nbsp;Name group chat icon&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/060d9c9f-1986-4d08-8dd7-d04361348f01?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/060d9c9f-1986-4d08-8dd7-d04361348f01?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;for
 Issue 123 Chat group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given this situation, may I confirm whether your problem is you cannot edit the "peppers2" group's name? If so, to confirm whether this issue is related to Teams client, please firstly sign in to Teams web app to see if there is any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please check if you leave the chat group and then let the group owner re-add you to the group chat and check if you can rename this group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to let us konw if there is any updates about this question, to assist you better, please provide following information:</p>
<p>1. A screenshoot of your Microsoft Teams client version information.</p>
<p>2. If this issue persists in Teams web app, please send us screenshoots about this problematic group in both Teams client and Teams web APP since we need to confirm whether the
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f12e9807-a99c-4265-a55e-614c7baee366?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>3. Do other group members can rename the problematic group?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<h2>            Spotify for Nokia Lumia 920</h2>
                    <p>Need some help WP fanboys.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded Spotify about two weeks ago and everything was working fine.&nbsp; Then sometime this week, Tuesday I believe, I tried to log in using my Facebook and Spotify account username and passwords and I keep getting an error message saying "You Must Use
 Premium Version". </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is that all about? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know about this or what I can do to fix this problem.&nbsp; I've already unistalled, reinstalled, etc. twice and still the same issue.&nbsp; I'm very sad because this is such a cool app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated. </p>

            FYI, fanboys is a negative term. Might want to use something else.<br />
<br />
You would have to contact Spotify to find out what change in their service happened.<br />

<h2>             IE8 shows error 403 Forbidden, Access denied by access control list.__</h2>
                    I had this same problem months ago and overcame it by reinstalling IE8. Now I am using Win 7 Premium and cannot download IE8 in correct format for Win7. Tried Win Vista format but no good. Any advice please

<p>Hi brian3315,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for using Microsoft Answers Forum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here are a couple of questions what will help us to give you a better answer :</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Does this happen on all websites or just one particular website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Have you tried with other Web Browsers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Do you face the same issue with other browers as well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 8 comes built-in with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually that particular error message (error 403 Forbidden) means that you are not authorized to view information on that particular web server.&nbsp; You are obviously connecting to the internet
 without any problem because the error message for no internet connection is different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try following the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>The website declined to show this webpage (HTTP 403)</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Internet Explorer is able to connect to the website, but Internet Explorer does not have permission to display the webpage. This can happen for a variety of reasons; here are some of the most common:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>•</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The website's administrator has to give you permission to view the page or the web server does not accept public webpage requests. If this is a website that you should have access to, contact the website
 administrator.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>•</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The webpage you're trying to view is generated by a program, such as a shopping cart or search engine, and the folder on the server the program is contained in is not correctly configured by the website
 administrator.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>•</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You have typed a basic web address (for example,
<a href="http://www.example.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.example.com</span></a>), but the website does not have a default webpage (such as index.htm or default.html). Additionally, the website does not allow directory listing, which allows you to view
 files in a web folder.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</td>
<td>
<p>Check to be sure you have a correct address. If it's a link, it could be out of date and no longer available on the website.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Download mail from subfolders in outlook.com to Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>I'm using outlook.com to consolidate a number of email accounts into one place, then using Outlook 2010 to access that outlook.com account and download all email from there into Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the email stays in the "inbox" on outlook.com, I can download it into Outlook 2010, however if I start to use subfolders within outlook.com, none of the emails in those subfolders gets downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it to download ALL email, regardless of what folder it is in on outlook.com to Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Already had it installed and running . . . the problem was it was ONLY downloading email from the Inbox, not other subfolders . . . but I think that we've cracked that now.

<p><span>My Samsung Jack hasn’t been connecting to Live since June 17th.&nbsp; It stopped syncing with the contacts as well.&nbsp; When i took the battery out last week, I lost a few of my contacts.&nbsp;
 It is not a connection issue with the provider, since I can browse and get yahoo or Gmail forwarded.&nbsp; My phone is constantly trying to connect, causing my battery to die every 3hrs.&nbsp; Every so often, it will come up with a reply that says "Windows Live is unable
 to connect.&nbsp; The service may be temp unavailable, or you may be in a place where data coverage isnt very good.&nbsp; Please try again later".</span></p>

<p>I need the main tab to refresh data from each tab and fill in the appropriate column each day.</p>
<p>However the ties I have update the most recent values and does not store the previous data.</p>
<p>For example... 10/16/17 data pulls as 67.40.&nbsp; I need this recorded for today on 2017 tab in it's own column for that day.</p>
<p>So it will show 10/16/17 67.40 then tomorrow/next day 10/17/17 will record a value that report is refreshed as xx.00 and keep the previous data of 67.40.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Cat</p>

            We will have to right a small piece of VBA code to accomplish this. But to write this, we need your workbook. Could you please upload a sample sheet sans confidential data to Onedrive /Googledrive / Box / Dropbox or any other file host and share the link? It is recommended that you zip your file and upload.

            I studied your sheet. I have a follow up question -
<br />
<br />1. In CME Settle - B239 to B250 - What are these dates for?
<br />
<br />2. I can write a macro which will see the date in row number 237 of CME Settle and if it is today's it will update those values under today's date in 2017 tab and will freeze the yesterday's date.
<br />
<br />Let me know if my understanding is correct. If not, please correct me by articulating the needs.

<p>thank you...</p>
<p>1. This pulls the CME settlement prices for Lean Hogs through web data connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Correct&nbsp;a Macro to see the date in 237 would be perfect as this pulls from the website and other reports I will be using will have a similar date that is posted automatically.&nbsp; Would be a good step for me to use the macro (adjust accordingly) and use
 going forward to apply to other reports that will be in this sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds perfect!&nbsp; Exactly what I will need!!!&nbsp; This will save the day, the month, the year!!!</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!!</p>

<p>Additional ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>On tab LH_201 on the same sheet...this again is a web data pull from USDA.&nbsp; Which is a report on Lean Hogs Market News that is published each day.&nbsp; I have this pulling data each day (A2 is the date). For now the data pulls all combined (see sheet)...and
 I am hand typing the value into the green cells for that day to pull the yellow box number. Which is then recorded on the main tab 2017.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to have the data pull separately into it's own cell to figure the resulting number without typing?</p>
<p>Should read as...Column Negotiated, Other Market Formula, Swine or Pork... with rows for each as Head Count, Carcass Base Price...then the numbers accordingly it appears as such below but in my excel you will see it combined.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Pivot Table Calculation - Compare Two Columns &#40;&#37;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a pivot table where I am counting the number of order lines and then the number of back orders in two columns.&nbsp; I want to calculate a third column that shows the % of back orders.&nbsp; (Back Orders/Order Lines)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Order lines is&nbsp;a count of part numbers in the data set. </li><li>Back orders is a&nbsp;sum of &nbsp;a column I added to the data set, IF the item is a back order then 1, otherwise ""</li></ul>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Order Lines&nbsp;= 100</p>
<p>Back Orders = 12</p>
<p>Back Order % = 12%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing, this seems like a simple item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>It comes down to the IPS LCD (Lumia 1320)&nbsp;versus AMOLED (Lumia 950)&nbsp;screen:<br />
Lumia phones with AMOLED panels don't have the screen time-out option 'never' since this screen technology is burn-in prone.</p>

            <p>I use the map app to get live traffic information. No guided navigation, I usually know my way around. (Contrary to the former HERE navigation, there is no way anymore to get in the navigation status without providing an address.) Running the map app with
 live traffic turned on does not keep the screen activated despite being updated constantly (the position is moving, the traffic is changing).&nbsp;</p>

It's for the developers to sort out. The phone does what it is supposed to do, and there are currently no settings to change, in order to have it do what you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check the Feedback app on the phone for similar suggestions and vote it up, or create your own. Windows Maps now has its own board in Microsoft Answers:<br />

</p><p>Keeping an AMOLED display always-on with a static image, even a navigation bar on only part of the screen, is not advisable due to burn issues. A bad/good sample:</p>

<br />
So the developers of both W10M and Windows Maps have a challenge here.</p>

            <p><span>Thank you, Hans. Even your answer is very helpful, two questions remain:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(1) I consider the map app with live traffic useless if it does not stay on while the car (the map) is in motion. How am I supposed to use this feature if I have to turn it on every five minutes?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(2) The Windows map app with live traffic DOES stay awake when I am using it in my old Lumia 1320 (Windows 8.1) despite having the lock screen time out set to 5 minutes. As long as the map/car moves, it stays awake. I still cannot see
 while this feature was removed in Windows 10 since burn-in issues are not a problem (the screen is constantly changing due to map updates).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>No one asks for a static screen to keep on all the time. So I don't see a challenge here. If the other map providers known to me allow the feature (switch) enabling &nbsp;the map to stay on on my AMOLED display while driving, why not Microsoft?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I don't work here, I only wanted to clarify the 'never' screen timeout is not an option on AMOLED Lumia phones. Please refer to my previous post - request features in the Feedback app, and consider the dedicated Windows Maps discussion board.</p>

            Hans, thank you very much. Yes, your response helped because I know now why I don't have the "never" screen timout option while others have it. (It is just interesting that some other navigation apps overwrite this by keeping the display on all the time.)
 Thank you.

            <p>No worries, I understand where you're coming from and appreciate you taking the time to persist despite the misleading replies earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile and Windows Maps are currently actively developed, but it will take time to sort out bugs and implement expected functionality. Some requests are ignored of course, but I'm confident the developers consider all feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest get a real sat-nav device if you need a mature solution this summer. ;)</p>
