<h2>            Outlook contacts suddenly disappeared from my Android phone</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Nexus 5X running Android 7.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am syncing my contacts using the Outlook app for Android connected to my Outlook.com account. All of a sudden my contacts suddenly disappeared from my phone as well as from the Google Contacts and Outlook app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this may be related to the server upgrade because when I checked Outlook.com today, I got the new interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this problem?</p>

    <title>nokia 6170 pc suite problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamex---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia 6170 pc suite problem</h2>
                    hello good people. i am tearing my hair out.<br />
<br />
i have a nokia 6170<br />
XP Pro SP2<br />
DKU-2 cable<br />
pc suite 6.4 and 6.6 tried<br />
<br />
i have previously had my pc suite and 6170 working perfectly on a non SP2 XP system, and have all my numbers backed up. my phone recently broke, and i have a brand new one which i need to transfer my data to.<br />
<br />
i can't get it to work! i have tried both pc suites listed above and have the same problem~: after installation, pc suite will not recognise the connection. when i look in device manager, it shows the nokia 6170 connected, but with no drivers and i cannot find
 the drivers anywhere on my system or on the web - i thought that pc suite 6.6 had these drivers included.<br />
<br />
when i try to the connection manager, it does not find the phone, and when i "add new hardware" the system hangs and i have to restart. i really need to get the numbers back onto my phone, so any help will be gratefully received!<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />

            hi<br />
<br />
this didn't work, unfortunately. i used the cleaning program to get rid of my installation and any other nokia files, re-installed pc suite 6.6, did the trick, restarted and when i connected my phone i got the "clunk-clunk" montone sound that means (i think)
 that the device wasn't recognised.<br />
<br />
in device manager it lists the nokia 6170 under "other devices" and has a yellow question mark and black exclamation mark next to it.<br />
<br />
the new hardware wizard tries to look for drivers but cannot find them. is there a possibility that the phone is at fault? it's a replacement that i just got a few days ago, so perhaps newer than the one i used to have (same model, obviously) but perhaps there
 are new features??<br />
<br />
could it be anything to do with my firewall/anti-virus? long shots, but i'm gettin' desperado!<br />
<br />
thanks for your help - i look forward to the next installment!<br />
<br />

            not sure. i bought it from "mobile fun" and there is a sticker on the computer end with the following info:<br />
<br />
DKU-2<br />
Type* DKU-2<br />
GS21005771<br />
Made in China<br />
<br />
The fact that it used to work perfectly is what is confusing me....<br />

            as i said in my original post, i had pc suite 6.4 on my computer (NON SP2), working fine with THIS cable and a DIFFERENT phone (SAME model).<br />
<br />
i reinstalled windows XP (SAME version) on my computer, got SP2, then my phone broke. i got sent a new phone (SAME model) and went to PC suite to upload all my saved numbers, photos etc and it wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
so i downloaded PC suite 6.6 (and the PC suite cleaner so i could install it).... and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
so i went back to the original cd i got with my 1st phone (PC suite 6.0 i think) ... and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
so i got a DKU-2 driver from the nokia site.... and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
so i tried all the above in as many various ways and sequences as i could think of ... and it didn't work.<br />
<br />
the thing that seems significant to me is that my Nokia 6170 IS recognised in device manager, but has no driver associated, and a question mark. my computer KNOWS what phone it is, but PC suite sees nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />

            how did you transfer the numbers from the origianal phone? did you synchronise it or did you use backup?<br />
<br />
you say that it worked fine on a different installation of windows on the same pc, are we to assume this installation had service pack 1 installed?<br />
<br />
does any other part of pc suiet see the phone or does it always fail on get connected for instance?<br />
<br />
does windows give you a connection tone at all?

            i transfered using backup.<br />
<br />
NO service packs were installed - i had a dual boot system, the XP machine was only used for music apps.<br />
<br />
pc suite never sees the phone. in "manage connections" it just waits and waits and waits an.......<br />
<br />
yes, windows gives me a connection tone - usually a monotone "dunk-dunk", but it was giving me the two-tone "dunk-dink!" at some point, but i can't remember what method of installing pc suite had that effect.<br />

            ok, that tone means there is a problem. that can be the cable, the phone or the usb port you are using. i would get the phone and cable checked by one of nokias engineers.<br />
<br />
also, if you transferred your contacts via backup then you will not be able to restore them to your new phone. to do this you would have had to transfer contents from phone to pc or use synchronise

<h2>            OneNote text rendering problems in OS X and iOS</h2>
                    <p>The most recent versions of OneNote for iOS and OS X have changed the way that text is rendered, and kerning and font presentation are now much worse than they used to be:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/93e4a2b9-bebf-42f5-9c9f-888ad069c81e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous versions were not as good as other OS X/iOS apps, but they were acceptable. (At least to me.) The new version is painful to read; this is really poor text rendering performance for an app meant to mainly present text.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Are other folks also experiencing this issue? Any insights on what happened and when/if it could be addressed?</p>

            +1 on this issue. I don't know how this build passed the QA process - the text is shockingly bad - I also don't think voting on uservoice will surface this issue fast enough. Before it gets 4-digit vote, Mac users are probably all gone.&nbsp;

            Mohan, what feature request are you talking about? Please read before posting a canned response. This is a glaring bug that your wonderful QA didn't catch during release validation. Instead of wasting your customers time and sending them to uservoice,
 how about fixing the bug and posting a releasing an updated version of OneNote?

<p>Depending on the level of your Windows 10. As of the Windows Creators Update (1703), you can force the Windows 10 back to login screen (lock).&nbsp; As of the Fall Creators Update (1709), you can now add your Windows 10 PC to you phone, so that you can continue
 web browsing with the Edge browser across the different devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for lock/unlocking the Windows PC, this seems to be an app not built-in to the Windows 10 itself.&nbsp; This might be a manufacturer specialized app to allows this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bing history won&#39;t delete&#33;</h2>
                    Dear readers,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using Bing as my default search engine for a few days now. When I went into settings, I noticed that my search history was being recorded. I decided to turn that off, and to clear the history of my searches that were already recorded. However,
 when I tried to do that, it didn't work. When trying to delete a single search query, nothing happened. When I clicked on clear all history, it said "At this moment it is not possible to clear the search history. Try again later." (translated from dutch).
 I did try again later (2 days), but it still doesn't work!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get the search history deleted? I was logged on to my account, so the search history is recorded on that account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope someone can help me, because it drives me crazy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Greetings,</div>
<div><br />

            I found a work-around! This is what you need to do:
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1. Click in the top right corner on the "gear wheel" to go to settings.</div>
<div>2. Then click on "Worldwide" on the top of the screen.&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Then click on "United States - English" (this will bring you to the U.S. version of Bing)</div>
<div>4. Click on the "gear wheel" in the top right again to go to settings once more.&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. Now click on "History" on the left.&nbsp;</div>
<div>6. Now click on "Clear all" on the right.</div>
<div>7. Click on "Yes, clear all history"</div>
<div>8. And the history will be cleared, without the error occurring.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To get back to your original language, click on "Settings" on the left. Click on "Worldwide" at the top of the screen and click on your country/language. You'll get back to Bing in your language and the history will be gone.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft still needs to find a way for me to clear history in my own language (Dutch), but for now, the workaround will do.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this will help you guys!</div>

            Hi CraigKemery,
<br />
<br />I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />Does restarting the computer fix it?
<br />
<br />If not, try this:
<br />
<br />Please click Windows Start
<br />Choose Settings
<br />Click Apps
<br />Choose the Microsoft application to repair
<br />Click Modify
<br />Choose Quick Repair       
        </p>

            Hi craig
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Go to Programs and Features
<br />
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .

Try doing the following :<br />
1) Reset the phone to factory default by keying *#7370# after backing up data<br />
2) Upgrade the firmware to 20.0.084 using Nokia software updater.Ensure the battery is fully charged

You should be able to update using a NSU. Since you are unable to do it, I suggest you take it to your nearest Nokia care. I believe your piece is under warrenty

<p>You will need to set a tab stop at the desired position in the TOC 3 style.&nbsp; Alternatively, modify the multi-level list so that the level assigned to the style that is used for those paragraphs contains a space after the numbers, rather than a tab space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, the default TOC # styles, use the default tab stops and the spacing that you are getting at the moment results from the heading number extending past the tab stop at which the text of the other entries is aligned, so that the text for the Heading 3
 entries is aligned at the next tab stop.&nbsp; If you want the text for all of the entries to be aligned at the save horizontal position, you will need to set a tab stop in the TOC 2 style as well.</p>

<h2>            DELETE ALL IN NEW &#34;OTHER&#34; FILE &#58; OUTLOOK.COM</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In outlook.com the new "other" file feature includes a "delete all" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very dangerous and previously only existed in the junk mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't ever want to delete all mails in this folder, how can I suppress this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please microsoft, take it away</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also make it easier to send you a comment, it has taken me half an hour just to get on this forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Delete all is a separate change.</p>
<p>This is what you see with focused Inbox turned off:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b9dfb5a-e689-426c-b8b5-f25f9d0e71bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b9dfb5a-e689-426c-b8b5-f25f9d0e71bf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all is an improvement.</p>
<p>Unlike Delete, there is a confirmation to OK before the delete all occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff58dc04-aa21-42d6-affa-67e7c39cce40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff58dc04-aa21-42d6-affa-67e7c39cce40" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The deleted emails will only be moved to Deleted items if you confirm the move.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you've tried to configure it with an Exchange account but don't actually have an Exchange account or did not configure it with the correct settings.</p>
<p>You can use the Mail applet in Control Panel to correct it or simply start with a new mail profile.<br />
See; <a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/newprofile.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/faq/newprofile.htm</a></p>
<p>BTW: Any proof of purchase would have entitled you to get a replacement license key. Most stores can also track your Original purchase in case you lost your receipt, credit card bill, etc...</p>

<h2>            Outlook was connected, now says &#34;trying to connect&#34;</h2>
                    I have windows 10, was using Outlook 2013, and everything was working fine until May 6th.&nbsp; Then Outlook (connected to Exchange Server with Office 365).&nbsp; So I made a slight mistake of upgrading to Outlook 2016.&nbsp; At first it wouldn't connect, then someone
 suggested connecting via Ethernet instead of my wireless (at home), deleting the old email in the profile&nbsp;and re-adding it, or creating a new profile.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I added the email back and&nbsp;it finally connected, but when I disconnected from Ethernet back
 to wireless, it would say, "trying to connect", or "disconnected".&nbsp; I left it for a while on Ethernet and it set up the new account fine, and then was working fine.&nbsp; Then I finally disconnected, having followed instructions to delete the security log and reboot
 as one method, and it worked as long as I didn't reboot.&nbsp; I just rebooted and now it won't connect.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the problem is.&nbsp; I need help

            <p>Hi Jithin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there are no drivers available for Windows 10 Technical preview I would suggest you to install the available in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below on how to install driver in compatibility mode:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Download </span></strong><span>the&nbsp;driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Right click </span></strong><span>on&nbsp;the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select operating system</strong> from the&nbsp;drop down list.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let the driver install and then check the&nbsp;functionality.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Post back with the results so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by "attach the document and attachment area." If you need to make changes to the business card you need to open Word and the business card file you created, and then edit it. Copy and paste&nbsp;the edits to all cards&nbsp;in the template.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open Word, go to File-&gt;Open to open your business card file. <em>You do not need to look for edit.</em> Once the file is open just move the cursor (click in) to the area that needs editing and delete or backspace the old text out and type in the new text.
 You will probably have to hit the Enter key to add a new line to type in the website info. Good luck with it.</p>

<p>That is exactly what it sounds like. Although I don't know how you could have set the entire business card as a picture. Did you create the business card in Word, or did you do a scan of the card and possibly saved it as a graphic? If so, you may have to
 scan it again and save it as text. Don't want to steer you in the wrong direction so maybe others have thoughts on this.</p>

<h2>            Outlook creates sync conflict pst-files</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>looking for some disk space, I realized that outlook generated redundant pst-files, with a suffix "....sync-conflict-20180114-110204-SNOZNTX". These files have the same size as the original one, making it up to 15 GB of redundant data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why are these files being generated?</p>
<p>2. Can they be deleted without any danger of loosing data? Of course I´ll keep the original file with most recent timestamp</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of what it looks like, I would keep "Gesendete Elemente.pst" and "Instruments.pst", but delete the files with "...sync-conflict..."<br />
</p>

<p>It is because you are connecting to pst-files that are within your OneDrive folder. This results in synching conflicts as Outlook has a lock on pst-files so OneDrive can't complete the sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store your pst-files locally and when you want your data to sync to the Cloud, store them within an Outlook.com mailbox.</p>

                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a method in Office 365 to get some insights in the Exchange Rooms bookings? For example, can you get an report, for a given period and a specific set of Exchange Rooms, on the reservations (who reserved it, how long is the booking, how many anttendees
 are included,....) those kinds of information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Hi Tom B,<br />
<br />
There is no such a report. <br />
<br />
However, you can use the access to the room calendar and view the calendar vent on the room calendar. For each event on the room calendar, it should include the organizer, meeting event duration and date, ect. As a result, we should be able to see “who observed
 the room, how long the booking is and how many attendees” information. <br />
<br />
For accessing the room calendar, <strong>an admin</strong> can set the permission of the room mailbox for a user via Exchange Online PowerShell. After connecting to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Online PowerShell</a>, run the cmdlet <em><strong>set-mailboxfolderpermission -identity "room mailbox’s name:\calendar" -user &lt;username&gt; -AccessRights reviewer</strong></em>. Then, the user can add the room calendar in OWA/Outlook client.
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alan<br />

    <title>AdSync and ADFS access during a non-business hour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kleberadriano  say:</h3>
<h2>            AdSync and ADFS  access during a non-business hour</h2>
                    <p>Using AD Logon Restrictions along with ADFS/Directory Sync works fine to block OWA access during a non-business hour schedule because a user is unable to login through the web form.&nbsp; Users are still able to conduct e-mail business on their smartphones through&nbsp;ActiveSync&nbsp;during
 those non-business hours&nbsp;though.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to prevent ActiveSync from syncing to Office365 based on a timed schedule of when it would and would not work.&nbsp; This should also be based on security groups and not just an all or nothing approach.</p>
<p>Reply of user in old discution:</p>
<p><em>ActiveSync requests hit different endpoint on the AD FS, so make sure you have included it. I'm not sure that you can avoid the token caching however (i.e. user that logs 10 mins before the restrictions are in effect will be happily using the mobile
 device for the next few hours).</em> </p>
<p>someone already managed to configure the activesync so that it complies with the same authentication rules that owa ?</p>

<p>As someone already replied, once the client (Outlook, ActiveSync, whatever) has a valid token, it can continue accessing the service until the token expires, without contacting your AD FS server.</p>
<p>In your case (French laws?), you can probably run a script that disables certain email protocols every night and re-enables them in the morning, but that's surely gonna cause some havoc. Your legislators are certainly not in their right minds :)</p>

<p>The token validate time I managed to change, using the command:</p>
<p>Set-OrganizationConfig -ActivityBasedAuthenticationTimeoutInterval 00:05:00</p>
<p>Every 5 minutes OWA, Skype fo Business and Outlook, request the password and if it is recorded only confirm if the outlook it does it automatically.</p>
<p>My problem is with the Android and iOS phones that seem to ignore the command, even I can set up a new account on any of these devices during the time when the service is locked in AD.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do the scripts to:</p>

<p>Hi Nekenpongen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not feasible to add the trusted location from the config.office.com directly, you can only configure to enable "Allow Trusted Locations on the network" or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check the introduction in the "Allow Trusted Locations on the network", when you enable this policy, users can specific trusted locations on network shares or in other remote locations that are not under their direct control by selecting the
 "Allow Trusted Locations on your network (not recommended)" check box in the Trusted Locations section of the Trust Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can leave a comment to <a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 UserVoice</a> to let the product team know that you need to configure the trusted locations for users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<p>So let me just clarify , there is no option to add da trusted Location from config.office.com ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what about the workgroup template path, the link dat you shared is pretty vague and just shows da path in the registry , nothing else, and how am i going to add the shared template so that people can access it ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Pongen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about that both&nbsp;I and Gloria forget to say that you should guide&nbsp;the configuration path firstly. I save the configuration file in Desktop so that I use cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a949bdf1-637d-40a6-b0d3-3b3491679337?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a949bdf1-637d-40a6-b0d3-3b3491679337?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then I use the cmd below:</p>
<p>setup.exe /download configuration.xml</p>
<p>setup.exe /configure configuration.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Make sure the configuration file name called "configuration".</p>
