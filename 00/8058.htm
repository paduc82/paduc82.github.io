<h2>            Word 2007 - Using Includetext - moving rest of paragraph onto new Line</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping someone can please help me before I pull my hair out completely - Word is driving me crazy :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a letter and I want to include some text from another document - which works great - brings over the information I want, albeit in a different font&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main issue is that when I merge the document, it brings through the 'include text' however, it moves the rest of the paragraph onto another line and I don't know how to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the 'Includetext' document for a paragraph break and there is one right at the end but I've read on various sites that you can't delete these but I have no idea if this is what is causing this to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be so grateful if anyone can help me with this&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

            The paragraph break is because you have included the whole document and that includes the final paragraph break. If you don't want the final paragraph break, select all of the text you want to include except for the last paragraph and bookmark it. Then
 reference the bookmark by replacing \* MERGEFORMAT with the bookmark name.<br />

INCLUDETEXT</a> field. My personal preference would be to use an IncludeText field, simply because I am more familiar with it. The LINK field is designed to allow things other than Word documents to be used as a source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to your original IncludeText link: </p>
<p>instead of "\* MERGEFORMAT"&nbsp; you would type the name of your bookmark in the source document.</p>
<p>When you have finished there would not be a "\*" switch marker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, when in the source document and setting the bookmark, you need to be careful that the paragraph mark following the phone number? is not included within the bookmark. It appears to be that paragraph mark which is being included and breaking
 your paragraph in your final merge document.</p>

    <title>How to Copy a Single Web Site Page&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liz 4.0  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Copy a Single Web Site Page&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Publisher 2007 to design and manage a small non-profit Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am trying to save space by copying single pages with some of the archived notices and newsletters as PDFs (or another format).&nbsp; I would then upload these files separately to the Web host, and link to our site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, even though I followed Microsoft's online&nbsp;instructions, I ended up either copying the entire site, copying only a portion of a page (with essential elements missing), or ended up with PDFs that "broke" the copied pages in the middle, thus losing
 some of the content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried grouping all elements on a page together and then copying and pasting on a Word doc, but many elements didn't make the transfer.&nbsp; I tried Selecting All from the Web Page Preview, then pasting as Special on a Word doc, with no success.&nbsp; I tried copying
 a both a grouped editable page and a Web Preview page, then "printing" as a PDF, which did produce a readable PDF, but with information gaps between PDF pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the copying procedures from the editable file itself, and also from the Web Page Preview.&nbsp; Nothing I've tried has produced satisfactory and readable results so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you suggest any other methods for making a good copy of a single Web page that I can upload and link to our site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thanks for straightening things up.<br />

My suggestions were premised on logic alone, before I had a chance to see Liz's site.<br />

I was under the impression that the newsletter consisted of text only but now that I have seen the content, I completely agree with your approach.<br />

Hi Geoffrey,</p>
<p>I think that this is one of the limitations of using Publisher for webs. It is best used for small simple sites and if you continue to grow your site at some point it becomes very difficult to manage and that is when people tend to move to other programs.
 I think that breaking your site up and building it with multiple Pub files is a way to build and manage larger sites...or at least that has been my experience. The poster in the thread you quote is also butting up against a size limitation and may need to
 go to a CRM or something else...it gives me a headache thinking about how to organize that site.</p>
<p>I don't think Liz has that big of problem. She just needs to make some structural decisions about how she wants to organize her site. She does&nbsp;not&nbsp;need to break her site up unless she wants to...the structure and navigation works. But I think she recognizes
 that she is approaching the time where it is becoming very inefficient to continue to upload all those pages each time she makes a change to her site. Breaking it up in a logical way and building it with multiple Pub files will make it much easier to manage
 in the long run. She just needs to decide how she wants to do it.</p>
<p>You might find this site content interesting. I read a lot of the tutorials back when it was a much simpler site called
<a href="http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.webdesignfromscratch.com</a> . Here are a couple relevant articles that I enjoyed back when...</p>

http://www.webdesignfromscratch.com/category/website-architecture/</a></p>
<p>I am not suggesting that you need help with your site architecture or navigation...you don't. But it sounds like you enjoy learning and thinking about the 'art' of web design and you might enjoy some of the tutorials on this site. If you go to any of the
 sections note that the tutorials are chronological...read the older original ones. Those are the ones that sold me on the value of this site.</p>

            <p>Liz,</p>
<p>Before anything else I want to compliment you on your site. It is actually a site I had in my list of good examples of Publisher built sites but I didn't realize it was the one you were talking about. You have done a really good job but I also can see why
 you are asking about how big a site can get and now how to archive materials. </p>
<p>I can see upon looking at <a href="http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm</a>&nbsp;why all this is coming to a head for you. You are running out of space in the text box for links to the archived newsletters. Your site is a good example how a Publisher site can eventually grow to have so
 many pages it becomes cumbersome to manage.&nbsp;Though you could continue to grow your site as it is currently organized, I think your best solution is to break up your site and build it with multiple Pubisher files so you don't have to upload the whole site each
 time you make a change only to the newsletters and meeetings content. I don't think that trying to convert your old newsletters or meeting pages to pdf files or .mht files is your best solution.</p>
<p>Like Geoffrey I primarily use Publisher 2000 to build my sites, and you can only build a 10 page site if you want to use the navbar wizard. This meant that very quickly I outgrew the navbar and had to change the way I approached my site structure and navigation
 system. David&nbsp; Bartosik wrote an article about this many years ago and it helped be think through how I wanted to organize my site so I could grow it without it becoming too cumbersome to manage. I would suggest you read that article now.</p>
<p>Reference: Building a web site with multiple Publisher web publication files:<br />
<a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/pages/81264.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msmvps.com/blogs/dbartosik/pages/81264.aspx</a></p>
<p>The main thrust of that article was the idea of breaking up a site and building it with multiple Pub files. David illustrated a way to choose a different file name than index.htm and thus a different thicket folder name (ex. index_files)&nbsp;as a way to organize
 your files and folders on the server.</p>
<p>I prefer a different approach. I would rather let Publisher continue to generate the default index.htm file name and use subfolders to organize my site such as what Geoffrey was suggesting. As an example David Bartosik suggests creating the music section
 by creating a new Publisher file and when you Publish to the web you save it as music.htm. He then would upload the&nbsp;music.htm file and the music_file folder to the same root directory as the index.htm file and the index_files&nbsp;folder. &nbsp;I would instead create
 a subfolder on the host called 'music' in the root directory or in other words at the same level as the index_files folder and let Publisher use the default index.htm file name and upload that&nbsp;index.htm file and index_files folder&nbsp;to the 'music' folder. So
 while the path to the first page of the music section would be written by David B. as
<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/music.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourdomain.com/music.htm</a>&nbsp;I would write it as
<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/music/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourdomain.com/music/index.htm</a> .</p>
<p>I decided to break up my site and produce each section of my site with a different Pub file. My home page is produced with one Pub file. Each main section such as your Meetings, News, Certification, Scholarships, etc would be produced with a seperate Publisher
 file and uploaded to an aptly named subfolder on my site..ie, Meetings, News, Certification, etc.&nbsp; So if I wrote a link to the first page of the Meetings section it would look like:
<a href="http://www.yourdomain.com/meetings/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourdomain.com/meetings/index.htm</a>&nbsp; My links in my main navbar would reflect this approach. By organizing it this way I needed only upload those parts of my site that changed.
</p>
<p>Now in your case you may not need or want to reorganize your whole site, so perhaps follow Geoffrey's approach. Create a subfolder called 'archives'. Create a new Publisher file and call it Archive.pub. Put the links that you have on page:
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm</a>&nbsp;on the first page of that new file. Perhaps provide an introductory paragraph, maybe even a short paragraph describing or&nbsp;outlining what
 was in the old newsletters under the links to them. Then add one page for each archived newsletter...don't put multiple newsletters on one long page and link to the home page of this new Pub file. Now when it comes time to produce a new newsletter you can
 just&nbsp;add a page to this new file, copy and paste the old newsletter from your main Pub file, and add the new newsletter as you have always done. Then you would Publish to the web&nbsp;the archive.pub file and upload that resulting index.htm file and index_files
 folder to the archive folder on your server. &nbsp;Now when you write a link to your archived or old newsletters instead of
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page456.htm</a>&nbsp;you will write
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/archives/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/archives/index.htm</a>&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>Now you also can also add the archived meetings to the same archive.pub file. Just add two pages each month...one for the old newsletter page and one for the old meetings page and link from the home page just like you did with the newsletters. Or, you can
 create two archive subfolders. Call one 'newsletters_archives' and one 'meetings_archive' and create two new pub files for each.
</p>
<p>Another possible approach is to create a new pub file for each newsletter and put the html file in a seperate folder. In other words instead of
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page540.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page540.htm</a>&nbsp;create a pub file called newsletterOctNov2011.pub or newsletter10-11.pub and put the html output into a subfolder called 'newsletter10-11'
 and link to it from your main site and from your list of archived newsletters <a href="http://www.nflaace.org/newsletter10-11/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nflaace.org/newsletter10-11/index.htm</a>. The advantage of this would be that you would never have to upload that content more than once.
</p>
<p>Another alternative is to create a new pub file called 'news.pub' and produce the first page is
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page531.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/index_files/Page531.htm</a>&nbsp;...everything on your current news page...and then add pages to this pub file for all your newsletters and meetings both current and
 archived. Create a subfolder called 'news' and upload all web content form news.pub to that folder. So now your main menu would link to news via
<a href="http://www.nflaace.org/news/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nflaace.org/news/index.htm</a>&nbsp;By combining all the news, newsletters and meetings including archived ones,&nbsp;on one pub file would mean that you would only have to upload one section
 some months.</p>
<p>You see where I am going with this? Spend some time thinking about how to seperate out the dynamic portions of your site from the static. Think of how you can organize the content and build it using multiple pub files and subfolders on your site. Most of
 my sites have a home page built with one pub file and every section is built with a seperate pub file and uploaded to&nbsp;a corresponding subfolder in the root directory on my site. By organizing this way I can also add temporary content to a new folder built
 by a new pub file and then just link to that folder from the main site and delete it when I am done.&nbsp;The main advantage is I only upload portions of my sites and not the whole thing and it is much easier to manage.</p>
<p>That was a lot of words and examples. I hope it was more helpful than overwhelming.</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>Geoffrey reminded me of a couple articles that you might want to read before you decide how to break up your site. As I suggested to him, you have a good logical approach to both your architecture&nbsp;and navigation, but it is also obvious your site is getting
 so big that it is become difficult to manage. These articles helped me many years ago think about how to organize sites and you might find them helpful before you decide how to break up you site.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It matters because, if you have a full HD 22" monitor and full HD 5.5" mobile screen, the image will be 22" large in monitor and 5.5" large in your mobile. If you zoom, the quality of image will be affected.

            BUMP! This is a major problem. Not only is it impossible to import PDFs directly on android. The Images on the desktop are not representative of what is shown on the tablet. My laptop is 1080p, the PDF is high resolution, the tablet is higher than 1080p
 but still I cannot read words on the onenote file on my tablet but I can read them on my computer. ( The tablet is a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition

            <p>Not sure they are going to fix this, the original post was over 2 years ago and the issue still exists. I have the same problem on my Samsung Note 10.1. File looks fine on the Onenote desktop version, but illegible on my tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please fix this, otherwise it's basically worthless, there are plenty of better apps for simple note taking, which is what Onenote android app is without the ability to read pdf files or any large file for that matter.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Word 2007 is suddenly taking a long time to load - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enckegap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 is suddenly taking a long time to load</h2>
                    <p>Word 2007 takes 8 seconds to load on my new Windows 10 PC (takes 1.5 seconds on my old Windows 10 PC). I have tried the "<span>winword.exe /a" trick mentioned in this old thread &lt;</span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/word-2007-is-suddenly-taking-a-long-time-to-load/3c5f8f89-d591-4381-8a90-69f53c034e07&gt;
 and it loads near instantly. However there are only two active add-ins and disabling them has no impact on the subsequent load time.&nbsp; Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>To me, that you get the fast load with the /a switch means the problem is one or more Add-Ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ones you are looking at are COM add-ins.</p>
<p>Look in your Word and Office <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startup Folders</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see these within Word under the <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/developertab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Developer Tab</a> by clicking on the Document Template button. Unchecking them, there, though, only turns them off for the current Word session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To stop them from initially loading, you need to move them out of the Startup Folder.</p>
<p>I generally do this by creating a sub-folder called "Stop" and moving them there.</p>

<p>I have done some research and may i ask you something?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the files the Always get deleted are .lNK (Lowercase L) files. I think these are shortcuts to programs. Other people had this problem to but i cant find an answer out of this. My mind is right now blowing away and i dont know what to do... Why does my
 anti-Virus delete .lNK files? and other people are also saying this is malware how do i get rid of this</p>
<p>

            I am using skype for windows desktop and it is all set up on my main computer - and works there - with my contacts etc. It was also set up on my work laptop ( I am communicating from now) but since I've had my laptop cleared and cleaned I have had to reinstall
 it and I am having difficulty doing this. When I went into the internet to download skype it seemed as if I was creating a new account? It did not ultimately download or though it said it had and the camera does not switch on ( which if should normally) nor
 were my friends/contacts recognizable when I put their names into the search button - it just came up with none found etc? So I am not sure why I cannot download the programme on to my cleaned laptop? thank you Sofia&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Good day!</p>
<p>Thank you for giving me the opportunity to assist you. We understand the importance of your inquiry and would be glad to address this matter.</p>
<p>May we know if you did perform "Export Data" in Yammer before and you want it to import back in your Yammer network? If yes, we are sorry to inform you that there is no option yet to import Yammer data back using Rest API.
</p>
<p>It is manually done and the date will change when you post the data back to your Yammer network. However, you may try to check/post your inquiry to
<a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0066cc">www.stackoverflow.com</font></a> and try to look if there is an existing API that matches your query.</p>
<p>We also noticed that, you opened a similar post in this forum (355531 and 355528). We will be closing it as a duplicate of this post.</p>

<h2>            N95 8GB - Issues&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi everyone!<br />
<br />
i've now had my n95 8gb for 4 months and the battery has started playing up!!! i've never had an issue with it before. it would always charge fine and would last between 4 -5 days before having to recharge...but recently, the phone is dying within 8 hours of
 being fully charged!! this is crazy! i'm having to carry my wall charger with me, so it's charging at work! any ideas why this would suddenly happen? i've noticed the phone heats up majorly too...<br />
<br />
also, another problem, which i've seen on this board, is my gallery...it used to take about a minute to load (once it rendered everything) but now it takes forever to load...majority of the time crashing - and i have to reboot the phone to get it to respond
 again!<br />
<br />
i've upgraded the firmware to the latest (v15) and started over again (not a factory reset though) - so there's hardly any pictures...no videos and very few things saved on the mass memory...<br />
i had a similar issue with the music player, where it would freeze when loading the library - but that just needed to be synched or something??? now it works alright...<br />
<br />
any ideas??? thanks heaps! :)

            It looks like your phone or battery has developed a fault. You should visit a nokia care point/service centre and get it repaired under warranty.<br />

            thanks for such a fast reply!<br />
<br />
I'll give them a call tomorrow...<br />
<br />
Would the battery be covered under the 6month warranty? Or because it was working and now has developed a fault, i'll have to buy a new one?

            I've just had a look at the Austrailian warranty (<a href="http://www.nokia.com.au/A4521194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com.au/A4521194</a>) and it says that batteries are covered for 6 months and the phone is covered for 12 months.<br />
<br />
So if it's under 6 months since you purchased it then the battery will be replaced for free if it's found to be the cause of the fault.

            This is a common battery problem. You can get your battery life back to normal..jus make sure for the next week you use it till the battery completely drains out, only then you should plug in your charger. For instance, "if you had used the cell for approx
 8 hrs..and started charging it again!"..and "this" went on for sometime period...the cell automatically gets used to this and hence adjusts itself to that battery life.<br />
..It happens with laptops too..!!..<br />
..Just make sure you use your cell till it dies out. Even after it dies out, you may still be able to switch it on and keep it without using for sometime. Wait till it empties completely. Do this for the next week or so!..It'l all be ok..!!..i know it's atime
 consuming procedure...but i really dnt think there's another solution to it..!!..<br />
<br />
..Hope this helps you..<br />
..Adios Buddy..!!

            well i read some other problems on other forums and it could also be a phone issue. if the phone has an error and loading the cpu 100% all the time your battery will die in a few hours. it could also be the phone that is not working properly. did it fell
 on the ground? been with you to the bathroom while showering (lol not in shower). or got wet by any chance? if so then that could damage the phone badly and result in a batterydrain. maybe the hardware is damaged.

            i think i may have fixed it by doing what thamer_ameen a couple of weeks ago...i did let it drain a couple of times...and it seems to be ok - it's now lasting a lot longer...<br />
i know about the battery having a memory of the amount of charge it can hold, but usually it's noticed over time...not immediately - or course i'm used to it with laptop batteries, which are a lot bigger and hold charge longer...so with a smaller battery, perhaps
 the results are more instantaneous...?? anyway, it seems to be ok...<br />
<br />
thanks for replying :)

<h2>            KB3050265 Update &#91; includes W10 preparation code&#93; for W7 CAUSED Hard Crash</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Today this W10 beta-Tester experienced yet-another un-expected problem resulting from W10 coding, this time 'far-afield'... on a Windows 7 machine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;KB3050265 includes the following very-last line in it's MS Details web-page: "General improvements are made to support upgrades to a later version of Windows." [Most of the beta-Testers out there will already be aware that MS has for some time now been
 slipping code into W7 / W8.0 / W8.1 machines, within their WindowsUpdates... in an effort to get them 'more-like' W10, before the big Official W10 Release.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mozilla has been chasing a MS-proprietary-Code tail for a few weeks now, trying to figure out a new realease of Firefox that will actually work with W7 / W8.0 / W8.1 PCs without 'squirrelly' things occurring. Mention this because today's sudden Hard-Off
 Crash of W7 Pro 32-Bit occurred "after" KB3050265 was installed (but W7 not-yet-Restarted), and during web-browsing of amazon pages using the latest Firefox 38.0.5. [And yes, the Mozilla "work-around" to turn Off HW Acceleration in Firefox's Advanced settings
 Options, "for now", had-been done.&nbsp; And yes, this PC has been "Fully" Tested HW-wise.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;In fact, had been Firefox browsing back-and-forth between amazon and Google-searches, successfully, for about 15 minutes, when the sudden W7 Crash occurred. W7 hard-offed the PC, and auto-rebooted it. [Went to SafeMode, then, to chkdsk the W7 partition,
 to make sure ntfs had not been damaged.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;Upon subsequent Restart, and W7 Logon, the ../WER/ReportArchive folder showed NO/None/Zero Firefox crash-reports, this Date. [There were, of course, some listed from previous days, when poor Mozilla had been releasing patched Firefox versions, to chase
 MS 'patches'.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;ANYONE ELSE observe sudden W7 or W8.0 or W8.1 "serious" Hard-Off Crashes after a WindowsUpdate&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">which includes W10-prep-code</span> (such as KB3050265) ??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --2015-09-11</p>

            <p>I'm sure it's not intentional, but it sure is convenient good timing for Microsoft to put out updates to Windows 7 and 8 that make it malfunction on the eve of releasing shiny new Windows 10. &nbsp;Just a happy coincidence. &nbsp;Or maybe it's that Microsoft firing
 all their quality testers is now relegating updates to a kind of russian roulette for end users no matter what the OS.</p>

            It is highly unlikely that this update, which all it does it gather some telemetry in a couple of files for transfer to MSFT, caused your PC to crash. A large multitude of things causes PCs to crash...it was more likely Firefox.&nbsp;

            Interesting the first I hear of this 'FireFox' issue is on a Windows 10 forum. FireFox is my main and only used browser on the my Windows 7 system, and I have not had any recent issues. But I have not installed KB305265 as spotted it and hide it. I have
 been vetting all Windows updates since the start of the GWX update or whatever the first one was and hide anything with even a hint of being related to Windows 10.

<p>I had a firefox crash day before yesterday on a win7 machine. It was me playing 1440p video.</p>
<p>Don't believe it had any thing to do with 305 0265. I'll have to check my notes. Never can tell....</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>The process is as below:<br />
When the video is uploaded, the files are encrypted and then stored in their encrypted format with Azure Media Services. When the Office 365 video player reprieves the video, it is first cached to the nearest CDN and the client are directed to the CDN, then
 client downloads the data directly from the CDN on the internet.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>If this is happening only on one (or a few)&nbsp;website(s) there&nbsp;really is (by Internet Explorer standards) a long running script&nbsp;on the page and IE is doing you a favor by providing the "Stop script" option. Click on the Stop script button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if only&nbsp;a site or two are affected...</p>
<p>It might break a desirable feature on the site, but placing a site in Restricted Sites will disable JavaScript and the script messages will stop.</p>
<p>Internet Options&gt; Security&gt; Restricted Sites...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're seeing the message on all or nearly all sites, a browser add-on might be causing it.</p>
<p>Note: The Google Toolbar has caused script problems for some users. See if disabling that toolbar stops the messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Internet Explorer without add-ons from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
or</p>
<p>from Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in <em>iexplore.exe -extoff </em>
</p>
<p><em>(iexplore.exe&lt;space&gt;-extoff)</em> then hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine which add-on is causing the problem see this old (but still relevant) article:</p>

</p><p>Another option: Other browsers like Edge, Chrome and Firefox are more forgiving of these script problems. Consider using another browser on affected sites.</p>

<h2>            OneNote 2016 repeatedly freezing for a few seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using OneNote 2016 on my Surface Pro 3 for a while and it worked perfectly until recently. Now every time I write (or erase)&nbsp;on OneNote it freezes up on me once every minute or two for about 10 seconds before starting to work again. Sometimes when
 it stops freezing some of what I wrote disappeared, and it's not even always the last thing I wrote. It seems a bit random. I've uninstalled and reinstalled Office but it didn't fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and found a solution?</p>

Does your computer have that DWORD value, Hans?<br />

If so, how do you change it to <strong>no</strong>?

            Hans,<br />
<br />
My system doesn't have a PageSetup folder in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, and so there's no Shrink_to_fit???&nbsp; Also, will this fix be for all users of this workstation or do I have to manually go through each logon?<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions, thanks

            Shrink-to-Fit printing can be tweaked (but not disabled) for Outlook and other MS Mail Clients&nbsp;(e.g., Outlook Express) which use the IE print engine but the same does not apply to Internet Explorer itself, I'm afraid.

            No, Shrink-to-Fit printing is the default in IE8 and IE7.

            Hi Robear,<br />
<br />
Yes - it is there.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fhlrnet.com%2ftechnoblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f02%2fie8-shrinktofit.png" /><br />
<br />
And I can change it by double-clicking.<br />
<br />
<br />
When chnging yes into no, shrink-to-fit is disabled.<br />
<br />
I checked a few other systems, and the key is absent on systems with IE7 - but it's also absent on Windows XP.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Hans

tamilselvanr535</a>. I believe you're using a Lumia phone, right? If yes, let's see if rebooting your phone will do the trick. This can be done by pressing &amp; holding the power &amp; the volume down keys at the same time until it vibrates &amp; restarts. In case your
 phone has the latest software installed, ensure&nbsp;that the system apps are also on the updated version. To do this, go to Settings &gt; swipe left, applications &gt; store &gt; check for updates. We'll wait for your feedback.

<p>I am trying to install Office 365 Business (2016) and a standalone version of Access 2016, however I because the version of Office is a click-to-run installer, it refuses to install with the installation of Access. The version of Access was downloaded through
 VLSC which only offers the bootstrap installer. Is there any way to install both of these?</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It’s not support to install the same version of MSI installer and Click-to-Run installer on the same computer. Moreover, for the same edition (MSI or Click-to-Run), we cannot install different version of them on one computer (e.g. Office 2013 and Office 2016
 Click-to-Run installers are not supported on same computer). To learn more, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-installed-using-Click-to-Run-and-Window-Installer-on-same-computer-isn-t-supported-30775ef4-fa77-4f47-98fb-c5826a6926cd?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office installed using Click-to-Run and Window Installer on same computer isn't supported</a>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a workaround, you can try installing Office 365 Business (2013) with Access 2016 (MSI). Meanwhile, Office 365 ProPlus or the Office suite from Enterprise E3 plan include Access. They are Click-to-Run installers.<br />

<h2>            outlook 2010 sending blank attachment</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have big problem, our outlook 2010 keeps sending blank attachments when you attach an email and are delivered as
<b>noname.eml(gmail) </b>
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">and&nbsp;</span><font color="#222222">No Subject(hotmail).</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222">the attachment in gmail though not named correctly can open and its not blank, however the hotmail one is blank when you open it.</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222">When send to other people we get the irritating response that we are sending blank emails.</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222"><br />
</font></div>
<div><font color="#222222">Anyone who has any ideas what setting or what we are doing wrong, please assist.</font></div>

            <p>When sending an attachment, always think about whether or not the recipient might be able to open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you send an email from Outlook as an attachment, you are basically sending a msg-file which can only opened by Outlook. If the recipient doesn't have Outlook,&nbsp;he/she&nbsp;won't be able to open it. However, and this is specific to msg-files, during transmission,
 the msg-files are often extracted and converted to eml-files by the receiving web servers or at least for the web interface). Recipients will then be able to open it with various locally installed mail clients but sometimes even on the web. The web interfaces
 of Gmail and Outlook.com do not support opening them on-line so the recipient will have to download it first and open it locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So make sure you sending your attachments in a format that the recipient supports. To be safe, you can use the html- or pdf-format.</p>

            Mails sent from outlook do replicate the error, and the sent items in outlook show mails as they were supposed to be recieved. However when i go to sent items on my gmail(because we using google accounts) the show the noname.eml as the attachment.
<div><br />
<div>my personal mail accounts i access them via the browser and the attachments open in outlook since its the default email app, but the gmail ones appear in the web browser unless i download the eml but these ones shows the data correctly when downloaded
 and viewed in outlook.</div>

            The recipients of the mails usually open the mails using outlok and they get the same problem.
<div><br />
<div>even when they downloading the attachment it makes no difference as the attachment is recieved with size 1kb.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>msg-files will arrive in Gmail as noname.eml.<br />
In Outook.com they will arrive as &lt;original subject&gt;.eml but that attached message will also be extracted at the bottom of the original message itself.</p>

<p>Have you already tested it by sending it to a (test) Gmail and Outlook.com account of your own?</p>

<div>while i agree with the above statement, it is not the case here when it comes to outlook.com it is renamed to no subject.eml and nothing is in the email.</div>

<p>
</p><p>When emailing an attached msg out of Outlook 2010 to my admin account and cc: myself in outlook but also myself in gmail. This is what I have found.</p>
<p>- my admin account the email comes through just fine.</p>
<p>-my gmail account the email is blank but has an attached noname.eml file. I click on download and I can view the email just fine, it just takes an additional step.</p>
<p>-my cc in outlook comes across as blank with untitled attachment 01324.eml file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing all the bulletin boards does not really address the resolution everyone cuts short after trying various options.</p>

                    <p>So, as you may know, if you turn "ActiveX Filtering" on, then, on 3rd party sites the YouTube videos running automatically in HTML5 mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, the problem is that I'm not able to run those videos&nbsp;in FullScreen Mode. Is it known "problem" ? Is it bug or just there isn't available this option yet?

<p>Everything else is working normally but this...&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your picture shows a Flash video player, not the inbuilt html5 video player.</p>
<p>The native html5 &lt;video&gt; tag in IE9 does not have a full-screen function (buit-in) (know feature request).</p>
<p>The full-screen button will not work while ActiveX filtering is enabled or your IE Security settings prevent the "scripting of ActiveX controls"</p>
<p>either</p>
<p>Turn off ActiveX filtering</p>
<p>and/or</p>
<p>check your IE security zone settings and click the "Reset all zones to default" button.</p>

            <p>But...&nbsp;at embedded videos, the only thing I can achieve with right-click is to show up just "about html5" dialog, which leads me to YouTube/Html5 site...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I disabled Active-x Filtering /all zones to default etc. But keep in mind the expected normal behavior when I disable Active-X filtering, the video turns in Flash-mode -and m<span>oving away</span>
<span>from</span> <span>goal. I disabled after that the Flash-Plugin too... Again I take html5 video but still not able to see it in Fullscreen mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe there isn't yet such option to make embedded html5 videos on third party sites to view it in fullscreen mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see it in fullscreen mode only if I go visit directly YouTube. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check a better ScreenShot:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried right-clicking and in red square says the known "about html5."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That site I took the screenshot ISN'T YouTube. Just has an embedded video from YouTube. I'm trying to clarify what I mean.

            <p>Hey Jack Sparrow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's check to see if you are able to view an embedded HTML5 video if Internet Explorer is forced to use software rendering (this is different than changing the setting suggested above).</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>Tools</strong> </li><li>Click <strong>Internet Options</strong> </li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab </li><li>Check the <strong>Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering*</strong> box
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> </li><li>Close <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (all windows) </li><li>Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then test to see if you are able to view the full screen video.&nbsp; If so, try installing the latest video card driver from your video card manufacturer's website. Then restart your computer and uncheck the box you checked above (and follow the same process)
 to enable GPU rendering again. Then test to see if the problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</p>

<p><span>First of all, I'd like to thank you all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Steven, the HWA is working extremely perfect on me. Actually this is one of the top reasons why I use IE 9. Has the best HWA implementation and I don't trust any other browser to mess with my precious Graphics Card. Of course, I use always the latest
 drivers ( 275.33 ).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Anyhow, before I realise how stupid I am sometimes, I tried your suggestion. It didn't work of course&nbsp;'cause as I&nbsp;said, I'm fool. I didn't know that HTML5 videos open in&nbsp;their own window... Guess what... I have&nbsp;an external Ad-Popup-Blocker&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;while
 the video&nbsp;was working normally, I couldn't think&nbsp;of being blocked like an "unwanted"&nbsp;pop-up&nbsp; -in FullScreen mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry, again! Also, sorry for my bad English. I'm not from an English-speaking country.

<h2>            Is there a way to change the notification frequency of Yammer emails&#63;</h2>
                    I know there is an option for each group to select "subscribe to this group by email". But is there a way to edit the frequency of notifications? Many folks have been asking in our organization.
