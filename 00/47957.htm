    <title>Password problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password problem</h2>
                    Hello.A week ago,when I was signing in to my microsoft account,I changed my password so I could let my mother use my computer for help on something.After she was done,I went to change my password back to my old password.But,it made me sign in to my microsoft
 account.(Which I find rather annoying,as I don't see why I need to connect to the internet to change my computer's password.).I typed in my old password,and it gave me a message saying "Please choose a password you have not used before.".This is rather annoying
 for me.Is there ANY way I can revert my password back to what it was?If I want to keep my old password,that should be MY decision,not microsoft's.If I can not revert to my old password,then I will take into using linux.It is actually a security concern for
 me,as only SPECIFIC people on my network knew the old password,and now no one can sign to their accounts.I would ask that you allow an old password to be re-entered.&nbsp;

            Hi Mark
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<h2>            drivers</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I am having the same problem<br />
<br />
<br />
I uninstalled the driver then rebooted it reinstalled the same driver for<br />
<br />
Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller<br />
Driver Provider:Microsoft<br />
Driver Date: 6/21/2006<br />
Driver Version: 6.0.6002.18005<br />
Digital Signer: microsoft windows<br />
<br />
and just about everything runs on this driver except my Dispay adapters, IEEE 1284.4 compatible printer, Imaging device, and keyboard because I downloaded these drivers from<br />
my video card, printer and keyboard<br />
<br />
and a few also runs on driver 6.0.6001.18000 but with the same date 6/21/2006

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Pinning website shortcuts to desktop in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 on my HP Pavilion DV7 64 bit laptop. In Windows 7 I was able to pin regularly used websites to my desktop to create a shortcut. I don't seem to be able to do that now. I use Firefox as my main browser whereas previously
 I used Internet Explorer. Could that have anything to do with it? If not, is there a way in which I can create these shortcuts which I find very convenient?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gordon, all you have to do is type <em>Firefox</em> in the Cortana search bar, once it displays the result, right click on
<em>Firefox</em> and select <em><strong>pin to task bar</strong> </em>or <strong>
<em>pin to start menu</em> </strong>as per your convenience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Feel free to post for any issues that you face with Windows in the future.</p>
<p>Have a great experience with Windows 10. </p>

            <p>Hello Joy and thanks for coming back to me though I don't think this is the answer. It has taken me a while as I've struggled to get Cortana operational but have now managed to do so at last. The advice that you've given me would enable me to pin Firefox
 to the start or desktop but that is not what I want. What I do want is that having opened my browser and gone to a site that I use regularly, I want to then pin that site to my desktop, not the browser itself. I have c. 8 sites that I use regularly and had
 them all on my desktop as shortcuts in Windows 7 but I don't seem to be able to do that in Windows 10. No doubt I'm missing something very obvious but can you give me any more help please. Incidentally, I've now changed my default browser to Edge.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble running the program because Windows 7 is too 'new', then you could try using compatibility mode.</p>
<p>To use compatibility mode, follow these steps.</p>
<p>Installed but program will not run:</p>
<p>Right Click the icon of the program&gt; Go to properties&gt; go to the compatibility tab&gt; select from the options that you know will work to run the program.</p>
<p>Installation will not run:</p>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the <span>Start</span> button, clicking<span>Control Panel</span> , clicking
<span>Programs</span> , and then clicking Run programs made for previous versions of windows</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the wizard, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The wizard is not designed to work on programs that have
 an .msi file name extension.</p>
<p>Alternately, you could try Windows XP mode if your computer is running Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise.</p>

<h2>            I need help with the external storage, deleted game</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I had a 2&nbsp;terrabite external storage attached to my console. I was at my freinds house to play and then&nbsp;I moved my exbox back home like normal but when I logged&nbsp; on I had 98% full on storage but normally I had 13%. So I thought something was wrong with my&nbsp;External hard drive. So then I clicked on the storage and I thought format was changing the data to the drive. But it erased all my games. But I later figured out that I put it in the wrong hole. I got my normal games back but lost a lot of my extremely long and high Gg games. Is there any way to get my game started back . I'm currently downloading but it takes too long and I think it doesn't save my data in the game. Please help, thank you very much.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in via dashboard, can&#39;t exit to dashboard once signed in</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since yesterday everytime I try to sign into my profile via the dashboard&nbsp;as soon as the "signing in" message disappears the dashboard immediately crashes. If I load up a game I can sign into my profile inside the game and play online without any problems-
 however when i exit back to the dashboard, instead of the dashboard appearing i just get a black screen and need to turn off/reboot the xbox.</p>
<p>Any ideas as to my problem? Thanks.</p>

<p>There are two things to try off the bat here. First, try clearing your cache, to see if that makes any improvement.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Clear system cache</strong><br />
System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; Highlight HDD, Press (Y) &gt; Clear System Cache &gt; Yes<br />
<br />
If that doesn't do the trick, try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/pages/xbox-live/how-to/xbox-live-account-management/gamer-profile.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 case here. I suspect that when the computer was initially set up a year or two ago, the IT dept established this setting for security reasons. At this point, she owns the computer and works from home, so having this security measure in place is completely
 superfluous and unnecessary.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What do I do to turn off this auto log out/off?</div>
                </div>

<br />
<div>I guess technically it's not logging off, but rather being locked. There is only one user account. When the system is idle for a few minutes, it auto locks. I would describe this as different than logging out because all applications remain running (even
 to the extent that audio from a Netflix stream will continue to play even on the lock screen), it's just that you have to re-enter the password to regain access.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried Method 1, but couldn't even start in safe mode. Holding F8 didn't do anything, and I tried several times. I don't know if this helps, but here's what happens when it starts up...</div>
<div><br />
<div>First, the Dell logo appears, then the following text appears:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Intel(R) Boot Agent GE v1.3.81</div>
<div>Copyright (C) 1997-2011, Intel Corporation</div>
<div><br />
<div>Initializing and establishing link..._"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then where the "initializing.." line was, it reads...</div>
<div><br />
<div>"PXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable</div>
<div>PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel Boot Agent."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then it goes through the normal windows startup. Also, for what it's worth, this is Windows 7 Enterprise.</div>

<p>It's a disgrace that Microsoft assumes users do not need warnings that updates may disable PC use for many hours!&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should classify updates minor, major and next christmas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2+ hours for an Update with no warnings!! You are total w@nkers who don't give a honest damn about user productivity.&nbsp;<span>You leave users vunerable to loss of business and students unable to do studies.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Week after week users just spend their lives installing patches, updates, processing updates and installing in background while PC grinds to a halt and causes 'not responding' due to extreme CPU usage and 100% disk.</p>
<p>We don't buy cars to have them in the garage for 3 hours a week so why a PC????</p>
<p>We can't use our PC's anymore due to constant software upgrades. It's a joke. </p>
<p>Our whole family hates Microsoft and it's endless software patches.</p>

<p>Windows does&nbsp;<strong>sometimes</strong> give prior notice however if you don't snooze the notice, your PC will automatically download the update. If it's something like the Windows 10 feature updates, it will take forever. It's an IT nightmare since the
 speed of the update depends on <strong>internet speeds</strong> and the actual <strong>
pc </strong>it is installing on.</p>
<p>However, Windows 10 uses a system called <strong>BITS</strong> which is basically an intelligent data download system meaning it detects traffic on a network to determine what the best time of the day is to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can in Windows 10 specify&nbsp;<strong>"active hours"</strong> where during them hours, your PC will not download &amp; install updates. So if you set this from say 8am to 10pm, your PC will update between the hours of 10pm &amp; 8am given that you leave the laptop
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other questions, feel free to give me a shout!</p>

            There are too many windows 10 updates. They take HOURS to install. This is a disgrace. I am so unimpressed with windows 10. I can't express in words my total disgust with microsoft and this operating system.

<p>I think this might help you.<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows key + R key then type : <strong>%Windir%&nbsp;</strong><br />
hit enter and it will pop the Windows system folder. look for "Softwaredistribution" &gt; "Downloads" &gt; Delete all the files here
<em>(This files are the downloaded Updates)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Download this tool to prevent downloading and installing the updates that is not properly installing on your device to avoid issues in the future and prevent the requested restarts from Windows update.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t change file &#47; folder permissions or delete files</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded (maybe, jury is still out ont that) XP Pro 32 bit to Win7 home Premium 64 bit.&nbsp; Every thing SEEMED to be working just fine.&nbsp; I play World of Warcraft and had installed it to my second hard drive (D:/world of warcraft).&nbsp; It started and
 ran without problem.&nbsp; The game is getting several patches and I recieved and applied the previous patch without any problems.&nbsp; Today is patch day again, and I have NOT been able to install or even download the latest patch.&nbsp;If I just run the game as before,
 the downloader just sits there and says initializing....&nbsp; I read on the game forums that running the game as administrator solved the problem, so I did that.&nbsp; It starts downloading but now I get :Could not initialize storage.&nbsp; You may not have permission to
 write to the destination path."!&nbsp; I have looked the permissions for the folder that it is trying to save to (and saved to&nbsp;for the last patch!)&nbsp;and it looks odd!&nbsp; I see the following for Group or user names,</p>
<p>Everyone</p>
<p>System</p>
<p>S-1-5-21-110828301-999176518-1929737048-512</p>
<p>S-1-5-21-110828301-999176518-1929737048-519</p>
<p>I do have two users defined on this system, Mike and Mike1 so I'm assuming that the the long names above are the two users but have for some reason NOT resolved themselve to shortnames.&nbsp; Both of these users when I go to the User Accounts control panel show
 as being adminitsrators and password protected!</p>
<p>At any rate I can NOT change permissions, delete or move files, and as a result can not use my computer to play my game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />A. Change Power Management setting for devices which can wake the computer
<br />Type cmd in Windows Start Search box &gt; Right click on cmd &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type following &amp; Enter: powercfg -devicequery wake_armed
<br />It will show the list of all devices which can possibly wake up your computer
<br />Now, you need to make a decision which all devices you want to make changes to to handle this problem
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager
<br />Locate a device from the above list say Keyboard
<br />Under Power Management tab &gt; Check the box next to Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. If this already checked, uncheck it &gt; OK &gt; Check it again &gt; OK
<br />Do it for other also.
<br /> Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />B. Get int to the BIOS setting of your computer (For how to - Look up internet for your computer make and model)
<br />Resume from S3/S4/S5 by PS/2 Mouse should be enabled
<br />Resume from S3/S4/S5 by Keyboard should be any key
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<h2>            Can&#39;t uninstall AdwCleaner_4.202 Application</h2>
                    When I run adwcleaner it says it's files have become corrupt and that I should delete it and download it again. The problem is that because it's corrupted, the GUI for it won't come up so I can use the uninstall button in the App. Also, it's not showing
 up in my program list in the control panel. How can I uninstall it now?

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 Problems adding music</h2>
                    I have just upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate from Vista Ultimate. I have all my music on a 1TB Western Digital Carver Green, my Media Drive. Now when i try to manage my media in Media Player, when i try to add folders or anything, after i click on Organize&gt;
 Media Libraries&gt; Music&gt;, there is no response does nothing at all, no action. When i click on Video or anything else it lets me pic folders and everything else that i need to do. But does not add the media to the library. I am not sure what to do i have tried
 everything i can think of. I can go to the folders where my media is stored and click on a file and play it through media player that way, but still no library to use.... what do i do, was it a mistake to buy windows 7, so far i have bean disappointed with
 this since everything i have is not yet compatible with 7 and it has already crashed 12 times in 1 week, i have got everything else figured out for now but the media play, what do i do, media player 12 is no good!!!1

            Uninstall and re-install WMP12. <br />
<br />
To uninstall,<br />
<br />
Click <strong>Start </strong>&gt; type <strong>appwiz.cpl &gt; </strong>select <strong>
Turn Windows features on or off </strong><br />
<br />
From "Media Features" <strong>UNCHECK </strong>Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
Restart the computer. THis uninstalls WMP12.<br />
<br />
After restart, <br />
<br />
Click <strong>Start </strong>&gt; type <strong>appwiz.cpl &gt; </strong>select <strong>
Turn Windows features on or off <br />
</strong><br />
From "Media Features" <strong>CHECK </strong>Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
Restart.<br />
<br />
This would reinstall WMP12. <br />
<br />
Let us know what happens!<br />

            <p>I received a reminder e-mail on my question earlier today and as instructed, at command prompt (Admin), I ran SFC /scannow which resulted in Windows did not find any integrity violations. So, I then ran DISM Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth.</p>
<p>The restore operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>I exited and restarted the computer and Cortina, the start menu and notifications app started to work. I was then able to access Window Updates and after a long pause it installed
 the latest Malicious Software Removal Tool and one other update so it appears that that is working also. From the logs it appears that it has been trying to install these for 9 days and failing each time. So, thank you Microsoft!</span>

<p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having a corrupted profile is one of the possible reasons why you cannot install the game Minecraft. To help you resolve this concern, I need to gather more details. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you experiencing this concern with your other games?</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to this concern?</p>
<p>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I recommend that you perform the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps using the link below. This can help remove problems with an app from Microsoft Store.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Delete Temporary files. This will help delete temporary files that have been stored on your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Storage</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>This PC</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Temporary files</strong>.</li><li>Choose Temporary files. </li><li>Click <strong>Remove files</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: Reset Store Cache.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Win+R</strong> keys to open the Run dialog.&nbsp; </li><li>Type <strong>WSReset.exe</strong>, and click/tap on <strong>OK</strong>. &nbsp;<br />
Note: The WS tool resets the Windows Store without changing account settings or deleting installed apps.
</li><li>The&nbsp; <strong>Store</strong> and a <strong>command prompt</strong> will now open without any message. The command prompt will automatically close when the Store cache has been reset.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us with the results.</p>

    <title>need windows 7 compatible audio drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heatherthered  say:</h3>
<h2>            need windows 7 compatible audio drivers</h2>
                    I just upgraded my Dell Dimension 4600 from XP to windows 7.&nbsp; Works great.&nbsp; I'm really pleased with the relatively smooth transition (and how windows automatically transferred my drivers, even with the clean install).&nbsp; When it was an XP machine, I had
 some trouble with my audio drivers (I think they were sound blaster, but I don't remember), so I installed Realtek AC '97 drivers.&nbsp; These drivers worked great with XP, but they're unsigned, so can't be used for 7 (I'm a little peeved about that).&nbsp; I'm not
 interested in getting around the lame unsigned driver bug.&nbsp; I just want some decent generic sound drivers that ARE signed, so I can have some sound on my machine.&nbsp; Doesn't need to be anything fancy--it'd be a wasted effort with my cheap Walmart speakers anyway.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In short: I'd like a link to download generic audio drivers that are windows 7 compatible.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

                    print spooler not started. I've followed all directions on various forums,including microsoft answers but still can't solve the problem. command prompt scannow says there is no problem. When I try to install printer software it says print spooler not started

            Hi Samhrutha,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer I am trying to install is a Canon Pixma MP250.&nbsp; I ran the inbuilt troubleshooter, result was - problem found but could not fix. I have disabled firewall and antivirus and tried again, but same result.
 I can't uninstall the software as I am unable to install it in the first place.<br />

            Hi Samhrutha,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've also noticed&nbsp; Volume Shadow Copy Service can't be started "Error 2: system cannot find file specified", diskshadow also doesn't appear to be installed in windows 7! Not happy with Windows 7. Might have to go back to XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards,
 philtaa.
