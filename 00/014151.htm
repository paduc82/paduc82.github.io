<h2>            My OVI Mail locked by Yahoo &#58;&#64;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have been using an OVI mail for my small business since a year or so with small but bearable problems, My business is not that old that's why I defined a very recent Date of Birth when signing up for that account. But when OVI mail got powered by Yahoo,
 they locked my account assuming that it's a child's account. I can access it from Outlook though but cannot from the web. Below is the text from Yahoo:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Please get your mom or dad!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone kindly explain me W.T.F is that? Hundreds of my clients have this Email address and I don't wanna create a new ID. I badly need help. Is creating a new ID the only option? If so, then I have to say goodbye to OVI and Yahoo mail.</p>

 to see if we can fix this going forward, for you and others. &nbsp;One other question--was 1/1/2000 the exact date of birth you chose when you setup the account? &nbsp;Partially, I'm just curious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Just FYI - New Ovi accounts can't be created with a date of birth indicating you are &lt; 13 years old. But it seems like we could handle existing accounts with such a date of birth better.</span></p>

Hi Brett, It's been almost 2 years so can't recall correctly but I am about 90% sure that this is the date of birth I entered while signing up for an OVI account. Actually this date of birth doesn't belong to me, I set this date of birth for my small business
 which is about 11 years old.<br />

<p>@mysterious1 - The right team is engaged now, and we asked that they update your account's date of birth to 1/1/1990. &nbsp;I think they'll be able to do that, but the real confirmation will come after they've actually done it. &nbsp;It'll probably still be another
 couple of days. &nbsp;I'll let you know when we get the word they've fixed your account, after which you can change the birthdate to whatever you want that's &gt;= 13 years old.</p>

<h2>            Shared Mailbox keeps prompting for credentials.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem with a shared mailbox that i've created in the exchange online portal.</p>
<p>I can add it in outlook as an extra mailbox but it keeps prompting for my credentials.</p>
<p>If however i create a shared mailbox on our exchange server and then migrate it to the cloud. I have no trouble.</p>
<p>We are not in a real hybrid environment since we are using exchange 2007.</p>
<p>I'm guessing it has something to do with ad not knowing the online shared mailbox but i don't see why that should be a problem. I can add the mailbox so obviously outlook knows it.</p>
<p>I can open the mailbox in the portal so it's not a rights problem?</p>

<p>ok, so i have been able to solve this. It was an autodiscover problem. our exchange autodiscover was already pointing in the right direction but our dns autodiscover wasn't set right yet. we have new issues now (autodiscover not finding anything the first
 time a user opens outlook. Unless you create a mailuser in exchange) but i will search on this first :) thx anyway for the help.</p>

    <title>Why does the grid not match the drawing sizes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does the grid not match the drawing sizes&#63;</h2>
                    I use the grid and do extensive mechanical drawings.&nbsp; I notice that if I set an object to be say 4" long with a grid of .1" squares that the line and the grid don't match.&nbsp; whereas I would expect there to be 40 squares for the 4" line there are often a
 couple more or less.&nbsp; Seems like a bug but I don't know to let Microsoft know.&nbsp; Anyone else have this issue?

            I set a page size up to 11" x 17" and select the grid as 0.1".&nbsp; Using the drawing tools I make a rectangular box 7" x 5".&nbsp; I'll put the box on the grid and align it on the left side.&nbsp; Within that rectangle I want to locate circles for holes I'm going to
 drill out.&nbsp; I want to space the holes apart and locate them on the 0.1" grid.&nbsp; When I go to locate a hole at say 4" from a side instead of it being exactly 40 .1" grid boxes from the edge it might be 41 or 41.3.&nbsp; The bigger the rectangular box I start with
 the greater the accumulated error.&nbsp; It's as if the .1" grid boxes aren't exactly .100" but instead something like .105" which adds up the larger the size.&nbsp; It becomes very annoying when I try to make larger size mechanical drawings.&nbsp; I like using word because
 it is easy to make mechanical drawings and share the files. <br />
<br />
I would like to see the addition of a hemisphere shape in the basic shapes of the drawing tools.&nbsp; Also, since I use the drawign tools for mechanical drawings adding a suite of mechanical components like screws and nuts and the like would be handy.<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions.<br />

<h2>            All my browsers &#40;Edge, Chrome, Firefox&#41; are taking 20-30 seconds or longer to load, if they load at all.</h2>
                    <p>For the past few days any browser I try to use takes 20-30 seconds&nbsp;or more to load, if they load at all. I have uninstalled every Windows update back to 10/13/2015 and hid them so they aren't re-installed&nbsp;but nothing has helped. When trying to play Zynga
 Poker, or trying to watch a video (YouTube, Vimeo, Netflix, and all others I have tried) the video and/or game is jerky and freezes the entire browser. I'm thinking flash or related drivers maybe. Web pages take close to a minute on some and over 1 minute
 on others&nbsp;and some won't&nbsp;load at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes when they fail to load the entire screen goes white. These problems are specific to my computer and&nbsp;I am convinced it is not my IP or router/wifi connection due to all other devices test internet speed @ 17
 MBs/sec. My Windows 10 computer only get 1-3 MBs/sec. which is Terrible.&nbsp;I am on a HP Pavilion laptop with AMD A10-5750 APU with Radeon HD Graphics 2.50 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 64 bit Windows 10 Home&nbsp;64-bit OS x64 based processor. I am not computer literate so please
 speak noob and tell me what and&nbsp;how to get any other info you might need. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sorry for the edit but: On some pages, games and videos, only part of the screen shows anything leaving the rest blank white also.</p>

            Are you a Windows 10 Insider and if so are you on build 10565? Are you activated?&nbsp; Do you have any third party antivirus installed and if so it was recommended not to use with this build, especially Avast.
<br />
Edit: Please note that Windows Updates provide Security and Stability to the operating system so you may want to reinstall the deleted updates. One of those updates should have been a Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 for x64-based
 Systems (KB3105216).

            Thank you hawkeyes46. No I'm not a Windows 10 insider so I'm not sure of the build. Windows 10 is installed and activated. I have Norton 360 for my main security, McAfee Security Scan Plus for quick scans and Sophos Virus Removal Tool for deep scans. I
 also ran a scan with MalwareBytes portable. None of these found anything. When I disable Norton nothing changes except the warning bubble telling me I am unprotected. So far this morning everything seems to be working as it should, but I haven't tried games
 or video. I will test these today and post the results. Ok, after trying to play Zynga Poker it is still choppy and freezes. Videos load, but continuously buffers, is choppy, and freezes after about 30 seconds-3 minutes. I ran another internet speed test on
 Ookla and the results were: Ping-34, Download 2.3Mbps and upload 3.1Mbps. The upload speed is what it should be, ping is usually 9-11 or 12, download speed is usually and should be 15-17Mbps and upload of 3. I have screen shots and files fr

            <p>It is recommended to only run one antivirus program and since you are running three they may be conflicting with each other. Malwarebytes is ok to run with only one antivirus</p>
<p>program. Norton and McAfee are both very intrusive programs and I am not familiar with

<p>Sophos. I use the built in Windows Defender and Malwarebytes and had a similar issue when I used Avast.</p>

            I only run Norton full time, I used the others one at a time to compare and hopefully find something Norton missed but no luck. Sophos tool is a specialty tool from Sophos Labs designed to deep search every file, nook and cranny of your system. www.sophos.co.
 I left the m because I'm not sure about what is considered spam. I can recommend it as a very good tool for it's stated purpose. I have used Norton since way back when it was a resource hog and have never had a problem unless I purposely set it to ignore something.
 I don't know for sure how to find individual drivers or graphics cards, but I have pretty much convinced myself it is flash or related. Most pages load pretty normal today, and my last test was: 12 ping, 15.88Mb/s down, and 3.21Mb/s up which is all good. Zynga
 is still jerky microfreezes and videos, especially youtube, but all buffer constantly and freeze occasionally.

Internet speed is very relevant to, and ties in with, my issues as it's the only computer in the house that has these problems, all of these problems, that happen while I am on.....the internet. I have no problems using anything and everything, program or software
 that is normally used offline. I have re-installed the updates that I had hidden but no change.

<p>Why Multiple Antivirus Programs is a Bad Idea</p>
<div><span>September 9, 2013</span> <span><a href="https://blog.kaspersky.com/author/sym451/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Posts by Serge Malenkovich">Serge Malenkovich</a></span>

</a></span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>You might think that, much like a pirate going into battle, the more weapons you have at your disposal for your protection the better: cutlass in one hand, pistol and the other, knife held between the teeth (hence the expression ‘armed to the teeth’). But
 while that may work in old-fashioned combat, it is not the case when it comes to protecting your system from the sea of danger it constantly faces. Running two antivirus programs at the same time is, in fact, a very bad idea. There are three reasons why:</p>
<p><a href="https://46qasb3uw5yn639ko4bz2ptr8u-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2013/09/2av_title_EN.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2f46qasb3uw5yn639ko4bz2ptr8u-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com%2ffiles%2f2013%2f09%2f2av_title_EN.jpg" height="420" width="640" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>They will try to kill each other</strong>. Because antivirus programs search your system for programs that are monitoring and sending information about your system, a competing antivirus program that is monitoring and sending information about your
 system tends to look like a virus, so it will attempt to block it and remove it.
<div>A competing antivirus program that is monitoring and sending information about your system tends to look like a virus.</div>
</li><li><strong>They will fight over viruses</strong>. When an antivirus program encounters a virus, it removes it and quarantines it. But if a competing antivirus program sees that quarantined file and wants to remove and quarantine it in accordance with its own
 objectives, then it will repeatedly send reports and notifications about this virus that it is detecting, even though it is no longer actually a threat to your system. If you don’t want to continually get bogus warning messages, this will be a problem for
 you.</li><li><strong>They will sap your power</strong>. Antivirus programs use a lot of your system memory to conduct system scans and other related operations. If you have two of these operating simultaneously, your system’s effectiveness can be greatly diminished
 or completely wiped out altogether, and without any benefit, since the two are performing redundant operations.</li></ol>
<p>When it comes to protecting your computer, more protection is not better. Take some time to do the research and choose one
<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/internet-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
comprehensive antivirus suite</a> that has been independently tested to combat the latest known malware programs and that will single handedly arm your system to the teeth to protect it against every type of threat.</p>

            <p>If you are still having issues after resolving the antivirus issue you should run the system file checker to check for errors.</p>
<p>Right click Windows icon on the task bar, left click on Command Prompt (Admin), click yes on user control menu, post: sfc /scannow&nbsp;
</p>

<p>If you are still having issues after resolving the antivirus issue you should run the system file checker to check for errors.</p>
<p>Right click Windows icon on the task bar, left click on Command Prompt (Admin), click yes on user control menu, post: sfc /scannow&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for helping. I only use one anti-virus to protect my computers. As I have stated before, the only time I use anything besides Norton 360 is, #1: I always make sure Norton is disabled, and #2: the only time I use any other virus software is to double
 check if Norton missed anything, or to troubleshoot my computers actions and compatibility in case Norton is what doesn't play well with new updates etc. I have run sfc /scannow, which found no flags or problems, I have run WindowsUpdateDiagnostics.diagcab,
 which showed 1 issue found&gt;&gt;Service registration is missing or corrupt, Not Fixed&lt;&lt;, I have run a lot of tests that other people in other forums/help sites told me to try. I have run a registry check with CCleaner, and other software and found no issues except
 left overs from updates or uninstalls which is normal. I mentioned before, and still think it is a flash or HTML issue with one of the Windows 10 Updates, and is specifically/especially worse when using Chrome. A Windows Tech or someone with more knowledge
 than me should probably start/focus on Chrome compatibility first and maybe find what is wrong there to use on all the others, since #1: Chrome is very noticeably worse, #2 Chrome doesn't allow Java, or flash. Thank you again, but to find the problem we need
 to move past the anti-virus thing that I have stated is not it. I have tried using NO anti-virus at all and the issue is still the same.<br />

<h2>            MISSING TEXT FROM SENT EMAILS IN HTML FROM OFFICE 2013 PROGRAMS</h2>
                    <p>Having problems with&nbsp;text in&nbsp;sent&nbsp;emails in HTML from within an office program - Word, Excel, Publisher etc. I select to share and then attach relevant file as an attachment and Word etc opens up Outlook , email text is written, email is sent no problem.
 When examining the email in the sent box all of the text has disappeared but the attachment is still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only happens using IMAP/POP arrangement and is fine in Exchange. No problem if email is composed in plain text.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired the office installation and checked for update KB2553248 which I believe has caused a problem in the past - it is not on my PC. I have changed default fonts. I have removed and set up new profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would&nbsp; be gratefully received</p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have Norton anti spam installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various options but I should state at the outset that I discovered that if the text is defaulted to Rich and then changed to HTML the problem does not occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if text format is set to HTML the problem is there. So I followed your suggestions. Initially I tried outlook in safe mode with no add ins and I can successfully send an email from say Excel with the text showing but there is a twist. The email is
 received by the email account to which it is sent and the text is seen in that email BUT The sent email does not show up in the original account from which it is sent. It appears in the sent folder of the receiving email account which happens to be a Microsoft
 exchange account . The original email account from which the email is sent is an IMAP/POP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same behaviours occurs with a Windows clean boot. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can not properly view locally stored html files on IE11</h2>
                    <p>I have been using a photo html&nbsp;creator program&nbsp;called JAlbum with no problems.&nbsp; Since upgrading to Windows 8.1 and IE 11, the html files created by JAlbum stored locally on the hard drive will not display properly in IE11.&nbsp; When IE11 opens the locally stored
 index.html file, it looks like a text file.&nbsp; However, this same file can be viewed properly using Chrome.&nbsp; And, once the files are uploaded from the local folders to a server, they load and view properly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have seen a suggestion to change a security setting in IE11&gt;Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advance&gt; scroll down to security and check the box&nbsp; "allow active content to run in files on My Computer".&nbsp; I did this but no changes.</p>

            <p>Hi Fergie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you facing this issue only with html files created using JAlbum?</p>
<p><br />
Yes, I see that setting "allow active content to run in files on My Computer" and setting Internet Explorer as default web browser to fix this issue.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Create a general .html file and check if you are able to open it using Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Open Notepad, and type in the following HTML tag into the document: <br />
&lt; html&gt;.</p>
<div>
<p>Input the head tags: &lt;head&gt;Title of Web page&lt;/head&gt;.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Type in the body tags: &lt;body&gt; Content of the web page &lt; /body&gt;.</p>
<div>
<p>Close the html tag &lt;/html&gt;.</p>
<div>
<p>Click "Save as" and save the document with the ".html" extension.</p>
<p>Now, check if you are able to open the HTML file using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also, Refer to this thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie8-windows_7/ie8-wont-open-local-files/59aefd81-f4b0-4749-aeb9-50ac7067ba98">

<h2>            Insufficient Privileges - Sharepoint - Office 365</h2>
                    
<p>I just got set up on our Sharepoint servcie with Office 365. &nbsp;My IT department said they set me up as a "user", not sure where that ranks in the hierarchy of permissions. &nbsp; When i went to add an Access app to a site, it got this error message that said i
 did not have sufficient permissions to perform that action. &nbsp;We are new to SharePoint. &nbsp;Any idea what level of user i have to be in order to work with Access Apps?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>After giving <strong>Full control</strong> permission, the user is able to create Access app. Could you contact your admin to have a try?</p>

            Hi Kelly
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It could be an issue related to the following:
<br />
<br />- There might be Malware on the system
<br />- The edition of Windows 10 you are running: Pro or Enterprise might be managed by your organizations system administrator.
<br />- You might need to reinstall Windows Defender using the steps below. 
<br />- A repair upgrade might by required to fix it.
<br />
<br />Enable Windows Defender:
<br />Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SecurityHealthService
<br />
<br />and modify the Start value from 4 to 2. Restart your computer to re-enable the Windows Defender Security Center Service.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Defender Antivirus Service
<br />Double click it
<br />Set its Start up type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableRoutinelyTakingAction /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG DELETE "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware 
<br />
<br />If this does not resolve the problem, then you need to perform a repair upgrade. See steps:

            <p>I would think that the reason that you have not had a response is because you have not provided enough information.</p>
<p>

            <p>Start with Doug's suggestion. &nbsp;Then, one approach to accomplishing what I *think* you're after would be to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new file in Excel or open the file you want to bring these other files into (I'm assuming they're already worksheets)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then add a bit to this section of Doug's code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For i = 1 To .SelectedItems.Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wb = Workbooks.Open(.SelectedItems(i))</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Do something with the file</p>
<p>
</p><p>' copy the contents of the first worksheet in the newly opened file</p>
<p>' add a new worksheet to the "main" file that you opened to begin with</p>
<p>' paste in the copied content</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wb.Close SaveChanges:=False</p>
<p>Next i</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally save the main file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's a possibility that there are multiple worksheets in each of these files you're importing, you'd need to add another inner loop to handle that.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "No Files were selected"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo ExitHandler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
x = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wkbTemp = Workbooks.Open(Filename:=FilesToOpen(x))<br />

<br />
Now, the only issue with the above code is that, the files are imported on a new workbook, instead of the current workbook, from where the code is run.<br />
I tried doing the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Replace: <br />
Set wkbTemp = Workbooks.Open(Filename:=FilesToOpen(x))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wkbTemp.Sheets(1).Copy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set wkbAll = ActiveWorkbook</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">With this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Set wkbAll = ActiveWorkbook</p>

</p><p>I however, searched online and found an eerily similar post <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-customize/importing-multiple-text-files-and-replace-contents/f13e1ca2-821c-4337-bf94-897987eaab7d">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although it does work beautifully, the only exceptions are:</p>
<p>1. the use of picking up a folder instead of individual files, and</p>
<p>2. it would work with text files only.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the tweak in the code. However, I need to select the files, instead of the entire folder, as it contains other files too, which would be irrelevant.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm also a VBA newbie, but I'm trying to do the exact same thing as the O.P. <em>

<strong>as new WorkSheets to the active WorkBook</strong>.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, only importing .pdf files from said would serve my purposes as well.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li><li>I copied your code from March 1st, but changed&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>strFile = Dir$(strFolder &amp; "<strong>*.csv</strong>")</em> to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>strFile = Dir$(strFolder

<h3> gks80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a feature in PowerPoint that allows for Shapes to be locked in on location</h2>
                    <p>Powepoint is widely used in my industry and we make awesome decks using this tool. But there are several features that are missing that would seriously make our lives easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Lock Shapes on slides.</strong> - Is there an option to lock shapes on regular slides. On most occasions I have multiple layers of objects overlapping. It is such a painful task to keep clicking till you select the one object you want to me. Almost
 on all occasions you land up moving several things that you don't want to. The ability to lock shapes/textboxes in one location will really make things much much easier. Also, I know we can lock shapes on the Master, but that option doesn't help because each
 slide is different and I cannot have locked shapes on the Master.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, MS understands that user feedback is really important and they need to act on it. If needed create a poll so users can vote on the most wanted features.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No such feature in the GUI. You can use the selection pane to hide shapes which may help with what you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite easy to lock shape position in the XML which means MSFT MIGHT listen as the code already exists. In the meantime OfficeOne have an AddIn ShapeLocker (commercial) that can do this.</p>

            <p>Adding on to Mr. Wilson's comment: Once you activate the Selection Pane (Home&gt;Editing&gt;Select&gt;Selection Pane), you can click on any of the shapes to select it. Although the original shape names listed may not be helpful (e.g., Rectangle 3 or Oval 5), the
 appearance of sizing handles will help you verify that you've picked the one you want to move. And you can even click on a shape's name and replace it with something more meaningful if you plan to work with that slide a lot.</p>
<p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Hello Matthieu,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question.<br />
<br />
From your description, I understand that you’re unable to install an Office update.<br />
<br />
I will assist you to resolve this issue, however I need additional information:<br />
<br />
1) Which update is getting failed to install (include the KB number or the name of the update)?<br />
2) Is there any other error report logged in Event Viewer? <span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</font></span><span><br />
<font color="#000000">To open Event Viewer, press and hold the <font><b>Windows + R</b> key on the keyboard. In the Run open box type in ‘<b>eventvwr</b>’ (without the quotes) and click on
<b>OK</b></font>.<br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<font><font>Let’s try the following and verify the result: <br />
<br />
1) Start the computer in clean boot state and then try installing the updates and verify the result.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Refer to the following article on how to restart computer in clean boot:</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a><font><font>
</font></font></span></p>
<br />
2) Download the update and then try installing it manually. <br />
<br />
3) If the above fails, repair the Office suite following the instructions mentioned in the below link and then try installing the update:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/repair-office-programs-HA010357402.aspx</font></a>
<br />

</p><p>You say this can happen when:</p>
<p><span>The wrong Microsoft account name was entered by mistake or due to a typo.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I entered a gmail address, not a Microsoft account name.</span></p>

<p>I got the same issue and more strange things happened. I used my Gmail to create my Skype account (Skype name: xxxxx.xxxxx) years ago. However, several days ago, I could not sign in when using the email. When I used the Skype name to sign in, it required
 me to change my password. I entered two emails (my Gmail and my Yahoo mail). I opened my Yahoo mailbox to get the link for password change. Things were done. Password was changed and I could sign in using the Skype name.</p>
<p>But I still cannot sign in using either Gmail or Yahoo mail. It is said that the two emails are neither Microsoft account. Then I signed in with my Microsoft account to create a new Skype name. How can I close the previous account (xxxxx.xxxxx)?</p>

<p>This amounts to fraud, I also had credit in my account and years of contact and history. I am sure somewhere in the future we will see sone sort of class action law suit against Hotmail. If this message is reaching to someone at Microsoft Skype support please
 help. My gmail account Skype ID is rxxxxxxxxxxx@xxxxxxxm</p>

            This is Microsoft's attempt to control us....I'm very upset too that my Skype account is gone...I'm sorry I ever had a Microsoft account now.&nbsp; I'm actually sorry Microsoft exists. &nbsp; It must be unlawful to do this, to just take our data without consent.

<p>Hi Skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same; I don't have a Microsoft account and the gmail email address I registered my Skype account years ago isn't recognised.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the solutions given above, it doesn't apply. Microsoft need to understand that this is an issue and I am about to loose credit and contacts.
</p>
<p>- I haven't logged into the incorrect account as I only have one and one email address</p>
<p>- I logged in with the same credentials as I always had which is my gmail account</p>
<p>- tried multiple devices and get exactly the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 5 days before I loose my credit. Please respond with a solution asap. </p>
<p>
</p><p>NB: I only now have a Microsoft account that I needed to create before I can comment on here. It is the same email address used for Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you </p>

<p>What I had to do was change my Microsoft email to my gmail account.&nbsp; You have to make an alias and then delete the original email address.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft has to send you code after code to verify it's you.&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>Somehow when I set up my new phone, Microsoft got me to log in using my original email.&nbsp; I think if maybe I had noticed that and NOT logged into Microsoft, I wouldn't be having this issue.</p>
<p>However, Skype is still a mess...I've been using Discord.</p>

<p>Hi KAmy_15,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No the answer is no.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be noted that although the organizor can mute the meeting participants. But he/she can't permanently mute them as the participants can unmute themselves. However, it is recommended that the organizor can set up an inform that all the participants
 are not allowed to unmute unless the organizor permit it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Control Panel Response</h2>
                    <p>Trying to print after installing Windows 10 (updated drivers as well) and when I open Control Panel and click on Printers, it just keeps spinning without opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ongoing saga of printing and Windows 10: I have a Canon printer and Canon suggested that I remove the old drivers and reinstall the new (Windows 10) drivers. When I go to Control Panel/Uninstall Programs and try to remove the drivers, nothing happens.
 If I try again, Windows 10 says to wait until it finishes even though I first tried this 24 hours ago).</p>

<h2>            Cannot send or receive emails</h2>
                    <p>On my MSN Mail Inbox (MSN Premium) I have a yellow caution sign with an exclamation symbol showing.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I click on it, the message reads “You cannot send or receive your MSN email because of a problem on the email server.” &nbsp;error 0x85ad60eb. &nbsp;What is
 this problem?&nbsp; How do I get rid of it?</p>

            Let me make sure I understand. You connect using Edge to http://mail.live.com/ to log into your mailbox, correct? And do you see the yellow symbol before or after you log in? Can you see any of your messages in the mailbox?

            <p><span>Yes, basically correct.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But, I have a MSN premium account and <span>&nbsp;</span>this happens when I sign into my MSN Premium account.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Although this account still receives and sends emails, the warning icon persists.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;

            The MSN Solution Center (<a href="http://answers.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://answers.msn.com/</a>) may be a better place to handle this.

 No definitive answer yet, but it wouldn't hurt to add your voice to that thread.

<h3> david grimsdell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly I cannot view streamed tv &#40;ie Sky Go&#41; in IE11</h2>
                    I have never had this problem before and am stumped. After many months of happily being able to watch different tv programmes through Sky Go in Internet Explorer 11, yesterday and today it will not open. I just have a plain white box and no matter what
 I try or what settings I look into it will not change and I cannot see the programme that I want to see. No changes have been made to my settings or anything immediately before this problem, so can anyone suggest what may have happened?

            Yes it is the same computer. I managed to sort the other problems. I have cleaned out my system a lot since the last problem and now only have about 1/4 of what I used to have on it. The TV streaming has been working fine and I regularly watch Sky Go through
 it (particularly football when the rest of the family are watching other things on the main TV). However now all I am getting is the dratted white box!

    <title>Linking 2 Excel worksheets on Dual Monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinpc06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking 2 Excel worksheets on Dual Monitors</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My whole department just received dual monitors at work &amp; part of the efficiency was to review 2 Excel worksheets on different monitors and create links between the different sources as needed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, when creating links between these 2 workbooks I've noted that the link path says the following:</p>
<p>=Excel.Sheet.8|'\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is different from the normal path I'm used to seeing which would be something like “='S:\”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Further, I've noted that the linking didn’t seem to work very well when linking under Excel.Sheet8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another observation is when I edit links the type says Excel.Sheet8 and another says Worksheet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is new to me &amp; I was just wondering how to best manage the links.</p>

            In order to open different files of Excel on another monitor you need to open another instance of excel move it to second monitor and then open file on the other monitor.<br />
<br />
Try this and see how it has to behave.<br />
<br />
If i have not understood the issue then provide detailed information.<br />

Did you test this behavior on other computers if you are using dual monitor.<br />
<br />
Using dual monitor should not effect any of the Excel feature.<br />
<br />
Please check this and let us know the result.<br />

            Have you tried to open the two workbooks within the same Excel instance, and use "Arrange All" to arrange the workbooks vertically? This way, you can resize your Excel's screen to span across the 2 monitors. See whether it works better for you with those
 links.
