<h2>            Office 365 Home Premium &#36;9.99 per month - Can i create custom Apps with this particular subscription &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone&nbsp;please tell me if i will be able to&nbsp;create custom Excel 2013 apps if i subscribe to the&nbsp;"Office 365 Home Premium" subscription for $9.99 per month and will this&nbsp;$9.99 subscription allow me to&nbsp;create&nbsp;these custom apps using the&nbsp;Napa&nbsp;and or Visual
 Studio tools?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp;my main&nbsp;objective is to create&nbsp;a web based Excel&nbsp;user interface that will allow me to&nbsp;create, read, update and delete Sharepoint and or database records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or can anyone recommend a more&nbsp;cost effective way to start learning how to develop Excel 2013 apps considering all of the various cloud offerings that&nbsp;are out there now a days?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for any insights on this!</p>
<p>bk</p>

            The applications in the subscription version are the same as in an MIS version.&nbsp; You should be able to determine in the first month if there are any problems and if so, just cancel the subscription.

            <p>Thanks Doug, that sounds like a good approach and actually i did have temporary access to that free DEV version of Office 365 when they were offering it and i was able to plug in the NAPA tool, but&nbsp;i wasn't sure if that DEV version was the equivalent of
 the Home version or not, but what the heck if i can cancel the subscription at any time then that's the way to go!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank again Doug!</p>

<p>What the OP wanted to know is if Windows 10 for phones will suppor HID input like Bluetooth keyboards. Can you confirm if this is&nbsp;planned for Windows 10 or not?</p>

            <p>I'm planning my next phone too and I'm very interested in pairing a Bluetooth keyboard to the phone.&nbsp; Why have Office without a keyboard?&nbsp; I can text without a keyboard but I want to be productive on the go without lugging a lot of dead weight around.&nbsp; I
 understand the abilities of the phone will be very minimal when compared to a laptop.&nbsp; A good part of what I do can be done with a handheld device and if I need more power, I'll&nbsp;find a workstation or pack a laptop.&nbsp; iOS and Android have&nbsp;had HID for quite a
 while&nbsp;and that's mainly why I'm still using those devices.&nbsp; I use iOS for personal and Android for work because I can save and transfer files directly on the device.&nbsp; Android also has the added benefit of OTG USB support which is a huge benefit for me at work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me a reason to switch like support for HID and OTG USB cables and I'll drop both phones and buy a Windows Phone or whatever it will be called in the future and use it for personal
<em>and</em> business use. </p>

            There still hasn't been any response on this. But WP 8.1 Update 2 (the version that comes pre-installed on the Lumia 640 and 640 XL) apparently supports Bluetooth keyboards already.

<p>Since HID and OTG hasn't worked on the Windows Phone since at least version 7.5, there is no reason... yet... to assume it would now unless the protocol were added. &nbsp;So, please tell us if the protocol is even being considered and then I'll try my keyboard
 again. &nbsp;By the way, I've posted about this in several threads, some of which I have started and I have provided feedback to Microsoft via the feedback app on my phone. &nbsp;So, multiple venues, none with answers to the question of whether or not HID and/or OTG
 will work in the future, if ever. &nbsp;A protocol that even the cheapest Android phones and the most expensive iPhones include but Microsoft surprisingly left out. &nbsp;Then the head scratching trying to figure out why no one buys Windows phones. &nbsp;This isn't the only
 reason by far but it is on my list and I'd love to see it added before I buy another Windows Phone.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a great MS fan. Like Win, VS and others. Working with those daily and using W10 from the beginning of TP.
</p>
<p>There is no OTG support on Lumia 640 under W8.1 U2! I've checked it again. Neither Mass storage nor keyboard or mouse.
</p>
<p>I've also tried under W10 (unsure build number), didn't work either!</p>
<p>It's a shame for MS: on a early Sony Sola (MT27i) with ICS both working. Not to mention lather model with LP! Also a shame for MS how poor the complete Bluetooth stack works. For example on W7 there is mostly third part support only.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Security lock password</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with my Nokia E66 after upgrading&nbsp;firmware&nbsp;to&nbsp;newest&nbsp;version 300.21.012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Mail for Exchange and because of some server security settings I had to setup security lock password. Everything was working fine until this firmware upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I start my mobile I first must enter PIN number and after this it ask me for security unlock key. I type in my key and it doesn't work. I also tried to type default "12345" and also not working. I also tried to<span>&nbsp;reset
 the phone by holding *3green call button and power at same time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I'm not able to do anything with my phone except of answering to a call.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any help would be much&nbsp;appreciated.<i>ðŸ˜ƒ</i></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I donÂ´t know if this will work on your phone as I have an E61: For my model, the code ---*#7370# or *#RES# performs a hardware reset.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could try *#7780# or *#RST# (reset all settings to original) - that might imply reverting the security lock code.</p>
<p>After doing that - if it works, if not IÂ´m afraid youÂ´ll have to make the trip to a Nokia shop - just disable the PIN so youÂ´ll only have to enter one code when powering on.</p>
<p>Btw., IÂ´m also using MfE and it was the exact same for me - a lock code is required by administration settings and for me, the locking interval was set to 5min.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Hendikoischnur,</p>

<p>I'm afraid that this is not helping me as this codes are not accepted while security lock key window is displayed and I'm not able to move it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does everone know if there is some kind of time lock. For exapmple if I tried 5 times wrong security lock key and then after this if I try right one it does not work?</p>

<p>Hi nemo2000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in that case, I must admit, I donÂ´t know what to do. I donÂ´t think there is a way to circumvent the hardware lock - at least I do not know any.</p>
<p>Hope you make it somehow. In the worst case, youÂ´ll have to take it to a store.</p>

<p>Your phone could have been asking for 1 of 2 codes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the SIM card PIN. This PIN should have been given to you with the SIM card. If you enter the wrong PIN more than 3 or 5 times (can't remember which) it locks it permanently and you need the PUK code available from your network to unlock it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is the phones Lock Code. It is a 5 digit number and is usually 12345 by default. You have already tried this code and it doesn't work. Sometimes phones are shipped with a different code but when this happens the code is usually printed on the
 label on the box. If you can't find the code or if you changed the code but cannot remember it, your only option is to get it reset at a Nokia Care Point. Most Nokia Care Point will only reset it for you if you can prove ownership so bring proof of ownership
 with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, it sounds like the Lock Code to me.</p>

<p>Thanks cjlim and hendikoischnur for your information ..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it is for sure phones Lock Code. I don't have anything on the box so no help except to reset it at Nokia Care Point. I've found out if you try 3 wrong attmepts it's no more accepting new inputs. and you have to switch if off and then on again and wait
 for 15 minutes before new 3 attmpts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi kohcepba,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it does. If I connect my mobile to PC with USB cable in the background of Unlock key window I see that it ask me for PC Suite mode and if I select it I'm able to open PC suite and work with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. actually before the firmware upgrade I did the compleate backup of my Mobile trugh PC suite. Then I did the firmware upgrade. After the mobile restart I noticed that it ask me for this unlock key. Then I tried to restore my files from earlier backup.
 I tot that this will fix my problem but no luck...</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 messes with Email Newsletter &#40;.oft&#41; formatting</h2>
                    
<p>The following Outlook Form Newsletter (.oft) Template is one I have been using successfully for some time with Outlook 2007.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC100805931033.aspx?CategoryID=CT101043281033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC100805931033.aspx?CategoryID=CT101043281033</span></a></p>
<p>However, I tried sending the same newsletter out this morning for the first time using Outlook 2010 (RTM Version) &nbsp;and recipients who are running Outlook 2010 received 2 newsletters, one in HTML which is the format that it was sent in and one in Plain Text.&nbsp;
 Those people&nbsp;not running Outlook 2010 all received it as plain TEXT format!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried sending it as HTML and RTF and folks are still receiving this as Plain Text.&nbsp; The newsletter formatting stays as HTML when sending from Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>Any suggestions and clues as to what the issue is and how to fix it would be creatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately an update isnt an option as it would mean a full regression test of our whole environment....</p>
<p>
</p><p>A repair also causes issues with some of our integrations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>via RDP, we have the same issue. And it happens without fail if i edit any text within OneNote, and eventually crops up while using the Notebook</p>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have confirmed that the OneNote 2016 also crashed under the RDP connection.</p>
<p>Then this issue should be caused by the corrupted software component,<span>&nbsp;
</span>or there might be some incompatible 3rd-party software/add-ins installed on your Windows server.

<p>I understand your question on how you can sign up an outlook account having the same email but different password. With the process of creating a Microsoft account, you can just have one password in each email account that you will create.

<h3> mohit92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 630 dual network issue after denim update. How to Rollback now as Cyan not availabel.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 630 dual and facing sim freezing problem with other network problems. When I went to the service center, they tried updating software but they also updated it to Lumia denim. I also contacted Microsoft support over call and they replied
 that I cannot get Lumia Cyan back by any means. So because of MS untested update my mobile has to go to a dead(almost) state. So who is to held responsible for it. Please MS give us a way to rollback our devices to Lumia Cyan, I don't want updates if they
 destroy my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have seen many queries related to this. Any help will be great :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things already tried out and resulted in no success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Switching off Cortana</p>
<p>2. Hard Reset</p>
<p>3. Soft reset</p>
<p>4. Changing sim's between slots</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>The most reliable workaround found by others for Lumia dual-SIM issues after WP8.1 Denim, is to only enable mobile data when needed. Not particular elegant, but at least it allows the phone to work as a mobile phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please notice, not all Lumia 630 dual-SIM phones have issues after Denim. I were unable to replicate the issues when the subject first came up last year, FWIW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The mobile operators should provide replacement SIM cards for free when any connectivity trouble or hanging issues is explained.<br />
- Make sure to apply all additional system app updates after a&nbsp;hard reset and after a recovery of the phone, in the Store app &gt; ... &gt; Settings &gt;&nbsp;check for updates.<br />
- Keep in mind that only one of the SIM cards can be connected to 3G. The other SIM must have access to 2G. Also if/when in roaming areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure a downgrade option to Cyan is never going to be officially available.</p>

            <p>Dear</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be in hurry. Just check to your family or friends mobile that has the same model and ask &nbsp;them or check online for same model especially your local repair Center. They can clarify either the same &nbsp;problem is reflecting to similar other mobiles or not.
 If in &nbsp;mejor the same problem is reflecting then it is serious but if not then just check that will your device be able to update the windows 10 once available. Some problems can be resolve by updating &nbsp;the OS. Just an experienced person like Engineer of Windows
 Phone or repairing person at Repair centre can help you better.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I wanted to get to your notice the following points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This problem occurred for me twice, once 2 months ago after update when I went to the service center and they rolled back the software to Cyan. But again when I updated after 2 months it again is facing the same issues. It gives an indication that nothing
 is wrong with the Sim/ network provider but the phone software and new settings may be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I am using only 1 3G sim i.e. in 1st slot and other one is a 2G sim, so no problem should arise there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can you give an indication that when will MS launch Windows 10 or any other update concerning these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--</p>

<p>Hi R.a,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create signatures in the Outlook clients by referring to these two articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Create-a-signature-7d5978c1-54df-4631-b8de-9333fc24b0c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a signature ( Outlook for Mac)</a></p>

<p>Here are the official instructions to add signature in OWA for your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-add-an-email-signature-in-Outlook-Web-App-0f230564-11b9-4239-83de-f10cbe4dfdfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-and-add-an-email-signature-in-Outlook-Web-App-0f230564-11b9-4239-83de-f10cbe4dfdfc</a>&nbsp;(in
 Outlook Web App)</p>
<p>Note: signatures in OWA and the Outlook desktop client are independent. You can create only one signature in OWA. While multiple signatures are supported in the Outlook clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            WebExcel isn't the same as client Excel (as you've noted), so some functionality isn't there (yet). The name box is one of those things. You cannot define range names in web excel. But you can press control+g to goto names.

            <p>I apologize for not contributing an answer but me and my friend are having the same issue. We both attended the same University and used our student emails as our alternatives. A couple weeks after graduating, the University terminates student emails so
 alumni are unable to access their old student accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made two attempt to resolve this issue. First, I opted the "I don't have these any more" choice (the two-step verification access code) which only locked me out of my primary email account for 30 days. This further exacerbated the problem personally
 as I couldn't receive emails regarding billing, job prospects, personal emails, etc. and after the 30 days, I still didn't get an option to establish a new alternative email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I contacted Microsoft Customer Support via phone but the issue was never resolved. I don't even think the representatives that I spoke to knew what I was talking about. Both attempts were made around June.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is kind of my last ditch effort to resolving this issue. If someone could please help us, it would be most appreciated. I'm a gamer that works a lot and enjoy downloading demos and arcade games from my personal computer so that when I home, I can just
 start playing. I can't afford to have my personal email locked for another 30 days and I don't want issues when (or if) I upgrade to a Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you're having trouble accessing your accounts because of the prompt that's prompting you to enter a security code. If you already elected a new alternate email address, you should still be able to access your emails while waiting for the
 30 day waiting period. Just make sure you're on https://outlook.com when you sign in. If this doesn't work, please contact us in private through

                    <p>I have never had a problem updating until this build 15058 (rs2_release. &nbsp;It gives me error&nbsp;0x80070057. &nbsp;I've searched and searched for this error but nothing seems to relate to my problem. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no problem waiting for the next build but will I have the same problem? and what about any other updates? &nbsp;I would really like this issue fixed because it really bugs me when things don't work right. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem I'm having is setting my default browser. &nbsp;I set it but it keeps going back to Edge almost right away.</p>

<p>I didn't have this bug before, on the new build it's stuck at 33%... :D This screen (with moving loading anim) was on my desktop PC for 10 hrs until I arrived from work and nothing happened, then I pushed reset, the system reverted, went to slow

<p>Yep, same here... again.</p>
<p>Even after doing a clean install of 16215. I've also been having this problem since 14393-14399. The update 'installs' on the PC, then restarts to complete and then goes back to the original build again with no errors, very annoying. Whenever I run the update
 troubleshooter it says that it's fixed a bunch of things.. corrupt database, registry, etc, but when I run it again it says the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just done another reinstall today.. a complete, total format\reinstall of the latest official build.. I'm going to install all my most essential programs, get properly set up, then make a backup and try the new build again. Don't know what they're playing
 at, but someone's screwing up somewhere..</p>

<p>Ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;Had build 16226 drop in Windows update yesterday and went through process of downloading and installing . When I am promoted to RESTART so the instalation can complete itself my machine goes through a restart boot , I get no " windows is configuring updates
 " just a natural restart which takes Me back to my already installed build 16215. When i go back into Update and security the 16226 is still requesting a restart ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Have tried a disk cleanup to remove any corrupt update files etc " No Luck" , as previous poster already stated I have also tried Update troubshooting tool which finds errors and corrects them BUT still cannot complete the install. Can anyone provide a
 solution to this problem or Do i need a ISO to attempt clean install of 16226?</p>

<p>So, after I did a completely fresh install of the latest official ISO, (15063, I think) the new preview downloaded and installed first time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Microsoft definitely messed up something with the Windows update database or registry and maybe when the troubleshooter 'fixes' it, it fixes it with the wrong entries, or something like that.</p>

</p><p>I've had success with installing the preview from an unofficial ISO a few times, so you could try that if you don't want to do a complete reinstall. I find a complete reinstall once or twice a year is usually a good idea though, as things always get messed
 up after a while.. registry, corrupted files, messed up installs, permissions, apps etc..</p>

            Unfortunately I don't there is any way around this at this time. &nbsp;If you go this route make certain everything is backed up. If you have Windows store apps you would be able to redownload from the store. Conventional Windows programs would have to reinstalled
 the normal way. Again as it has been said time and time again the Windows 10 Insider program is beta software and should not be used for your primary computer.

            &nbsp;Then partition your hard drive and use the release version of Windows for your important things, and a 2nd partition for the insider version if you really want to use the insider program.&nbsp; Regardless of what you do, you must do BACKUPS or risk losing
 the things you value.&nbsp; The release version is a good bit safer than the insider version, but you can always lose programs and data due to hardware failures, power failures, operator error, etc., etc.&nbsp; Are you really really sure you want to be on the insider
 program?

    <title>Outlook on android keeps closing calenders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raddickie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook on android keeps closing calenders</h2>
                    Using Outlook app on a Nexus 6P&nbsp;android phone.&nbsp; App syncs email, people, and calendar&nbsp;with no problems&nbsp;from outlook.com (exchange active sync).&nbsp; I use 4 calendars.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I first open Outlook Calendar on the phone, no calendar events appear.&nbsp; When I open
 the list of calendars, they are all checked.&nbsp; If I uncheck and recheck the calendars, then all of the events appear.&nbsp; If I close and reopen Outlook on the phone, again no&nbsp;events appear until I open the list of calendars (the calendars are still all checked)
 and uncheck and recheck them again.&nbsp; Doesn't sound like a sync problem but some kind of bug in the Outlook for Android.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be welcome.&nbsp;

            I have tried both removing and reinstalling the email account and Outlook which has not helped. It appears to me that all of the calendar data had been synced properly but something keeps turning off the display of the calendar. I can manually reopen the
 displays but whenever I close the calendar the displays are all turned off when calendar is reopened. &nbsp;

            <p>My wife has the exact same problem w/ her Live account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendars are sync'd and she gets reminders on her display, but if she goes into the Outlook app and looks at the agenda it's blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If she selects the calendars to display, the events then appear in the agenda but soon after navigating around if she comes back the events are gone from the agenda and the calendars have been unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Super frustrating. I'm getting stink eyes from her for us moving to Android :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on a Samsung S7 Edge with the latest Outlook app installed. Note that her account is an easy-ID, meaning that it's her personal email address for her MSA and not a @outlook.com @live.com etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And everything worked great on her Lumia 920)</p>

            Hello again, I contacted outlook app support and after being redirected to higher level support this is the response I got: "Hi Andrzej, hope you're doing well. We truly apologize for the inconvenience. We have identified this problem as a bug with the
 app. Fortunately, the engineering team informed us that they are now working on sorting this out. Though we don't have an specific time frame as to when the fix will go out, it shouldn't take long as several users have been affected by the problem. Please
 bear with us for now and make sure to keep the app updated. Thank you so much for your patience."

            <p>Thanks for the feedback. &nbsp;Not optimistic about a quick fix. &nbsp;Also been waiting for fix because Android Outlook app contact search cannot find many of my contacts. &nbsp;It occurs if you are just searching the people list or when you want to enter a contact's
 email address to start a new E-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I switched from my Windows Lumia 920, the rumor was Microsoft had developed a better Outlook for Android...not a chance!</p>

            Besides these&nbsp;malfunctions, there are several design omissions in the Mobile Android Outlook compared to Windows Mobile Outlook.&nbsp; Since there doesn't appear to be a viable competitive&nbsp;Windows Phone in the near (or distant) future, it's&nbsp;would&nbsp;seem that
 to keep&nbsp;everyone who uses Outlook in the MS fold, they need some kind of first-rate mobile Outlook solution.&nbsp;
