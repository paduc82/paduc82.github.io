<h2>            Keeping columns in the same page</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to keep columns in the same page as the previous paragraph . So the order would be a Paragraph a break into two columns followed by another paragraph. There is plenty of room in the page. When I do it, word inserts a continuous &nbsp;break on the
 page but does a PAGE BREAK. When I activate the non printing characters it shows as a continuous break but it still is doing a page break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the second such layout in the same document I had no problem on the first one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            <p>Just in case: A Continuous Section Break will show as a double blue line with Section Break (Continuous) in the center.<br />
</p>
<p>If instead it says Section Break (Next Page), follow these steps:</p>

<p>If it is already Continuous, use this technique to switch it to New Page, OK out, re-enter the dialog and change it back to Continuous on the off-chance that it will reset the behavior.</p>

<h2>            Not getting latest insider build</h2>
                    <p>Hey all running Windows 10 Pro (clean installed after the initial upgrade). But I'm not getting offered any builds. According to the Insider Hub app my current build is "th1 10240 Professional"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opted into the insider builds and selected the fast ring. I am signed in using the Microsoft account I used when I was getting preview builds. Windows is activated. All of the latest updates are installed. Insider Hub app is installed. I haven't been offered
 build 10525 or 10532. Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you need any more info.</p>

            <p>I'm in the <strong>exact </strong>same boat. I have 3 other machines that have all been updated to 10525 and then 10532, but I have one that is not being given any build&nbsp;updates since I had to do a clean install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I had all 4 PCs at 10525, but there was a problem with the product key on this one machine and I could not get Windows activated despite a 90-minute chat with MS. I ended up&nbsp;doing a clean install of 8.1 and verified it was activated, then updated
 to Win10 via the 10240 ISO and confirmed that it was activated, then restored from a recent system image (made when running 10240) and Win10 has now stayed activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like OP, I'm set for preview builds; I'm on the Fast track; and I have the Insider Hub installed, just like on my other 3 PCs, but so far it's been
<em><del>5</del></em> <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">10</span></strong> days since I restored from the 10240 backup and I get no update notices no matter how often I check or reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to know if there's a way to trigger a notification of the latest build!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Edit 9/4/15: </em></strong>I've run SFC /scannow as an Admin several times and it always reports that it found no integrity violations</p>

<p>As usual not very helpful response from MS. I have the same problems and others for not receiving any insider builds since the last one (i.e. 10240). I've been on fast ring from the beginning and until 10240 release I received all the updates. And, now,
 nothing. The only updates I've received are the usual ones, but no insider builds. I did the troubleshooting in case there's a problem with settings, even did a PC reset, but nothing helps. I wonder if there is anything else I need to check (apart from sfc
 /scannow thing).</p>

            <p>No dual boot, but the 10532 offer finally came through a week ago (7 Sept) although there wasn't anything I could do on my end. If you've done everything listed above, I think the only choice is to wait :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>They just released 10536 for Windows phones yesterday which is a <strong>HUGE </strong>
improvement over 10512 that had been out for 2 months, and I expect that they'll be rolling out something similar to the main Fast ring very shortly. Hopefully we'll ALL get that notification as soon as it's ready.</p>

            <p>I have a MSWin10 Technical Preview VM install currently at build 10586 (originally installed with build 102xx, if not earlier, and upgraded at each preview release).&nbsp; I have checked for updates a number of times over the past couple of weeks, and it hasn't
 found the newest TP release (11082 currently) ever.&nbsp; In fact, it insists there are no updates *at all* for the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system *IS* configured to get previews, on the fast track, and I have tried it *WITH* an account configured to receive preview builds (not linking it to the main login I use, because I don't want MS fiddling with the settings for my regular login, thank
 you very much).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ALSO getting that red "some settings are managed by your organization" message, even though this is a standalone machine, and has NEVER been connected to a domain.&nbsp; Tried the "gpedit.msc" suggestion, but gpedit.msc apparently doesn't exit in this system.&nbsp;
 Have tried the "sfc /scannow" and "dism" fixes that are supposed to fix it, and it still continues to be broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no intention of reinstalling, because I can't do a reinstall without it asking for a key, and I am only looking at this for evaluation purposes, seeing if and maybe when it would be OK to upgrade various family machines to MSWin10 (I don't run MSWin
 myself).</p>

    <title>Giving up on Build 10130 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcboomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Giving up on Build 10130</h2>
                    After 5 attempts, first from Build 10122, the rest updating from re-installed Build 10074, I'm giving up on Build 10130. On the last attempt, using a clean boot to a freshly formatted partition, installation hung on reboot and would not allow subsequent
 access to the Bios, even after powering off. Managed to recover by putting an older drive with win 7 installed back in the laptop. I'll wait for the next build released as ISO before trying again.

<p>You are not going to have a dual boot on the Same Product Key.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your choice is to delete the partition with the old O/S and have W10 or delete the partition with W10 and have the old.&nbsp; No free ride here.&nbsp; From the mouth of Garbriel Aul.&nbsp; The generic key

            If I understand what your saying..Nothing will happen to the licence...it remains with each system you have...I've got three systems booting WinXP/win8.1 and win10 build 10130...and just to add my 2cents again ..the latter win 10 build sucks big dull ones...I
 find no reason to lose a good operating system like Windows 7 or 8.1 over one which may not be any better.*john<br />

<p>The setting does work. The only problem is it may not be an obvious setting in the BIOS. I found mine hiding under "Execute Disable Function" with a sub-label of 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology." Once I enabled it, I was able to boot from the ISO

    <title>Removing or Disconnecting Exchange Server 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing or Disconnecting Exchange Server 2010</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently migrated all users to Office 365 via cutover migration and want to decommission exchange 2010 On-premises running on Server 2008R2 x64. I am using DirSync and I want to keep active directory, user objects /attributes and proxy address but
 just want to remove (disconnect) the server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been told to convert all user mailbox to mail-enabled users before disable user mailbox and can uninstall exchange. However I need to find the impact of just shutting down server and removing virtual machine.</p>
<p>Just wondering, if I just shutdown the server and delete the virtual machine server running Exchange 2010 which I am purely using it for Exchange mailboxes and not as a domain controller or a Global Catalog. Will there be any impact of just shutting down
 the Exchange server and deleting the virtual machine running exchange? Will this interrupt ADSync or Office 365 mailboxes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mitesh</p>

<p>Hi Mitesh,</p>
<p>After a cutover migration, if we want to deploy DirSync/ADFS/SSO with Office 365, we need to convert the on-premises mailboxes to mail-enabled users first before we decommission or shut down the on-premises Exchange servers. Otherwise, the Exchange related
 attributes stored in the on-premises will conflict with the ones in Office 365 during the DirSync setup.</p>
<p>Here is the detailed steps about deploy DirSync/ADFS/SSO after cutover migration for your reference:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just to let you know, DirSync is already enabled and all the user are connected to Office 365. ADSync is working at the moment.</p>
<p>Currently Exchange Server 2010 On-premises is just turned on but none of the users are connected to on-premiese Exchange.
</p>
<p>I think shutting down server won't delete the Exchange related attributes stored on Active Directory.
</p>
<p>What's your thoughts?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Mitesh,</p>
<p>You’re correct removing the Exchange server won’t delete the values stored in the AD but the Exchange related attributes will not be shown in the AD, that why it’s recommended that we keep at least one Exchange server for the management purpose.</p>
<p>If DirSync is already up and running, and we don’t see any issues at the moment, it should be fine to shut down the Exchange server.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm getting the same problem with my PC. I was restoring it back to 8.1, I had all my files and stuff backed up onto a 1 terabyte hard drive then this showed up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unexpected error has occured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0xc0000034</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media(like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But my PC did not come with a system recovery disc and I couldn't back up windows 8 before installing windows 10 because I did not have a USB drive more than 4gb(I only got the 1tb hdd after i got 10).</p>
<p>How can I repair it without the recovery disc?</p>

            <p>I have also just received the same error running Windows 10 Technical Preview (build unknown since I can't boot) on my Surface Pro 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only screens that I can access are the UEFI firmware settings and the "Your PC/Device needs to be repaired" screen with error code 0xc0000034.</p>
<p>

<li>Power + Volume Down does nothing (error screen is displayed)</li><li>Power + Volume Up brings me to UEFI firmware settings</li><li>Shift+F8, F8 both do nothing (error screen is displayed)</li><li>Cold boot without touching brings to error screen.</li></ul>
<p>I'm fairly upset given that I'm outside of my warranty period, but do have recovery media and could easily re-install if there was simply a way to force it to boot from USB -- however that's not currently the case.<br />

<h3> jwhimesdenco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel&#58; Help with conditional fomatting a row but skipping cells that already have a background color</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for help on creating a conditional format where I am color coding a row based on a # the user inputs. These color codes (1 - 6) are used to indicate a particular status as they determine.</p>
<p>Some cells on the row will already be highlighted in vbLavender. These are set by a different process to indicate something has changed with this data. I don't want the conditional formatting to cover this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example cell BB44 has the lavender background.</p>
<p>Currently this is my VB code for the conditional formatting for color 5:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Selection.FormatConditions(1).StopIfTrue = False<br />
Range("A2:BW99999").Select<br />
Selection.FormatConditions.Add Type:=xlExpression, Formula1:="=$BT2 = 5"<br />
Selection.FormatConditions(Selection.FormatConditions.Count).SetFirstPriority<br />
With Selection.FormatConditions(1).Interior<br />
.ThemeColor = xlThemeColorAccent1<br />
.TintAndShade = 0.399914548173467<br />
End With</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>So if in cell BT44 I enter a 5 the row is shaded blue.<br />
This also shades BB44 as blue. </p>
<p>If I delete the 5 the lavender color is still there. How would I change the above to not color cells that have an existing color or vbLavender?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated :-)</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/313b73b7-38df-4739-a50f-f40badc2df4a" title="JwhimesDenCo">
<p>
</p><p>Thanks fro the intersting question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the Range().Interior.Color property is unaffected by conditional formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I your case the </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Debug.Print Range("BB44").Interior.ColorIndex</p>
</p><p>&nbsp;shall print out the whatever is the Colorindex of lavender Color, and </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Debug.Print Range("BT44").Interior.ColorIndex</p>
<p>
</p><p>shall give -4142 if there were no Fill applied to BT44.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems fro me, that it is possible to crete a range of cells, that are not Color formatted and apply conditioning formatting to them.</p>
<p>Something like</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Dim WorkingRange As Range<br />
Dim datax As Range<br />
Dim xcolor As Long<br />
Dim myMultipleRange As Range</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">Set rngWorkingRange = Worksheets(1).Range("a2:bw99999")<br />
<br />
Set myMultipleRange = Worksheets(1).Range("A1") 'Not good, but&nbsp;rnage needs to be defined, otherwise Union function gives error</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcolor = -4142 'No color<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each datax In rngWorkingRange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If datax.Interior.ColorIndex = xcolor Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set myMultipleRange = Union(myMultipleRange, datax)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next datax</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I hope it helps.</p>

<p>Hi ValeST &amp; thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>A little more context, each row has many fields that represent different elements about an order.&nbsp; When I pull new data using a merge of the existing &amp; new data, I do a cell by cell compare &amp; highlight where something changes. (Qty, Dates, names, ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cells that may be highlighted in Lavender (color index 24) are non contiguous.&nbsp; (IE: C7, AB13, G17, BB17, L81, ...)</p>
<p>From what I am seeing the RANGE function needs to be contiguous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that I am trying a different approach.&nbsp; Thanks for confirming or informing me the color index stays even with a conditional format "overwriting" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my macro code block I am setting W1 to be the last row # something is populated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did adjust my ranges to use this instead of the BW99999 was previously using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the code block for this section I added the below:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Dim acess As Range, mycel As Range<br />
Set mysel = Range("A3:BW" &amp; W1)<br />
For Each acell In mysel<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With acell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If acell.Interior.ColorIndex = 24 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acell.FormatConditions.Delete<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next acell</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This adds almost no additional run time to the macro.&nbsp; What it does is remove any conditional formatting in the cell if the index color = 24.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If a cell is Lavender and they enter or change a color code in column BT, the Lavender stays but the rest of the row changes to the desired color.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am going to run this by my tester to see if this will work for their department &amp; how they want this to run.</p>

<h2>            Charged for a purchase on Xbox one that I did not make.</h2>
                    <p>I checked &nbsp;my Microsoft purchase history and found that I had been charged for an add-on for the Xbox one game Destiny today on December 28th, 2016 that I did not purchase for a total of $19.99 plus tax. What can be done to rectify this unauthorized purchase
 and can I be refunded the cost of this purchase I did not make?</p>

<h2>            &#40;Build 10162&#41; Ethernet not working</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading, my ethernet seems to only work once in every 20 boots or so. It works sometimes but not all the time. I've tried restarting the adapter, reinstalling drivers, removing drivers, uninstalling the device... everything I can think of. It still
 just randomly connects at random times. I know the port is fine because I'm dual booted with linux and it works perfectly fine there.
</p>
<p>Anyone have any idea of what to do?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your Ethernet doesn't work with the latest build, at times it connects but it mostly doesn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem might be caused due to driver compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you better, we need the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the pc?</li><li>Is the any particular message or error code?</li><li>Did you try installing drivers using compatibility for Windows 8.1?</li></ul>
<p>Please reply to assist you better.</p>

            <p>I'm getting the same error as the Poster. The computer in question auto-updated to 10162 yesterday night and upon waking in the morning I found Network Connectivity to be spotty. It will be connected for a sporaddic and random amount of time, then the adapter
 will seemingly cut out and no amount of fiddling (restarding the adapter, removing and reinstalling the driver) can seem to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted a Hard Reset of the machine through the 'Reset my PC' option in settings last night and this morning its still been giving me the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Its a Dell XPS 8100, did a full reformat of Windows 8, and again for 8.1 and 10 when they came out, up until last night 10 has given no issues</p>
<p>2. From what I can tell there is no error message which comes up.</p>
<p>3. Currently trying that now</p>

            <p>Ah forgot the specifics.</p>
<p>My pc is custom built, I'm using this motherboard: Gigabyte ga-970a-d3 </p>
<p>It has the Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller built in.</p>
<p>There's no error or message, the driver reports that the device is working and that there is nothing connected to the port, and I've tested it with multiple wires to no avail. Troubleshooting only returns an error message for a different device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not try installing them in compatability mode, but they're the windows 8.1 drivers that I'm running. I'll try doing it compatability mode and see what happens.</p>

            You will have to use Percentile function for the same. Put following formula and drag down - 
<br />=IF($F2&gt;=PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,90%),"A",IF(AND($F2&lt;PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,90%),$F2&gt;=PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,70%)),"B",IF(AND($F2&lt;PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,70%),$F2&gt;=PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,30%)),"C",IF(AND($F2&lt;PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,30%),$F2&gt;=PERCENTILE($F$2:$F$100,10%)),"D","E"))))

            <p>Is the missing content inside Tables in the document?&nbsp;&nbsp; There was another post here the other day about a 2007 document that when opened in Word 365\2013 contained many "blank" rows in a number of the tables in the document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the OP send me a copy of that document and while it opened OK in 2010, in 2013,&nbsp;much of it was missing.&nbsp; However, by using the Convert Table to Text facility, the missing text re-appeared and then using the Convert Text to Table, (and a little more
 formatting - table style, column widths, font), the appearance of the original document was reinstated.&nbsp;&nbsp; As there were numerous tables in the document that suffered from the affliction, I created a macro to perform the reinstatement.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly Stefan, if I just open it and save it in .doc format (2003 to be precise), then I close it and open again and there they are all the missing pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no Doug, the problema is not with content inside tables, it is several pages that have gone missing. Document has 86 pages and it just shows until page 30, and the program actually does something weird when it gets to the supposed end (30 pages), but
 I do not know how to explain this.</p>

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have exactly the same problem the topic starter describes. Currently, I'm working on my Master thesis. I mainly work on my laptop with office 2007 installed. However, I sometimes use my regular desktop computer which has Office 2013 installed. You might probably
 understand some of the horror when I first noticed that only the first 15 of 60 pages from my thesis were displayed in Office 2013... ;-)<br />
<br />
After some backup restoration and experimenting, I figured out that the problem must be caused by office 2013. I can't figure an exact pattern (e.g. pages after a specific graph or table going missing). However, it is impossible to fix the problem using Word
 2013. Repair options do not solve the issue. The only option is just to use my laptop with Word 2007 when I want to work on my thesis.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is not what I expected when I bought and installed Office 2013 on my desktop machine. I needed Outlook 2013 as a solution to overcome issues with e-mail and calendar, but in this case new problems have been created with Word... quite annoying.<br />
<br />
Kind regards, Geoffrey<br />
        </p>

            <p>The workaround suggested by Adán works, though it is uncomforting. Word indicates that some aspects of your page layout and design might get lost in the process of converting to an older file format. As I have included several graphs and tables from Excel,
 I don't want things to get messed up because of file conversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, working with an old file format to enable working on both my computers is not ideal. Every time the old file format is opened, a dialog box will appear about the compatibility mode or about compatibility issues. As you mentioned, it is a workaround.
 But definitely not a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious to know if Microsoft will be able to fix the issue in a future update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards, Geoffrey</p>

            I totally agree with you Geoffrey and would like Word to solve the issue in a decent way. What I cannot understand is why just some of us have this problem, as I said, a friend of mine can open it and Doug, who commented earlier, just told me he can see
 with no problems in every version he has.
<div><br />
<div>After reading Geoffrey's comment I looked for a pattern in my document and I realized that it "crashes" just before the first formula I wrote using the formula manager, do not know if this can mean something.<br />
<div><br />
<div>By the way, the document I am working on is also my thesis, so maybe Microsoft does not want us to research! Just kidding.</div>

            Hi GiganorSupport
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            I wonder why everyone with an issue, not their own fault, gets the same kind of answer, kill this, delete that, reinstall and all that other BS, while EVERYONE knows it is Skype itself that is the issue. Volunteer or not, they should stop defending crappy
 software.<br />

<h2>            How do I customize presenter view&#63;</h2>
                    On PowerPoint 2011 for Mac, why can't I customize the presenter view? I should be able to configure how large the slides are, whether I show just the next slide or the current and next, whether there are notes, etc. But I can't..

</div>
<div>Why not? Is it only me who wants this feature? It seems like anyone who presents a lot would want more control over the presenter mode?</div>

<p>The header of one is&nbsp; my e-mail address@epbfi&nbsp;&nbsp; and the other one is exactly the same except it is followed by (1).</p>

<p>Also the one that has the (1) after the header only contains Inbox, Sent, Trash, Junk E Mail, and search folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I get rid of the one that does not have any messages and keep the one followed by (1).&nbsp;

            <p>An IMAP mail account would, within Outlook result in two sets of folders;</p>
<p>1) The default Outlook Personal folders, Inbox/Sent/Drafts etc. (You cannot remove this)</p>
<p>2) An IMAP set of folders, which is a copy of what is on the server (These will be used in any new msg or received)</p>
<p>NB If you reconfigure outlook to use pop mail with this provider, and remove the IMAP account, the default for a pop account is to download all mail from the server, unless you selected the option during setup to keep a copy on the server.</p>
<p>PS Always best to manually configure outlook, and not use any automatic setup, that way you get what you want</p>

</p><p>May be a dumb question here but I opened up a blank document to find these L shaped bars on each corner of the page. I have no idea how they got there; this has never happened before. Maybe I accidentally set them without realizing?</p>

    <title>IE10 does not work with OWA Spell Check -- need to revert back to IE 9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justitia.pax  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE10 does not work with OWA Spell Check -- need to revert back to IE 9 but MS Website won&#39;t install because it says it&#39;s already installed but I do not have acces to it.</h2>
                    I am a university professor and thus work at home a lot. The last upgrade to the University's Outlook Program spring of 2013&nbsp; did not provide the spellcheck option. After further investigation by the university IT team (who are extremely good, unlike most
 university IT people)&nbsp; -- they found that spellcheck works on OWA with IE 9 though my computer at home with Windows 7 has IE 10.
<br />
<br />
So I've been trying to download IE9 -- though I hate it as it is buggy as all h*ll at so many websites -- but MS downloads says it won't download it because it is already on my computer.<br />
<br />
Well, I assume they are referring to IE 10 as IE 10 is an automatic upgrade to IE 9 which was automatically downloaded when it was available.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I am stuck without spell-check -- OWA will not let other spell check programs work with it -- and frankly I am a professor, not a typist -- I have typo errors all the time -- I desperately need spell check. I spend a huge amoutn of time before
 sending out any email correcting typo and spelling errors and when I am in a rush -- which I often am -- email gets sent out to important people in high place with spelling errors.<br />
<br />
This is also true with quite a few of my colleagues and frankly people are getting fed-up with MS and Outlook.&nbsp; There is a campaign to figure out how to dump it.<br />
<br />
I don't have time for all this nonsense.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me out?

            <p>Well, Cyber_Defend_Team -- I owe you an apology for my message at bottom. (I am leaving it to help other readers.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it was true that none of my spell check programs worked on OWA -- it is the case that IE 10 does have a spell-checker add on -- which I found and downloaded and it does indeed spell check OWA messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was confusing is that <em>everyone</em>&nbsp; (including a dozen or so extremely experience IT personnal) has been use to the OWA spellcheck icon -- which shows up on all previous versions of IE before IE 10. So nobody realized that there was spell-check
 program on IE 10 that would work for OWA email</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it were explained like this: for users of OWA with&nbsp;IE10, the OWA spellcheck is not longer available but spell check can be achieved for your email with IE 10's own spellcheck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I can see -- however -- there is no longer the option of selecting to prevent an email from going out if there is a misspelling as there was before. That is a real loss.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>******************************************</p>
<p>THE BELOW RESPONSE PROVED TO BE NOT CORRECT; BUT AS THAT WAS NOT OBVIOUS, I LEAVE IT HERE FOR OTHER READERS. THE CORRECT RESPONSE IS IN THE MESSAGE ABOVE THIS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is not with IE's spellcheck. It is with Outlook Web Access' (OWA) spell check.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When one is sending an email through OWA-- the email screen comes up -- across the top are the various options. One of the options has always been to click on the icon (signified by "abc")&nbsp; to spell check the email text before it gets sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well accessing OWA through IE10 -- that option does nto appear. This has been confirmed by a number of people. It shows up on IE9 but does not show up on IE10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an OWA problem -- one that emerged with the most recent Enterprise Outlook for the university system this past spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps this question should be posted in a forum regarding MS Outlook and not regarding IE.</p>

    <title>MS Word &#34;AutoFormat As You Type&#34; randomly works or does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qualify42  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Word &#34;AutoFormat As You Type&#34; randomly works or does not work</h2>
                    I know how to set the AutoFormat and AutoFormat As You Type checkbox options through AutoCorrect Options. The problem is that my AutoFormat As You Type selections are sometimes applied as I type and sometimes not, with no discernible pattern. I notice
 this especially with smart quotes and apostrophes. This has been happening since I used Word 2002 and still happens in Word 2010. It happens both on my old desktop with both of these versions of Word, and on my new laptop with a fresh installation of Word
 2010 only. Why would AutoFormat work only some of the time when I have it turned on? It suddenly stops working for no apparent reason, I can only get smart quotes or apostrophes to reappear by physically copying and pasting them from earlier in the document,
 and as I keep typing, it may or may not turn itself back on.<br />

            <p>In what way does the AutoFormat As You Type options not work? Are you getting no smart quotes at all? Or are the smart quotes incorrect for whatever language you are using? In the latter case, verify that your langauge settings are indeed correct.<br />
<br />
In particular, note that the default in Word is to have the program guess which language you are using, which may cause the language to change at the insertion point.</p>

            Hi Stefan, thank you for responding. I always keep the "Automatically switch keyboard to match language of surrounding text" and "Detect language automatically" check boxes clear. The autoformatting seems to work, or not, at random. For example, in the
 two lines of text I just typed, the apostrophe in "physician's" came out smart while the apostrophe in "patient's" came out not smart. I didn't switch languages manually or change any settings in between. I can't identify any logical pattern in the behavior.
 The only possible clue I have noticed is that when I correct my typing by using the backspace button, it will undo the autoformatting of a smart quote or smart apostrophe before it erases it, and the autoformatting then seems to be disabled for some indeterminate
 amount of typing or time. At one point I thought the autoformatting seemed more likely to work if I slowed down my typing pace, but this doesn't always help, either.<br />

            Obviously, troubleshooting is more difficult when the behavior is inconsistent. :-(<br />
<br />
Does the problem (appear to) affect a particular document, or documents created from a particular template?<br />

</p><p>Possibly.&nbsp; Literally ran into this issue today.&nbsp; I may have found a solution, but this is for Microsoft Word 2002 running in Windows 7 Pro x64 SP1 environment.&nbsp; (If you aren't using Word '02, hopefully this will at least provide some insight into your issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; go to Tools -&gt; AutoCorrect Options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; on AutoCorrect tab, check that "Replace text as you type" is enabled.&nbsp; (This is not the cause, but I think it may be a related symptom of the cause.&nbsp; I constantly
<del>ab</del>use the feature and would never have intentionally disabled it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; go to <strong>AutoFormat</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; disable everything under the "Replace" section (" "Straight quotes" with "smart quotes," "Ordinals (1st) with superscript," et cetera).&nbsp;
<em>This is very important!</em>&nbsp; If I didn't do this and performed the following steps, Word crashed every single time. *</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; go to <strong>AutoFormat As You Type</strong> tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; under "Replace as you type" section, enable the settings you want, i.e.: straight quotes with smart quotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp; click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp; save your document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test the setting(s) by typing in a quote mark.&nbsp; Hopefully, it/they now correctly function, or at the very least don't cause your Word application to crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* after I got the settings working, I couldn't replicate the appcrash.&nbsp; :|</p>

<h3> eric the grey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared calendars and outlook presence indicator</h2>
                    <p>I have a client who is using Jabber for Windows in conjunction with Outlook (not certain what version, waiting on a reply). With the Outlook integration enabled, Jabber shows him in a meeting on login. Without it, it shows him available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue started several weeks ago, and has persisted through the corporate upgrade from Windows 7 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He doesn't have any meetings in his own calendar at this time. &nbsp;I'm wondering if these shared calendars might be causing his status to show as in a meeting, even though they are not his personal one. &nbsp;Is that a possible cause? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, what would cause Outlook to indicate he is in a meeting, if he is not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit; He is running Office 2013</p>

</p><p>Yes, it is possible that the Shared calendar is causing the status on Jabber appears to be in a meeting.</p>
<p>I'm not a user of Jabber though, it is best that you coordinate with Cisco Support for further information about your concern.</p>

<h2>            Audio won&#39;t insert into Powerpoint 2010</h2>
                    HI!<br />
I'm making a pretty long PowerPoint Presentation (about 15-20 minutes long) and I was having trouble inserting the audio. I clicked insert audio, from file, and chose a song I know is compatible (I've inserted the song into a presentation before). PowerPoint
 then tries to insert the music for 10 minutes and when it stops inserting, nothing is there! It keeps failing, and I don't know why! Anyone know what is going on? I tried all different songs, but it doesn't seem to work.<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question you have with PowerPoint 2010. As I understand that in spite of inserting any compatible audio files, you are unable to play the audio in the presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any 3 party audio decoder or codecs installed on the computer recently?</p>
<p>Try inserting an audio file of a different playable format in PowerPoint and check if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If inserting a different playable format audio file does not help, then restart the computer in clean boot and verify results.</p>
<p>Refer the article on how to restart the computer in clean boot:<br />

    <title>Passing information in&#47;out of the clipboard using VBA variables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james anderson_851  say:</h3>
<h2>            Passing information in&#47;out of the clipboard using VBA variables</h2>
                    I have a powerpoint addin that inserts objects into the presentation via the clipboard, and this works very well.<br />
<br />
The irritation is that, when running one of these macros, I overwrite what was previously in the Clipboard. &nbsp;I would like to arrange it so that the clipboard remembers what it had in it before I ran the macro so I can eg. copy some text, run "FancyTextboxMacro",
 and then hit Ctrl-V to put the text into the Fancy text box. (right now, when you hit Ctrl-V windows just pastes in another fancytextbox)<br />
<br />
I *think* the best solution would be to start the macro by pulling the current clipboard into a variant (ie. object defined in the VBA), and then put the info back into the clipboard at the end of the macro.<br />
<br />
However I don't understand the windows clipboard or its shell commands in VBA very well (and I understand the office Clipboard even less!), &nbsp;and info like that from Tony Jollans here (<span>http://tinyurl.com/cepydbb</span>) makes me concerned that a VBA variant
 might not hold all the info from the clipboard object.<br />
<br />
So, any ideas on how to pass a clipboard item into a VBA variant &amp; back? &nbsp;Or better solutions for my problem?<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance for any help,
<div>James<br />
<br />
PS. Running Office 2007 on a windows 7 machine, ideally need&nbsp;compatibility with Office2010 &amp; 13 as well.<br />
PPS. &nbsp;To clarify, I'm not sure which of the office or windows clipboards is important here. &nbsp;I hope windows, the office clipboards seems to be&nbsp;inaccessible&nbsp;from VBA from what I've read<br />
<br />

            Hi James,
<div><br />
<div>There is only one clipboard and it is a function of the OS and not Office.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's hard to know what the correct answer is for your application but I would say that you should think about using a temporary "invisible" file and your macro uses it as a scratch pad for building the object. When it's ready the macro then copy/pastes
 the object into the presentation file and closes the scratch pad without saving.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>
        </p>

            There are two clipboards but the Office clipboard (which can store multiple copies) is very hard to access via vba.<br />
<br />
Having a library file which opens without a window is a good way to go. Make sure you remember to close it again as it will be invisible.<br />

            The features you'd need to manipulate the clipboard as you'd like to are simply not built into VB or VBA. &nbsp;You'd need to call on a lot of Windows API stuff to get there.
<div><br />
<div>As you mention, the Office clipboard isn't available under VBA (or any other way other than manually, as near as I can tell). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you're just looking to move text from one shape to another, this would do:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Sub CopyText(oSourceShape As Shape, oTargetShape As Shape)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; oTargetShape.TextFrame.TextRange.Text = _</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; oSourceShape.TextFrame.TextRange.Text</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sub Test()</div>
<div>' Put two shapes on an otherwise blank slide one</div>
<div>' Add text to the first of them</div>
<div>' Run this:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; With ActivePresentation.Slides(1)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CopyText .Shapes(1), .Shapes(2)</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; End With</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you need to preserve whatever was on the clipboard, copy/pasting is out, unless you want to get into some tricky WinAPI stuff (and it may not really be possible at all).</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the other hand, if you're trying to preserve something that you put there from PPT in the first place and don't much care about blowing away things that other apps might have copied, it might be enough to create a temporary BLANK slide, paste the clipboard
 onto it, do whatever you need to do, then grab the first shape on the blank temp slide, copy it, then delete the slide.</div>

            Is it not possible to make use of the DataObject to get and put information to the clipboard, if you are only dealing with text?<br />

            Many thanks for the replies so far, &nbsp;I will investigate these suggestions :).<br />
<br />
I plan to keep using the Copy/paste method for the "inserting objects" part of my Addin (there are numerous objects in there that take &gt;10seconds to draw from scratch - I introduced the copy paste method so the objects can live 'pre-drawn' in a hidden presentation
 and then get added to presentations&nbsp;instantly)<br />
<br />
<br />
Methods that are only capable of saving Text from the clipboard would certainly be an improvement over the current addin version.<br />

            Good call, Andy.
<div><br />
<div>VBA help does its utmost to hide this feature; I could dredge up one reference that alludes to it but nothing whatever about how to use it. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Chip does a nice job though:</div>
