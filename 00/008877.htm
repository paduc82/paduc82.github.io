<h2>            Outlook 2013&#58; Change default view for new folders from compact to single</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Two issues here:</p>
<ol>
<li>When I create new folders, which I do daily, they default to compact view. I want to change the default to single view, so I don't have to keep changing it.</li><li>Outlook seems to frequently reset everything to defaults. This happens on multiple computers that I am using. Since I can't use almost any of the defaults, I would like to change them permanently.</li></ol>
<p>I spend several hours a week reconfiguring Outlook on several computers because the defaults keep getting used.</p>
<p>Outlook 2010 didn't seem to be nearly as bad as this. It was much, much more user customizable --and much more productive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get thousands of emails a week, so I don't want most any of the social settings on, they just get in the way and greatly slow productivity.</p>
<p>Some settings are still unchangeable, like wanting to remove everything from the Reading Pane except the message body.</p>

</p><p>Out of curiousity - what exactly do you mean by the terms "compact view" and "single view"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to add some details for the benefit of others who read this and be able to provide some insights such as</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - What defaults are you referring to specifically?</p>
<p>#2 - What type of email accounts are these folders associated with (i.e. your POP, Imap, EAS account etc) or are these in a stand-alone PST file?</p>
<p>#3 - If it's in an IMAP account - who is the ESP (i.e. Outlook.com, GMAIL, Yahoo, other ESP etc)</p>

</p><p>Certainly not going to pretend that this is an area that I play around with much or have any kind of in-depth expertise in&nbsp;(certainly others on here who are a whole lot more versed in the subject then I am) but just doing a quick test to satisfy my own curiosity
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; picked an existing &nbsp;folder</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; went to Change View --&gt; Manage Views</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Changed a variety of options for &lt;Current View &amp; Settings&gt; via &lt;Modify&gt; --&gt; &lt;Other Settings&gt; which included&nbsp; (1)&nbsp;Single or Compact View (2) Reading Pane location etc</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; then went back to Change View --&gt; Apply Current View to other Mail folders
</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;only picked a new folder just created to apply the changes to </p>
<p>6)&nbsp; closed up the view related Windows and then </p>
<p>7)&nbsp;created several new mail folders in different data files.&nbsp;All the settings selected in item #3 stuck when I checked the settings&nbsp;in the newly created folders. (i.e. used Single / Reading Pane at bottom etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time I tried just changing the Current View settings - the changes didn't get applied to newly created folders which is why I retried things again and went thru the exercise of steps 4 &amp; 5</p>

<p>Simply just going to throw out the following for the sake of discussion - don't know whether there is an inherent underlying bug in Outlook or not when it comes to this SO</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 -In your original description - you mentioned constantly changing folder defaults</p>
<p>#2 - Steps I followed were related to the settings for&nbsp; &lt;Current View &amp; Settings&gt; which were then "applied" to a specific folder at which point were automatically carried forward to new folders created - no individual changes to the folder settings were
 required</p>
<p>#3 - If you've applied changes to the underlying settings for &lt;Current View&gt; as noted and &lt;then&gt; continue to make ongoing changes to individual folders - quite possible that the &lt;Current View &amp; Settings&gt; are possibly getting especially since you now mention
 that it can take a few months before it seems to reset itself etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little unclear about the description - are you saying that once it reverts it</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) happens on all systems using the same accounts?</p>
<p>b) happens to all folders within the profile or for specific accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so there's no mistake, not challenging hat you're encountering nor am I trying to defend Outlook. Have spent a more time than I care to remember trouble-shooting things&nbsp;trying to track down what appeared to be&nbsp;a "random" issue - many of which were the
 result of a very very specific sequence of events - miss/change one step in the sequence and the problem didn't show itself. In this case, it sounds like there are so many change going on, probably would be impossible to determine the root of the cause. Am
 not a big believer that stuff "just happens on its own" with no explicit contributing factor coming into play</p>

            <p>I try to set all the accounts to the same settings, but that varies a bit, as IMAP and POP3 are a bit different.</p>
<p>I create new folders daily in mail, so I have a very large Outlook footprint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get resets several times a week on my work machine, but then again, it could be that we're dogfooding again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I know my home machine should be stable, although it has many more email accounts. It resets every few weeks, sometimes more often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very heavy use scenarios just aren't the focus, especially those in IT or development. I don't mind the defaults at the beginning being unusable for me, but:</p>
<p>1. They need to be configurable, and many important ones&nbsp;are not now.</p>
<p>2. The changes need to stick.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Probably won't know&nbsp;unless and until you try making modifications to the &lt;Current View &amp; Settings&gt; as per the scenario I described which do allow for configuring a variety of settings especially&nbsp;regarding the Single/Compact view and Reading Pane location
 (along with everything else that can be configured for it). Even&nbsp;with that&nbsp;- would be impossible to determine if it would actually change over time because it could be months before that may happen (as per your description) and even then - I wouldn't be&nbsp;wouldn't
 be&nbsp;dealing with number of new folders etc you've described. Trying to replicate something like this to determine the cause would be a time-consuming nightmare.</p>

<p>I do the apply all, every time I change them back, several times a week, for two years now.</p>
<p>It doesn't last.</p>
<p><strong>Something probably corrupts, and Outlook sets everything back to its OOB default settings.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which would be fine, if I could change those default settings, but I have found no way to so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really bad user experience for people like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd go back to Outlook 2010, but it's IMAP support is much worse, and I need it to sync between my phone and all my workstations.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes I read your post but what I got from it was that you change settings for an individual folder versus going into the
<strong>&lt;Current View&gt;</strong> <strong>&lt;Manage Views&gt;</strong> component and then modifying the
<strong>&lt;Current View &amp; Settings&gt;</strong> there versus making changes to the &lt;View Settings&gt; for an individual folder&nbsp;and then applying those changes to&nbsp;other folders. Don't know if that would make a difference but it's a different "sequence of events" of
 how things get applied/ occur unless I misunderstood your explanation in which case, everything I wrote can be ignored. To be very specific, I didn't make the changes to the view settings for a specific folder - I changed the view settings for the &lt;Current
 View &amp; Settings&gt; itself and THEN created new folders which used those settings automatically without anything additional getting "applied".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, from this point forward, will leave it to others - just added comments here for the sake of brainstorming - no more - no less.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got the same issue with Outlook 2013 since a few weeks. I do testify the following: After install of Outlook 2013, one of the first thing I did was to apply a customized view of my own to all message folders. And that customized view was automatically
 applied to any folder I created afterwards. This has been working for about six months but it's not working anymore since a few weeks. I do not know what exactly happened as I did reinstall Microsoft Office 365 that had become corrupted in the meantime. Maybe
 the reinstall or a new Office update is the culprit the as both occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default view for any newly created message folder has reverted to Compact view. And I have to change it to my custom view manually. I tried to reapply my custom view to all message folders as I did manually but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the following workaround that is obvious and so simple but I did not apply it to my configuration as I do not want to change a predefined view. Maybe I will decide to copy it before to a new custom view as is and I would name it "Compact_Original".

<h2>            Video won&#39;t advance to next slide in Powerpoint</h2>
                    Making a slideshow for my company with numerous videos in it but no matter what I do, the slides with videos do not advance once they are finished. Have tried adjusting the timer and leaving it at zero but the videos still take 1-2 minutes to move on after
 they are finished. The box about clicking to move on is unticked so it's not that either. Any help you can give is greatly appreciated!

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Choose whatever transition you'd like, then in the Timing/Advance Slide section, put a check next to After: and set it to 00:00:00</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done. &nbsp;What we've done here is to tell PPT to IMMEDIATELY advance to the next slide, but since PPT will never advance until after any animations are done, it'll play the video first, then advance. Automatically.</p>

    <title>Word 2016&#58; F9 on INCLUDETEXT field doesn&#39;t load images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew feury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2016&#58; F9 on INCLUDETEXT field doesn&#39;t load images</h2>
                    <p>I've recently upgraded to Office 2016 and have noticed an issue in a Word document I maintain. &nbsp;The document uses an INCLUDETEXT field to embed HTML content from a file on our intranet, e.g.:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">{ INCLUDETEXT "\\intranet.example.com\filestore\myapplication\myfile.html" }</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The HTML file is a pretty basic rendering of data from an XML file using tables, headers, images, embedded style info, and little else. &nbsp;The image tags contain relative links to PNG files in the same folder as the HTML, e.g.:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&lt;img src="myimage.png" alt="my embedded image"&gt;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Everything rendered fine in Word 2013 but in 2016 the embedded images load as placeholders. &nbsp;Or, in some cases, one image will load but all others will be placeholders. &nbsp;I can manually select each placeholder, press F9, and the
 image appears. &nbsp;But this isn't practical since there are many images and the whole reason I'm using INCLUDETEXT is to embed many snapshots of dynamically generated content into a DOCX for publication.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I can post a bare-bones document &amp; HTML/image files that demonstrates the issue. Not sure if this forum allows attachments...</p>

<p>I downloaded your examples but unfortunately (from a troubleshooting perspective) the images appear here without any placeholder problems. The low number of responses to your question suggest that other people have not been able to replicate either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would normally expect to have to double up backslashes, e.g. instead of</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">{ INCLUDETEXT "\\intranet.example.com\filestore\myapplication\myfile.html" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>use</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">{ INCLUDETEXT "\\\\intranet.example.com\\filestore\\myapplication\\myfile.html" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>but my guess is that that is what you actually already have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own test UNC server name is not "dotted" (i.e. I use something like &nbsp;\\SYN412\filestore... instead). Perhaps worth checking that factor.<br />
<br />
Always worth checking the Web Options (File-&gt;Options-&gt;Advanced-&gt;General-&gt;Web Options) if you have not already done so.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions! &nbsp;In the real file my path is being generated using hyperlink base + a few dynamic properties, so I'll look into the double-\ thing as well as the web options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: tried on my home PC (forgot I'd upgraded to 2016) and I also can't reproduce. So when I get back in the office Monday I'll check the web options, do any patching/reboot/repair, and, failing that, throw Process Monitor on it to see what I can find.</p>

<p>Tried Peter's suggestions as well as Paul's and still no luck. To summarize:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Installed latest Word 2016 updates &amp; rebooted</li><li>Confirmed Web Options all enabled (matching my home PC)</li><li>Confirmed Show picture placeholders unchecked, Show drawings and textboxes on screen checked</li><li>Changed field definition to <strong>{ INCLUDETEXT &nbsp;"test.html" &nbsp;\* MERGEFORMAT }</strong> to avoid any errors in path expression</li></ul>
<p>I still see the same behavior. &nbsp;Using ProcessMonitor, it appears the HTML and both images are being found and read in their entirety:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59f762dc-4444-4f7d-a803-ab11c14476e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59f762dc-4444-4f7d-a803-ab11c14476e8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So no clue why it's not being rendered at this point. &nbsp;Without anybody able to reproduce the issue or debugging symbols from Microsoft I don't think there's any way to proceed.</p>

            Thanks for the info, I appreciate the reply.&nbsp; However upon researching Outlook plus (which is certainly plus in ones debts), I am under the impression that the bar on the right cannot be removed totally but rather there will be some other useless feature
 in it's place.&nbsp; This, in the end meaning that the message headers/subject lines will still be cut short and the mails displayed in one very narrow column compared to hotmail.&nbsp; Seems that once again in the name of "modernization", yet another good thing has
 been ruined in our world.&nbsp; Don't know how much more modernization I can take!&nbsp; I will take the advice and further search for other&nbsp;solutions to removing it.

            <p>The bar on the right can be removed if you are using Outlook on a normal computer/running a tablet as a normal computer. This is nothing to do with Ads and the like though.</p>
<p>To remove the right hand menu there are some very small icons in the top left of the Outlook window (Quick Access Toolbar if you don't have these). Outlook/sendreceive/undo/touchmousemode. The Touch/Mouse Mode icon looks like a little hand/finger and this
 gives you the option to change between Touch mode and Mouse mode. </p>
<p>Change to Mouse Mode and the menu shortcut buttons all become a little smaller and the menu on the right disappears. Makes it fit nicer on the screen once this is done.</p>

<h2>            Onenote and Offline Files - is there a conflict&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My environment is Win7 and Office Proffesional Plus 2010</p>
<p>I have a file server share that contains a folder (w/ subfolders).&nbsp; One of these subfolders contains several OneNote Notebooks.</p>
<p>I have a parent of the OneNote folder flagged as offline.&nbsp; It now occurs to me that this may present a conflict because Onenote does its own synchronization of shared Notebooks.</p>
<p>Supporting evidence of this possible conflict is that Sync Center reported that a OneNote folder was out of sync and needed to be resolved manually.&nbsp; I went into OneNote and OneNote reported that all NoteBooks (and in particular the one Sync Center was complaining
 about) we in sync.</p>
<p>Is it a problem for the subfolder containing shared OneNote Notebooks to have a parent folder that is flagged Offline?</p>

            Just select double-click on the font file to automatically open the Font Book utility. You will have the choice to install it only for the current user, or for all users of the Mac.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>To add&nbsp;a twist on the "tab name" question previously.</p>
<p>Can you add several different sheet names to a single spreadsheet? For example, let's say you have sheets named Dallas, New York, Miami, Chicago, etc. And on a summary sheet, you wanted to include the names of the other&nbsp;sheets&nbsp;(without having to type them
 in)&nbsp;also&nbsp;so that if you change one of the sheet names, it updates&nbsp;the change on the summary sheet.</p>

            <span>Hi&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Leah</strong></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Bing</strong></span><span>&nbsp;announced a contest for the next homepage image before. However, this was already years ago. I'd suggest that you subscribe to the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Bing</strong>
<strong>newsletter</strong></span><span>&nbsp;to get more updates for upcoming features. You may subscribe&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.bing.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>In addition, you may also check&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Bing</strong>
<strong>blogs</strong></span><span>&nbsp;for more latest news about the program. Check it on this&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://blogs.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Occasionally,
 Bing also hosts a contest and will ask for participants to submit their photos to their&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Facebook</strong>
<strong>page</strong></a>.<span>&nbsp;I'd also recommend sending a feedback regarding your request, you can do this by going to Bing.com, then scroll down to the bottom part of the page and click&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Feedback</strong></span><span>.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you have additional questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Changing pie chart colors &#38; legend sequence so they match on 2 charts</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a training exercise in which students create a dashboard, including a couple of pie charts showing regional percentages of work by days and by earnings. Here they are:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d6f5af1-3e25-4397-a13d-c424f4221b94?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d6f5af1-3e25-4397-a13d-c424f4221b94?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Two problems, possibly related:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I cannot move the Legends to get them in the same order: on both charts - the required options are disabled:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/332f815b-19f3-4606-8ba5-76d2fefe10c9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/332f815b-19f3-4606-8ba5-76d2fefe10c9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. I cannot get the 2 charts in the same colour key e.fg. "London" is blue ion one chart and yellow in the other,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The spreadsheet is at</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/x/s!AmxJyApgEAcYgqsnKGx2InOy8lEK2Q</p>
<p>

<p>Hi oldhasbeen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Question One: The order of Legend depends on the order of the corresponding data. You could change the data order to sort the Legend order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Question Two: You could select the part of Pie chart and take it apart. After that, you could fill in with different colors you like in the part of Pie chart as shown in the following figure:</p>
<p>

            Asuming that Onenote is crashing since start up or after a couple minutes ill recomme to rollback at least OneNote to a previous version.
<br />
<br />Lately  Office 16.xxx version has been released and some features not working, you can try to rollback Office version to a previous one version that was working fine, take a look to the following link: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to-go-back-to-office-2016-for-mac-15-xx-versions-from-16-xx-e88ed6c8-6fb4-40a1-9540-529000d3d20f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-to...</a>

<h3> carlott  say:</h3>
<h2>            ConnectionErrorException&#58; We&#8206;&#39;re having trouble connecting to the server for this account.</h2>
                    
<p>So i got this for 3 of 15 mailboxes (very small migration). I searched the forums a bit, but cannot find a good answer. I get the above message "ConnectionErrorException: Weâ€Ž're having trouble connecting to the server for this account." in 3 of the cases.
 NO mail is downloaded. Accessing the server via webmail, outlook, iphone, all work fine. Just the migration fails and there really isnt any other logs i can deal with.</p>
<p><br />
The current IMAP server is easymail, of a very ancient version. The domain provider has zero effort in supporting because its free to their customers and they have a paid upgrade to some sort of hosted exchange. However office 365 was MUCH cheaper for this
 org so that is why we are going this way.</p>

<p>The mailboxes themselves, are all sort of similar. They may have user created folders, or may just have the default ones. Some have many GB of data (data cap is 3gb on this email server), and some have only a few hundred mails. The mailboxes which did back
 up (12/15) worked all almost perfectly, despite being some of the most heavy in mb and items on the server.</p>

<p>Please let me know if there is any other logging or whatnot i can access using the portal.office.com site, or via the remote command line which I have already used once or twice. I cannot do any logging of the mailserver. They wont even let me delete mailboxes
 and recreate them on this server, nessecary at times to fix the many IMAP bugs that we are so very close to getting away from.</p>

<p>thanks!</p>

<p>Hi CommunityHelpsme,</p>
<p>Since 3 out of 15 mailbox got the error message during the IMAP migration. Based on the situation, I would like to confirm several points below:<br />
a. Whether there is one item more than 20M and one attachment more than 10M in the 3 mailboxes.<br />
b. Whether there are many subfolders under the default folders of the 3 mailboxes.</p>
<p>If yes, you may delete some items to check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Beside, suggest you perform the steps below to narrow down the issue:<br />
1. Please verify that you can connect to your IMAP server.&nbsp; Run the following Windows PowerShell command to test the connection settings to your IMAP server.<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell</a><br />
<em><strong>Test-MigrationServerAvailability -IMAP -RemoteServer &lt;IMAP server FQDN&gt; -Port &lt;143 or 993&gt;</strong></em><br />
Please Note: For the value of the Port parameter, use 143 for unencrypted connections or use 993 for SSL connections.</p>
<p>2. Check if you have done the preparation work step by step according to the official article
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>Moreover, you may try using PST files to export the data from this mailbox via the Outlook client, and then import the PST files into Office 365 accounts. Please refer to the link: Use Outlook to move information between email accounts
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Use-Outlook-to-move-information-between-email-accounts-52335a27-aa7c-4d3a-96d7-6477bdeb85c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Best regards,<br />
Mouran</p>

<p>I ran the command "est-MigrationServerAvailability" &nbsp;before i even posted anything. Seems like you didnt read what i wrote and just replied with a form letter. connectivity is fine, because 13 fo the 15 mailboxes work perfectly.</p>
<p>I can of course do the PST file work around, however my question is what is causing this problem under these three mailboxes and or is there any additional logging available to me. The error above does not say what failed or why. Its probably some mail or
 mail folder, but with no log, i am just fumbling blindly in the dark.</p>
<p>There may be attachments over 20M. As i previously said, the mailboxes, one has many user created folders and one has None. However if its the 20M limit, or user created folder problem, then it should SAY THAT IN THE ERROR MESSAGE. If it does not, then we
 are just guessing what the problem would be.</p>
<p>Do you have additional logging options available to me and how do i access those. thanks.</p>

<p>Hi CommunityHelpsme,</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. It seems the size of the attachment and item in the 3 mailboxes has nothing to do with the issue.</p>
<p>Since 3 out of 15 mailboxes failed to migrate from the IMAP server to Office 365, we need to figure out what's wrong during the process of the IMAP migraton.In this scenario, please use exporting PST files of the 3 mailboxes as a workaround until the 3 mailboxes
 is migrated successfully from IMAP server to Office 365.</p>
<p>To figure out what's wrong during the IMAP migration, I'd like to know some information:<br />
1. Did you strictly refer to the follow article to do the IMAP migration?</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj874015(v=exchg.150).aspx</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Would you mind&nbsp;capturing&nbsp;a screenshot of the CSV file that you are using for the IMAP migration&nbsp;and upload it to us&nbsp;for further troubleshooting?<br />
To upload a screenshot, please click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong>-&gt;<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong> button.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued efforts.</p>

            What do you exactly mean? Using another browser as default? It certainly is easy to do - see my dedicated full tutorials on all these subjects at &nbsp;<a href="http://my.opera.com/opera.mini/blog/tutorial-make-opera-mini-4-1-your-default-system-browser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://my.opera.com/opera.mini/blog/tutorial-make-opera-mini-4-1-your-default-system-browser</a>
 when it comes to Opera Mini.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Opera, switching the browser is even easier: just make it the system browser from inside Settings.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. Actually, what I want to do is: limit the using of browser or disable it. In my mind if iexplore can be changed its privileged value, maybe I can lock it by two-tier lock. But our applications are still using Network, just disable&nbsp;browser.
 Perhaps there should be some good solutions. Can you give me a light?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Windows Mobile completely lacks solutions like that of iOS - that is, both allowing for completely disabling Safari (the browser) and/or disable everything not allowed to be seen by less than 18 years old people. (Both are password protected.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there're several workarounds (hacks). The easiest I could think of was just removing the Iexplore icon from Windows/Start Menu, along with the file association (in the Registry) and only make it accessible when started from a secret .lnk file,
 or, by directly starting Windows\iexplore.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is insufficient (because the people you'd like to lock out from using IExplore know what Windows\iexplore.exe is and how it should be started), you can take even more drastic steps; e.g. removing all IE-related stuff from
 Registry (which may disable it entirely â€“ dunno, haven't tested this) and only recovering them by starting a (secret or even one on a separate memory card) script or .reg file. This is fairly easy to implement with third-party scripting tools - scripting needed
 for quick Registry key removal. I've published a lot of articles on scripting on WinMo; see e.g. MortScript (<a href="http://www.sto-helit.de/index.php?module=page&amp;entry=ms_overview&amp;action=view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sto-helit.de/index.php?module=page&amp;entry=ms_overview&amp;action=view</a>
 ), which is still actively developed. These scripting solutions also support Registry removal / insert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is unlike iOS, where there's a complete â€žlet's password protect any, even third-party appsâ€ solution for jailbroken devices (in addition to the ability to disable Safari), I don't know of a similar solution on WinMo. Unfortunately,
 there's no built-in password protection in any of WinMo Web browsers either â€“ as opposed to the best iOS Web browsers or PDF readers. (You might want to convince the Opera folks to implement this in the WinMo version of Opera Mobile / Mini?)</p>

            Thanks again Mennersyys. I have tried removing IE-related staff from Registry, but still cannot block. Some items came back after IE got running. I appreciate for your information. Can Opera be modified as a "Password Protected" application?

<p>Hi<br />
<br />
Using a button 'On Click event' I need to copy three fields <strong>Membership Ref, Amount Paid, Subs Paid</strong> from a table called<strong>Current Members</strong> and add as a new record to the same field names in a table called<strong>Subscription History</strong>
 . <br />
<br />
I would appreciate some help with the code as I have tried the INSERT INTO statement but hitting syntax issues.<br />

Thanks</p>

<div>Hi Steven,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry, I didn't scroll down far enough, so I didn't see your code.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>It's cumbersome to use IIF in the way you've used it. The best way is to build a custom SQL statement; only including values that are being inserted. In the following code, I've assumed the following business rule - if there
 is no subscription amount, there is also no corresponding date.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Private Sub Archive_Subs_Click()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL1 As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL2 As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me![Subs Amount]) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only add arguments and values for Subs Amount if there is something to add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL1 "[Subs Amount],[Subs Paid],"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL2 = Me![Subs Amount] &amp; ",#" &amp; Me![Subs Paid] &amp; "#,"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me![Subs Other Amount]) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Only add arguments and values for Subs Other Amount if there is something to add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL1 = strSQL1 &amp; "[Subs Other Amount], [Subs Other Paid],"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL2 = strSQL2 &amp; [Subs Other Amount] &amp; ",#" &amp; [Subs Other Paid] &amp; "#,"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Len(strSQL1) &gt; 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Get rid of the training commas<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL1 = Left(strSQL1, Len(strSQL1) - 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL2 = Left(strSQL2, Len(strSQL2) - 1)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Build the resulting SQL statement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO [Subscription History] (" &amp; strSQL1 &amp; ") VALUES (" &amp; strSQL2 &amp; ")"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBEngine(0)(0).Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />

Hello Graham<br />
<br />
I tried your suggested code in earlier postings but couldn't get it to run without errors.&nbsp; However, together with another solution elsewhere on this site, it helped me to understand the syntax better.&nbsp; I attached my reworked code at the bottom of my last posting,
 together with a description on what lead up to the changes and a question.&nbsp; All this appears on your reply!<br />
<br />
Does this help clarify where I am?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Steven.... </blockquote>

            Yes, the reason the Insert Frame button is on the Legacy Tools flyout palette is that you can put legacy form fields in frames but not in text boxes. If you just want a box to indicate where to enter data, you can put the form fields in a table and apply
 borders selectively.

<h3> barespirits  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE9, IE10, IE11 all cannot print - Line&#58; 1905, Char&#58; 1, Error&#58; Invalid argument, Code&#58; 0, URL&#58; res&#58;&#47;&#47;ieframe.dll&#47;preview.js &#38; res&#58;&#47;&#47;ieframe.dll&#47;preview.js errors</h2>
                    <p>Original title: IE9, IE10, IE11 all cannot print</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once upon a time, my Win7 PC with&nbsp; IE9 would print normally.&nbsp; After upgrading to IE10, I started getting the res://ieframe.dll/preview.js errors commonly reported.&nbsp; I uninstalled IE10, and when IE9 reappeared, it would no longer print.&nbsp; That's telling.&nbsp;
 The problem is with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Silly me, upgraded to IE11 today expecting to be able to print, but no.&nbsp; The line number of the script error changed from 1791 to 1905, but that is the only difference I see.<br />
Line: 1905, Char: 1, Error: Invalid argument, Code: 0, URL: res://ieframe.dll/preview.js.<br />
<br />
EVERY application on the PC that can print will print to any of three printers attached, EXCEPT Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
None of the remedies I have seen while trying to resolve the problem have worked.<br />
<br />
It is not the printer driver.&nbsp; I reinstalled it once on MS advice, and that was a major PITA because many of my applications then needed their profiles updated.&nbsp; I won't do that again.<br />
<br />
It is not the selected default printer.&nbsp; It is not the "low" folder.&nbsp; It is not the website visited, unless all of earth's websites have a problem.<br />
<br />
Proposed fixes I've seen do not discuss what the javascript line is unable to do, or what the 'Invalid argument' is.&nbsp; They all seem to be like home remedies or legends or anecdotal fixes (my dog barked 3 times then it worked).<br />
<br />
Why can't this be fixed.&nbsp; I've generally moved on to other browsers, but would like IE to work because it is better at some things.<br />
<br />
Is there a file that can be replaced, or a diagnostic procedure that can be done that addresses the real problem?&nbsp; Whatever it is.&nbsp; Why is that line of code crapping out?&nbsp; What does it expect?<br />
<br />
Help, please.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you checked for updated printer drivers since installing IE11?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the problem persist if IE is opened with all add-ons disabled? From Start&gt; Run type in

<p><em>iexplore.exe -extoff</em> then hit Enter. Try to print. (Space between exe and -)</p>

            Your focus on printers is misdirected, at least in my case.&nbsp; I'm the original poster.&nbsp; My affected machine worked with 9, started misbehaving after the upgrade to 10, kept misbehaving after reverting to 9.&nbsp; NOT a printer issue.&nbsp; Same for 3 connected printers
 (2 Zebra models, one Brother).&nbsp; IE is the only application that will not print.&nbsp; It does not even let me select which printer before throwing out an error.&nbsp; How does it know all are bad?&nbsp; The answer is that it does not know.&nbsp; Other computers on the LAN print
 to the printers.&nbsp; Just one machine will not, but it once did, before the IE 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Some other mishap has caused the failure to print.&nbsp; It is not the printers.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
naiveuser,&nbsp; I strongly suggest that you turn off automatic upgrades, then find a restore point to get you back to the point where you had a working setup.&nbsp; After restoring, check to be sure that automatic updates are disabled, then hide the IE 11 upgrade so
 it won't get back in.&nbsp; If you don't do this soon, there may not be a restore point to use later on.&nbsp; Turning auto updates back on after you get your printer going again is up to you.<br />

    <title>Word for Mac &#40;2008&#41; creates huge PDF files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> todferran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word for Mac &#40;2008&#41; creates huge PDF files</h2>
                    I have a word doc which is 109 pages long, includes two graphics, the rest is text and nested tables.<br />
<br />
The word doc is 1.1 mg file size. When I save it as a PDF, it creates a file 109.7 Mg, literally a hundred times bigger. Average more than 1 Mg for each page.<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can find on the web for reducing this file size and nothing really shrinks it. Zip brings the file size to just over 100 Mg, only compresses less than 10%.<br />
<br />
I have tried printing to PDF, same size doc is created.<br />
<br />
I will be creating one to two of these files per month. I need to send them in PDF form, and via email.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tod<br />

            Are there any Pictures?&nbsp; If so change them from .jpg to .png then try again.<br />
<br />
There is something about how the Mac handles jpg files&nbsp; increase their size.<br />
<br />
Another thing when in Acrobat X look for this<a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/uHHNh7jqRp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.screencast.com/t/uHHNh7jqRp</a><br />
<br />
In Acrobat 9 under tools menu look for PDF Optimizer. <br />
<br />
Open PDF Optimizer and then click on Fonts. remove all copies of the same font.<br />
<br />
example If you see:<br />
Helvetica <br />
Helvetica Bold<br />
Helvetica Italic<br />
<br />
Are different fonts.<br />
<br />
For some reason there usually are 3-6 exact copies of the same font. remove all but one of each version And remove all fonts not used in your document.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Between Fonts and use of jpeg images make PDF's excessively large. <br />

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have a table, which i create a chart from, in column A i have a formula that gives results as a month or as blank. is there a macro that will automatically hide rows that are blank, and if the vairiable change e.g. another month is added, it will automatically
 unhide the row, so i dont get blank values on my axis in my chart?</p>

            Event driven macros like <i>Worksheet_Change</i>&nbsp;are not triggered on a change in a formula's result, only a manual typed change in a cell's value. You might be able to get away with
<i>Worksheet_Calculate</i>&nbsp;or possibly <i>Worksheet_SelectionChange</i>&nbsp;but they will likely be triggered many more times than they are required. Perhaps&nbsp;<i>Worksheet_Deactivate</i>&nbsp;would suffice as you would be changing focus to the chart worksheet?&nbsp;Did you
 have in mind anything particular for the trigger to <i>"that will automatically hide rows that are blank, and if the vairiable change e.g. another month is added, it will automatically unhide the row"</i>?

            <p>well what it is, there is a start and end date for a project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have a formula that you gave me i think :) which gives me the months that i need for the chart axis, however becasue there is no set end date i have dragged the formula down to cover 2 years, it only shows the months within the start and end range already
 spedcified and the rest remain blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the problem that i have is that i need to create a chart from this table that will be flexible due to the start and end date. at the moment it works fine, however the remaining blank cells in the table have to be included becasue there is no way of me knowing
 how long this project will last, i only want to include the cells with values in them and leave out the blank cells, so i thought if i could get a macro that will automatically hide the blank cells, and unhide them if the end date is extended so they are then
 included in the chart. </p>

            You can have a macro loop through a series of rows and hide/unhide rows depending upon a calculated result (e.g.
<i>not blank</i>) but I wanted to warn you that the <i>Worksheet_Change</i>&nbsp;does not get triggered on a change in&nbsp;the&nbsp;result&nbsp;of&nbsp;a formula. If you want something that can be manually run from&nbsp;the&nbsp;<i>Alt+F8</i>&nbsp;Macros dialog, provide a few more details including
 row and column addresses and a solution can be provided.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so what it is i have a table with 20 lines, 12 of them could have dates in them, the rest are blank, becasue the project ends, &nbsp;the amount of dates could increase from 12 to 14, if needed, so &nbsp;i need a macro that could be assigned to a button maybe which
 would hide all rows within the table that are blank so that they do not show up on on the graph, do you have such a code?</p>

<br />
<div>Macro code typically determines the number of rows and/or even the number of columns to process with loops or range edit commands, but it needs somewhere to start. The actual column that holds the dates might be a good place to start instead of vaguely
 describing <i>"what it is i have a table [...]"</i>.</div>

                    <p>In Outlook, is there a way to block an entire domain rather than just a particualr e-mail from that domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the spammers keep changing the name of the mail account from their domain, and it would be good to block the entire domain.&nbsp; Could we use a wild card for the name for examp0le?</p>

            That is disappointing.&nbsp; It seems like a real oversight on Microsoft's part.&nbsp; And it would be so easily fixed.&nbsp; Is this the sort of issue that I should start a discussion about?

            open your lense cover and it should give you the option on screen, if not, press the status area and you should have the option for flash light.<br />
as for the widget, tap a blank area of the desktop and press the icon that appears in the top right, then select desktop menu/add widgetand select the facebook widget

<p>Was just about to reply with. "You don't need Flash light, the N900 supports Flash 9", then I realised what the OP was talking about. Duhhhh :smileytongue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if it's the Flashlight I'm thinking of, it doesn't install an app, it adds a button to the status bar menu. Just tap the clock and it should be there. If not try scrolling the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the Facebook app. Not sure how you managed to delete it unless you un-installed it from App Manager. Why not just go to the main site and bookmark it to your desktop. Just as good as any FB widget IMO.</p>

<p>yes...the application is there, and it did insstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you have to open the lense cover, then tap the "x" on the camera and then tap menu on the screen top, and then flashlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it doesnt&nbsp;show up until you activate the camera.</p>

    <title>How do I identify the sourcefile of images pasted into a word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> browns87  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I identify the sourcefile of images pasted into a word document.</h2>
                    
<p>Please tell me how to identify the sourcefile of an image pasted into a Word document?&nbsp; The images were pasted as Windows metafiles or enhanced metafiles, not linked or embedded.&nbsp; If this is not possible, is there an easy way to include the sourcefile name
 I paste images in the future&nbsp;(without linking or embedding)?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>extraneous info:</p>
<p>I move files around alot, so links are useless, and Im writing a large document, so I cant embed tables etc because it uses too much memory.&nbsp; I need the sourcefile info so I can figure out the exact source of where&nbsp;the original table or image came from (I
 have many near-identical files with identical layouts where I change one variable or another, and I cant remember which ones were the correct final version)&nbsp; Further, the timestamps for 90% of my files were changed to the date of our last file migration so
 my previous system of organization where I distinguished files by date (as poor as it was) was rendered useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasted graphics in Word don't automatically retain any record of their source. At best, you can do so manually as follows:</p>
<p>Right-click the picture and choose Size to open the dialog. Click the Alt Text tab of the dialog. You can paste or type the name of the source file there. It will be saved with the document, and you can reopen the dialog to read it.</p>
<p>Now, why the Alt Text got stuck into the Size dialog is one of those little mysteries...</p>

<p><span>Hi Jelo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you log into the OneDrive for Business library with your work and school account, after some time, the session will time out</span><span>
 and the library needed to be accessed by re-signing into the account. So your friend may be unable to see the updated data. If you want to remotely control your laptop, it is a Windows computer question rather than an OneDrive for Business question, I suggest
 you post a new thread on our Windows category for expert help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>
