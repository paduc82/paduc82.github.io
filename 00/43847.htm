 this issue rather than uninstalling and reinstalling it again?</p>
<p>Please respond.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Black screen after installing Windows 8.1 update 1</h2>
                    Original Title: Windows crashed after installing Windows 8.1 update 1Black
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install the Windows 8.1 update 1 (<span>KB 2919355</span>) today and it left my computer in an unbootable state (I can't even boot to safe mode). It shows the Windows logo and circles and after that, it sits at a black screen with the cursor and
 wifi indicator appearing periodically. I thought it created a system restore point but it never did. I managed to boot to recovery but from there, I attempted to run a startup repair and sfc /scannow and I had no luck whatsoever. I really don't want to do
 a clean install because I just did one about 3 weeks back and just recently got everything back on there. The computer did not originally come with Windows 8 as it was upgraded to it from Windows 7.<br />

            <p>Hi Harrison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to outdated or incompatible display driver installed on the computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>How did you tried to perform a System Restore? </li><li>What is the Make and Model of the computer?</li><li>How did you navigate to the recovery options? Is it using a media?</li></ol>
<p>I would suggest you to try hard reset method to boot the computer in safe mode and then try updating the display driver installed on the computer. Follow the methods mentioned below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold power button to shut down the system.</li><li>Press the power button to restart system.</li><li>Repeat the steps multiple times (twice or thrice until you see the recovery page).</li><li>After that, select "<strong>advanced repair option</strong>" in Recovery page</li><li>Select "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>" in Choose an option page.</li><li>Select "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" in Troubleshoot page.</li><li>Select "<strong>Startup Settings</strong>" in Advanced options page.</li><li>Select "<strong>Restart</strong>" in Startup Settings.</li><li>After restart the system, choose "<strong>4) Enable Safe Mode</strong>".</li><li>Now, if you are able to boot the computer in safe mode, Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Display adapter</strong> and expand the driver icon. </li><li>Right Click on the display driver and select <strong>Disable</strong>. </li><li>Restart the computer and check if you are able to boot the computer normally.
</li><li>If yes, download and install the latest display driver from the computer‚Äôs manufacturer website.
</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>When you install an update offered from Windows Update, then, a restore is created.
</p>
<p>If you haven‚Äôt tried performing a System Restore using the media/recovery environment, you can do so and see if it fixes the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a Windows 8.1 media, refer to the link to create one and then proceed further:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</li><li>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </li><li>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in Troubleshoot screen.</li><li>Select <strong>System Restore.</strong></li><li>Check the box that says ‚ÄúShow more restore points‚Äù.</li><li>Select the restore point prior to this issue and proceed further with the restore operation.</li><li>Windows will restart after it restores the operating system to a previous point. Check if it fixes the issue.
</li></ul>
<p>For reference:</p>
<p>You can reinstall the update for Windows 8.1 Update April, 2014:</p>

            <p>I have had the exact same issue. Lucky enough I did have a restore point which got it back working to the day before the update. I thought this must have just been a glitch so I tried the update again and did the exact same thing, black screen cursor periodic
 wifi flash but nothing else. And it did the same thing when I installed and tried it a third time making sure the computer was awake the whole time and giving it a good hour to see if it would eventually load screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has the exact same behavior even when I boot into safe mode on multiple attempts (though once I believe I did see it flash the safe mode boxes in the corners). I have tried tried everything I could think of and every solution listed in prior form posts
 about this and has had no change, only fix is to system restore to pre update and then not attempt the update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres a quick run through of what I've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>reboot</p>
<p>system restore and tried update again twice</p>
<p>safe mode (same black screen / cursor)</p>
<p>safe mode with networking</p>
<p>low resolution mode</p>
<p>options for no digital driver enforcement / malware startup</p>
<p>tried running startup repair multiple times successively says cannot repair each time</p>
<p>hibernating and unhibernating</p>
<p>toggling screen on / off with function keys</p>
<p>hit windows key + shift + arrows (to see if login was projected off screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>in command prompt (accessible from troubleshoot section on os selection) I have also tried:</p>
<p>chkdsk - no errors</p>
<p>chkdsk /r</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmbr - says successful</p>
<p>bootred /fixboot - says successful</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At this point I think I will have to ignore this update unless someone can come up with a new fix :(</p>

            Actually, it looked like it was more of a disk error rather than the update causing it. I pulled the hard drive and plugged it into my desktop and I ran both a defrag and a chkdsk /f/r. The disk was fragmented and I let it do its thing and disk errors
 did come back with chkdsk. Luckily, this looked like this fixed my problem<br />

            <p>I have the same issue with the update. It did not create a system restore point. I was lucky to have an older one. Tried it several times, and still black screen with cursor (it's the same in safe mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest chipset drivers from MSI, the latest GeForce drivers for my GTX770, and basically everything else is up to date. (I even updated my BIOS, but that didn't help either).</p>

            <p>Microsoft is informed about this issue. And I think, running a chkdsk and having success with the update was just some luck and the problem is anywhere other located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is fully operating, fully healthy and in almost everything up to date. But actually no way to install that one big KB2919355.. Black logon screen, any low resolution, the WLAN icon on the wrong side (left), and a flickering "busy" mouse cursor
 that only appears if I move my mouse.</p>

            <p>Something is very wrong with this update. I did a clean install just for this. Sure enough the update installed fine. Windows booted to desktop, everything worked. For half a day! Then the problem came back. But this time it was a little worse. I was anticipating
 it, so I created a restore point right out of the gate, but I couldn't restore it this time. (There was an automatic one too, but that also failed to restore). System restore inormed me that I have an Antivirus program and it cannot finalize the restore. This
 is ridiculous as I had the same AV installed the last time around (Eset Smart Security 7), and there was no problem with it. So now I'm on my third clean install.</p>
<p>The problem might come from theme service. I suspect it, because the last time it occured I saw an auto theme change (windows reverted to default theme on it's own). After that I rebooted, because I thought something was glitching and I couldn't boot anymore.</p>
<p>Some specifics about the situation: there is a cursor. I can move it. Ctrl+alt+del, ctrl+shift+esc doesn't work. Win+P brings up an empty charms bar, but I can't do anything with it. At one time I enabled the text to speech interface with some key combo,
 but that's all the life I could get out of it. The same goes for safe mode.</p>
<p>That's literally all I can say about the problem right now.</p>

<p>I'm considering using the BitLocker feature, but I've been postponing the decision because I didn't know how that will reflect to files synced via SkyDrive to my other PCs.
</p>
<p>Will I be able to access these files easily on other PCs or via Web when I'm not on my PC? Also, should I expect any other issues that I might not be aware of?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but my&nbsp; problem remains. I didn‚Äôt state my problem correctly.</p>
<p><br />
I‚Äôm sorry my question was not clear. I referred to user account name on startup whereas the change I want is in File Explorer, under users ( &gt;This PC &gt; OS (C:) &gt; Users&nbsp; rober). My folder is spelled rober, when it should be Robert. The rename option is not available
 for this folder, leading me to believe that it has a special status, and cannot be simply removed or changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your assistance in renaming or replacing &nbsp;this folder.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that you are using the new Skype version interface on your Mac, that is why you can't those settings, but what I can suggest, is to try to download the classic version of Skype, through this link:
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, try to check the privacy option and let's know if that will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Skype login loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaydee228  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype login loop</h2>
                    I can't login into any of my skype accounts with the desktop application (not the store app). When I type the correct password (and it is correct, I can log in on the website with it just fine), the login screen goes white for a second as if it's loading
 something, and then it gets me back to the "enter password" screen again. I've been using an older version of skype that worked fine, but as of recently older versions have been disabled. I'm running Windows 10. I've tried reinstalling skype, deleting its
 folders manually, none of that helps.

<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if the file format is compatible to be viewed in Windows Photo Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Understanding picture file types</span></strong><b><span><br />

<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also try opening the photos using Paint and check if you are able to open without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Right click on any one of the photo and select <strong>Open With </strong>
and click <strong>Change Default program</strong>.<br />
b) Now select the <strong>Windows Photo Viewer </strong>in the list.<br />
c) Now put a check mark for ‚Äú<strong>Always use a selected program to open this kind of file</strong>‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you don't have file extensions displayed by default, right-click on a photo and look at the file's name.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have not set it as default program to open images, perform these steps:</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of the NTDLL.DLL file that you're seeing is also the OS Build of your Windows 10. If you will update the OS Build of your Windows 10, the NTDLL.DLL file will also be updated. Upon seeing the system that has the NTDLL.DLL issue, this computer
 is still using the old version and build of Windows 10. We recommend that you <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">update your Windows 10</a></strong> through Windows Update. When you update your Windows 10, all of the system files, including the NTDLL.DLL
 file, will be replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, kindly reply to this thread.</p>

<h2>            xbox 360 from another country</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>So basically I just moved in the US from France and my xbox is French.&nbsp;But the power supply is&nbsp;different in terms of voltage&nbsp;( 220V to 240V for mine) compare to&nbsp;here in the US (110V to 120V). So my question is if I buy a new power supply with 110V to 120V,
 will it work on my xbox 360&nbsp;?</p>

<p>I suggest you to not do such a thing. As xbox live states here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/power-supply" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../power-supply</a></p>
<p>PSUs are designed to be used only in the countries or regions where they are sold because different regions have different power requirements. Using the power supply in a different country may damage the power supply or your Xbox 360 console, and the warranty
 may be invalidated.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Disc&#93; Mirror&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Edge not recognised</h2>
                    
<p>I can't get my console to recignise my Mirror's Edge disc as a backwards compatible title. When I go to "Install disc", I get a "This game is not playable here" error message with error code 0x8082000c.<br />
<br />
Tried 3 other games (Gears of War 3, Gears of War Judgment and Perfect Dark Zero) and they were all recognised. I also tried the problem game in my 360 and it was recognised correctly and eventually launched successfully (got an update error on my first attempt
 but it worked correctly on the second attempt).<br />
<br />
The game and my console region are both Australia (PAL). The disc is a standard edition disc.<br />
<br />
I've already tried a console reboot but there was no change.</p>

<h2>            BSOD - KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>A couple (1-3) times a day my W540 laptop will display a blue screen of death with the error message KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED. The machine then restarts and works fine until the next iteration. The specific cause (which I understand is sometimes displayed
 under this error) is not listed. The machine restarts and then later on that day will do the same. I am trying to determine the cause of the error. I haven't installed any new hardware or software recently, Windows 10 is up to date, and the BSOD troubleshooter
 didn't find anything wrong. I looked at the Event Viewer to try and determine the cause (Event Viewer&gt;Windows Logs&gt;System) but all I could find was a list of "Event 6008" entries that each read "The previous system shutdown at 6:39:26 AM on ‚Äé1/‚Äé23/‚Äé2018 was
 unexpected." Here's a list of the recent unexpected restarts:</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Hi, when you get the next couple of BSOD's, let the percentage build up to 100% and reboot, this should create the mini dump files and then you can upload them

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you get any error message when the game crashes?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your game still crashes in Windows 10. The issue might arise due to various reasons, including system file corruption or due to user profile corruption.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to troubleshoot the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>

            <p>Running method 1 completed successfully with no errors found. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 will not work with this game since per the vendor, G5e.com, "the game goes in real time and it recharges ... even when the app is minimized or closed. In case the app is reinstalled your game progress and purchased items are lost."&nbsp; e.g. the came
 is tied to the specific user account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 upgrade two errors are generated when trying to launch the game.&nbsp; Event ID 1000 and 1001.&nbsp; The gist of both is that msvcr120_app.dll version 12.021005.1 is not loading/processing the game files correctly after the upgrade.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a quick search and also trying to register the file at the command prompt with
<strong>regsvr32 /i msvcr120_app.dll</strong>, it appears that&nbsp;this file is no longer present in Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like the game vendor, g5e.com needs to issue a patch to rectify the issue.&nbsp; They are aware of the problem and working towards a fix.&nbsp;

<h2>            After installing MicrosoftFixit 50465 my keyboard has been typing wrong letters</h2>
                    So about a month ago my keyboard started acting up. &nbsp;The windows key kept tweaking as if it was being pressed down when it wasn't. &nbsp;I swapped the keyboard and it was still acting up. &nbsp;So After i searched around for a while i found MicrosoftFixit 50465
 which i downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216893/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/216893/en-us</a>&nbsp;. I followed all directions carefully, however about a couple hours after i installed the&nbsp;MicrosoftFixit 50465 my keyboard started
 acting up in a different way.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now when ever i type certain letters or keys, the letter 'L' appears after. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example ( bl, nl) , these are the letters and keys it seems to be happening with so far.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Caps Lock key, B, N, f12</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running&nbsp;</div>

<div>Compaq Presario CQ56</div>
<div>AMD V140 2.30GHz</div>
<div>5GB RAM</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can i fix this?</div>

    <title>Need a new password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aegir004  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need a new password</h2>
                    Recently I bought a small Asus computer in Iceland where I live. I had to create a Microsoft account while I was setting it up for the first time and quickly put in some password thinking I would never need it again. Anyway I was offered a chance to use
 a four digit pin number instead of the password to log into the computer and immediately accepted that. Only too late did I find out that I need that password (not the pin number) to do all sorts of things on the computer like updating things. I can use the
 Outlook mail account though because I am logged into it on that computer. But I can't update the password because I need the old password to do that and I cannot remember it. And Microsoft refuses to let me get a new password on the web because I can't provide
 information that I have emailed realatives or bought stuff with the account that I have never used.<br />
So my computer seems locked to me. I have never before known Microsoft to claim absolute control of a computer in this way. It seems to be some kind of Microsoft ransomware rather than a computer. Is there some way I can at least register the computer under
 a new account name? What do people do when they want to sell a computer like this?<br />
Can anybody offer some help?

            Well that didn't work I had already set auto play from the control panel to ask me every time on every thing. Just to make sure I did it again control panel - hardware/sounds - auto play all are set to ask me every time and then save. No luck turning AV
 off. I searched the internet and it looks like its a big problem with no correct fix, did MS drop the ball on this one?

            <p>Some things to check/do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Control Panel &gt; AutoPlay click the <em>Reset all defaults</em> button, then reconfigure all settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ensure the <em>Shell Hardware Detection</em> service is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Ensure Quiet hours is not enabled in Action Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Under Settings app &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions, ensure you have at least the following notification settings enabled:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31cb3fc4-c3d6-4ee5-9568-c40e5be30c0e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31cb3fc4-c3d6-4ee5-9568-c40e5be30c0e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If none of this helps try creating a new local admin user account and test whether AutoPlay works properly under it or not.</p>

 my computer and after two hours were not able to get it to work.&nbsp; He reinstalled windows 10 and will call me back tomorrow to see if its working and after it was finished reinstalling windows 10 I still don't have Auto Play?

<h2>            Preorder game download</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to preorder a game on my Xbox One. If I do, when can I begin downloading? I bought the AC Unity using download and it seemed to take FOREVER. I felt it would have been better to go to a midnight sale since I got tired of waiting and went on
 to bed. So is a game downloadable and not playable until release date, or do I have to wait until after midnight on the release date to start downloading?</p>

<p>Pre-downloading is awesome, in my opinion. &nbsp;As Zen mentioned, the game will download immediately, but won't be accessible until it is officially released. &nbsp;You won't have to wait... you just start it right up.</p>

<h2>            How can I keep MouseKeys from turning on every startup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I start up my computer, MouseKeys will activate and I have to go in Control Panel to disable it. Is there any way to keep it from turning on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Just to confirm, I have gone into Control Panel\Ease of Access\Ease of Access Center\Change sign-in settings and ensured that MouseKeys is not set to turn on after start up, and applied these changes. I have also looked into Registry
 Editor, and based on other information I have found, I have set:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">(Default) : 0</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Flags : 62</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">However, after restarting, this value gets reset to 66.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is there anything I can do? This is very annoying.</p>

            Hi Luke,<br />

It appears that this issue is due to programs that are running in the background. Let's isolate the issue by performing the methods below:<br />
<br />
The methods are listed in order, so start with the first one, see if that fixes the problem, and then continue to the next one if it doesn‚Äôt.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Disable any startup programs using the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/67a35c4f-a19f-14c5-0094-e6e7df4d853a/how-to-open-msconfig-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">System Configuration Tool</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Perform a clean boot using the steps <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong>.<br />
