<h2>            How to compare columns across two tabs</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Excel 2007 workbook with two tabs. Tab 1 contains the following columns:</p>
<p>IP Address, Server Name, OS</p>
<p>Tab 2 contains the following:</p>
<p>IP Address, Street Address, Owner, Group, Host Name, Network</p>
<p>I am trying to do the following:</p>
<p>Compare Tab 2 against Tab 1 based on the IP Address. For IP Addresses that show in Tab 2 but not in Tab 1, highlight the row or add an indicator in a new column at the end flagging that row.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help is greatly appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The VLOOKUP formula will only find the first occurance of a match looking down a column.&nbsp; It will only find contso.microsoft.com as a match for contso if contso.microsoft.com is the first text string in the column with a leading "c".</p>
<p>You CAN look up the IPAddress as previous and step over to return the HostName if you wish.....by using this formula instead......notice the differences in the two formulas?</p>

One way to try for a fuzzy search &amp; flag<br />

<h3> clinton chau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Consolidate accounts by reassociating aliases</h2>
                    <p>I have two Microsoft accounts that I want to consolidate into one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first one is what I use with Office 365 and Outlook.com, call that one, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second one I used to use for Xbox, call that one, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now want to use only *** Email address is removed for privacy *** for all Microsoft related services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an alias under my *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, called *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, that I want to associate with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I remove the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** alias from my *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, I cannot associate *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I get is that the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is already in use by someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I accomplish my goal? Will closing my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** account release my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** alias?</p>

    <title>Emails from .space tld domains are marked as spam at Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails from .space tld domains are marked as spam at Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I am contacting on behalf of RADIX.<br />
<br />
RADIX is Asia's largest domain name registry operator - with 10 TLDs under management (.Online, .Site, .Space, .Website, .Tech, .Press, .Host, .Pw, .Store and .Fun). As our TLDs grow, we have become more cautious about the quality of names being registered.
 More specifically, we have taken a very strong stance against any kind of abusive use of domains in our TLDs. We have been getting feeds from a bunch of sources and security agencies, and are very quick to respond when our domains show up in any such feeds.
 This lets us remain compliant with ICANN requirements and pose as a fairly aggressive anti-abuse unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, it has been brought to our notice that the emails to Outlook/Hotmail&nbsp;from .space tld domains are marked as spam. We have tested the same from newly registered .space domains with a fresh email account and found out that the emails are indeed getting
 marked as spam in Hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a possibility that .space&nbsp;tld is blacklisted at Hotmail/Outlook? If yes, what is the solution to get the tld&nbsp;removed from the blacklist? If no, then what could be the possible reason of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight on this matter will be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Anu Somarajan</p>

<p>Hi Anu Somarajan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be a filter or settings on recipients end that caused the email to be marked as spam. If the issue happens to multiple recipients we would recommend that you use and fill up the form on this
 which can request for unblocking the domain address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's anything else that we can help you with, please do not hesitate to reply here and we will further assist you.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, Ma. Lau!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the filter by default on the recipient wmail account. We tested this by creating a new Outlook email account also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, this do not seems to be domain specific. Like i specified in my post, we also tested sending emails after registering new .space domain and creating a new email account on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll surely file up the form, but can you please confirm that Outlook do not blacklist tlds, especially the new gtlds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us Anu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated in our previous post there are several factors why an email or address is being blocked or marked as spam. Most of it is caused by the content of the email or IP and domain's sending reputation. You can communicate with the support and know what
 is causing the issue once a support representative replied to you when they received the form that you fill up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also some information in this <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></span></strong> which you can check to know the possible cause
 of your issue. Kindly refer to the article about <strong>Email send is being blocked or junked by Outlook.com</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Does Word for ANDROID have Outline View&#63;</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
I'm playing with Word for ANDROID — which is a great idea BTW — but having trouble navigating around larger documents? I'm hoping to use Word as a kind of 'wiki' for writing up characters and places etc for a novel I'm working on. And of course another document
 for plotting, and another for the actual writing. How do I use these word wiki's without Outline view? I can't just jump around in the document as I can on my mac?

<p>
</p><p>Please check this with your service provider. It is possible that you might need a new SIM in order to make calls and/or send text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third party apps may allow you to make outbound calls because you these apps are using internet connection which is different if you are using the phone app that uses your service provider's cellular network.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 is Slow</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original Title: Word 2010 is Slooooow!</strong></p>
<p>I'm on windows vista and had word 2002 which runs slow on this machine so I tried word 2010 and it is even slower to open a document and then to close a document.&nbsp; I could probably make a peanutbutter &amp; jelly sandwich waiting for it to open and probably
 eat the sandwich while waiting for it to close.&nbsp; On some days I might open and close 50 or more documents.&nbsp; What a waste of time this has turned into.&nbsp; I tried microsoft fixit app and it says it can find no problems.&nbsp; Sometimes word 2010 freezes and windows
 has to shut it down.&nbsp; When that happens, I get a message that says it wants me to send the erro report to microsoft - I always do.&nbsp; So if windows is always reporting errors and mr microsoft fixit doesn't recognize any errors is there any other option, other
 than going to look for my hammer!? btw, this condition is the same with word 2002 and word 2010.&nbsp; I guess vista does not like word???????? Can someone help Please?</p>

<p>Anti-virus add-ins have been known to slow down Word 2007-2010. Try running Word 2010 in<em> Safe Mode</em>.</p>
<p>Click<em> Start</em> or tap the<em> Windows key</em> and type or paste in<em>&nbsp;winword /safe</em> then hit<em> &lt;enter&gt;</em>. Word will start with no blank document and the title bar will read<em> Microsoft Word (Safe Mode)</em>. Open an existing document
 and perform some standard actions that you would expect to be slow.</p>
<p>If this resolves the speed issue, look to enable/disable add-ins within the<em> Trust</em>Center area of<em> Word Options</em>.</p>

            <p>I appreciate the response, and will consult the links you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried running it past McAfee, which now I guess is part of Intel.&nbsp; But as usual they passed on it because the version of McAfee I have is through my MSN subscription;&nbsp; they always say I have to call MSN support.&nbsp; It's aggravating because the McAfee
 module on the computers have links in their Help section that go to McAfee support pages, not MSN, so the seemingly handy links&nbsp;just waste my time.&nbsp; MSN's McAfee support is only via telephone, so I have to be able to hear and understand them, which in my experience&nbsp;often
 does&nbsp;not go so well.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The links provided put my mind to ease a bit.&nbsp; Though the second one re. the article in bleepingcomputer didn't load and scroll without problems via MSN Explorer, the image of the blue screen shown there was virtually identical to the one I ran into while
 trying to access a page at Velvac researching vehicle mirrors and using Edge.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, Edge has been kicking out a lot of annoying pop-up ads in spite of the pop-up settings I thought were in place to prevent such irritations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GreginMich answer link would not open at all, at least not via MSN Explorer and Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm finding I often have to try different computers and mix and match browsers and operating systems until I get one that works.&nbsp; You'd think by now that technology
 would not be so aggravating.&nbsp; Heck, I've even found on occasion that XP will work where Vista, iOS&nbsp;Safari, or W10 won't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like Malwarebytes was part of the MSN subscription package as well, but I may have sidelined it as a duplication of McAfee's anti-malware, and unnecessarily using disc space.&nbsp; I should revisit that decision as perhaps misguided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Le Boule, thank you&nbsp;for the thorough input.</p>

            Hi, lightspeed117. Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussions! Viber requires internet connection to use the app. Which connection are you using? Cellular data or WiFi? Do you have an active internet connection? Try to access a website using your phone browser
 to confirm this. Let us know the outcome.

            &nbsp;No Trouble.<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to Page Page set up (make sure you printer is set as your default printer).</li><li>go down to page size and 5 x 8 index cards.</li><li>Go to button just below setting og number of copies.</li><li>Scroll down to bottom and give a name.</li><li>From now on you can just select that preset.</li></ol>
You will have to adjust Margins accordingly. Type or insert your content. Save document. Then print using this preset.
<br />
<br />
See this link I would rather use a different screen grab program that allows me to upload to skydrive so I can insert here but it doesn't allow multiple layers of capture.

    <title>Currency in British Pounds. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Currency in British Pounds.</h2>
                    <p>When trying to purchase music from the Windows Phone App store my currency is set to British pounds, while currency for apps/games/videos are set to US dollars.&nbsp; All my settings are for the United States region in "language+region" and my time zone is set
 for Eastern Time US.&nbsp; I have tried to change the settings to UK then restart phone, then back to US and restart phone but still the currency for music purchases is pounds.&nbsp; When it is in pounds I will incur a currency conversion charge on my credit card plus
 I do not get the US library of music, just the UK one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this issue or know how to fix it?</p>

            <p>Thank you for pointing me in the right direction David!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I went to my live account I did indeed have a billing account in both GB and US.&nbsp; From there I ultimately made my way to the Xbox site (Xbox music) where there is an option to merge more than one billing account into one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solved my problem and I now can get access to not only the US music store but now also Podcasts on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how I got an account in pounds and why an incomplete account would be the default since I do not have an address in Britain or a credit card on file issued in Britain.&nbsp; But my US account did.&nbsp; Seems to be an issue with the account.live site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to check your Microsoft Account settings (under Billing =&gt; Payment options) online as well at:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure that you are editing your US Account and not UK. You know this by looking under your name in the top right-hand corner and, hopefully, you should see "US - Personal Account."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those settings are correct, then you might want to reset your phone (wiping out all data and apps) and setup your phone from scratch, being sure to select the correct Regional and Language settings for your location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!<br />
David<br />

    <title>Text Select Pointer Enlarged - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Text Select Pointer Enlarged</h2>
                    <p>Hi using Windows 10 preview build 10162 and noticed that the "Text Select" pointer is over sized.&nbsp; I've tried resetting it via the Personalization/Themes/Mouse Pointer Settings but that didn't seem to work.&nbsp; While I'm here the other major things I don't
 like are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No recent history when hovering over start menu applications like Word or Excel</li><li>Edge browser won't open a site in a new Window, just a blank screen</li><li>Desktop icons very flat and dull</li></ul>
Other than that really stable and coping with all I have tested so far.

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing your interest in Windows 10.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 Insider Preview</strong>&nbsp;is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. We are looking forward to improve it and provide the best possible customer experience in the
 latest coming builds.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you answer few questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Edge browser, do you face the issue with all websites or with any specific website?</li></ol>
<p>For the issue with text select pointer size and dull Desktop icons, issue&nbsp;may be caused by graphics driver’s absence or not updated. I suggest you to update graphics driver and check if it works. Kindly refer the below given link to update drivers.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For viewing history on Start menu, we have functionality such as show the most used apps, show recently added apps, show recently opened items in Jump list on Start and task bar etc. But as of now we don’t have functionality to view history by hovering on
 Word and Excel on Start menu. I suggest you to provide your feedback through Feedback app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information answers all your queries. Please post back with the results and the information asked, we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h3> soulhuntre  say:</h3>
<h2>            15007.rs_prerelease - Storage spaces issues &#47; bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After the last two updates (15007 and the one before) the problem is this. I have two storage pools - one on USB external drives (3) and one on SSD drives (2). After the update and subsequent reboot, the SSD_Pool doesn't mount. It is HAPPY to exist,
 and the drives claim they are fine... it just won't mount the storage space.</p>
<p>If I pull the cables on the USB drives, the SSD pool then comes up completely and happily. The data is fine, there is no corruption.</p>
<p>This happened with a fresh load (Win10 Pro, then insider fast) as well as on a second machine (my new workstation, same OS evolution). If I plug all the drives in, I can recreate the SSD storage pool and make a new storage space. if I do then the
 SSD and USB will coexist for a while... but a reboot has a high chance of "losing" the SSD storage space again.</p>
<p>Possible issues...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Storage space snow has a bug that prevents it from linking multiple storage pools on one machine?</p>

<h2>            Unable to Activate Office 365 Pro Plus on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am eligible to use Office 365 Pro Plus through my University and was able to use it with no issues on Windows 7, but upon attempting to install the programs on Windows 10 I am unable to activate the programs through the Microsoft Activation Wizard. I consistently
 receive error code 0x8004FC12 and am unable to continue with the activation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc /scannow and&nbsp;even did a fresh install of Windows 10 to no avail. I've also tried the quick repair and online repair options using Add/Remove Programs with no success and I keep getting the same error. Office 365 Online clearly shows&nbsp;I have
 it activated on my&nbsp;Windows 10 installation but repeated attempts at reinstalling have not fixed the issue. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I would like to have been the first person to mark 'helpful' but unfortunately none of the suggestions worked. &nbsp;The Microsoft Activation Wizard does&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> give you the option to activate the software by telephone. &nbsp;The option is there but
 it's greyed out. &nbsp;Neither is there a telephone contact number. &nbsp;The last heartening message I noted was that if I chose not to activate at this time, I had (in my case) 6 more days before the product became unlicensed. Following the 'Help' suggestion which
 asks you to open an Office application and click&nbsp;<strong>File &gt; Account &gt; Activate Product</strong> is interesting because I can not find any option to activate the product under Account. &nbsp;It of course &nbsp;finishes off with an error message and apology - "We're
 sorry, something went wrong and we can't do this for you right now. Please try again later. (0x8004FC12)". &nbsp;I have 3 other computers awaiting the Windows 10 Upgrade which I will obviously delay as I don't want to run the risk of creating similar issues on
 3 other fronts. <strong>I can only hope that a workable solution is not to far away. Grahanit.</strong>

            Grahanit basically sums it up. The article was unfortunately not very helpful as it does not account for the error which we are receiving in attempting to activate the product. The telephone option is unavailable and activation through the internet simply
 does not work because of the aforementioned error.

            <p>This really does seem to be a show stopper for me for Windows 10 - you can have a new operating system, but you can't use other Microsoft products with it. I too have Office 365 via my university, and the account looks fine, but I can't activate it now I've
 moved to Windows 10. Was using it on Windows 7 no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support haven't been helpful either - two "online chats" with support to try to resolve it - the first person told me to reboot my PC, the second said "Hi, I'm Jennifer" and then said nothing else for 10 minutes after I told her the problem!</p>

            <p>When is <strong>Microsoft</strong> going to take some <strong>responsibility</strong> for this situation where Office 365 won't&nbsp;<strong>activate</strong> in the Windows 10 environment. None of the fixes suggested by Microsoft Community work,&nbsp;and that comment
 is no reflection on the excellent job they do. One fix from Microsoft Support&nbsp;suggested running System File Checker. No, and I tried it four times, restarting each time. (It did come up with "&nbsp;System Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to
 fix some.") &nbsp;I even tried the 'restore health' command (DISM) but that was to no avail. &nbsp;I have a copy of the relevant CBS Log. &nbsp;If anyone thinks it may be of some use let me know where to send it.</p>
<p>The comment then made that if it doesn't work try performing a Reset or Reinstall of Windows.&nbsp;I may try a reset but if I have to install Windows I may as well go back to Windows 8.1 where I&nbsp;never had the problem.</p>
<p>I have 5 computers - 2 running Windows 10, the rest a mix of 7 and 8.1. &nbsp;I have a Office 365 subscription valid until March 2016 and in a few days I will find my Microsoft Office unlicensed and therefore I gather unusable.</p>
<p>Having been a part of the Insiders Program for many months I am more than aware of the potential and reality of teething problems, I simply cannot afford to waste any more time and the prospect of no email program or word processing capability leaves me
 cold. &nbsp;Grahanit.</p>

            <p>OK, I'm almost nervous to post this in case it all goes wrong tomorrow! However...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had exactly the same problem, and was about to revert back to Win 7. However, I decided as one last-ditch attempt to uninstall Office on my newly upgraded Win 10 PC, then go to the website (I went via File | Account | Manage Account, but I think&nbsp;https://portal.office.com/
 takes you there too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deactivated my current version of Office from that website, and reinstalled it. I reinstalled the recommended 32-bit version rather than the 64-bit version. So far, it's worked fine and hasn't (yet) prompted me for an activation key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I may post here again tomorrow to say the problem's back again - but worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of interest, I did try installing Office from the website as a last-ditch attempt earlier today (over my existing one), and it said I couldn't install the 32-bit version as there was already a 64-bit version installed. Now, I'm pretty sure that
 I didn't install a 64-bit version (since they recommended the 32-bit version), so I do wonder if the Office 10 upgrade simply installs the 64-bit demo version (and therefore unlinked to whatever account you may have) regardless of what you happen to have already
 installed? Just a thought.</p>

            Many thanks for your post and advice. &nbsp;Unfortunately your suggestions didn't work for me. &nbsp;Your suggestions by the way made perfect sense, more sense then I am receiving from MS quarters. &nbsp;In fact I tried 2 options. &nbsp;Firstly I deactivated from My Account
 and reactivated it - no go. &nbsp;I then uninstalled it from Programs &amp; Features and then reinstalled it from My Account - again no go. &nbsp;What to do next - quite frankly I don't have a clue at this moment. &nbsp;Thanks Again Chris

 they get license from Microsoft,which I can understand.But than I find out that is not true.When I turn them again for support they say that I need to be patient and that they soon updated current version,after some time that do that but my new version was
 not even close how it's done on Android phone and soon thay pull back that update and I again get old even worse version.They say that it's because they have trouble to make that version without bugging and that they best people very hard doing on create version
 that will function on Windows phone.But I can't understand why is like that and why is in store in offer a new version as way is are store is not good as on Android phone.Also I will love to not be obliged to have Xbox accoun
