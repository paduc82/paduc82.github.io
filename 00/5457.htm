<h2>            Excel Multiple Sheets with Unique IDs and I need a count&#47;sum&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently working on multiple sheets and I have Unique ID's tied to them. I need to be able to populate a cell with a summed number. So sheet one has ID but sheet two has 4 rows all with that ID. I need sheet one to display in the cell next to the ID
 the number 4 because there are 4 rows with that ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ex. Sheet 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheet 2</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; /&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ID:1234 /</p>
<p>ID:1234 /&nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ID:1111 /</p>

    <title>Mobile 6.5 Locking the phone while in a voice conversation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mobile 6.5 Locking the phone while in a voice conversation</h2>
                    Older versions of windows mobile while using a blue tooth device, you could simply lock the phone and put it back on its holder on your hip and carry on a conversation. This allows you to talk on the phone hands free and take the phone with you. You wouldn't
 accidentally hit a button and hang up on the person or dial in other people. <br />
<br />
Mobile 6.5 HTC Touch Pro2, I do not seem to be able to lock the phone while in a conversation on the phone. You have to kep it out in front of you and so on. I can not figure out how to lock the phone while on the phone to prevent hitting other buttons and
 so on. This might tie into a prior question I had with locking the phone easier. Then again might not. Anyone have any ideas how to lock the phone once in a phone conversation? Actually I do not see a way to really exit the phone screen.
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            For future reference, I did find a way to do this. This seems to be the only way however. it is long and cumbersome then can have drawbacks.<br />
<br />
While in a phone conversation Press the windows logo or start menu. Scroll down and find the Settings. There is a lock Icon under there. Press that and the device will lock while you are on the phone.<br />
<br />
When it locks it doesn't look like the normal lock screen. You now have a portrait of who you are talking to, if you have a portrate set up for them and about 6 buttons, 3 on the left and 3 on the right. One of the buttons is Unlock MAKE NOTE OF THIS BUTTON.
 it is not a slider or anything but a button so you are probably going to hit it and attempt to unlock your phone if you put it in your pocket or in a belt case.&nbsp;If lock&nbsp;is password protected them it will prompt you for that and not actually just unlock you
 have to enter in the pass code. The downside or at least has happened to me every time and why I said make note of this button because so you are on the phone and your screen fades, like it is supposed to in order to conserve power, the lock screen while you
 are in a phone call some how goes in landscape mode (Like if your phone was sideways)&nbsp;even though it is displayed on your phone in portrate. You can only see and touch a little side piece of that button to actually unlock your phone when the conversation is
 done. Even if you open the keyboard, turn the phone on its side etc, it will remain so you can not see any buttons on the left side of the screen just the edges enough to hit them but you need to know where they are, because you can't read them.
<br />
This whole thing and mechanism is broken and definately a downgrade from Mobile 5 and 6.

    <title>Automatically updating a total across multiple EXCEL speadsheets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tg-succasunna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically updating a total across multiple EXCEL speadsheets</h2>
                    I have two spreadsheets within the same workbook.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first spreadsheet (HOURS) allows data entry across multiple days/weeks across multiple work tasks.&nbsp; The second spreadsheet (TOTAL HOURS) is intended to keep a running total of the data entered across
 the multiple work tasks whenever data is entered in the HOURS spreadsheet.&nbsp; Does anyone know how I can automatically update the total in TOTAL HOURS on an ongoing basis using base EXCEL commands?&nbsp; I can easily copy from the appropriate cell(s) in HOURS to
 the appropriate cell(s) in TOTAL HOURS; however when the&nbsp;cell(s) in HOURS change so do the cell(s) in TOTAL HOURS.&nbsp; Basically, I'm looking for a work in progress (WIP) cell that will maintain the total from the previous data entry in HOURS and allow me to
 add new hours as they are entered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>This is an example of the basic 'problem' in Excel for many - there are no formulas that you can use that won't update except if the formula also contains some kind of decision maker: usually the IF() function.&nbsp; A cell can either hold a formula that will
 (normally) update with any change to cells it references, or it can hold a value (something you type in) which is permanent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem for that in cases like this there is no equivalent of a statement like:</p>
<p>=IF(X1="Don't Update",Keep Previous Results,Calculate New Results)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a couple of options:</p>
<p>#1 copy the total hours when you want to preserve them and perhaps copy them to the column right next to the column with the formulas in it.&nbsp; BUT instead of just copy and paste, use Copy then Edit --&gt; Paste Special and choose the "Values" option.&nbsp; The value
 (results of the formulas) will be placed in the new cells and won't be updated with changes to the HOUR entries.</p>
<p>#2 ask for, or even record, a macro that will do the #1 actions for you when you need to create a record of the previous entry/entries.&nbsp; For us to provide one, we'd need to know the worksheet names involved and the cell addresses involved on both sheets.&nbsp;
 A sample workbook (with personal or confidential info removed) and posted to one of these free file hosting sites and made 'public' for us to look at would be marvelous.&nbsp; All you have to do then is post the link to the file that the site provides to you.</p>

            <p>Or maybe I'm totally misunderstanding you.&nbsp; Does this describe what you are looking for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say at the start of some time period that both the plain HOURS and the Total Hours sheets look like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="7">The TOTAL HOURS sheet (and initially also the &nbsp; 'just' hours sheet)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thur</td>
<td>Fri</td>
<td>Sat</td>
<td>Sun</td>
<td>Mon</td>
<td>Tue</td>
<td>Wed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5/1/2014</td>
<td>5/2/2014</td>
<td>5/3/2014</td>
<td>5/4/2014</td>
<td>5/5/2014</td>
<td>5/6/2014</td>
<td>5/7/2014</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then when the Hours sheet is used for the next period and looks like this:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="7">The &nbsp; 'just' HOURS Sheet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thur</td>
<td>Fri</td>
<td>Sat</td>
<td>Sun</td>
<td>Mon</td>
<td>Tue</td>
<td>Wed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5/8/2014</td>
<td>5/9/2014</td>
<td>5/10/2014</td>
<td>5/11/2014</td>
<td>5/12/2014</td>
<td>5/13/2014</td>
<td>5/14/2014</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You want the Total Hours sheet to look like this?</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="14">The TOTAL HOURS sheet after new entries on the 'just' hours &nbsp; sheet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thur</td>
<td>Fri</td>
<td>Sat</td>
<td>Sun</td>
<td>Mon</td>
<td>Tue</td>
<td>Wed</td>
<td>Thur</td>
<td>Fri</td>
<td>Sat</td>

<tr>

<td>5/3/2014</td>
<td>5/4/2014</td>
<td>5/5/2014</td>
<td>5/6/2014</td>
<td>5/7/2014</td>

<td>0</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If that's what you're looking for, almost certainly you're going to need a macro solution.</p>

<p>Hi Tennessee Smith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, there are several ways sharing calendar with other people, here is an article about the shared calendar, please see:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/share-an-outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88</a> . According to this article, may I know how you create the calendar and in which way you shared the calendar to others?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to scope your issue, may I confirm with you some related information for analyzing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When you added an appointment, did other people can see the updates on their side?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>If you are using Outlook client, did you tried on <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> and still have the same issue?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>When you remove a meeting, did the participants received any cancel emails like below picture shows?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Are all of your shared calendar having the same issue?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>May I know how you shared the shared calendar with other people, since there are many ways to share a calendar, like publish the calendar, giving permissions to people and so on?
</li><li>When you shared the calendar, how they add it to their calendar? If you can give me more details, like step by step, to make me better understand your situation?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
<p>

<p>The calendar was done in a shared folder and one person would send out the invites. Everyone would receive calendar invites from that calendar and they would just click accept on their calendars when the invite arrived.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tennessee Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I confirm with you the “shared folder” you said refers to a public folder, and people have permission to access this folder and create calendar meetings in folders, anyone accept the meeting can see the meeting in their own calendar? Please correct me
 if I misunderstand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, only organizer can cancel a meeting. If one person (not organizer) decline the meeting by delete it from their own calendar, since he isn’t organizer, others will still see the meetings in their calendars. Please check whether the meeting was
 canceled by the organizer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever organizer cancel a meeting, other people will find in their own calendars this meeting‘s status are updates to “Canceled”, then they can choose to remove it via right-click-&gt;Remove from calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<h3> mike atamian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Spinning Beach Ball of Death with digital signatures and MacOS Sierra</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a MacBook Pro circa 2013. Had been running Outlook 2016 under El Capitan, and CACKey, with no issues. Upgraded to MacOS Sierra and now have a major problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever anyone sends me a message with a digital&nbsp;signature, I get the spinning beach ball of death for up to 3 minutes or so. Outlook will not respond. Sometimes I get a prompt to either wait or kill Outlook. If I am patient and wait, I can read the message.
 If I deselect it and then reselect it, no issue. But if I close Outlook and reopen, same problem with the same message. This happens with EVERY SINGLE e-mail from anyone with a digital signature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything. Reinstalled Outlook, no joy. Completely eliminated CACKey from Mac and reinstalled (five times), no joy. Even removed CACKey entirely, no joy. The only thing I haven't tried is reverting back to El Capitan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the problem is CACKey, as the problem still occurs when it is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else seen this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, any help is appreciated!</p>

            Liezi - it appears that your answer is about a problem with rebuilding the database. Mike's question is about digital signatures. How does your answer relate to Mike's problem?

    <title>Lost all pinned files after Office 2016 online repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost all pinned files after Office 2016 online repair</h2>
                    <p>I ran the Online Repair option from Control Panel (not the Quick Repair), and now all my pinned documents are gone (when right-clicking on my Word/Excel shortcuts from the start menu). I had a ton of 'em!&nbsp; :(&nbsp; If I had known this repair was going to clear
 them away, I would have backed them up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange is that if I go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\User MRU, there's a ton of files in there, but none of them start with&nbsp;[F00000001]! (They all start with&nbsp;[F00000000], and I have no idea which of these I had pinned, or even
 if I did?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice/suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your concern with me. I recreated your concern in my end and upon doing it your pinned post should remain. For us to isolate the caused of this concern, can you locate your file and try to pin it again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding with your files, pinned documents on your Word are just the shortcut to your files. By the thought that you were able to pin it, it means that your files were saved to your computer. The files you found on your registry are the pinned files that
 were on your Word before. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>We highly recommend not doing any changes to your registry since it might affect your whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your response.</p>

<h2>            Office 2007 Ultimate won&#39;t open Excel files from shortcut</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my PC to Windows 8, and reinstalled my Office 2007 Ultimate software. Now I can't open any Excel files with the shortcut, but need to open Excel first then find the file &amp; open it.</p>
<p>Word files open fine, just not Excel.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Girish<br />
When I try to open an excel file from the file itself, I get an error "There was a problem sending the command to the program".<br />
I ran the Fix-It diagnostic, and verified that the box to "ignore other applications that use DDE" was not checked in Excel Options, but that isn't fixing the problem.<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi Joel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the situation, I'd like to confirm the following information.</p>
<p>1.Check if the issue happens to other users in your organization. You may also move the tasks in another plan to see if the issue only happens to this plan.</p>
<p><span>2.For "</span><span>the task would not move</span><span>", please share a screenshot of the issue symptom to help understand the scenario.</span></p>
<p>3.Confirm whether you access the Office 365 Planner via the app launcher in the
<a href="https://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 portal</a>.</p>
<p><span>4.You may share your account information via </span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list"><span>Private Message</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>to see if we could find any clues from the backend.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t edit Web page Source - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stellab42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t edit Web page Source</h2>
                    I have a web site that I edit by hand coding in Notepad.&nbsp; I view the .html file on my hard drive, click on View and select Source.&nbsp; I can then edit my code and change my web pages, then upload via ftp.&nbsp; That was until today!&nbsp; Now the pages are uneditable.&nbsp;
 The code page now shows up in colours with numbers in the left margin, which didn't happen before.&nbsp; It is not possible to edit the page at all.&nbsp;
<br />
I suspect that this is something to do with the Windows update that was downloaded today.&nbsp; I was able to establish that this was Security Update for JScrit 5-8 for Windows Vista (KB971961)<br />
What can I do to make the source code editable again?&nbsp; This is vital as it is the website of a charity that I manage.<br />
Any help will be welcome.<br />
Thank you<br />

<p>Hi Tang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for writing back to us and we’re sorry for delay response.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue is related to authentication or not, we suggest you follow the steps below and check the result.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p>1. Click on Windows + R&gt; Enter regedit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
2. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER &gt; Software &gt; Microsoft &gt;Office &gt; 16.0 &gt;Common &gt; Identity</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
3. Inside "Identity", create a new <strong>REG_DWORD </strong>(Type) value called "<strong>EnableADAL</strong>" (Name) and leave the value at<strong> 0
</strong>(Data)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Note: Right Click on the mouse&gt; Click New&gt; DWORD (32 bit) value.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p>
4. Restart the PC and try again to login from Office 2016. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
</p>
<p>In addition, as you mentioned you cannot reproduce this problem in new user account of Windows 10, can you confirm whether did you create local user account or Domain Joined user account?</p>

<h2>            All Settings, FBH, weather do not open in build 18219</h2>
                    <p>Having issues with the above not opening up at all. Need 'all settings' to work to get windows updates cause right now cant get at it.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Cheers, and thanks much.</p>
<p>I have now rolled back to 18214 in Skip, but don't want to Skip anymore as it were and go back to regular fast ring for new builds.</p>
<p>Thanks for the hints etc but roll back was the easiest thing to do.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Sync Center Log File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed9213  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Sync Center Log File</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully connected my HTC Touch smartphone to my Windows 7 PC via USB, and performed successful synchronizing sessions.</p>
<p>I had two unsuccessful sync sessions yesterday, so I rebooted the computer and the phone.</p>
<p>The resulting sync took a long time, showed, on the Sync Partnership tab, the progress of the sync, and just before it ended successfully, indicated that there were two unresolved items.&nbsp; The listing of the two unresolved items did not show up anywhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there a log file that lists this data?&nbsp; My search through Event Viewer didn't turn up anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello. Unfortunately not a easy way to find the offending item(s) short of trial and error, e.g. make a new Outlook profile and add items back one by one until the unresolved item is found. See if this KB helps you:</p>

<p>The log files can be found by typing %temp% in a run box. </p>

            <p>Resourceful,</p>
<p>Thanks for the article.&nbsp; Those log files don't show up in the Windows 7 file search, so either they are named differently now or are somewhere where the file search engine doesn't go, like a hidden library or the system folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are right on target, though, with locating the proper log files.&nbsp; Creating a new profile and adding things back one by one (over 400 Outlook Notes, 65 doc, xls, and pdf files, a huge calendar, hundreds of contacts, etc.) I think is out of the question,
 unless I choose to spend my vacation doing that with no promise of a resolution.</p>
<p>If you can help me determine where those log files would be and what they are named, that would be a huge help!&nbsp; I could not locate a log file on the HTC Touch Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional device, and I've not been able to find the log file on the Windows
 7 (64 bit) system.</p>
<p>It's been very aggravating, since sometimes the sync's go perfectly, and others hang up for 12 hours without finishing requiring me to reboot both the phone and PC.</p>
<p>Thanks, again, for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello. I was wondering, since you keep mentioning "Sync Center", if you have ever installed WMDC 6.1&nbsp;64-bit on your system. Sync Center is a built-in&nbsp;part of the Win7 OS but you should install WMDC 6.1 to sync Windows Mobile with Outlook on Win 7. Those
 log files will be made if you have WMDC installed. Don't worry about the older versions of software mentioned in that KB. The PC&nbsp;syncing software has changed over the years from ActiveSync to WMDC&nbsp;but it functions the same and only the user interface has changed.
 You can d/l WMDC from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp6/sync/installing-wmdc.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp6/sync/installing-wmdc.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>I agree that 1 by 1 may be too cumbersome but you can sort through 20 or 30 or any number at a time. Or just&nbsp; sync separate categories like contacts, calendar, files to&nbsp;narrow the search.&nbsp;&nbsp;You just have to find about where the unresolved items are and then
 examine them for any unusual characteristics, i.e.&nbsp;long notes on contacts, entry errors, etc.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Resourceful,</p>
<p>Yes, I am using WMDC.&nbsp; When I first attached the phone, the drivers downloaded and recognized the phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did find some files named 'wcesmgr_20110803_005831.mvu', and similar other ones,&nbsp;in the %Temp% folder you referenced, and can distinguish file names between the "garbage" using Notepad.&nbsp; If I could only organize these file names in some way to see where
 each log stopped (I am guessing these are error-generated logs since there are so few of them compared to the number of times I've sync'd) perhaps that would give me a direction to the crash point.</p>

            <p>Hello. Do you suspect that it is in the Outlook stuff or files you are syncing? You can change your sync options to narrow that, e.g. uncheck "files" in sync options in both WMDC on the PC&nbsp;and AS on the phone. Reboot the PC and soft reset the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
 if the next&nbsp;sync proceeds without problem, the unresolved items must be there. Here's another KB I came across to make sure your phone has sufficient memory resources:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/295001#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/295001#top</a></p>
<p>Cleartemp is a great little utility to investigate that theory:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pocketpcfreeware.com/en/index.php?soft=1489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfreeware.com/en/index.php?soft=1489</a></p>
<p>And make sure you don't have any running programs in the background. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, please backup your critical data, e.g. your .pst file/profile in Outlook on the PC and your PIM info/My Document folder on the phone, prior to changing sync options. Some people get the message that data will be deleted when changing sync options.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup .pst file:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, there really aren't any other USB syncing solutions. There is 3rd party sync software available but they still depend on the WMDC connection. If you want to sync to the cloud, there are options there as well.

            <p>I try to address this when I have the time, and I'm just tired.&nbsp; I bit the bullet and tried to eliminate categories, like unchecking Files in the sync options, and Yes, It Does Erase the Files on the Device.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did reload the Files section and re-sync, and still had the error.&nbsp; The message seems to come during the Notes sync, so I nuked those and reloaded them and still have the message.</p>
<p>This has taken much, too much, of my time.</p>
<p>I'm finished with this type of back-woods troubleshooting.&nbsp; The logs are recorded, as MVU and log files, and since the sync software looks for changes and makes at least a temporary table from which to complete the sync, there is a piece of database software
 or debugger that will load that MVU file and devulge those secrets.</p>
<p>If you can direct me to that kind of software, Thank You!&nbsp; If you can't, this will be just another one of Windows 7's disappointments for me.</p>
<p>Thanks, again for your help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would try this third party software (there is a 14 day trial). it may have a more robust means of dealing with "unresolved" items:</p>

<h2>            Looking for a way to automatically turn my phone volume off on a timer</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to find a way to have different profiles that turn my audio alerts on and off at set times. So for example, I could have my phone automatically turn off all email and text notifications after 10pm so they don't wake me up, then the profile would
 reset in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a software that can do this? I have Windows Mobile 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
