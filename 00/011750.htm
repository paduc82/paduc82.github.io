<h2>            Excel 2013 High CPU usage upon opening file</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am heavily reliant on excel to analyze data recorded from past experiments. I occasionally run into the problem of high CPU usage (&gt;96%) that will cause Excel to crash. Recently, I can no longer open ANY excel spreadsheet file without the excel program
 crashing. A can open a Blank worksheet but cannot open any&nbsp;previously created files of ANY size (e.g. crashed after trying to open 400KB). Norton Internet Security was installed on my computer the day before this problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use theses following guidelines/parameters to work in Excel: avoid too large of files (&gt;15MB) most of the time, limited use of over-complicated formulas, disabled "hardware graphics acceleration", and reduced graphic display of the entire system as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Excel not to crash? What should I be troubleshooting? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My application and system information is below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>Dell XPS 8300 x64-based PC</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz, 3001Mhz, 4 cores, 4 logical processors</p>

<h2>            10130&#58;  Suddenly can&#39;t rearrange tiles in Start menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Exactly what it says on the tin.&nbsp; Recent upgrade to 10130 from 10041, and it worked okay for the first little bit.&nbsp; Then I restarted, and all of my tiles were thrown out of whack, and I couldn't rearrange them, not even after clearing out the Start menu
 entirely and starting from scratch.&nbsp; Any ideas???</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I tried creating another local account, and it had the same symptom.&nbsp; Don't know what's caused it, but it's definitely a Windows-wide issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Brandon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue, as Vinod said, is due to corrupted/missing system files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would, as of now, suggest you to run System File Checker tool which is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></p>
<p>Type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>: </p>
<p>
</p><div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command will scan all protected system files, and replace corrupted files with a cached copy that is located in a compressed folder at
<var>%WinDir%</var>\System32\dllcache. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
        </p>

    <title>Windows mobile 10 Restore &#39;Can&#39;t Connect&#39; error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jnelso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows mobile 10 Restore &#39;Can&#39;t Connect&#39; error</h2>
                    <p>I'm consistently getting 'Can't Connect We're having trouble connecting to a network ...' error message when trying to Restore Windows Mobile 10 on a brand new Lumia 650 from a previous 650 which was dunked. Needless to say, my Wifi reception is fine, right
 next to router, and showing full bars.</p>
<p>This happens immediately after verifying MS Account sign-in and at 21% in restore process.</p>
<p>I've tried resetting phone and rerunning without SIM and SD cards, but still the same problem.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message says that it could be some 'problem at the other end' but, that's presumably OneDrive and is&nbsp;under&nbsp; Microsoft control, not mine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there doesn't seem to be any other way of doing the restore later on, except during phone initialisation process? Unless anyone knows how to do this ?</p>

            <p>This is not related to connectivity. I have purchased Lumia 950 XL and, when trying to restore settings from a backup made on Lumia 640, I get this:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can't connect</p>
<p>We're having trouble connecting to the service. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tap Don't restore, you won't be given an option to restore your backup later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[ Don't restore] [ Try again]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needles to say, I'm writing this post on Lumia 640 whilst seeing this message on Lumia 950 XL; at same time my TV and PC download files and stream casted video without experiencing any connectivity issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this error message is a result of an incorrect error code handling in Windows Mobile 10 Setup. It could be, this error indicates that selected backup copy is incompatible with the target phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems that if the backup copy was created on an old phone such as Lumia 640, you won't be able to restore its settings on Lumia X5X phones (650, 950, 950 XL).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thus, if you want to migrate from an&nbsp;old phone, even though it runs Windows Mobile 10, to a new phone that runs Windows Mobiles 10 out of the box, you have to forget about your old settings and favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointing for me as an advocate for the decaying Windows Mobile platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my friends were insisting that I buy an iPhone or a Google Pixel, but I have chosen Windows phone just for the sake of retaining Windows experience and being able to access the same favorites, settings on all my devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that my favorites are gone and Edge doesn't sync them on Lumia 950 XL, and I can't restore my settings as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft, please have respect for your customer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way, has anyone at Microsoft ever tried to write anything here by using their Windows Mobile 10 phone? This is simply mad, the entry point jumps in the edit box like a mad rabbit. The text you type is entered with huge delay. Last time I've seen such
 delays when typing was on a 16 MHz machine 25 years ago when I was a child. Thanks for bringing the nostalgia.</p>

<p>Your customer wants to restore his settings and favorites. Why are you recommending&nbsp;him to reflash his BRAND NEW phone with WDRT? What does reflashing have to do with restoring user settings from an old phone? In a single word, nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please, read the original post again. It says, connectivity is fine, router is fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>II can confirm this and second the original post as connectivity has nothing to do with being not able to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if Microsoft does insist this is caused by connectivity issues, please specify the URI of the service endpoint so that we could check connection to this service.</p>

            <p>The case you reported with different phone types being incompatible doesn't apply to me, since the backup and restore happened on exactly the same sort of phone (nokia 650).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even more puzzling, is that when&nbsp;I&nbsp; got the first 650,&nbsp;I did the restore from an earlier 8.1 Nokia 625, and that worked perfectly, restoring all app data etc. But it won't work now on another 650 with phone that's an identical model!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agree on the WDRT seeming to be irrelevant, but thought I'd try it just in case there was some strange comms firmware glitch, but as expected, it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why cant Msft get the basics right ! Also have the problem with incomplete restoring of SMS messages, but managed to find a workaround for that using Contacts and Message Backup app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About to give up finally on Win Mobile 10 altogether :(</p>

            <p>The reason I advised you to use the Windows Device Recovery Tool is because you already mentioned that you already performed a reset. I added the restarting of your Internet router to refresh you connection as there are times when the issue is with the Internet
 Service Provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting your computer is indeed irrelevant. I apologize for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using a different Internet connection to restore your back up?</p>

            <p>I'm getting the same thing.<br />
<br />
I broke my Lumia 650 and got another 650 and exactly the same thing is happening to me.&nbsp; I'm trying to restore a back up from the 19th (yesterday)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with the SIM in and out,</p>
<p>I've updated the OS to the latest,</p>
<p>I've tried on several WiFi,</p>
<p>I've tried via mobile data</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a factory reset and restore about a dozen times and the same happens each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 21% it errors&nbsp;Can't Connect.<br />
<br />
It can connect as it signed me in and listed my restore points.</p>
<p>If I cancel the restore I know its connected as it starts downloading app updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this is not a connection error more an issue with the actual backup or backup server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I got another MS phone was I could keep my data, if I can't restore it I may as well return the phone and look for something else.</p>

            <p>Right, so not just me then. And nothing to do with using a different ISP as per last recommendation from learned source&nbsp;in the thread above - I didn't even bother to attempt that!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, how did you manage to update to the latest OS, given that the restore process happens before the phone is fully operational?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've long given up and rebuilt the phone from scratch, and given up all hope of restoring config and application data. My wife (it's her phone) is not impressed :( I'm almost at the end of my tether in&nbsp;my commitment&nbsp;to steer her away from Android/iPhones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like this problem might be quite easy to replicate. How about someone trying to do that - anyone from Microsoft ????</p>

            <p>To get the latest software installed, during the factory reset setup process, when asked to sign in I selected skip or I'll do this later, which sets up the phone with a local profile.</p>
<p>Once the setup was done &nbsp;I&nbsp;went to settings and then ran the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ran the update again without the SIM card in and got to the part to type the verification code, I got that emailed to me, I entered it and it was accepted and then I instantly got the error again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This cannot be an isolated incident. I bet all the people with this issue are getting it at 21% install.</p>

            <p>This problem is not isolated to Windows mobile 10. I have a Lumia 925 running Windows Phone 8.1. It was giving me problems so I decided to reset it. After choosing which backup to restore from, it freezes at 21% and I get the error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Can't connect</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">We're having trouble connecting to the service. Make sure you have good reception. If you do, the problem may be on the other end. Wait a little while and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">If you tap Don't restore, you won't be given an option to restore your backup later.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"don't restore" "try again"</p>
<p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the flow is exactly as described on <a href="http://intunedin.net/2014/08/restoring-your-windows-phone-8-1-after-a-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this web page</a>, but after getting to the "Restoring 21%" page that tutorial says it should bring up a "Verify your identity" page for multi-factor authentication. That does not come up for me though; instead it just displays the error message I posted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting this error for the past few days each time I try resetting my phone again. I have only ever had this Windows Phone; I am not trying to migrate a backup from a different Windows Phone onto this one or anything unusual like that. I have
 tried connecting from 3 different networks (my home, work, and a friend's house), so it is definitely not a network issue; as well, it is able to sign me in and find my previous backup, so it definitely does have an internet connection. The error message even
 says "the problem may be on the other end", i.e. it's Microsoft's issue, not the phone our my network's issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems this problem was only reported recently and is affecting many people. My guess is that the phone reaches out to a URL to launch the multi-factor authentication step, but Microsoft recently accidentally removed/moved the URL that the phone is reaching
 out to. The solution is likely that Microsoft needs to reinstate the URL that the phone tries to connect to. It is unfortunate that the phone itself does not tell us which URL it is trying to reach.</p>

<p>I recently brought a new nokia e52 and wantd 2 hear its music quality. I inserted my headphones pin in the jack only half not knowing that it should be fully inserted. I started playing a song but was unable 2 hear anything and it restarted automatically.
 I tried inserting it fully but it didnt work out until my brother showed me. I did this thrice and the phone restarted thrice. Now it goes fully into the jack. So is there a problem with my phone or is it normal coz now i can insert it fully and listen 2 my
 music clearly. Plz help, im quite worried,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, URGENT HELP SHALL BE HEARTFULLY APRECIATED,</p>

    <title>Copying text FROM OneNote TO another application resulted in an IMAGE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yt.8019  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying text FROM OneNote TO another application resulted in an IMAGE and not text.</h2>
                    <p>This has been asked before and is still a problem in OneNote 2016 and OneNote (Win10). If you copy some plain text from OneNote to another application (for example, WeChat Messenger or LINE Messenger, the two most popular instant messengers in Asia) the
 text becomes an image of the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly wrong. And some answers in the forum seem to suggest it's other applications' fault when handling OneNote's clipboard data. However, there is NOT a problem when copying from Word or Excel or PowerPoint or Evernote or any other major productivity
 application, only OneNote has this problem. Therefore every time you paste something from OneNote to other applications, you need to paste the text into Notepad first, then copy again from Notepad then paste into the other application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CTRL-C to copy OneNote text:<br />
</p>

<p>The problem is not limited to messaging application but seems to affect any app that takes rich text input. Any way we could ask Microsoft to look into this and correct it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I dare to disagree.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clipboard</strong></p>
<p>The clipboard is used to transfer data between applications that DON'T use or understand the same formats. The source application adds data to the clipboard in the formats it understands. It's the source's responsibility to put as much data in the clipboard
 as possible to ensure the content can be reproduced on the other end.</p>
<p>Target applications request the clipboard data in the format they understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example for a Clipboard content by Word:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75d4877e-5090-44e2-a94e-d1ba4e2409ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75d4877e-5090-44e2-a94e-d1ba4e2409ac?upload=true" /></a></p>

</p><p><strong>Example for a Clipboard content by OneNote:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65eceaa5-b856-48e2-943a-89845371a023?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65eceaa5-b856-48e2-943a-89845371a023?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Two differences worthwile to mention:</p>
<p>OneNote creates some versions of the Bitmap type.</p>
<p>OneNote doesn't create Rich Text Format, which is IMO the hidden reason for your problem.</p>
<p>BUT Word and OneNote both create the simple Text format.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;MS Office doesn't use Rich Text Format as its standard, it uses HTML (which is produced by OneNote too).</p>
<p>You can see this by using Paste Special in Word.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;a text paste from OneNote to Word works.</p>
<p>So it looks like your messengers should request just&nbsp;Text (or HTML)&nbsp;instead of requesting Rich Text Format.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Error 554 5.7.1</h2>
                    <p>I have just started using Outlook 2013. I have no problem receiving emails, however when I try to send from outlook I get the following error return:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Server error: '554 5.7.1 &lt;email redacted</font><font color="#000000">&gt;: Recipient address rejected: Access denied'</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I have no issue sending emails from my iPhone or the web based mail client, or from Windows Live Mail I was using before I switched to Outlook 2013.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Does anyone have any suggestions? There is virtually no info on the web.</font></span></p>

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the links to the other articles - they helped me find the solution!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Answer - I had to tick 'My outgoing server (SMTP) required authentication'</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am using a POP3 account. I also have no experience of setting email accounts up which explains the errors!</div>

    <title>Cannot turn on Media Streaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian.d.willett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot turn on Media Streaming</h2>
                    <p>When creating and joining a HomeGroup, when finishing and selecting "Allow all devices on this network such as TVs and game consoles to play mt saved content." Selecting that brings you to the "Turn on Media Streaming" button. When attempting to turn on
 Media Streaming I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Media Streaming is not turned on</strong></p>
<p>Windows media player network sharing service or a service that it depends on failed to start. Use Windows Services Administrative tool to find out more specific details about the Network Sharing Service and it's dependencies.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Windows Services Administrative Tool</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select that and run it, it brings up the Services program. When&nbsp;WMPNetworkSvc is selected and the option to Start the service is attempted, it fails and provides this, "Windows could not start the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service service
 on Local Computer.</p>
<p>Error 1068: The Dependency service or group failed to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been researching this via Windows Support and Google for the last 5 hours to no avail. I have literally tried hundreds of suggections and "fixes" and have made n o progress whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10</p>
<p>Version 1069 (OS Build 16299.248)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fix for this would be fabulous. I am unable to stream media to other devices or to share any media folders .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> stevecody  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with PDF formatting with Save As PDF</h2>
                    <p>In the most recent update of OneNote for Mac, 15.2, the Save as PDF option produces a PDF with formatting problems if the page width is wider that 8.5".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the Notebook section is too wide, the PDF cuts off the right portion of the document and gives it it's own page, similar to a wide Excel file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no ruler view option to know where a normal 8.5" border will be.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem running OneNote 15.4. Saving as PDF breaks down the file in many ways (empty pages and text out of the printing area to name it). A quick fix is to adjust (minimise) the width of the text area.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I hope this will be fixed soon. Really annoying.</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Alcatel Idol 4S Data</h2>
                    <p>HI!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm delighted with my Alcatel Idol 4s generally, but when I'm out and about, people all around me are reading their email and facebook posts, while I'm getting nothing more than the occasional "no internet" banner. Data is supposed to be turned on when Wifi
 reception is poor/non-existent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what's the problem and what -- if anything -- can I do? Thanks in advance!</p>

If your data doesn't turn on automatically, you can resolve the issue by turning it on manually. Please swipe down from the top of your phone's screen, then select
<strong>Expand</strong> &gt; <strong>Cellular </strong>data. If the data won't connect, soft resetting your phone by pressing and holding the
<strong>Power</strong> + <strong>Volume down</strong> buttons for ten to fifteen seconds or until you feel a vibration may resolve the issue. This is safe to attempt and will not remove anything on your phone. After your phone restarts, enable the
<strong>Cellular data</strong>, and you should connect to the Internet.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you may help make Windows 10 Mobile become better by submitting a feedback or feature request using the Feedback Hub app. This app can be accessed via the App list menu or by pressing and holding the
<strong>Power</strong> + <strong>Volume down</strong> buttons for two to three seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.

<p>We appreciate you getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you no longer see <strong>Expand</strong>, it only means that the <strong>Action Center</strong> is already expanded. Selecting
<strong>Collapse</strong> will hide most of the Action Center quick command tiles, and you will see the
<strong>Expand</strong>. If you cannot connect to the Internet when the Cellular/Mobile data is enabled, toggling it
<strong>Off</strong> and <strong>On</strong> may resolve the issue. You may also perform the soft reset button combination, mentioned in my previous response to resolve the issue.<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To clarify the issue, I’d like you to confirm and provide the following.</span></span></p>
<span><span>1. About “</span></span><span>When using Excel Online, it appears that the review ribbon
 is missing commands.&nbsp;“, could you provide us with some related screenshots?</span><span><br />
2. If you want to use the Track Changes feature in Excel Online, it isn’t feasible now as Excel Online is different from the Excel client and some features in the Excel client may not be available in Excel Online. I suggest you vote

here</a> as it is the direct way for product developers to know users’ requirements.</span>

<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span></p>

<h2>            Host Processes for Windows Tasks trying to access a malicious link</h2>
                    <p><span>Host Processes for Windows Services is trying to access some malicious link.
<br />
My anti-virus is blocking it, but it is constantly trying to access it. It started when I downloaded a fake application which I deleted yesterday. My anti-virus had blocked it off, but I think my windows is infected. What should I do?
<br />
<br />
I use Kaspersky Internet Security.</span></p>
<p>I did scan the application called taskhostw.exe but no threats were found. I also did an sfc/scanfile on it and it did not find any violations too.</p>

</p><p><span>I suggest you to use Windows Defender Offline in Safe mode and remove the virus and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows Defender Offline is a stand-alone tool that comes pre-loaded with the latest anti-malware updates. It works outside of Windows, which means it can catch and clean infections that hide themselves when Windows is running.</em></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Go to another PC that isn’t infected and download </em><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Defender Offline</span></a>.</em></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>Insert a blank USB flash drive or CD into the PC, and then run the Windows Defender Offline file that you just downloaded.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>You will be prompted to install Windows Defender Offline to the blank USB flash drive or CD.</em></p>
</li><li>
<p><em>After you’ve installed Windows Defender Offline onto the USB flash drive or CD, insert it into your infected PC and
<strong>restart in </strong><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong>. You will be prompted to start the Windows Defender Offline tool.</em></p>

<h2>            Word &#38; Excel do not work on office 2013 Prof using Windows 8 on Dell all-in-one touch screen</h2>
                    <p>Having bought a new PC with Windows 8, I installed the Office 2013 Professional.&nbsp; All Microsoft programs work except Word and Excel. A message box pops up immediately saying "Microsoft word/Excel has stopped working.&nbsp; A problem cause the program to stop
 working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you&nbsp; if a solution is available".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no way of working on or retrieving documents and I am tearing my hair out. I uninstalled and re-installed a completely new Office 2013 and it did the same thing so there is something in the system I guess that is stopping it fro working.&nbsp; Please bear
 in mind this PC is brand new so I don't understand why there would be problems with it.&nbsp; I am very unfamiliar with Windows 8 and finding my way around it so this also makes it even more frustrating for me.&nbsp; Can someone please please help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Disable prompt to Save changes to a file in PowerPoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I use a 3rd part component (EDraw Office Viewer) to open and display PowerPoint files. This has been fine until PowerPoint 2013 appeared.</p>
<p>With PowerPoint 2013, every time the PowerPoint presentation is displayed, it has a ""Want to save your changes to filename.pptx" message.</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable this "save" prompt?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Further to my previous post, I have been performing some testing and&nbsp;I have identified that there is a problem with gmail displaying the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It prompted me to Display the message instead of just sending it because I wanted to ensure that the image was in the email before it sent. Having done this and then sent, it worked and the image was visible in the gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I inserted a .Display line before the send and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.To = toMail<br />
.cc = Sheet2.Cells(i, "I").Value</p>
<p>.Subject = Sheet1.Range("b2").Value<br />
&nbsp;.HTMLBody = "&lt;body&gt;Dear Sir/Madam," &amp; "&lt;img src=" &amp; "'" &amp; pPath &amp; "'/&gt; Regards,LearnExcelMacro.com &lt;/body&gt;"</p>
<p>.Display</p>
<p>.Send<br />
End With</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that it might be that the Send is too fast for the image to display in Outlook mail before it was sending so I inserted a Wait command before the send but to no avail.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Usage limit exceeded. try again tomorrow.&#34; when try to send a verification code in text message to my smartphone.</h2>
                    <p>(My email addresses are expressed in the form of <strong>accountname_AT_outlook.com</strong>,&nbsp;otherwise if I use "@" the email addresses will be masked by the forum like
<strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong>.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first Microsoft account is chr********206_AT_outlook.com. Created a few months ago. When creating this account, I input my smartphone number +886965****97.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently within 7 days: I created account e71******85e_AT_outlook.com, input the same smartphone number; and then I created account pi1******536_AT_outlook.com, also input the same smartphone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can normally sign in chr********206_AT_outlook.com and pi1******536_AT_outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I tried to sign in e71******85e_AT_outlook.com, I got this message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1c41698-778f-4b0a-b520-b5f26a8a4f89" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1c41698-778f-4b0a-b520-b5f26a8a4f89" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed "Continue", input the same smartphone number, tried to send a verification code in text message to my smartphone. Unfortunately I got this message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75847cc1-9b57-44ae-96f1-657982065465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75847cc1-9b57-44ae-96f1-657982065465" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Usage limit exceeded. try again tomorrow." I tried to sign in e71******85e_AT_outlook.com several times, the results are the same. Although I have never send out any email by this account e71******85e_AT_outlook.com,&nbsp;I still cannot sign in. This account
 is created within 7 days, I doubt there was someone else used this account sending out junk messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could any friend or any expert help me solve this problem and successfully sing in to e71******85e_AT_outlook.com? Thank you in advance!<br />

<p>I suspect that this is due to using multiple Microsoft accounts with the same phone number or on the same IP address. (I guess this is to prevent spammers and for security). I noticed getting this block in a corporate environment when there's many users
 sharing the same IP accessing their accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching the forum for fixes and found that browsing using "<em><strong>InPrivate</strong></em>" fixed the issue for some people. For others, it's just waiting until the system lets you verify again.</p>

            Ask hp or on an hp oriented forum. This forum here ia for Microsoft-made phones and related software. Additionally, if you actually want help on that,at least tell people the actual model number. HP makes hundreds of different models.

                    We are Running M$ office 2011 for mac with the latest updates on Mac OS X 10.7.5+ with 8GB+ of RAM. The issue that we are experiencing is on a spread sheet that has been filtered down hiding Approx. 1000 lines, when applying any border styling that effects
 more than one boarder per apply Excel apples the operation and the proceeds to hang using 100% CPU and ~1GB of Real Memory. Any thoughts on a solution to this would be appreciated.<br />

            Do you see this behaviour only with this spreadsheet??<br />
<br />
What is the size of the excel file? <br />
<br />
If this behavior is with all the excel files then try<b> Step 2</b>:<br />

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Which files are the ones you are trying to upload Microsoft Word, Excel? Any particular program? Does one program work and another doesn’t?&nbsp;</span></em><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Mostly Excel but I just
 tried a word document as well to upload it to the&nbsp;folder and it did not work either.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">We have tried multiple folders and everyone seems to be having the same issue with not being able to check in/out documents or upload.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>So I'm unable to access check out and check in as an admin with SharePoint. I'm unsure how to fix this issue with Administrative access.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What can I do to make it so that we all can have check in and check out abilities in SharePoint?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams Desktop on Mac not starting - Scenario.Status&#58; timeout</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Sep 24, 2018 I successfully used Microsoft Teams Desktop on my Mac, it loaded smothly. Altough I have upgraded neither Mac OS (still in 10.13.6) nor Teams Desktop, today Sep 25 I cannot load Teams desktop anymore. The loading window with the message "Hold
 tight! We're getting you connected" keeps displaying the same message for about 10 minutes and there is no progress apart from the following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tue Sep 25 2018 21:59:21 GMT+0200 (CEST) &lt;334&gt; -- event -- status: timeout, scenario: 86c1b173-6d0d-4ac5-a52a-3ff23c474c9f, scenarioName: desktop_mac_sso_guest, name: desktop_mac_sso_guest, step: stop, sequence: 4, delta: 599994, scenarioDelta: 599994, elapsed:
 609510, Scenario.Name: desktop_mac_sso_guest, Scenario.Step: stop, Scenario.Status: timeout, &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling completely and reinstalling Microsoft Teams Desktop, but I still have the same issue. This is not a network problem because it happens on two different network, office and home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the solution ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Nicolas</p>

<p>Hi Nicolas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know what's the type of your account? If you sign in Teams desktop as a guest user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to sign in to Teams web app (<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://teams.microsoft.com/</a>) to check the outcome. If you still cannot sign in, the issue may be related to your account. I need to collect
 your account for further checking in Private Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can sign into web version, but cannot start Teams desktop, please try following to delete the&nbsp;settings, cookies, caches are stored:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Click <strong>Go</strong> &gt; <strong>Go To Folder</strong> &gt; Type in: <strong>~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then delete the Teams folder there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please help us to reproduce the issue and then collect the logs located in&nbsp;<strong>~\Library\Application Support\Microsoft\Teams\logs.txt</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before reproducing the issue, you should delete the previous logs and then reproduce the issue. After issue reproduced, collect the new logs there and send it to us in Private Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent you a private message to collect those information, you can click your profile and the click
<strong>View private messages</strong> to check it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, please also provide us the screenshots of the error messages you got when you start Teams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
