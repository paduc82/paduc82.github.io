<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Project, we can connect to SharePoint Online, Public a Project to SharePoint, sync with SharePoint tasks list and so on.</p>
<p>We can also export Project reports, timelines, ot data to other Office programs, and take advantage of the sharing feature that lets you join online meetings and share your Office files from any supported device.</p>
<p>For the details, see <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sync-with-a-SharePoint-tasks-list-fb956d2c-723d-4d5a-b7e5-710ef82aa27a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Non-Nokia phones and OviStore</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone! I want to congratulate the people who worked hard for ovi store release. I know it will be a success in the future if planned correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the near future, can non-nokia symbian based phones be compatible with ovi store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I and other people would greatly appreciated compatibility for samsung, lg and other symbian phone&nbsp; brands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I soon will purchased a phone with similar N97 specs <em>(hd) </em>and would loved to used ovi-store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advantages of supporting non nokia phones in Ovi store includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater market audience - more revenue</li><li>Greater developer offerings&nbsp; - (more appz) more revenue</li><li>Secured future growth for release of next symbian phones</li><li>Symbian OS more appealing to phone manufacturers (vs other phone OS)- more adoption more revenue</li></ul>
<br />
<p>There are many more reasons to support non nokia phones in ovi store, but in general, its what Nokia and Symbian needs to solidify their possition in the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>It's not nokia's decision about making the store available to other symbian based handsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure samsung would not be happy if nokia made the app store compatible with samsungs as they prepare their own store for launch.&nbsp; It would result in a very nasty legal battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way that the ovi store will ever appear on other manufacturers devices is if those manufacturers approach nokia and ask for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically if you want the ovi store then you have to buy a nokia, not a samsung.</p>

<p>Are you sure that's right, Psycho? Certainly a number of Java-based products that might be offeredwould be compatible with other brands, and even in the world of Symbian apps there is room for cross-platform apps to be offered because Nokia will not be providing
 all of the content directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>N-Gage is one of the things merging into Ovi Store, and that is certainly Nokia-specific, but also Widsets is going to be part of it, as is MOSH - the latter was a rather open arena where anybody could publish stuff, but even though Ovi Store will be more
 selective about the content it accepts, it is entirely possible that apps for Nokia and Samsung S60 models could be offered by third parties.</p>

<p>Not 100% sure but using common sense can you really imagine that other manufacturers will allow nokia's store to be available on their phones?&nbsp; Not sure about LG but Samsung and Sony Ericsson are both working on app stores for use on their devices.&nbsp; Do you
 really think they would be willing to let users use a rival manufacturers store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure someone will find a "hack" that will let the store run on other compatible devices but i'll be surprised if anything official happens.</p>

brighthand</a> which reported that ovi stored will be released for symbian s40 and s60 devices eventually.&nbsp; Also symbian is owned entirely by Nokia which can mean they can offer apps to symbian as they owned the os, they just grant licenses to other manufacturers.
 Also maybe&nbsp; Symbian based phones owners may choose the store they wish to purchase apps (be ovi store or other store) and not locked to a specific store which is entirely legal (because there is no blocking in competition content).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up to this point no official announcement has been made by nokia.</p>

            All you can do then is wait and hope that those other manufacturers choose to use or license the ovi store on their symbian based devices. It is their decision, not nokia's so don't hold your breath.

<p>Widsets was always offered as cross-platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, from a commercial point of view, it might benefit all manufacturers that have such a store. It could encourage more content providers to take part if they are able to offer a wider range of apps in one place, the competition for the stores is to provide
 the best environment to encourage content providers to choose them over another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although seems logical to lock people into your own service, by offering more choice to the consumer you make them more likely to choose your product before they even consider buying the add-ons. You'll note that most of the places where you can buy a mobile
 phone don't offer just a single brand. The real key to commercial success is the customer's freedom to choose, not by trying to dominate the customer's use of additional products and services, this would be a turn-off for many people.</p>

<p>Widsets was always designed to be cross platform and free so that isn't relevant to this topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are talking about an actual store here that nokia runs and gets the profits from, that is why other manufacturers will not want nokia to offer the store to it's customers without it's permission. It will take money away from their own stores, along with
 promoting nokia on their handsets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an ideal world it would be nice to choose the app store that we shop at but can you honestly see manufacturers like samsung allowing it when they are about to open their own store?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could debate this all day as to whether the common sense approach will be taken or not but the fact remains that it's other manufacturers decisions to allow the ovi store, not nokia's. Nokia cannot force other makers to use the ovi store in the symbian
 OS, if they did it is obvious that those manufacturers would abandon symbian.&nbsp; If you remember in the past microsoft tried to force manufacturers to use it's apps and services, that resulted in a massive fine.</p>

            <p>The retailer should never sell a phone in demo mode.<br />
However, you may be able to reset it to normal mode yourself:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Settings &gt; About and scroll to the bottom of the screen, then tap Update demo phone.</p>
<p>2. Next, tilt the phone in the following directions:</p>
<p>a. Tilt the phone to the left. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in landscape.<br />
b. Tilt the phone upright. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in portrait.<br />
c. Tilt the phone to the right. Give the phone a second or two to redraw in landscape.<br />
d. Tilt the phone upright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice the text in the dialog changes from confirming an update to confirming a reset. Resetting a demo phone removes all of the demo content and apps and restores factory settings. To continue, tap Yes.</p>

<h2>            contacts sync issue between outlook on exchange and windows phone</h2>
                    I have a Nokia Lumia 930 windows phone running 8.1 for work, I have recently started experiencing an issue where I receive phone calls, texts or emails from people that show to be from another contact, on checking the contact on the phone it appears multiple
 contacts have merged together?? On my desktop outlook contacts using Microsoft exchange the contacts are separate and correct so I assume it is during auto-sync that this is occurring. I have checked with colleagues and found at least one other experiencing
 the same thing. Is this a known issue and how can it be corrected?

            I have a similar issue to Triconman which started a couple of days ago on my&nbsp;Lumia 930 Windows 10 phone (and Win 10&nbsp;laptop). Some contacts and text message threads disappeared,&nbsp;and&nbsp;some contacts linked/merged themselves. "People" in Outlook.com show the
 same errors. on my laptop.<br />
<br />
I can't see what this has to do with Office 365 so do you have any other ideas, Cristal?

            <p>Thanks Cristal, however I do not use O365 currently and no doubt won't get any support as a result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 3 corporate organisations in the chain between my work MS exchange server and my Windows phone. EE the mobile network operator, Mobile Iron cloud security and Microsoft as the phone OS. As you can imagine, the effort required trying to get much
 sense or assistance out of any of them three will need to be herculean, we will probably be on Windows 12 before a resolution was found.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just hoping this issue was already known and the community could have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the email account on the phone and set back up but get the same result, only solution will be to manually check and adjust all the individual entries but not sure if that will stop it re-occurring.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technology was developed to save the world time on daily tasks, all we seem to do nowadays is resolve issues.

<h3> droc92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 account&#58; &#34;Something went wrong.&#34; and &#34;Sorry, we can&#39;t get that information right now. Please try again later. If the problem continues, contact your helpdesk.&#34; error</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Outlook.com student account: "Something went wrong."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a student, and my college uses Outlook.com for student and administrative email. Lately, a lot of curriculum has been moved online, and these email accounts are now essential for communication and getting work done. I have a HUGE problem concerning my
 email account; it's a big problem because I can't find information about it, and I'm furious at my school's IT department's dismissal of the issue. I'm turning to Microsoft support as a last resort.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log into my student email account, I am unable to view my email. Instead, I'm greeted by a page with a huge frowning emoticon and the words: "Something went wrong"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Underneath, it says: "Sorry, we can't get that information right now. Please try again later. If the problem continues, contact your helpdesk."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">have</span> contacted my school's helpdesk, and after a half hour on the phone, I&nbsp; wound up changing my password. This resolved the issue immediately afterwards, but the very next time after that when I logged in,
 the same exact issue resurfaced. After basically begging them for help a second time, they replied to me
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">days later</span> with a one-line email that told me that I had a virus, and offered no further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running an MSE full scan right now after having updated the definitions, but I do this about once a week, and I kind of doubt that a virus is the problem, or that if it is the problem, MSE will be able to catch it. I'm not in a financial position to
 purchase questionable, $50, 3rd party security software; I think MSE works well enough, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the "more details" tab underneath the error message (on outlook.com), I get this information:</p>
<p>
</p><pre><p>X-ClientId: JEYG - ZXEK - ESYS - KWKSXLVG

X-FEServer: BLUPR08CA001
X-BEServer: null
Date: 8/26/2014 6:49:50 PM</p><p /><p>Can anyone tell me what this indicates?</p><p /><p>I'd really, really appreciate any help anyone can give me. I have loads of work that can't get done because of this, and I'm at my wit's end.</p><p /></pre>

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. I understand your trouble accessing your account via Firefox but I'm still glad that you can access it via Internet Explorer.</p>

<h2>            How do I permanently set the tabs default from .5&#34; to .25&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    Office 2004 Student Edition<br />
Word v 11.5.5<br />
iBook G4<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
I've been trying to get tabs to permanently default to .25" so that every time I start a new document I don't have to go to Paragraph&gt;Tabs to reset from .5 to .25".<br />
<br />
I've looked around in Word Help and in another discussion group and found two suggestions, both from Beth Rosengard.
<br />
<br />
1. Go to Normal template and change it there, or <br />
2. Change it using Styles working from the formatting palette. <br />
<br />
I haven't been able to make either of those two work. I believe I followed the instructions for both methods, but when I went back and opened a new Word doc, .5" remained the default. Do I need to quit and restart Word? Do I need to restart my computer?<br />
<br />
Could someone please tell me how to implement these suggestions, or suggest alternatives to help me to get my new default in place and working?<br />
<br />
In addition, I attempted, in the Formatting Palette, to set a keystroke for this Style. I don't know much about Styles. Would you please explain how a keystroke would be used in the case of a new document that was defaulted for I gues what would be considered
 to be a non-standard Tab default?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            I believe this : "<i>In My Templates' I have..:</i>" is your problem. What you have there must be a copy or previously moved Normal - or perhaps it was created by a previous effort to make a new Normal using Save As. Whatever, that
<i>isn't</i> the Normal you need to modify.<br />
<br />
The 'live' Normal is located in <b><i>username</i>:Documents:Microsoft User Data</b><br />
<br />
Open that one, follow my steps &amp; you then should have what you want. There is no need to do any of the actions you asked about.<br />
<br />
"AFAIK" = As Far As I Know<br />

                    <p>Hallo</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a kinda funny case here.</p>
<p>I'm trying to help one of my users, getting files attach to an mail when using OWA.</p>
<p>When we try to attach a file, it just keeps loading, and never gets done.</p>
<p>We are using files like Docx and xlsx, on 11KB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the user is doing the same thing on another pc, there is nothing.</p>
<p>It gets attached, and it works like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He's labtop just got reinstalled the other day because of this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i'm kinda hoping someone in here, can help with some troubleshooting&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS:Win7</p>
<p>Browser: IE11.0.51 &amp; Chrome 65.0.3325.146</p>

<p>Just found out that the issue is the new update of IE11 (v. 11.0.51)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just can't update the screen..</p>
<p>or what you can call it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soo the work around that i found out is this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>create a new mail &gt; start attaching&nbsp;the file &gt; give it 5 sek (Depending on the size) &gt; close the tap (The one with OWA) &gt; Start the OWA up again &gt; go to Drafts and then you can send the mail with the attachment...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i would say, if it possible to use either Firefox or Opera.</p>
<p>Then do that in sted of the work around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I click on suggested sites I get the turn on suggested sites button no problem, but when I turn it ON, I always get just a blank page? I installed IE 8 on another computer on same network, and it works perfectly. I would like to see and use suggeted
 sites, but wont let me enter a web address, or show anything. When I DO mess with the address bar and try to enter an address it apprears to get caught in some kind of loop. But it will not dispaly anything. I have also tried turning off firewall, and virrus
 software with no new results.</p>

            I am having&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;problem.<br />
<br />
When clicked the Suggested Sites button displays the message:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Suggested sites is not working properly on this PC account."&nbsp; <br />
The instructions direct toward a Suggested sites option in the Tools menu, but there is no "Suggested Sites" option in that dropdown menu.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried running the version of IE8 without add-ons found in the Accessories/System Tools folder and found the same error message.

<h3> vb1111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why won&#39;t my MS Word for Mac print on envelopes&#63; Using Epson WF 3640</h2>
                    <p>After 4 hours on the phone with Epson, they concluded the printing issue I am having is not with the printer, but with my application - Word 2016 for Mac. I am using El Capitan. I'm pretty sure my software is not outdated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why I cannot print out envelopes, when I used to be able to. I have tried using Cassette 1 and the rear feeder, neither works. The rear feeder won't print at all. Cassette 1 will pull the envelope through but not print the recipient address,
 only the sender, and even that is not in the upper left corner, but more toward the middle of the left side of the envelope. Help!</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to  menu &gt; Preferences&nbsp;&gt; Printers and Scanners.<br />
</li><li>Open and locate version information for the Print Drive<br />

<br />
</li><li>Now add the Driver Back and make it the default Printer. Close Printers and scanners one last time.</li></ul>
<p>Now try to setup and Print envelope <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Both in 2011 and 2016. Note that Mail Merge Manager who is responsible for printing envelopes Uses a Separate Page Setup "program." It is there that you establish appropriate Page size or&nbsp;envelope

            Thanks, Phillip. They actually had me install a new driver. It's because of that that they insist the problem lies with Word. MS Word wanted to charge me $99 for help. I think that's a bit much. Pretty sure this issue can be resolved without being taken
 for a ride.

</p><p>Goto control panel, region and languages, formats ... first day of week. WeekdayName is using this setting.</p>

<br />
<br />
For example, if the sender sent the email using the Outlook.com User Interface and the recipient is a Gmail account, the recipient may not be able to view the sender’s picture in the email because in Gmail, users have the option to add a picture for their contacts.
 The picture in the email will only appear in the sender’s Outlook User Interface and if the recipient is also a Microsoft account with Outlook.com User Interface.</span></p>

            What do you have as Zoom level. <br />
<br />
On my 17" Macbook Pro I have template created that is 292&amp; for Portrait. and 229 for Landscape. This files the screen with just one page (Sheet). If its 100% I see about 8-10 sheets at one time but it unreadable.<br />
<br />
IF your going to use preset set to 200% or start at 200% then in increments of 10% change (210,220,230, etc.) until you get to0 large the reduce by 1% until fits just right. the save the blank page as a template. Repeat for landscape. Then open from the template.
 and it will always be set.<br />
<br />
I start up from The templates menu so I can use my custom sizes.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 still tries to log me in to an old office365 account and I can&#39;t remove it</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a personal BYOD windows 10 machine that was using a work office 365account, for example oldcompany.com</p>
<p>Then we were acquired and our company name changed. This means that all the accounts in oldcompany.com were migrated to another office365 tenant newcompany.com.</p>
<p>Everything works fine apart from on boot up windows insists there is a "problem" with my account. When I click on the system tray message I am taken to a login for the old office365 account.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb5a75d2-aa32-4cc3-8662-a98e3501bb04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb5a75d2-aa32-4cc3-8662-a98e3501bb04" /></a></p>
<p>No matter what I do (sign in with another account for example), this box appears time and time again.</p>
<p>I think this may be related to Shared Experiences (which I have turned off and have never used) which is the part of windows settings that sits behind this log on message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
