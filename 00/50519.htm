<h2>            Windows 10 photo import settings</h2>
                    <p>1. I would like to import photos from SD memory card and set a custom network folder where these photos are saved. However, the photo import dialog does not offer any customization or advanced options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I would like that the imported photos are saved in folders grouped and named by date taken, for example folder 2005-08-28. Old Windows did this automatically but cannot find such feature in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>

Not helpful at all. &nbsp;First of all, I don't have anything called "Photo Gallery," just "Photos." &nbsp;The "Photos" app doesn't give me any of the options in the link you provided. &nbsp;This is becoming aggravating and no one has an answer. &nbsp;Just bring back the import
 photos wizard...

            <p>I have a follow up question / comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 7 you were able to specify a suffix to use for the folder name that the imported pictures were being imported to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is important to avoid the possibility of collisions in the names of the photos (two different devices taking a picture in the month with the same image name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see how to do this in windows 10.</p>

            <p>I'm really surprised, no one has answered this question yet.&nbsp; And, I wish I had the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can install another application/program to handle pictures.&nbsp; But, you shouldn't have too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use the built in Photos App on Windows 10, but they removed some of the basic functions we have grown accustomed to...like changing the Import Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would much rather have this back than get the budget photo editing "suite".&nbsp; It seems very "Apple" to me to take away my choice in the matter and say imported photos can only go where Windows thinks it should.&nbsp; Fortunately, Windows will likely add it back
 some day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the best advice I can give to the OP is to either download different software or:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Use the built in Windows 10 app to import from your first device.</p>
<p>2) Go to your "Pictures" location</p>
<p>3) Rename the Folder and/or move it to a new location</p>
<p>4) Import photos from your second device</p>
<p>5) Repeat as necessary.</p>

            Good thing I still have Windows 7 on my desktop. &nbsp;We import 1000's of pictures from our cameras every year and not having control of the file names, folder names, etc is reason enough not to upgrade. &nbsp;This needs to be fixed as above - add the Windows 7
 controls to photo import. &nbsp;The change in the import process from XP to Win7 was bad enough, this effort in photo gallery is just plain poor engineering.

            <p>I totally agree. &nbsp;It was easy to upload photos from an SD card &nbsp;-only the new ones were marked chosen, and you hit import, and they were listed by date entered into computer. &nbsp;Now apparently the pictures were uploaded, but I cannot distinguish them from
 all others, which are not listed in groups as before, but seemingly randomly, also mixed in with named photos and scans. &nbsp;Please restore the old way of handling photos.</p>

<h2>            Can not share achievement with facebook</h2>
                    
<p>For about a week now I have been unable to share achievements with facebook like I used to. Is this due to the facebook app being removed from the console or is there another problem. When I click share on an achievement I get the message,</p>
<p>Sorry, there was a problem connecting your account or sharing to Facebook. Try again later.</p>
<p>Status code: 0x000001F7</p>
<p>As I said this has been happening for a week now so im not sure what to do. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I've gotten the same error. I believe it does have to do with the app's removal. Every article that I've read on the issue indicates that MS wants us to connect to Facebook through the IE app. Maybe signing into Facebook through that will reconnect things?
 I can't imagine why they would leave bits of the Facebook app behind if they didn't work.</p>

 not work since the app has been removed.</p>

<h2>            Can Only Burn DVDs Not CDs</h2>
                    
<p>My only burning software is Windows 7. I did a clean install of Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a blank hard drive for my HP Pavilion dv6500 - other drive has Vista Ultimate 64-bit. Device Manager looks good and Windows search for updated DVD/CD-ROM Drives
 software finds none. Tried opening the Windows CD &amp; DVD burning troubleshooter at this link while connected to Internet, but the specific Troubleshooter&nbsp;described at this link is not available&nbsp;-
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Here's the Troubleshooter excerpt from above - "<span>Open the Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu‑ray Discs troubleshooter by clicking the

<p><span><span><span>Device Manager shows my DVD/CD drive as HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-T20N ATA Device. The driver is Microsoft Version 6.1.7600.16385 dated 6/21/2006.</span></span></span></p>

<div>HiOUgrad,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) What application are you using to burn the CD in Windows 7 (i,e Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>b) Are you able to read or play any music CD on your machine?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resolve this problem on a computer that is running Windows 7, use the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and select CD DVD drives.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information about how to open this troubleshooter in Windows 7, visit the following Microsoft Web site:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a> (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a>
 )</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also you may try to navigate to the following location in registry editor and delete the upper filter and lower filter keys and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click All Programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the start search box type regedit, and press enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the right pane, Check for UpperFilters and LowerFilter keys and select it.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong> You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click UpperFilters only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Edit menu, click Delete.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Registry Editor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes this problem is caused by two Windows registry entries that have become corrupted. To fix the problem, you have to use Registry Editor to delete the corrupted Registry entries.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, follow the steps as in the KB Article:

<p>Hi Azeez,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding. I am just now getting to your suggestions. I noticed this was recently&nbsp;Marked As Answer by Debra-Support Engineer, but I don't know that yet so I will Unmark it for now.</p>
<p>I had already run the Troubleshooter you mentioned above and it did not fix the problem. I ran it again just in case. I can play music CDs and can read data CDs. The burning application I used was "Burn Files to Disc Using Windows Explorer" in AutoPlay.
 Another application that did not burn CD but did burn DVD was "Create A System Repair Disc" under Maintenance.</p>
<p>I will try your Registry edits and report back. KB322756 noted above&nbsp;explains how to export the Registry, but not how to import it. Please have someone add this information to that KB. There is a File, Import option in Registry Editor, but I've never seen
 a KB Article explaining how to use it properly to import a complete Registry. I've used it to import individual Registry&nbsp;keys, but never a complete Registry. I would assume computer restart would be required to import a complete Registry.</p>

<p>Hi Azeez,</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I tried your Registry edit suggestion, but it did not work. My Registry&nbsp;subkey {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}&nbsp;only had Upper Filters (REG_MULTI_SZ under Type and GEARAspiWDM under Data). Should I add Lower Filters to this
 subkey? If so, what? I restored the Upper Filters entry for now.</p>

<p>Hi Azeez,</p>
<p>I tried both troubleshooter options you suggested, but neither helped. I ran each troubleshooter twice - with AutoPlay open and with it closed after clicking the Burn Files to Disc option. The first troubleshooter you list above gave me a message saying
 it had fixed the problem with AutoPlay still open, but it did not. I click the Burn Files to Disc option in AutoPlay and nothing happens. If I try to open the CD/DVD drive in Windows Explorer, it will not open after clicking Burn Files to Disc. Windows Explorer
 shows a CD-R is loaded when I insert the Disc.</p>

<p>Here's a related problem I just discovered with CD-RWs. When I insert a blank 4x Memorex CD-RW, AutoPlay launches, I click Burn files to disc, then&nbsp;I get the following error message - Windows can't format this type of disk. Insert a different disk and try
 again. This error message is String ID 4116 from the Windows 7 shell32.dll file per the following link -
<a href="http://www.win7dll.info/shell32_dll.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.win7dll.info/shell32_dll.html</span></a></p>
<p>If I insert a blank 16x Memorex CD-RW, AutoPlay launches with only the option to Open folder to view files. Windows Explorer opens&nbsp;with the following message at the top -&nbsp;Drag files to this folder and add them to the disc. When I try that, I get a Copy Folder
 window that says "Invalid MS-DOS function" with a Try Again button. Try Again gives the same error. The DVD RW drive in Windows Explorer shows 571MB free of 571 MB.</p>

<p>Correction to above. The second CD-RW was not 16x, it was another blank 4x Memorex. Neither disc had been erased or formatted. The first was probably&nbsp;3 years older than the second above.</p>

<p><span>Hi ozzy68,<br />
<br />
Adding to TrekDozer and SpiritX MS MVP's suggestions,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
The first step would be to install the latest Windows 7 compatible audio (sound) drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the official Dell download link for Latitude D610:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=LAT_PNT_PM_D610&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Drivers
 &amp; Downloads for Latitude D610</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the link it appears that the drivers are available only for Windows XP operating system (OS). Windows 7 is not a supported (OS).</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>For more information on updating drivers,&nbsp;</span><span>see
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update drivers: recommended links</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try and install the audio drivers in&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
 XP compatibility mode</span></a> and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check if Windows updates can automatically download the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Automatically
 get recommended drivers and updates for your hardware</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> bigboss4491  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Shut down and kernel 41 error in event viewer both windows8&#47;10</h2>
                    <p>First of all I write my pc specs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mobo: Z87-D3HP with latest bios version</p>
<p>Ram: 2x4GB corsair vengeance</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair TX650 (650 watt)</p>
<p>GPU: Asus r9 270X DirectCU2</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i5-4570</p>
<p>HDD: 500GB blue Caviar Western Digital</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers installed : motherboard inf, intel management engine (there's a controller in the motherboard that requires it), logitech gaming software, amd latest gpu drivers, realtek audio drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The problem: </span></strong>At random times when I normally want to shut down the pc and press " shut down " from start menu screen turns black as it normally does but the Tower keeps working arround 4-5 minutes
 and then shuts down... Like it gets unresponsive. Then if I boot again it boots a bit slower and I find in Event manager every time that happens a critical error " Kernel 41 error " &nbsp;" The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error
 could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly. " I think my case is system stop respoding.. That happened in my pc in both windows 8.1/10. I don't have performance issues just this. Any ideas?

            Hey there BigBoss4491,<br />
<br />
Are all your drivers and OS up to date? Are there any beeps coming from the motherboard when shutting down or when starting and the problem occurs? I'd check Windows Event Log to see what info it can provide.&nbsp;<br />
I would also test the PSU with a multimeter and see if it's providing proper and stable power to the rest of the parts.&nbsp;<br />
A stress test and a memory test can give you some info on whether the hardware parts are working properly or not. I'd also check the temps while at it. Is anything hitting 100% usage while you are using the system?<br />
I would also test the WD Blue with WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and see if it's healthy and safe for your data. I would recommend using the quick and the extended tests and see if it passes both of them. Checking the raw values of the S.M.A.R.T. status would
 also be helpful. If you are not sure how to read them - feel free to post a screenshot here. Here's a link to the WD Diagnostic tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=0Txxng<br />
<br />
Post back with some results and if you have other questions :)<br />
<br />

            <p>The system is very stable during gaming or any other task. It performs excellent heavy games like Witcher 3. Performance is solid even in full stress. As for the HDD test and memtest I will run it when I am back from university.

            Ok thanks for nothing I guess, turning off Fast start up at power options fixes the case. So why would fast start up not working correctly is another story. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            I'm glad you got around the problem. Check with the support of the motherboard's manufacturer and the OS's support and see what the guys there have to say about it. There may be a problem with the PSU functioning properly when you use the Fast Start Up
 option. It may be a good idea to try using a different one and see if the results are the same.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenges that you're having when you try to connect your <strong>USB C adapter</strong> to your computer when booting it up in Windows 10 may be related to the driver of the device itself. Considering that you have tried connecting a different USB
 device and it is working, there is also a possibility that we are facing a compatibility issue between the hardware of the device and Windows 10. We would like to clarify, have you tried contacting the manufacturer of the
<strong>USB C digital adapter</strong> and see if there are any specific drivers that you will need to use along with it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible factor to the issue is if the Windows 10 drivers are not working properly. Here is a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15048/windows-7-update-driver-hardware-not-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for updating drivers on Windows 10 that are not working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would be looking forward to your response as to how the suggested step goes.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify all usb c adapters I have cause the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open up windows update, all drivers appear to be the newest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to contact Apple about this as I am using their adaper and they said that since it works on the macOS side then it must be a problem with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall Windows several times and the issue still persists. Also sometimes the pop up appears that I have attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/688c0cb2-4ac3-4b7d-a312-8551c8ae6711" /></p>
I cannot use ANY USB devices in Windows, they cause a freeze, usually within 30-60 seconds of connecting the dongle. Any USB dongle (video or ethernet) or even USB flash drive (data stick). Exact same issue - CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT blue screen of death, unless
 I unplug the device quickly enough after the mouse pointer freezes, then it unfreezes several seconds later instead of blue screening. If I don't unplug the device it consistently blue screens CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
Everything in MacOS works perfectly. All symptoms identical to the O.P.</p>

<p>You're downloading a good 6 Gigabytes of data with Reach so expecting it to be done in an hour is a big ask for any internet connection. Switch on background downloads in your console settings then switch your console off to save a bit on your electricity
 bill.</p>

    <title>Skype Number and Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Number and Subscription</h2>
                    <p>Hello.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am moving to South Korea and want to have a US number so family can call me. My question is do I pay for the skype number and subscription seperately? When looking over the cost is looks like I pay almost 50.00 a year for the number and then 70. 00 for
 the subscription. Is this correct or is there a way to buy a "package deal" for both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch the "Navigation" app to be able to do it directly. From there you can enter a destination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can make the voice toggle using the volume buttons on the side of the phone.&nbsp; You may have your media volume set low with turn-by-turn navigation running and just not be able to hear it (a work around)</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can turn off the voice with the volume buttons as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps fix the issue to turn off turn by turn voice in Maps. Get back to us for further queries on the issue above. We are happy to help!</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Vibration trotz Sparmodus aktivieren - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Vibration trotz Sparmodus aktivieren</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo liebers Forum,</p>
<p>mein Xbox One Controller vibriert auf einmal nicht mehr. Habe mich dann auf der Support Seite schlau gemacht und dort stand dass es entweder am Spiel liegt, dass es ggf. keine Vibration unterstützt. Tut es aber (Battlefield 4). Oder dass der Controller die
 Vibration bei niedrigem Batteriestand deaktiviert um Strom zu sparen. Leider erkennt man das ja nicht, da es keine Batterieanzeige mehr gibt (gut gemacht, MS). Meine Frage: Kann man diesen ''Stromsparmodus'' vom Controller irgendwie deaktivieren, also dass
 der Controller bis zum Ende des Ladestands vibriert? Danke schon mal für die Antworten :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Depuis la suppression du service One Drive sur Groove Musique, je cherche des solution pour optimiser l'écoute de ma musique sur XBOX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Solution 1 : </strong></span>J'ai activé le DLNA et j'utilise l'appli Xbox "lecteur media" pour écouter mes chansons. Mais les pochettes ne s'affichent pas a la place j'ai l'icone du fichier wma :( (les fonctions
 aléatoire et répéter fonctionnent bien)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quelqu'un sait comment faire pour que les pochettes s'affiche.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sur mon ordi les pochette s'affiche pourtant bien..</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Solution 2 :</strong></span> utiliser la fonction "Lire sur l'appareil" du Lecteur Windows Media de mon PC, en envoyant le son vers ma XBOX. Dans ce cas le son est lu dans l'appli Goorve Musique&nbsp; de ma Xbox

<p><strong>Solution 1: I activated the DLNA and I use the Xbox&nbsp; "Media Player" app to listen to my songs. But the pouches do not display instead I have the icon of the WMA file:( (random and repeat functions work well)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Someone knows how to make the pouches appear. </strong></p>
<p><strong>On my computer the pouch is displayed though</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: use the "play on device" feature of the Windows Media Player on my PC, by sending the sound to my XBOX. In this case the sound is played in the Goorve music app of my Xbox (the pouch appears:)) but not possible to play a song list only
 a title will load even if I link a full playlist. I have to switch from one title to another via the playback controls of my Windows Media Player, from my PC</strong></p>

<p>Hi Florian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your questions. Have you checked Spotify to see if your music is there also? When all this occurred some music was moved to spotify. You can view the entire guide here for
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4046109/groove-music-and-spotify-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Groove music and spotify</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All the music that had a match in Spotify’s catalog now appears in your Spotify library and playlists. All your purchased or uploaded non-Groove Music Pass music will remain untouched in the Windows 10 and Xbox Groove Music apps. Music you own and
 that is stored locally on your hard drive or on OneDrive is untouched and will continue to be playable from your local hard drive through the Windows 10 and Xbox Groove Music apps.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the Spotify app and let us know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Brad</span></p>

<h2>            can&#39;t access my libraries</h2>
                    Hello, I hope someone can help.<br />
<br />
I did a refresh because my computer said it couldn't fix a problem. Now... when I go to my explorer and click on anything in my library...pictures, documents, video, music...it gives me the message pictures.library-ms not working. this can be deleted safely
 without affecting files.<br />
<br />
So I read what to do. I did the right click on the library and restore default libraries, but I still can't access any of my pictures that I've taken. What happened to the pics I took when I received the message...something went wrong when taking this photo.....????
 They had to have gone somewhere to access them. I heard the camera click...??<br />
<br />
Have I lost everything because of the refresh?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>For which problem did you try to refresh the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error message when you tried to do a refresh?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you delete the libraries before trying to restore them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the issue with libraries, follow these methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to right click on <b>Pictures</b> library and delete it and then try to
<b>Restore default libraries</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Deleting a library does not delete the contents of the included folders. However, you may need to re-add or include your folders manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>Perform <b>SFC (System File Checker)</b> to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files<b>
</b>and see if it helps:</p>
<p>a. Right Click at the bottom left hand side corner of desktop (on
<b>Start</b> screen).</p>
<p>b. Select <b>Command Prompt</b> (Admin).</p>
<p>c. Type “<b>SFC /scannow</b>” and press <b>
Enter</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results. If you need further assistance, we’re here to assist.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could have caused due corrupted files present in the computer. I suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. To run it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right-click (or press and hold) the Start button, then select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></span></li><li><span>Enter <strong>
sfc</strong> <strong>/scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Keep us posted on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you,</span></p>

            I tried the SFC scan but did not resolve the issue. &nbsp;The error message came up only after I had upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. &nbsp;The latest version of iTunes does work, except that iTunes closes down when I try to print a playlist. &nbsp;That's why I
 wanted to install an older version of iTunes. &nbsp;But I'm not sure if I would have the same problem printing with 10.7. &nbsp;If its an issue with Windows 10 it may not make a difference as to which version I use.&nbsp;

<br />=====
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Thank you so much for helping me to try resolve this issue.&nbsp; I've done each step 1 to 6 precisely.&nbsp; Everything seems to check out OK.&nbsp; My results for the
Check &amp; Restore windows integrity are as they should be (identical to your screen picture).&nbsp; However I still have not sound.&nbsp; Could it be a problem on my end?&nbsp; I had sound just prior to
 the update though.&nbsp; I also reinstalled my silverlight because even connecting my laptop with the HDMI cord to watch netflix I could not get sound.<br />

            <p>Alas, this didn't work either. I hoped this would be the answer since the speaker icon on my taskbar did have an "X" next to it. However after clicking and removing the "X" and now having the icon showing the speaker on, there is still no sound.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like everyone else, I upgraded to Windows 10 (on my desktop PC) and have not been able to get sound on any speaker source since. My sound systems were working fine on Windows 7 and Windows 10 had "scanned" my devices in advance and said all were compatible.&nbsp;
 But when Windows 10 downloaded the sound suddenly stopped, so this&nbsp; IS a Windows 10 issue. The Windows 10 "trouble shooting" option cannot detect any problems. Could an MSN support tech please provide a solution beyond the routine list already given?

Acronis True Image</a>&nbsp;and that's only if you are transferring to the same version of Windows.

<p>I am sorry to inform that <span>Windows</span> Easy Transfer transfers only program settings, not the programs themselves. To use the programs from your old computer, install them on your new computer, and then transfer files and settings for those programs.
 It's possible that some kinds of programs, such as security and antivirus programs, might not work with this version of
<span>Windows</span>.</p>

            <p>The full version of Acronis TI has the ability to restore the clone to new hardware, If you restore the cloned drive to a new PC you will have an identical installation as to the old PC, ie it will be home premium. You would then need to upgrade to Ultimate.</p>

            <p>No. You can't do that because there are files associated with installed programs which reside in&nbsp;folders other than the program folders themselves..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless the programs are very simple ones, they have to be installed properly from the original installation media.. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are composing a new email message: open the App bar and then select Attachment. This will open a file picker that will allow you to navigate to your Photo and attach it to the email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To print an email message you can open the Charm bar and select devices. From Devices, select the printer that you would like to use to print your message.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I the windows 7 one could keep more than one windows (website) open at the same time by Minimising a window which would then sit behind the I.E. icon on the command line as a page, and clicking on the "e" would show thumbnails of each of the windows that
 are currently available, clicking on a selected mini-window would then re-open that window/page on the screen without having to re-type it's web address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we do the same as above in windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>That still happens with tabs.&nbsp; Actually I would say it happens when <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
hovering</span> over the IE Taskbar icon.&nbsp; You can still have tabs open in other windows too.&nbsp; E.g. press Ctrl-n or launch links by pressing Shift- when clicking on them.&nbsp; We can even drag a tab from the Tab bar, "tear it away", &nbsp;and create a separate IE window
 for a tab that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are you seeing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; There is an option in <strong>Tab Options</strong> which is relevant that you may have unchecked:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Show previews for individual tabs in the Taskbar</em>*</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Requires restart</p>
<p>(Alt-T O, Alt-T S)</p>

            Hello. If you are not having issues with anything else video related then this is probably a problem with either your webcam or facebook as a whole. 
<br />
<br />You might need to go into device manager and check your graphics card drivers and see if they are up to date. 
<br />
<br />Do  a clean boot into Windows 10 as well and see if that fixes it:
<br />

<br />
<br />If that does not work, clear the cache of your browser for whichever you use. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need further assistance.

    <title>Moving fonts from OS X to Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Moving fonts from OS X to Windows 8</h2>
                    I am trying to transfer fonts in TTF format from Macs in the office to my Windows 8 machine. When I view the TTF files in Windows, they show up as being 0 kb and double-clicking them calls up an error that says "(whatever).ttf is not a valid font file."
 The folder containing the fonts has the same apparent size as it does on a Mac. Only the files themselves say 0 kb. The fonts all install from the same files without a hitch on a friend's MacBook.

            That's not it. I know how to install a font from a TTF. The issue is the TTF files I have aren't working, and because they work fine on a Mac, I think it has to do with them not being compatible with Windows. I need a way to convert them to a Windows-friendly
 format or for Windows to be able to read them.
