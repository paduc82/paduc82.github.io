    <title>Access Query disappears when moved from user&#39;s computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access Query disappears when moved from user&#39;s computer</h2>
                    Hello, I have a power user that created an Access DB. Whenever we try to move the DB to another machine or email it, the make table queries seem to disappear. I have researched this topic on the net and it seems people have similar issues, but not exactly
 like mine, so I have found no solution. The query name itself seems to be there, but when you open it in design view, it's empty. Is this a known bug, or just something happening to us? Of course, when you try to run the query you get the message "Query must
 have at least one destination field". Can anyone offer help in this matter? I thank you in advance for your help.<br />

<p>The only time I've seen such a thing is when the wrong file was being transferred, but why not email the SQL statement, then you can quickly recreate the query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could the queries be created in the backed and the frontend is being emailed, or vice-versa?</p>

            I've never heard of such a thing.&nbsp; Are these normal, local queries, making the table in the local database?&nbsp; Is this database the front-end component of a split database architecture?&nbsp; They aren't pass-through queries, are they, or queries directed to
 an external database file by the "Source Database" property of the stored query?

            These are normal make table queries, this is not a split database. There is a linked table that has a dsnless connection, but the make table query associated with the linked table works fine.&nbsp; The macro,&nbsp; runs the 2 make table queries, then it deletes
 the tables and then imports data into the tables, then it makes a local table from the linked table, then it opens the table that got built from the make table query.&nbsp; The make table queries that it runs first with the openquery Command, are the queries that
 when we move it another computer the query data gets lost completely and all that shows is SELECT "x" AS Expr1 INTO TblBacklogHMPT; which should not be there.

<p>
</p><p>I don't quite follow the logic if this.&nbsp; By "it deletes the tables", do you mean it deletes the *data* from the tables?&nbsp; Because if it deletes the tables themselves, I don't see how you would then import data into the tables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I still can't guess why it is behaving so strangely.</p>

<p>Would you like to post the database, or a cut-down version of it, on a file-sharing service where I can see what happens and try to debug it?&nbsp; Or you could make a minimal demo database, compact and zip it, and e-mail me the zip file.&nbsp; You
 can get my e-mail address from my website, which is listed in my sig.</p>

<h2>            How do i make a complaint &#63; My word and all other office apps have been disabled.</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a laptop recently 01/08/2019 from Harvey Norman and they had downloaded all the apps for me word, excel etc,</p>
<p>I decided to open a corporate email and had Johnny from Microsoft help me create a business email on my laptop who fail to advise that if i log in with my company email it will disable my word, excel and all other application as it recognizes that i am logging
 in using my company email on my personal laptop and i meant to have a personal and business laptop. i had logged in my two computer using a company email and all of my apps need to be activated and i cant use this&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result both of my computers microsoft apps are all disabled and cant use Outlook and when i called business team and spoke to Connor and Harrison they advise they cant help me and purchase a software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should have never occurred as i am not required to have a personal and a business laptop and should be able to do this from sale without my word and excel app being disabled and at least advised that if i was to log in using my work email other application
 will be disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i need this resolved asap i called technical team and they were no help instead and instead i was promoted to make complaint to legal department in writing, irony is a tech team asking me put complaint in writing and ticket number i got was&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(50, 49, 48, 1)">14272620</span></p>

    <title>Excel Pivot Tables don&#39;t work with OneDrive &#40;Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgallo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Pivot Tables don&#39;t work with OneDrive &#40;Office Professional Plus 2013&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Our company recently has migrated to OneDrive as primary option for backing up the files in our PCs, so I recently decided to sync my files with OneDrive. I like the idea of keeping all my files safe somewhere in case my computer is destroyed, lost, stolen,
 etc. The process is very easy, but as I was doing it, I realized that the "Original" data no longer set up to reside in my PC, but rather in the Cloud somewhere far away... no big issue, I thought I could get around it somehow. I have used OneDrive for a week
 now and I'm starting to rethink this whole OneDrive thing again... few annoyances start adding up.... the most critical for me so far is having problems with my pivot tables as described in the microsoft forum link at the bottom... so here is my dilema:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the files I work with are big (10-40MB), so working on the cloud doesn't work for me... too slow + too much data lost syncing every time I hit save... therefore I rather work on my "Local PC Copy" and then sync to the OneDrive cloud when I am done...
 I actually have to select "Pause Syncing" option in OneDrive so I could work more efficiently and stop using ridiculous amounts of data in sync process.</p>
<p>-- when I work on the Cloud files, pivot Tables are non issue... so far</p>
<p>
</p><p>On My PC... &nbsp;at first, Pivots work, but eventually (next day) they stop working all together... can't update + can't create new ones.... when I look at the Pivot Data Source, it calls back to the "Original" location... which is the OneDrive Cloud web address...
 which contains the "]" characters that cause the error in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only fix so far is cut off the file from OneDrive all together by removing the file our of the OneDrive folder in my PC, and delete the "Original" from the Cloud folder...
</p>
<p>then... re-create pivots, then save back on OneDrive Folder and Sync to Cloud... then repeat next day if you need the pivot... total pain and waste of time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to efficiently get around it, when and how does it stops working, how to prevent it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish Microsoft OneDrive would allow the option of keeping your local PC as the primary location and let OneDrive be secondary backup if the user desires it, instead it works the other way around.</p>

<p>Hi Antoine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you right click on the Excel worksheet, it will show you the option to <strong>
Copy</strong> but not to <strong>Move</strong>. Can you let us know what happens when you click on
<strong>Copy</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Move-or-copy-worksheets-or-worksheet-data-47207967-bbb2-4e95-9b5c-3c174aa69328?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> on how to <strong>Move</strong> or <strong>Copy</strong> worksheets or worksheet data. You can choose either to move or copy worksheets to another location in the same workbook or to a different workbook. You can also choose to move or copy a portion
 of a worksheet to another.</p>
<p>

    <title>Using SUMIF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> external202  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using SUMIF</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use SUMIF for a range, but I need to exclude a value in the sum_range if one of the text values for the range includes a letter in the middle of the text.</p>
<p>For example, the range is A1:A10, and the sum range is from G1:G10, and one of the text values from A1:A10 has the letter V in the middle, which I want to exclude from the sum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I am having trouble with the criteria? This is what I input:<br />
=sumif(A1:A10, if(mid(A9,6,1)="V",0, _____ , G1:G10)<br />
</p>
<p>I am not sure what to put in the underscore, or I could be using sumif incorrectly. I probably also have to use IF at the beginning of the statement.</p>

    <title>Moving Office 365 Subscription from GoDaddy to Microsoft Server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katherinebarbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Office 365 Subscription from GoDaddy to Microsoft Server</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Our small business has always had a domain name and website with GoDaddy and just recently signed up for an Office 365 subscription through them as well. We decided that we would like to transfer our Office 365 subscription from GoDaddy to the Microsoft
 server so we may take advantage of the online version of Microsoft Project instead of being restricted to using the desktop version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would be the best steps to take for this transition? How do we ensure that we do not lose any emails, contacts and the data in our MS Project sheets during the transition? Does anyone have any experience with making a flawless transition?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi KayB123,</p>
<p>There are no official tools to&nbsp;move an Office 365 tenant from Godaddy to Microsoft directly. Based on my expericence, it is required you
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Remove-a-domain-from-Office-365-f09696b2-8c29-4588-a08b-b333da19810c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove the domain </a>from your existing Office 365 tenant and then cancel the Office 365 subscription in GoDaddy.</p>
<p>Then you can purchase an Office 365 tenant in Microsoft and add the domain into this Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>GoDaddy is a syndicate partner of Microsoft and some furtures could be different from the ones bought from Microsoft, you may need to consult GoDaddy support for the detailed steps.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.<br />

                    <p>I am trying to put a formula into a cell and then fill down to apply that formula to each row in my sheet. I create a formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(A2="xyz",0,1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highlight that cell and drag down to the bottom of the column. I then hit control-D and fill down. But the formula does not take - the IF doesn't fire as expected. But if I manually edit the specific cell where the formula is fulfilled (ie. the row where
 the condition is met), it works. So Fill isn't working but the formula works fine if I manually edit it.&nbsp; This is happening consistently on any sheet where I try to use Fill Down.&nbsp; It fails every time, no matter the formula/function, no matter the worksheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work just fine. I can't isolate when it broke - some recent Excel update, apparently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Excel 2016 for Mac, version 16.21.1 (190123). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Help?</p>

In other words, you want to extract DRN/5 ?</p>
<p>If so, try this:</p>
<p>=MID(A2,FIND("/",A2)-3,5)</p>
<p>Assumes there will *always* be a slash and only one slash in the string.</p>

    <title>Consistent Deterioration in Call Quality 3 minutes into a Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panther13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Consistent Deterioration in Call Quality 3 minutes into a Skype Session</h2>
                    <p>We recently (within a day or two) installed Skype ver. 8.17.0.2 (Calling ver. 2018.09.01.9) on an IBM ThinkPad Model T510 running the most recent incarnation of Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. The installation was smooth, and at first everything tested and functioned
 flawlessly. The tests were conducted using the resident Skype Call Testing Service, as well as testing conducted using the Tools function (regarding Audio and Video setups) in Skype.
</p>
<p>However when we used it to establish a proper Skype session, after about 3 minutes (consistently and during each attempt) into a conversation, Skype then advise on-screen that there is a connection problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this juncture, the audio received is greatly compromised (although barely understandable) - and there doesn't seem to be any change or problem with the audio being transmitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our question is - what could be causing this Issue? Thinking it is not a hardware issue, since the problem is not immediate or evident from the start.</p>
<p>Again.. it is important to note that everything is fine at first, but the deterioration and problem manifests itself (and predictably so) within a few minutes after a call is established - to the point where you can virtually use a stopwatch to anticipate
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have used Skype since Forever on our Windows machines without incident. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known Linux or Skype Version issue?</p>
<p>Thank you for any assistance/info regarding this.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Sergei-P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>We have tried several times using both a WiFi and an Ethernet (corded) connection, encountering the same issue/result with both methods.</p>
<p>I am confident that the proximity of the laptop to the modem (since located only about 4-5 feet away in direct line-of-sight, in this case) was close enough so as to not cause any related connection problems. The laptop was not moved during the Skype connection
 at the time the issue was encountered.</p>
<p>This only occurred with one specific contact. As I had mentioned, the installation of Skype on the computer referenced took place on the preceding day, and this was the first and only Skype call attempted.
</p>
<p>Please note I was able to establish a problem-free Skype Connection with that contact/person, using a separate computer running Skype on Windows 10 (as we always do on a once-per-week basis). I did this just minutes after encountering the problem described.</p>
<p>There are no problems connecting (more accurately <em>maintaining</em> a proper connection) outside of the Linux/Newest Version of Skype configuration.</p>
<p>Therefore, I do not believe that this issue is unique to one contact in particular.</p>
<p>However.. I can look into that aspect of things further if need be. </p>
<p>With thanks and kind regards,</p>
<p>Panther13</p>

<p>Dear WiseguyT -</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, and thank you for confirming for me that this Skype "connection problem" is not a direct result of something I have done, or done incorrectly.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be addressed in a future Skype or (possibly) Linux update.</p>
<p>Especially grateful that your confirmation of this exact issue stops me having to reinstall or to randomly tweak things looking for a solution.</p>
<p>Again.. thanks for taking the time.</p>
<p>Hope this issue is soon resolved for all of us.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>Hi Sergei_P,</p>
<p>Yes, I have done. Uninstalling/Reinstallation of Skype has no bearing on (the resolution of) this issue.</p>
<p>It is quite consistent in its nature.</p>

<p><span>Hi Thunderbird02,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I notice that you have added the number “<strong>1</strong>” to the first command and this is the cause of this issue. The correct RMS key sharing location for Office 365 for Government
 customers doesn’t include the number “<strong>1</strong>” at the end of the URL. The number after the URL in the article below is a note to explain that “Only customers who have purchased Office 365 for Government SKUs (Government Community Cloud) should use
 this RMS key sharing location</span>”.</p>
<p><span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn151475%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn151475%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, please re-run the command without the number “<strong>1</strong>” and then follow the steps in the article above to complete the process. Feel free to let us know if you need
 further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>You are probably going to need a formatting switch and an If...then...Else field construction to get the desired output in Word.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What data is in the cells that return the 12:00:00 AM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is that Word uses the contents of the first n (I think it is 8) records to determine the type of data in each field.&nbsp; Sometimes it is necessary to insert some dummy rows at the top of a data source for force Word to treat the data in a particular
 way.</p>

    <title>Save site as template option not available for team sites in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Save site as template option not available for team sites in SharePoint online</h2>
                    <p>We have root site collection created based on team site template, later on we turned on publishing feature on root site collection. I do understand that sharepoint hides "Save site as template" feature for publishing sites, it behaves in same way in Sharepoint
 2010 too. However we have subsites created based on team site template without enabling publishing feature on them but we still do not see "Save site as template" option for those team sub sites created underneath root site collection on which publishing feature
 is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If root site collection is created based on team site template and publishing feature is turned on on root site, later sub sites are created underneath based on team site template without ever enabling publishing feature on them. Should "Save site as template"
 option be visible for these sub sites in this scenario ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not want to use app model and any of the unsupported methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this supported : Create site collection based on team site template without enabling publishing feature on root site collection then create sub site based on team site template without enabling publishing feature then save sub site as template, which
 will be available in solutions gallery. After doing this enable publishing feature on root site collection. In this way I still have site template of sub site created based on team site. Is this approach supported by microsoft ?</p>

            Hi DhavalRaval,<br />
<br />
Yes, it should be feasible. We can save a site as site template before enabling the publishing feature, and the template can still be used after the publishing feature enabled.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Eric Yang<br />

    <title>Missing PDFMaker files. Do you want to run the installer in repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kkkwj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing PDFMaker files. Do you want to run the installer in repair mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems creating PDF files from Word docx&nbsp;files when right-clicking the files in File Explorer and choosing "Convert to Adobe PDF." I get the hated message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Missing PDFMaker files. Do you want to run the installer in repair mode?<br />
</p>
<p>Needless to say, running the installer in repair mode does not solve the problem. Neither does re-installing&nbsp;Word (Office 365), re-installing Acrobat, or anything else that I have tried (following the troubleshooting on the Adobe web pages, for example).
 Many other people have experienced this problem over the years, but I cannot find a solution on the net.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started for me in mid-2018 sometime.&nbsp; I have included a&nbsp;pile of version details below in case anyone is wondering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem? Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I try to right-click a file in File Explorer to convert it to PDF, I get the following message. Running the installer in repair mode does not help. Everything used to work fine (for a year) until an automatic update of Windows during mid-2018 broke
 everything.</p>
<p><br />
Missing PDFMaker files. Do you want to run the installer in repair mode?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>2) I can manually add the Acrobat Tab to the Word Ribbon by going through File/Options/COM Addins, etc. BUT, the tab will not stay there. If I quit Word and restart it, the Acrobat tab on the ribbon is gone.<br />
</p>
<p>The Acrobat Tab will show on the MS Word ribbon until I restart Word:</p>
<p>C:\program files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat DC\PDFMaker\Office\PDFMOfficeAddin.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Here are the version details. My machine and licenses and versions are all up to date.</p>
<p>Many other people on the net have reported this problem, although no one has provided an answer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office Version:</p>
<p>Word for Office 365 MSO 16.0.11029.20045 32-bit</p>

            Why not make use of Word's ability to save a file in pdf format, or print it to that format using Microsoft Print to PDF facility accessible via the backstage Print view (File&gt;Print) in any Office application.

<p>Hi Doug, thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For months, that is exactly what I have been doing - File, Export, to PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I lose a lot of functionality that way since I cannot access all the Adobe Acrobat Pro DC features. (And I used to have the Adobe Generate PDF icon on my quick access bar too.)&nbsp; And I can't use the Word PDF method to right-click a file in File Explorer
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like most people, I suppose, it bugs me that everything could work fine for a year before an automatic update broke things. Being automatic is not the real problem either&nbsp;since I can (or could and did for many years) shut that off to avoid unexpected breakages.
 But you can't avoid updating forever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's frustrating.</p>

            I agree with Doug's suggestion to use the pdf capabilities built into Office.
<br />
<br />This forum is user-to-user support on Microsoft Word.
<br />
<br />PDFMaker is an Adobe Acrobat product.
<br />
<br />Even so, it is used enough that there is an Office Support page on this:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/missing-adobe-acrobat-tab-even-when-add-in-is-enabled-in-office-2016-apps-9a723b83-3ef5-4dd0-9701-269d888e7396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/missin...</a>
<br />
<br />AcrobatDC should be compatible. I'm using AcrobatX and it is working.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;I can manually add the Acrobat Tab to the Word Ribbon by going through File/Options/COM Addins, etc. BUT, the tab will not stay there. If I quit Word and restart it, the Acrobat tab on the ribbon is gone.&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Is it marked as disabled in the Add-Ins settings?
<br />Is it set to load on startup?

<p>I understand your frustration.</p>

<p>Hi Charles, thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have been using Word-&gt;PDF for months and months. (But if you don't mind me saying, it's a workaround, not a solution.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I agree that this is a user-to-user forum. I posted here because all official methods and web pages (dutifully followed) have failed me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it should work. It DID work for me for a year or more, until the magic update. And the Acrobat addin&nbsp;does work on my Excel and Outlook ribbons, which suggests that the problem is something to do with Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your two comments on 1) disabled in the Addin settings and 2) set to load on startup have me thinking that there are TWO settings involved, not just the single checkbox setting that I use to enable the&nbsp;addin&nbsp;like the other addins. There are many checkboxes
 available to check, but in debugging I disabled them all, only working with the Acrobat addin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will investigate to see if I can find TWO different settings to set. Not loading on startup would explain the behavior, if there is such a setting. I will report back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking around, I was not able to find TWO settings. There is only one checkbox. When I check it, the addin loads, shows up on the ribbon, and works as expected (at least, with my quick tests). When I restart Word, it is gone and back to the old disabled/unloaded
 status.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfb74822-dd80-411b-974a-59705eca9b22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bfb74822-dd80-411b-974a-59705eca9b22?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a further step, I ran Start / Word / More / Run as Administrator and enabled the addin&nbsp;as an administrator, just to be sure. (Of course, my normal login account is an administrator on my own machine.) But that did not help either (sigh). Word and Acrobat
 must be two of the most popular business apps in the world, and yet others and I are still having this problem. Oh well. Maybe something will change in 2019 with another magic update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I went into the registry and checked that the LoadBehavior value for the PDFMOfficeAddin.dll was set to 3 (the official approved value). I changed it, saved it, and changed it back again to 3, but it made no difference.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, you are right that it makes sense to look at the interaction of Word and Acrobat. All I can suggest is to give feedback to both MS and Adobe. The way to do that in Word is to go under the Help tab and use Feedback there.

<h2>            How to add myself as an admin &#124; Dynamics 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I registered for a trial for Dynamics 365 on 07/06/2017, however i am not able to view admin tools, I tried calling the support phone number&nbsp;800-865-9408, i was asked to contact 888-477-7989, who asked me to contact&nbsp;866-425-1865, who asked me to contact
 800-865-9408, after speaking with multiple people and "<strong>HOURS</strong>" on hold the issue stands open, I need help on the following -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Registered for a trial - Dynamics 365 (plan to subscribe to a paid version once i am able to set up org)</p>
<p>Only one user present - i.e. myself&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not the admin hence the org set up is not possible</p>
<p>Called support - no help received after spending hours listening to music and speaking to someone who is unable to help</p>
<p>Tried following options -&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Login to Dynamics 365</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Navigate to other applications</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Click on - Admin</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">question appears -&nbsp;Ready to become the admin for &lt;&lt;company name&gt;&gt; with link to - "Yes, I want to become an admin"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">After clicking on&nbsp;"Yes, I want to become an admin"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Page says - "Add this TXT record to show you own &lt;&lt;Domain name&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Issue - The domain owner is different and the CRM admin is different, as an admin i do not have access to modify my DNS records</p>
<p>which leaves me helpless and unable to use CRM, received no help from phone support (2 case numbers no solution)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions -&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i register for a trial and i will pay once the trail expires why do i need to make changes in DNS records to register myself as an admin? (Microsoft internal CRM admin and the domain owner for microsoft.com is that the same person? if no why does MS expect
 the Dynamics CRM admin to have access to DNS records)</p>
<p>What is the alternate procedure to add myself as an admin (i am the only user in the org) &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Organizing Quick Parts&#47;Building Blocks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esilverberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Organizing Quick Parts&#47;Building Blocks</h2>
                    <p>I want to keep about 50 addresses in my Quick Parts.</p>
<p>They can be broken down into 4 categories.</p>
<p>1. Will Quick Parts hold that much data?</p>
<p>2. Is there some way to look at the list without showing all 50 entries?</p>
<p>i.e. Is there a way to only show the names of the Quick Parts rather </p>
<p>than the whole thing? Is there a way to see a specific category and not the whole list?</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Using Word 2007.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; QuickParts is one of 35 available (BuildingBlock galleries).&nbsp; It can definately hold 50 entries.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When you display a gallery (be it QuickParts or one of the others) then the whole gallery content is displayed.&nbsp; So to shorten the displayed list you would need to break your entries up between several different galleries, use building block content
 controls in your document filtered using "categories" or&nbsp;employ a custom&nbsp;ribbon that&nbsp;uses a dynamic menu to filter and&nbsp;display building blocks</p>

            <p>This was a lot of information to take in.</p>
<p>It looks like I need to use the Add-in but I'm not sure where to get it.</p>
<p>When I click the link at the end of the article I get a document called </p>
<p>Bulding Blocks Enhances Tools AddIn.dotm and get a table of examples.</p>
<p>I see your modified ribbon, but how do I get that myself?</p>
