<h2>            Office Pro Plus 2010 VS. Office Home and Business 2010</h2>
                    <p>I have Office Pro Plus 2010 which in Control Panel shows that it's installed (programs/features)...</p>
<p>I have Outlook 2010 from Office Home and Business 2010 which also shows being installed in Control Panel...</p>
<p>My question is if I uninstall or delete both and then install Office Home and Business 2010 "OR" Office Pro Plus 2010 using another software package, will I lose all my Outlook data files, Excel and Word files when I use another software package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not ask why I want to do it, I just want to so I can clear up some other problem/s, OK?</p>
<p>

<p>Uninstalling any Office version has no impact on Office docs, they all remain as before.</p>
<p>With MS Outlook it depends on the type of mail account, pop, IMAP or Exchange?</p>
<p>With pop mail the *.pst data file containg all mail data will be retained.</p>
<p>An Exchange mail account all data is on the server.</p>
<p>In an IMAP mail account mail ONLY is on the server, Contacts/tasks/calendar are in an *.pst data file</p>
<p>In any case you cannot have both 2010 pro Plus and 2010 H&amp;B installed, even if that is what is shown in the control panel. Any Office key is version specific.</p>
<p>If you open any Office component Help&gt;About would show what you have</p>

    <title>Desperate To Learn How to Remove Outlook Default Email and Replace - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Desperate To Learn How to Remove Outlook Default Email and Replace w&#47;Gmail As Microsoft Default Email Address</h2>
                    <p>Hello Outlook Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My quest is to remove the default Outlook email account that my daughter enabled when she set up the Hewlett-Packard Model HP19-2114 computer, v.1511. At the time of installation, Windows 8.1 was the factory install. I am extremely anxious to replace the
 Outlook default with my preferred long-held Gmail email account as the dominant program. Obviously this was an ongoing error in her not asking me for my preference in setting up the appropriate email account at that time. I recently upgraded to Windows 10
 Home-v.1511; Ram 4.00 GB; 64-bit OS, x64 based processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A good many obstacles have presented when I have been faced with a login at an Microsoft associated screen where I have to enter my email address and Microsoft password. While my Gmail email address is definitely accepted as part of signing into the Microsoft.com
 home login, signing into other Microsoft associated logins are rejected because of the default Outlook email association (which has never been utilized). Consequently, e.g., posting the Calendar App on my taskbar today, I was again met with a rejection due
 to Outlook being the unwanted default email program. I hope I have relayed my frustration with a modicum of clarity and have not unnecessarily convoluted what probably is a "walk in the
</p>
<p>park" for an individual having sound technical knowledge . . . hoping to hear good news soon!</p>

            <p>There is not reason to remove the default account.&nbsp; You can leave the account and setup a new Windows user account for you to use.</p>
<p>Only Microsoft accounts can be used to login.</p>
<p>You can use a Gmail address to create a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This creates problems because you have two accounts, a Gmail account and a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://accounts.google.com/</a> and enter your Gmail address and password, you will enter your Gmail email account.</p>
<p>If you go to <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> and enter your Gmail address and Microsoft password, you will enter your Microsoft email account.</p>
<p>The Gmail account can have a different password than the Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Any emails sent to the Gmail address will go to the Gmail server.</p>
<p>The Microsoft account would not receive any emails.</p>
<p>Email, calendar, contacts, OneDrive, .... are all setup when you create a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what this means: "...I have been faced with a login at an Microsoft associated screen where I have to enter my email address and Microsoft password. While my Gmail email address is definitely accepted as part of signing into the Microsoft.com
 home login,..."</p>
<p>Did you add your Gmail address as an alias to the Outlook account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason why you can't have a Gmail address and an Outlook address.</p>
<p>The Gmail address can be used as the notification address for the Outlook address.</p>

    <title>Nokia N800 - USB Connectivity Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sealswcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia N800 - USB Connectivity Issues</h2>
                    I was just getting ready to purchase about 3000 770's when I found out the N800 was being released. So I bought a few test models. I am having some issues with the new model that I've not heard addressed on any forums yet:<br />
<br />
1. USB connection to the PC is a little bit "picky". After several failed attempts to connect to my Windows XP machine ("Error connecting USB device" ), I finally figured it out: The 800 has to be powered OFF before it's plugged in. This was not the case for
 the 770.<br />
<br />
2. Despite all attempts, I've failed to connect the N800 to a Mac. This is the first device I've ever had problems getting a Mac to talk to.<br />
<br />
And finally, a complete mystery:<br />
<br />
3. Why, on a device touting its open source qualities, is the software updater written exclusively for dot Net architecture? I wonder if anyone else has found the fact that a Linux-based device can not be updated by a Linux-based computer a bit ironic?

            1. Strange, I haven't had any problems to connect N800 to WXP and I don't need to reboot the device to get it connected to my WXP. If you have this kind of problem you may need to flash the device again. 3. You can flash N800 from linux. more info here:
<a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/releases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maemo.org/downloads/releases.html</a> you need flasher 3.0 to N800.

            yes, I just got my N800 and it is the first device indeed that has no connectivity with Macs. Mac OS X is so good with different devices that sometimes I think that even if I connect my blander to a mac it will recognize it.. but Nokia N800. sad.

            Totally agree I have just bought an N800 and I am Mac only. I use a PC at work but do not have permission to connect my N800. Therefore I currently have no way of updating. This device can go on the internet and download so why is it not possible to complete
 an update using the device itself?

            I never had problems connecting my N800 to a PC running WXP until a few days ago. Mozilla freezes and would not recognize the N800.

            After upgrading from an older version of OS2008 to the latest<br />
version, I lost the ability to connect my N800 to my Linux<br />
box as a USB device. Before, it would show up as a USB<br />
device, and I could access the card. Now it doesn't.<br />
I have it plugged in when I connect the cable, and when<br />
I start it, it boots as though the cable is not connected,<br />
and it does not appear as a device. This is rather odd!<br />
Has anybody else experienced this?

            Never mind -- I figured it out.<br />
<br />
Here's the fix. Go to Settings -&gt; Connectivity,<br />
and select the option to automatically accept all<br />
connections.<br />
<br />
When I upgraded OS2008, I think this was reset to WLAN<br />
only. When I changed this to all, then USB connection<br />
worked just by plugging in the cable.

                    I have installed the new version of Skype on my computer (mac) but it seems to have created a totally new Skype account. The credit on my Skype account (still available on my iPhone) along with the history and contacts have disappeared. The systems says
 there are two Skype accounts associated with my email address but will only let me log into this new one not the original. I use this everyday for work and need to be able to access it. What to do?

    <title>SileadInc Touch Screen Driver Does Not Install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SileadInc Touch Screen Driver Does Not Install</h2>
                    <p>Since switching to Windows Insider builds on this Onda V891W(Version 1) Tablet (Intel Atom Z3000 Series based) the touch screen does either work erratically or not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Onda provided touch screen drivers results in&nbsp; a touch screen registering touches in the wrong place, as if X and Y axis were mixed up
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and</span> the screen resolution were lower than it really is (real resolution is 19200x1200; correctly recognized by Windows). During the last few weeks I've collected quite a bunch of Silead touch drivers, both from
 Onda and other OEMs, but - while they can be installed just fine, none of these do correct this erratic behavior. Other users (as can be seen searching the web) appear to have the same problem even when not running a regular, non-preview build of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>De-installing the vendor provided erratic driver or just waiting a day while keeping the erratic driver installed, Windows Update claims to have installed an updated (Windows Update Catalog 10/13/2015) driver. While the install is reported as "successful",
 in reality the driver is not installed at all (Device Manager either does show a yellow warning sign and no driver installed and&nbsp;touch screen not registering any touches, or continues to lists the old, erratic driver). Subsequent WU runs again claim having
 successfully installed the missing driver:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7916a218-9a3f-43bf-8248-01df15f6f1bb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the driver in question from the Windows Update Catalog and was able to force its install, but this just results in another version of a erratic touch screen behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reported this behavior using Windows Feedback some time ago, but this is still broken, leaving me with a tablet without touch ...</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>I suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Download the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a BlackJackII from ATT, i never use activesync, but wanted to install a program last night (opera) so I set it up. I didn't really work to install, so i just copied the cab file to the phone and got it installed that way - then I went
 to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning when I was to make a call, I find out that all my contacts on my phone have disappeared. Throughout the day, a few showed up again, but most are still missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to get them back? I really really need them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to reset the phone and reync etc....but nothing works :/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            part of header disappears when i exit editing mode</h2>
                    In a two-page Word document, I have set the headers to be different using a section break. I recently wanted to add something to both headers, so typed it in separately in each one. However, when I exit header/footer editing mode, the addition that I made
 to the second header keeps disappearing. Why is this happening and how can I fix it? &nbsp;

            Did you add the content as a continuation of the existing paragraph? Or did you add it as a 2nd paragraph?... I'd first check the paragraph formatting, especially with regard to Line Spacing.<br />
<br />
Exactly how was the Header constructed? If you used a text box or one of the built-in Header selections it could be that the text box isn't tall enough, but without more descriptive details it's difficult to guess.<br />
<br />
If you can post a copy of the document on SkyDrive or similar perhaps it can be analyzed for you.<br />

            <p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand your internet browser has fallen a prey&nbsp;to browser hijacking. It pertains to an online fraud in which scammers use malicious software (malware) to take control of your computer's Internet browser and change how and what it displays when
 you're surfing the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer 11 is the newest web browser from Microsoft. It comes with your Windows 8.1 or Windows RT 8.1 update and is available for Windows 7. It has the "Do not track" feature with which you can send a signal to marketers and websites requesting
 them to not collect data that enables them to track you on the web. The websites you visit often contain content from third parties. In order to load this content, certain information about your computer is sent to each of the third parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, you could InPrivate browsing and Windows SmartScreen which helps you identify known phishing and malware sites and helps you make informed decisions about app downloads. All of these security features are packed in the new
<em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Internet Explorer 11</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to fix your hijacked web browser, I would suggest you to try the methods provided in the following Microsoft Security article and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>Lost changes saved to downloaded Word doc that saved as Read Only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost changes saved to downloaded Word doc that saved as Read Only</h2>
                    When I downloaded Word docs from Hotmail, they saved themselves as Read Only - which bothers me. When I went to edit these docs, I had to click and Enable Editing button. When I went to Save - a Save As window popped up - I didn't pay attention to the
 file path and decided to name the doc Manual2 so I would recognize it as the edited doc. Clicked Save. Cannot find that document anywhere. Have I lost all the changes? How do I straighten out this Read Only issue for the future. This never happened before.

<p>I assume that you are saying that the Document is opening in "Protected View"</p>
<p>If the document was saved from Hotmail into the My Templates folder, the path of the document would be</p>
<p>C:\Users\[username]\Documents\</p>
<p>given that when you try the save the document, the path is</p>
<p>Owner/AppData/Local/Temp/Temp2_stuff.zip</p>
<p>indicates to me that the attachment was NOT directly saved from Hotmail to the local disk.</p>
<p>I do not use Hotmail, so I cannot give precise instructions, but yesterday in one of these forums, someone mentioned that in Hotmail (I guess there is a new version that is throwing everyone off), there is a pulldown that must be accessed to actually save
 the attachment rather than open it.</p>
<p>Note that in Word 2010, documents downloaded from the web or saved directly from an email message to the local drive will always open in Protected Mode the first time that they are opened in Word.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, this has happened to me before. But I did save them in My Documents. Then when I open them, they say they are Read Only, so I click the enable editing button,,,, but, later - the changes have not been saved. So two issues, why are they saving
 from Hotmail as Read Only, and why did it let me edit, but it didn't save the changes, even when I thought I was creating a second file for saving. Here is the pathway it shows when I try to save changes to these Read Only docs:

 the authenticator doesn't recognize or allow&nbsp;my Hotmail.com login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add Visio&nbsp;to my Office365 subscription, or am I hosed?&nbsp; If I'm hosed, I'll probably just buy a standalone version of Office because I'm an individual consultant without access or need for corporate licensing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

            <p>Lowell,</p>
<p>IMHO the visio licensing around o365 has been hosed since the beginning (part of the reason I personally don't play in the o365 arena). Some (not so) bright decision was made</p>
<p>to associate visio with the business class licensing only (personal/home/student can only lament). Your best bet is to get the standalone Visio&nbsp;(which is not included in any 'Office'
</p>
<p>product suite).</p>

            <p>You are hosed. There is NO "Office 365" bundle that includes Visio or Project. So why are they called "Office" (don't ask me!).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, even "standalone" Visio has that unfortunate interaction with "consumer" Office licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is, as a "consultant", you are using Office to make money. Office 365 Personal is a "consumer" license that does not allow that type of use.&nbsp; "Officially" you are supposed to be using a business license for Office, therefore you would not
 have this problem ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory, if MS figures out you are "misusing" your "Personal" subscription this way they can cancel it. Or worse ...

<h2>            Insider Green Screen Crash, endless &#34;Preparing...&#34; Loop</h2>
                    <p>Running the latest Insider version and encountered this Green Screen</p>

<p>(Sorry about the orientation!)</p>
<p>After experiencing this I got an endless loop of Preparing Automatic Repair. I went to an Acronis backup to restore my system, that backup on an external HD was reported as corrupt. Moved the backup to an internal drive and disconnected all external devices.
 Suddenly the system came back. With a few login glitches I was back up and running.</p>
<p>I then reconnected all external drives and erased the old Acronis backups. To cover myself I ran a new Acronis backup. CRASH, again. I've&nbsp;</p>
<p>tried everything this time, but cannot seem to recover the system.</p>
<p>While in the in the working phase I created a new restore point just to be safe. Since the latest crash all attempts to restore this or other restore points have failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope someone has some answers.</p>

<p>Yeah! I finally got my computer back up, that’s back up, not backup. I was up all night last night trying different things. Not sure what finally solved it. I finally opened up the box and disconnected all of the drives but my SSD system drive; removed all
 external USB devices; even moved the jumper to reset the CMOS. I also tried some of the HP power button/windows key combinations to try and reset the BIOS and other things, but don’t think any of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i couln’t get any of my just created USB and DVD to boot the system. They seemed to load, but a white box outline flashed either in the center of the screen or at the left edge on a normal MS blue bacground and then the screen would darken and nothing further
 would happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i finally tried the DVD I used over a year ago to install Windows 10. I booted. But it still couldn’t intall 10 because the boot drive was the wrong format. Just for fun I rebooted again and tried the SanDisk USB I had cleaned in Dispart to remove their
 partitions and used Rufus to create the boot disk from the Windows .ISO file. For some reasonit now booted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the start of the install I had to use the Custom option and remove all the original partitions and let the install reformat the drive to allow the install on the UEFI system. But eventually all worked and I got the system back up with all internal and
 external drives running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to do a LOT of updates once it was running and I’m probably not going back to Acronis for backups since it appears this all started with a conflict between TrueImage and the Insider release. I never particularly liked it, but it seemed to be working.
 Still wish Semantec would revive Ghost. It always worked and saved me several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tomorrow starts the long process of reinstalling all of my software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone for tne comments and suggestions!</p>

            Hi Airizarry,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The limit for workflow associations is 100 per list/library. Exceeding this limit will degrade browser performance due to the large volume of data that is loaded for more than 100 associations and their status columns.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To learn more workflow limits in SharePoint, see the <strong>Workflow</strong> section in<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc262787.aspx#Workflow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this page</a>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim

<p>I am using Google Debleena but it did the same thing with whichever search provider I tried.</p>
<p>I had to remove IE9 last night - came across a major problem in that it would not let me post in the University forum - having typed quite a long post I was none too pleased!!</p>
<p>Anyway the up shot is that once removed I was able to post in the forum as usual and the search display problems were all back to normal with no italics.&nbsp; So definitely a couple of teething problems there.</p>
<p>Because I had to remove IE9 in a hurry last night I now have no way of submitting feedback, is this possible by some other means from IE8 please?</p>

<p>Hi, I'd like to add that I'm experiencing a similar problem which also seems to affect Arial fonts on web pages, i.e. they are displayed in Italics.</p>
<p>I did a system restore to get revert the PC prior to he IE9 install as I noticed windows updates were undertaken at a similar time to the the IE9 install so figured there may have been a clash.</p>
<p>After the restore&nbsp;the the fonts were back to normal in IE8.&nbsp; I then re-installed IE9 and, yet again, the web pages and google entry and result lists display in italics.</p>
<p>As an aside, I also updated my wife's HP laptop and that hasn't experienced the same issue.</p>
<p>Any ideas welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Italic Font Fix Solution For Internet Explorer 9!!!</strong></p>
<p>All my text went Italic and I could not get&nbsp;the font&nbsp;to go back to normal. Reinstalling IE9 will NOT fix this problem but this will...</p>
<p><strong>I found a solution for internet 9 explorer Win7 users! <br />
</strong>Go to your Control Panel, then click on Fonts. Drag the "Times New Roman" and "Courier New" icon onto your desktop, then drag it back onto your Control Panel Fonts window. It will ask you if you want to reinstall the Font click "Yes To All".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the inconveniences this issue has caused. As this issue doesn't happen on PowerPoint Online, it may be related to the add-ins or other software. Please check if this issue could be fix in the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe
 Mode</a>&nbsp;of your Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this issue is related to the settings of your LG Ultrafine 5K 27" display or if it's caused by the PowerPoint application, I'm wondering if you have another display. If you do, I'd appreciate it if you could connect your Mac to it and see if
 this same issue could reproduced to help us identify the cause of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, if my above suggestion couldn't help, I'd appreciate it if you could confirm the following information so that we could further investigate this issue for you:</p>
<p>1. When did this issue first happened? And before this happened, was there any special operation on your Mac (for example updating PowerPoint or macOS to a new version, installing or updating of a particular software, etc.?)</p>
<p>2. Please capture a screenshot of this issue and share it with us;</p>
<p>3. Please click PowerPoint in the top menu &gt; select About PowerPoint &gt; capture a screenshot of the version information;</p>
<p>4. Please click the Apple icon in the top menu &gt; select About this Mac &gt; capture a screenshot of the information about your MacOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>Development of the individual programs is done separately, so it is possible that Outlook has not yet been updated to handle high 4k/5k resolution.&nbsp; (Sorry, I don't have access to a Mac, so I can't check).</p>

            Office 2000 is now two decades old and has not been supported by Microsoft since&nbsp;July 14, 2009. It is also not compatible with Windows 10. Although you may be able to reinstall it and get it running again, it will likely never be fully functional and may
 compromise your system's security.

                    How can I unlock an image on a slide master I received? &nbsp;The image shows up as the background on slides, but when I go into the slide master, there are no images visible on the master or layouts (or even in the selection pane). &nbsp;It appears that the background
 may be a "fill with picture," but I need to isolate the image so I can copy and manipulate the background image. &nbsp;Any ideas would be greatly appreciated...thanks!&nbsp;

            A line can be made a variety of ways. Before proceeding, make sure the document is not protected by going to the Tools menu and making sure the Protect Document option is displayed. If it says Unprotect Document, then choose that option to unprotect the
 document.<br />
<br />
If the line is a shape, then when you click on the line it will become selected and you can press the delete key to delete the line.<br />
<br />
If the line is part of a form field, when you click the line it should select the form field. Press the delete key to delete the form field.<br />
<br />
If the line is part of a table, when you click the line you should see the table outline. Click on the outline of the table to select the table and then press the delete key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
If the line is an underline made by pressing the space bar a bunch of times and then formatting the spaces as underlline, then select the spaces and toggle the underline off.<br />

            1. This is a limitation with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . .

<p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current design of Outlook.com does not have the option to show users how much storage space is used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Storage space for your Outlook.com email is ever-growing,</strong> but
<strong>if </strong>the amount of email in your inbox and folders grows too fast, it may bump up against the account's quota, and you might not be able to send or receive any messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People who send you email will get an error message that your inbox is full. </p>
<p>
</p><p>See this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Free-up-storage-in-Outlook-com-7ac99134-69e5-4619-ac0b-2d313bba5e9e?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>
