<h2>            Where my desktop &#40;and living room&#41; are.</h2>
                    <p>Thank you Microsoft for your previews of windows 10.&nbsp; With windows 10 my desktop which is located in my living room&nbsp;has moved (according to your location finder (geo referencing)) every day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew the internet was great for exploring new places of interest.&nbsp; But I never knew the it would put any good moving company like two guys and a truck out of business.&nbsp; I wish I could move this easy before windows 10!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downside is when I ask Cortana if I need a jacket I then have to check the "local news" to find out where Cortana thinks me, my desk top, and living room are located today to know if she is giving me accurate weather information for my house location!&nbsp;
 I do not yet have a windows phone.&nbsp; but only hope the location finder on them works better.&nbsp; I can only imagine turn by turn navigation when it thinks your in another location then you are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure what is not helping is my ISP's POP is&nbsp;a 4 hour drive from where I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is their any way to hard set my desk top location?</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes I have provided feed back on this via windows feedback</p>

<h2>            NOKIA LUMIA 610,I need a Change.........Symbian is better than WindodwPhone</h2>
                    
<p>When I bought the phone Lumia 610 2 days ago (5-Aug-2012),I was very happy and thought that Like the N72 (my previous mobile) this one will be much better and&nbsp; I buy it,just because it has the BRAND NAME "NOKIA" ,but now I regret it that WHY I have not checked
 online regarding its various issues.Most importantly its bluetooth problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if I need to transfer any file of various extension viz. *.jpg,,*.xls,*.doc,etc. from my friend,I will have to ask him to either mail me or to use "SKYDRIVE",and we all know for sure that every one does not have an account on "SKYDRIVE" and both "SKYDRIVE"
 and "E-Mail" need internet connection,and in India,internet connection in mobile is not common.Don't to yu all think it is more time consuming to upload a file and download the same (which again depend upon the internet connection &amp; speed) than sending it
 through bluetooh .when I know the file lies just in his hand (mobile) and if I had a blue tooth file transfer facility in my mobile "LUMIA 610" it could have been done in just few minutes.Now I feel I was fool that I bought this "LUMIA 610" ( So I say My N72
 was much much better than LUMIA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't even download a file like,*.zip,*.exe,*.msi,*.rar,etc. from differnt website,all because the browser in LUMIA say "This file format is not supported by this device".....I know its not supported by the device,I want to download it ,so that I can,later,
 transfer it in my computer.You would say I can do the download directly in my computer,WELL YES,I can do that,but In case of large size files,I think it is better to keep the mobile open for downloading ,than desktop or laptop. ( So I say My N72 was much much
 better than LUMIA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want ask Nokia technician and people concern in NOKIA community,can I expect the following changes in my Nokia Lumia 610 from you people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1). Complete Bluetooth facility (atleast file (of all type) transfer facility)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2). A good browser,so that I can download ,whatever file I want,whether support or not by the windows mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)A file manager (like the one you have in SYMBIAN OS ),so that I can take a full advantage of my mobile hard disk/drive,manage my files by putting it in my choice of folder(s)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. A good PC SUITE ,not this stupid ZUNE,which will support the transfer of all types of file (Like the one you provide for SYMBIAN Mobiles.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF NOT ALL THESE THEN TELL ME IS IT POSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE OPERATING SYSTEM OF NOKIA LUMIA 610 TO ANY OTHER BEST AVAILABLE SYMBIAN OS. I feel that ,when it come to mobile OS ,NOKIA's SYMBIAN is much much better than WINDOWS phone/mobile OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you people would reply positively and quickly because if all these changes are not possible,then I would be selling this stupid LUMIA to some one else,and would have look at some other handset/mobile,possibly of some other company,because at the same
 range I m getting a good product. (DON'T TELL ME THAT I MADE A MISTAKE BY BUYING LUMIA,ALL I DID WAS TRUSTING A BRAND "NOKIA" WHICH I WAS USING SINCE LONG TIME)</p>

<p>Sorry you feel this way. Personally I think the Lumia 610 is a great phone with a fantastic price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SkyDrive is included free with your Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would you want to download msi, exe, etc? You can't use those files on any phone. Why not download those on the device you are going to use them on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) This will not be possible until Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>2) This has nothing to do with the browser. It has to do with OS restrictions and security measures.</p>
<p>3) This will not be possible until Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>4) This has nothing to do with Zune. It has to do with OS restrictions and security measures. Zune has been scrapped and will no longer be used with Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Lumia 610 will not be able to run Windows Phone 8. It is not possible to change the OS to Symbian.</p>

            so its not possible to transfer file directly to my phone(except music,video,podcast) and if i want to transfer excel file,pdf file then i will have to do it indirectly through email or skydrive(in both cases uploading and download the same depending on
 internet connection) ..... that very time consuming(bad).since full bluetooth facility and file managering system wull be available in WIN8,then I think I made a mistake by buying WIN7 based phone,However one of the person from Nokia customerCare contacted
 me through email and said that these feature will be included in the update of phone software,If true,I thanks to the developers of the Nokia comunity in advance and hope such update will be available very soon,since such updates are possible than changing
 the OS. I hope someone in this forum confirm me the same(about the updates). Thanks &amp; Regards.

            so far the builtin browser is concern,I would suggest UC browser,which I m using right now in my Lumia,which is much better than Internet Explorer im phone.

            if not updates,another solution to these problem could be that the nokia developer could develop an application which after installing in WIN7 phone,would help in file transfering (either by bluetooth or mass storage) files of all types by bypassing the
 WIN7 phone restrictions.I hope these suggestion would result in some fruitfull solution\outcome.

<p>It is not possible for any app to bypass WP7.5 OS restrictions like no bluetooth file transfer and no mass storage mode. Neither will they be done away with with WP7.8 update which is mainly a UI upgrade. These restrictions go to the core of the OS and you
 are stuck with them. The Nokia care reply has given you false hopes which is regrettable.</p>

    <title>Formula for auditing tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kari p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula for auditing tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating an auditing tool with 5 categories to be scored. I am trying to create a formula that will let me add the sum for the row of the audit, however divide by the "possible score" and multiply by 10. I want to add a condition that if 1 cell is left
 blank that it will not be included in the sum so the score will not be lowered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible to do? I tried a SUMIF =(SUMIF(B5:F5,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"")/SUM($B$3:$F$3))*10 formula but it was still dividing like there was an option to score in the category.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: You can score a 10 all together, however if 1 category was not audited, Cell E3(or the one that was not used) will be blank, therefore the possible score will not be picked up in our range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! </p>

<p>I think this is what you actually want:<br />
</p>
<p>=SUM(B5:F5)/SUMIF(B5:F5,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"",$B$3:$F$3)*10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For scoring purposes, it is handy to use a weighting function:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMPRODUCT(B5:F5,$B$3:$F$3)/SUMIF(B5:F5,"&lt;&gt;"&amp;"",$B$3:$F$3)*10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where B3:F3 has relative weights for the factors (a weight of 2 is twice the weighting as a 1, but half that of a 4, for example), and B5:F5 have scores that are, say, 1 to 10 or blank.</p>

<h2>            importing data from multiple workbooks</h2>
                    I want to create a workbook with a list of all excel files in a folder and data from a specific cell (E7 - Balance Due) in each of those files.&nbsp; I've managed to get the list of files using a query but can't figure out how to get the data from cell E7.&nbsp;
 Any help is appreciated.

 the actual sheet name that you have in those files - for all the workbooks in that current folder.</p>

<p><span>Hi EMBN.Edirisinghe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, as you are using the Education A1 for students subscription which doesn’t include the license for downloading the Office 2016 applications, the issue happens in your environment.</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference:
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://products.office.com/en-us/academic/compare-office-365-education-plans</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For checking if you can get the free Office 2016 applications, I suggest you go to
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education?ms.officeurl=students" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://products.office.com/en-us/student/office-in-education?ms.officeurl=students</a> and type your school email address to see if you can finish the sign-up. If yes, you can get the Office 2016 applications.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Cliff</span></p>

<h2>            How To Create a Drop Down List Item that Calculates Percentage</h2>
                    <p>Hey,<br />
So I've looked around all over google and I tried searching these forums but I couldn't find any mention of this.<br />
<br />
I have a drop down list with all kind of items, each has it's own price, I was wondering if it would be possible, and if so then how, to add an item that if used, would calculate the percentage of all the previous chosen items.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
200 &nbsp; &nbsp;Wood &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $1,000<br />
52 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cement &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$500<br />
12 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Screws &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $50<br />
1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10% &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $155<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;$1705</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 renaming file extensions from Samba share - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beta6nine9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 renaming file extensions from Samba share</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am having a problem where when dragging and dropping an attachment from a Samba share, it changes the extension to all upper case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on linux and in the windows explorer, I will have "file1.txt" and "something.lic", go to compose an email, and drag the files to the email.&nbsp; I then look at the attachment bar and they are now named "file1.TXT" and "something.LIC".&nbsp; This is a problem because
 every time I send an email with this to a customer, I have to tell them to rename the extension as all lower case because our software requires the case be lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest updates for Windows 10 and Office 2016 and am pulling out the remaining 3 strands of hair!&nbsp; Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi beta6nine9,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further assist you with this concern, I would like to know more information. Kindly answer the following questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of email account are you using? (POP, IMAP or Exchange)</li><li>Does the issue happens to all attached files?</li><li>Have you tried manually attaching the files using the
<strong>Attach File</strong> option?</li><li>Are those files still accessible even if the extension format is on upper case?</li><li>Are you subscribed to Office 365 subscription?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let's run the application in safe mode. This would help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing the problem. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click Yes when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>safe mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>To notify us and have us get back to you, simply reply to this post. </span>

</p><p>I have the search box named correctly so that is not the issue. I have 2 main issues,&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: even though my range is set from a2:v931 in the error it always puts only the range entered in the first indicator so if its a2:v931 it returns not found in a2:v2 if I put a4:v999 it still returns not found in a4:v4 so it
 isn't searching my range.</p>
<p>2: even when I put the word I am searching for in cell a2 it still doesn't find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is whooping my butt. I got the macro from thespreadsheetguru.com. he skips how to join the vba with the box so I am unsure if if that is my issue? as of now my text box named user search has no macro just is a regular
 text box for entering the search item. my "button" shape has the macro assigned.</p>

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
There is no out-of-the box feature to set permission restriction on editing column in SharePoint Online.
<br />
<br />
However, some third-party tools or java scripts may achieve this feature. Here are some threads for your reference:<br />

<h2>            Outlook.com Rule Filters Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have rules set up to delete specific spam emails from junk to deleted. &nbsp;I find a lot of useful emails end up in spam so I prefer to limit junk mail accumulation through rules. &nbsp;But the emails come through anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example I have the following rules</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete keyword viagra</p>
<p>Delete sender ****</p>
<p>Delete keyword ****</p>
<p>Delete sender viagra</p>
<p>
</p><p>but just had the following email show up PLUS KEITH1957 IS NOT EVEN MY EMAIL!!! Is that part of the issue?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the inconvenience this may have caused. Let me help you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further investigate with the issue, please let us know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this issue confined to the specific email address?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to create a new rule by following the steps provided by&nbsp;deleting the old rule and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to your Outlook.com account.</li><li>Click on the cog or gear icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Manage rules </strong>from the dropdown.</li><li>Set Condition as <strong>Sender contains</strong>, then enter the complete email address in the next block.</li><li>Under Action set it as <strong>Delete</strong> and click on Create rule.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if you still receive emails after following the steps above to create a rule.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No Sir - it's not confined to a single email address. It's almost as if deleting from junk mail is not permitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the keyword rule is critical because the email addresses are spoofed and ever changing.</p>

            <p>I am having problems similar to this also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get an email from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I CAN create a rule that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If sender contains&nbsp;"*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" move it to junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>^^^ this works ^^^</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to create a rule like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If sender contains&nbsp;"viagra" move it to junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>^^^ &nbsp;This does NOT work ^^^</p>
<p>

<p>

    <title>Merging inventory tables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralphruffolo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging inventory tables</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I hope someone can help us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are in the process of moving over some store inventory data and it needs to be in a format that their system can read. In their system, for every color and for every color's size, there needs to be a SKU. Our current system placed these values in different
 .csv files: one for inventory and one for color/size grids. The color/size grid sheet contains ONLY the items that have color/size options while the inventory contains only the item—as well as everything about the item such as cost,price, etc. Here's our problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What we need is for the tables to be merged in a way that includes sizes/colors for the items that have those options, all while treating each one as its own item.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68962873-3bae-4ec2-b47c-4d66c3a18a94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68962873-3bae-4ec2-b47c-4d66c3a18a94" /></a></p>
<p>As the file contains multiple rows of data and over 14,000 items, to say this is overwhelming to us would be an understatement. There has to be an easy, or less time consuming, way of doing this. I saw someone do something similar to this using VLOOKUP,
 but only with a small amount of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does anyone know exactly how to merge these tables or where to start? Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bello FP2&#58; fails to recognise caller&#39;s number</h2>
                    
<p>I have a contact set up whose number is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>00441234567890</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0044 is UK country code, so I can call her from abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calling out works OK. But if she calls me, the phone shows 1234567890 and does not recognise the caller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia phones generally worked by matching more than 5 or 6 digits against every phone book entry, so this should work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i've checked in the previous answer but this topic it's quite blind</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short we are sending email to our customers , since April 2019 we received a lot of claims by our customer due to email not sent.</p>
<p>We discover that it's only related to MS email&nbsp;ecosystem , live , hotmail , msn outlook</p>
<p>From our smtp service we have high reputation , all best practice applied and completely clean on all public spam list.</p>
<p>and from maillog the message to MS emails it's ok</p>

<p>
</p><p>but the answer was</p>
<p><em>Your IP was blocked by Outlook.com because Hotmail customers have reported email from this IP as unwanted.&nbsp; One possible explanation for this is the automatic forwarding of unfiltered inbound messages, including unwanted messages, to Outlook.com/MSN

</p><p>however i disagree, this probably fix temporary the issue but we still blind about the root cause.</p>

<h2>            phantom email notification</h2>
                    i periodically get a notification tone and the email icon appears on my lower toolbar even though there is no new message.&nbsp; Emptying my deleted folder removes the icon, even if nothing was in the deleted folder. How can I get this to stop??

            Phantom.. That sounds like me :P<br />
<br />
Alright, jokes apart. Lets fix up your Outlook.<br />
<br />
Do you use any Antivirus application that scans your Outlook emails?<br />
Turn the antivirus integration with the emails.<br />
<br />
Not helpful, then create new Outlook Profile.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

    <title>How to pull data from multiple worksheets based on criteria in two - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to pull data from multiple worksheets based on criteria in two lists</h2>
                    <p>I have a workbook with 25 worksheets pertaining to different suppliers.&nbsp; In each of the supplier sheets there is information that is specific to their equipment and process, but within the same category for each supplier.&nbsp; I need to be able to pull the description
 of each supplier into a comparisson table based on the users selection.&nbsp; I have created two lists that will give the user the option of which supplier and which piece of equipment within that supplier they would like.&nbsp; The probelm I am having is getting a
 lookup function to pull data from different worksheets and different columns within a worksheet for these two criteria.&nbsp; Example below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supplier&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S2</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equipmet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R3</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dimensions&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 135&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 88</p>
<p>Volume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1500</p>
<p>Throughput&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data for these two suppliers is on two different worksheets.&nbsp; Also, in the case of supplier 2 they have at least 3 pieces of equipment (R3) that will be in the third colum on the data for supplier 2.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.</p>

            I have assumed that the table above is in cells A1:C5, and that the tab names match the supplier names exactly. I have further assumed that your equipment names are in row 1 of each sheet, and that the properties for each piece of equipment start in row
 2 and continue down the column.
<div><br />
<div>In cell B3, enter the formula</div>
<div><br />
<div>=INDEX(INDIRECT("'"&amp;B$1&amp;"'!A1:Z100"),ROW($A2),MATCH(B$2,INDIRECT("'"&amp;B$1&amp;"'!1:1"),FALSE))</div>
<div><br />
<div>and copy down and across. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If any of my assumptions are untrue, post small samples of your supplier sheet layouts for the example you showed in your post.</div>

            <p>I would like to be able to make the <em>parent</em> text optional and all of the dependent text ( children)&nbsp; become optional as well but retain their relationship to the parent.&nbsp; For instance,&nbsp; if there is a section like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>High level text heading</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first sub level text</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I want to be able to make the 1. High level text heading&nbsp; option.&nbsp; Subsequently,&nbsp; the
<em>first sub level text </em>and the <em>second sub level text </em>would become optional as well AND retain their outline relationship to the 1.High level text heading - meaning they would not change their indent for the a) and the .1).&nbsp; I have seen this
 done before in Word but I am not sure if it is something native to Word or was some type of Macro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very, very helpful when you need to do mass editing of lots of outline formatted text.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to place the cursor next to the 1. and select optional
 text and the whole outline string became optional.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Numbering levels in a multilevel list have fixed indents in Word, so I don't see a way to do what you are asking, assuming that I understood your question this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can apply numbering levels in the "wrong" order, but you won't like the result. For example, if level 2 numbering is applied at the very beginning of a list and level 1 follows, level 1 will renumber (even though the starting number is set to 1):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Level 2</p>
<p>2. Level 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;--- Level 1 starts at 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word assumes the presence of the "missing" level 1 item. </p>

<p>Hi Mahdi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked using an expired tenant and it is an expected behavior. As far as I know,&nbsp;If you don’t reactivate your subscription while it is in the expired state, it moves into a disabled state, which lasts for 90 days for most subscriptions. In this state,
 your users cann't sign in, but you can still sign in and get to the Office 365 admin center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your screenshot, the status is deprovisioned. In this situation, admins and users no longer have access to the services or Office applications that came with the subscription.&nbsp;At this point, you should no longer be able to sign into exchange admin
 center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>
        </p>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the application isn't compatible anymore with the current build. It would be best if you contact the app developer to check if they have any updates so that you can download and run the app in your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other queries, feel free to contact us.</p>
