            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very familiar with the Zune device but based on what I know, I'd check that the Zune Software is up to date, maybe reinstall the software if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't, maybe you'll find some useful information on this page:</p>

            <p>Thanks for the details. After restarting my computer it downloaded software but irisit is failing to install because my device does not have enough space. But I have formatted the device multiple times. I found a way to make Zune as aexternal hard drive
 and saw that the hard disk is showing only 1GB instead of 80GB. Then I decided to leave the device as is and stop using it. It's not worth investing on the hard disk now. Thanks.</p>

<p>Sync your phone through WMDC (Windows Vista/Windows 7) or ActiveSync(Windows XP) which might be available in the CD provided with your phone. For syncing you also need to have Microsoft Outlook installed for full functionality.</p>
<p>Once you have synced your phone, go to Outlook, Click on Contacts Tab,&nbsp;select&nbsp;Import contacts, give the path of your .vcf file, import the contacts and then press the sync button again.</p>
<p>Viola! You have all your contacts in your phone, right away!!!</p>

            Phenomenal Only prob was to select the vcf files 1 by 1, instead i opened outlook &gt; contacts section &gt; dragged and dropped the vcf files in a batch of 15 each &gt; pressed "save and close" for each contact. little time consuming but was better as no VCF to
 PST or VCF to CSV converters were needed. Thanks for the idea.... or should i say solution :) Regards AK

<p>Do you use Outlook.com app&nbsp;for&nbsp;IOS or built-in mail app&nbsp;to access your email account?</p>

            Thank you but I tried installing from that exact site (third party) but Symantec did not allow it since it was flagged as a malicious file. Does Microsoft have an add-on that does not require using a third party?

<p>The redaction add-in on CodePlex was developed by Microsoft but is no longer supported by the company. Also, I didn't realize before trying it that it doesn't have an installer; the file you can download includes the code, which you must compile with Visual
 Studio or a comparable tool to make an executable add-in. This isn't a simple process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There are no other redaction tools from Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another article,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2015/02/new-redact-assistant-easily-redacts-word-excel-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2015/02/new-redact-assistant-easily-redacts-word-excel-files.html</a>,
 points to a commercial program, <a href="https://new.thepaynegroup.com/security-software-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Redact Assistant from the Payne Group</a>. (Although the article gives the price as $45, the Payne website charges $60. That still seems reasonable, as other commercial redaction tools run as much as $300 for a single user.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the Web for 'redact', there seem to be more redaction tools for use on PDF files. Because Word 2013 can save as or print to PDF, that may give you another path to explore.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to Microsoft Account service on Lumia 930 and Lumia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sydneytechhead  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Microsoft Account service on Lumia 930 and Lumia 520</h2>
                    <p>I reset my <strong>Lumia 930</strong> from Windows 10 Mobile to Windows Phone 8 using the Windows Device Recovery Tool and now can't sign in to my Microsoft Account, so effectively my phone is a "brick".</p>
<p><br />
I have also reset an old <strong>Lumia 520</strong> and have exactly the same issue. This has always had Windows Phone 8/8.1 on it - I just did a hard reset (Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone) to clear the phone and put my user account in.</p>
<p><br />
I have tried both phones multiple times in the last two days, so I suspect this is an issue on the Microsoft server side.&nbsp; I've checked the date/time on the phone and other suggested fixes, but&nbsp;with no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue arises in the following situations:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After resetting the phone when it asks you to sign in to your Microsoft account as part of the setup after reboot (you need to click "cancel" or "set up later" to continue setup)</li><li>When attempting to add a Microsoft account to the email+accounts settings</li><li>When attempting to install an app in the Windows Store</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the phone doesn't even ask you for a user name and password - it simply can't connect to the service in the first place, eg:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; email+accounts</li><li>Select "add an account"</li><li>Choose "Microsoft account"</li><li>Click the "sign in" button in the "Keep our life in sync" screen</li><li>"waiting dots" appear on screen while service tries to connect</li><li>After a few seconds the following error message is displayed:</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">"<em><strong>Can't connect</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>We can't connect at the moment.&nbsp; Wait for a little while and try again</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it's just a matter of Microsoft rebooting the service at their end when they return from their Super Bowl celebrations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be more problematic if they've changed the service sign-on protocol which requires and update to the phone, as I now how no way of upgrading my phone back to Windows 10 without the ability to sign-in and download apps etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the number of other people reporting this issue, I hope it's the former.&nbsp;</p>

            I'm having exactly the same problem. I'm really annoyed because I thought I'd done something to my phone and just restored back to the factory settings, losing all my photos, contacts and apps! I'd like to know what they are going to do about it. I'm definitely
 changing my phone to a more reliable one. This is downright shoddy service and they haven't even had the decency to make a statement about it to allay customer's concerns. Poor service Microsoft. Never again!!! Shove your phones where the sun doesn't shine!!!

            <p>Sounds like Microsoft is working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess it that it's linked to the new Outlook.com rollout, which was 99.9% complete last week:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-migration-to-the-new-outlook-com-is-99-9-percent-done/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bet they turned off the old Outlook.com&nbsp;service at the weekend, which was used as the sign-in for Windows phones.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all, no one at Microsoft uses Windows phones anymore, so it wouldn't have been picked up in testing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be a bit of a scramble to turn it back on again, if this is the case.</p>

<p>I reset my <strong>Lumia 930</strong> from Windows 10 Mobile to Windows Phone 8 using the Windows Device Recovery Tool and now can't sign in to my Microsoft Account, so effectively my phone is a "brick".</p>
<p><br />
I have also reset an old <strong>Lumia 520</strong> and have exactly the same issue. This has always had Windows Phone 8/8.1 on it - I just did a hard reset (Settings &gt; about &gt; reset your phone) to clear the phone and put my user account in.</p>
<p><br />
I have tried both phones multiple times in the last two days, so I suspect this is an issue on the Microsoft server side.&nbsp; I've checked the date/time on the phone and other suggested fixes, but&nbsp;with no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue arises in the following eff du yyrrdrt situations:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After resetting the phone when it asks you to sign in to your Microsoft account as part of the setup after reboot (you need to click "cancel" or "set up later" to continue setup)</li><li>When attempting to add a Microsoft account to the email+accounts settings</li><li>When attempting to install an app in the Windows Store</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Note that the phone doesn't even ask you for a user name and password - it simply can't connect to the service in the first place, eg:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; email+accounts</li><li>Select "add an account"</li><li>Choose "Microsoft account"</li><li>Click the "sign in" button in the "Keep our life in sync" screen</li><li>"waiting dots" appear on screen while service tries to connect</li><li>After a few seconds the following error message is displayed:</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">"<em><strong>Can't connect</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>We can't connect at the moment.&nbsp; Wait for a little while and try again</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it's just a matter of Microsoft rebooting the service at their end when they return from their Super Bowl celebrations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be more problematic if they've changed the service sign-on protocol which requires and update to the phone, as I now how no way of upgrading my phone back to Windows 10 without the ability to sign-in and download apps etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the number of other people reporting this issue, I hope it's the former.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            OneDrive for Android&#58; Certificate Missing</h2>
                    <p>I have OneDrive for Business and I'm using the OneDrive Android app on a HTC phone (in addition to Microsoft Company Portal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Approx. every two months, the OneDrive app will not log me into OneDrive anymore, and instead shows me an error message stating that my organisation's certificate is missing.&nbsp; Each time I try to locate certificates and install them on my phone, and sometimes
 it works, but sometimes it doesn't and I'm stuck.&nbsp; How can I find out which exact certificate OneDrive for Business requires?&nbsp; (Of course, the error message will not tell me.)</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot Open Pinned Excel Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamjonathanwang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Open Pinned Excel Files</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed Office Professional 2013 and I have trouble opening pinned Excel files from the taskbar. When I go to the actual directory, I can open the file fine. It is a pain to have to do that because I've always pinned files to open quickly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, all the pinned files don't have an Excel file logo next to it. It has that orange box like the "Microsoft Office Click to Run Agent" logo. It's the logo that shows up when you install office and it says your office is ready. I've right clicked and
 set all the files to open with Excel, however, it still doesn't open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            You cannot put messages back on the server with POP transports. You'd have to send them back to yourself.

<h2>            Security and Anti-virus</h2>
                    <p>One WTP (Windows Release Preview) no one within Microsoft seems to have mentioned at all so far, is its security, e.g., especially virus/malware protection/Anti-virus software, for example. Of course, WTP includes the Windows Firewall. But, is that enough?
 Regrettably, Microsoft -- given the experimental nature of the OS -- has not included anything remotely close to a link to its WTP software engineering team for any meaningful inquiries to be directly forwarded to it despite its WTP release announcement that
 it had merely released the OS to receive feedback from initial users to be used in improving and tailoring the OS accordingly to avoid another backlash as on Windows 8! In this regard, I am not sure the forums can really be the best answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my own case, there are two testbed PCs running WTP presently. One --&nbsp;64-bit quad-core Intel based --&nbsp;was upgraded from the 64-bit version of the
<em>Windows 7 Ultimate</em>. The&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;installation included the Microsoft <em>
Security Essentials</em>. After upgrading to WTP, SE has simply disappeared without any mention of the consequences running the PC without any anti-virus/malware protection!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second testbed, is a 64-bit quad-core AMD PC. WTP was installed on this machine in a
<em>CLEAN</em> installation. Again, of course, without the benefit of an anti-virus/malware software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two PCs being only <em>testbeds</em>&nbsp;might somehow&nbsp;suggest they do not include any critical information! But unfortunately this is untrue because the two PCs by default link to my
<em>OneDrive</em> and potentially compromising its content. In this case, one might also suggest the disabling of&nbsp;the OneDrive access to the testbeds. It is a working possibility/solution but doing so will essentially compromise the whole idea behind the new
 OS which is its online functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft has something up its sleeve, so to speak, in response to the WTP anti-virus/malware issues that will address the concerns I have outlined here.</p>

<h2>            Why is a sign-in required to edit and save a downloaded Word document on my iPad</h2>
                    I have a paid subscription to Office 365 and have downloaded a Word document to my iPad. When opening the file, it tells me I must "sign-in to edit and save changes to this file." I need to work on files when I don't have Internet accessories to sign in.
 How do I get around this and why is it even required?

            Unfortunately this is the way Mobile MS Office works (on both iOS and Android). The modus operandi is that it uploads the file first to Onedrive and then provides you the ability to edit.
<br />
<br />Hence, you require internet connectivity. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should give this feedback to Microsoft engineers so that they can consider this as part of their product roadmap.

<p>Hi ArmandsPriede,<br />
<br />
Firstly, as said in the screenshot, the issue could be related to the fact that the Mailbox Import Export admin role didn’t take effect. So I would suggest you run the command below to check if the required Mailbox Import Export and Organization Management
 admin roles have taken effect.<br />
1. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connect to Exchange Online with PowerShell</a> using an admin account.<br />
2. Run the command below:<br />
Get-RoleGroupMember "Mailbox Import Export"</p>
<p>Get-RoleGroupMember " Organization Management"<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, could you create a new global admin and assign the Mailbox Import Export role permission to check if you can use the new admin to do the import?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

<p>Hi ArmandsPriede,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. <br />
Firstly, I would like to confirm again whether this admin account is a global admin as described in the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assigning-admin-roles-in-Office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Assigning-admin-roles-in-Office-365-eac4d046-1afd-4f1a-85fc-8219c79e1504?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a><br />
<br />
Moreover, since there are two ways to import the PST files in Office 365 portal, I would confirm which way you has used as said in the articles below:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt684587.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use network upload to encrypt and import PST files to Office 365</a><br />

<p>Hi ArmandsPriede,</p>
<p>I’m here to follow up on this case.</p>
<p>I understand you are using the method(upload files over the network) to import .pst files. And the issue persists on different admin accounts. If anything is misunderstood, please correct me.</p>
<p>For further investigate this issue, please provide the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;The screenshots of the whole steps(please highlight the admin).<br />
2.&nbsp;If the issue always occurs in every .pst files, please provide us an example .pst file(contains some test emails).</p>
<p>To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message to collect them. Please access it by clicking

<h2>            SharePoint Online Checklist Ability</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been asked to create a pre-start custom list online. That's the easy part and for the most part I have completed the list and tested it. It works well however i currently have a column setup that lists items that need to be ticked off. The issue is
 that it is not as functional as it could be. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have the ability to list the item and then have&nbsp; 2 tick boxes for that item so a user can tick YES (to indicate he has checked the item) or tick the secondary option for that item line (this could be either NO or NEEDS ATTENTION)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i achieve this?</p>

<h2>            Rules in Error Cannot move to the &#34;XX&#34; folder Outlook 2003</h2>
                    
<p><span>I had Office Professional 2003 running on an&nbsp;older machine running&nbsp;Microsoft XP Professional. I re-installed the Office Professional 2003 on a new machine running Windows 7 and with trial versions
 of Office 2007 installed.&nbsp;I am using/accessing my email via Outlook using a POP3 mail server.&nbsp;I want to continue using Office 2003 until I can get used to mynew machine and iron out any problems (like the one I am currently experiencing) and also make some
 time to get acclimated with Office 2007 (i.e. I dont have a lot of time to spare right now).</span></p>
<p><span>Here's my problem: When using&nbsp;Outlook 2003 on my new machine,&nbsp; I get an error: "Rules in Error Cannot move to the "XX" folder" when Rules and Alerts are run for incoming email messages. Everyting
 else seems to works fine. I have looked extensively on the internet for solutions, including Microsoft support pages:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/291509?p=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/291509?p=1</a></span></p>
<p><span>I have: * exported, deleted and then re-imported the rules, then tried to run them; * reduced the size of my PST file; * dowloaded and installed any and all updates I could find for Office 2003;
 * did a repair install with the Microsoft Office 2003 discs; * exported all the rules; deleted all the rules and set/ran up one test rule&nbsp; -- ALL WITHOUT SUCCESSS</span></p>
<p><span>The other options I am considering are: 1) moving my Outlook.pst file to a location where the path would be shorter (per option #4 at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886616</a>); or 2) Completely UN-installing anything having to do with Office 2007 from the new machine; or 3) installing Office 2007 (which I bought and have the keys to start
 the trial versions that were installed with the machine), and use Outlook 2007, but still use Word 2003, Excel 2003 and Powerpoint 2003… I am not sure what to do. Option #1 seems easy enough; and options #2
<span>&nbsp;</span>and #3 may to be opening up another set of problems I cannot imagine how to anticipate.</span></p>

            So you created the rule&nbsp;on the new computer and pointed it to the correct folder and it still failed? When you move to a new machine, the rules are looking for the pst on the old machine - once you repoint them to the folder on the new machine it should
 work.

            <p>Hi Hill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data for a form is stored in a SharePoint library. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Store forms and form templates in a centralized location</em></strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><span><em>You can associate a form template with a library, which is a location on a SharePoint site where you can create, collect, update, and manage files with
 other people in your organization. When users fill out forms based on the form template in that library, the completed forms appear in the library along with key information from the forms themselves. Depending on how the SharePoint library is designed, users
 can fill out forms that are based on your form template, export the data from completed forms to Microsoft Office Excel, or merge the data from several forms into one form. The following example shows expense reports stored in a library.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is mentioned here: </span></p>

<p>I hope I'm asking this question in the right area ...... I have downloaded the software program BillQuick CE 2007 from BQE Software into my Samsung i760 running windows Mobile 6 (CE OS 5.2.979 Build 17233.0.1.1).&nbsp;
 I continually receive a native exception error; Exception Code 0x80000002&nbsp; &amp; Exception Address 0x01368328 trying to run this software.&nbsp; I have no other 3rd party software installed on this device. BQE Software says they have had no other problems with BillQuick
 CE 2007 and the Samsungi760&nbsp; with WM6, they advised me to restore my unit to factory settings and reinstall the software, both companies said it is a&nbsp;Windows problem!&nbsp; I tried removing the software, doing soft resets, I deleted Framework.net (I think that
 was the name)&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas or suggestions,&nbsp; thanks for any help in advance!!</p>

<p>Before the hard reset you can try to remove the program first</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start-&gt;settings-&gt;system tab-&gt;remove software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do a soft reset and reinstall the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully that will do it, If not a hard reset should be your next option</p>

    <title>Indexing word document - pagination changes due to addition of index - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeanwinansfisher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indexing word document - pagination changes due to addition of index entries.</h2>
                    When I indexed a word document, the pagination of the original document changed as a result of adding index entries.&nbsp; In other words, I started out with a 46 page document, but ended up with a 52 page document post-indesing.&nbsp; So I had to go back and manually
 change the page numbers in the index.&nbsp; This seems contrary to the whole process o f indexing.&nbsp; Did I do something wrong?&nbsp; If so, how can I do it right next time?

                    When I first start up the computer a black screen pops up that is labeled C:windows\system32\Net.exe . Apparently this is a "feed" but I think it is associated with the error message I noted above. How can I get rid of this feed and hopefully have the

<p>You&nbsp;are seeing the effects of a hijackware infection!</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>
<p>Microsoft PCSafety provides home users (only) with no-charge support in dealing with malware infections such as viruses, spyware (including unwanted software), and adware.<br />

<p>Otherwise...</p>
<p>1. See if you can download/run the MSRT manually: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx</a></p>
<p>NB: Run the FULL scan, not the QUICK scan!&nbsp; You may need to download the MSRT on a non-infected machine, then transfer MRT.EXE to the infected machine and rename it to SCAN.EXE before running it.</p>
<p>2a. WinXP =&gt; Run the Windows Live Safety Center's 'Protection' scan (only!) in Safe Mode with Networking, if need be:<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm</a></p>

http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</a></p>
<p>3. Now run a thorough check for hijackware, including posting requested logs in an appropriate forum, not here. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!!</p>
<p>I can recommend the expert assistance offered in these forums: <a href="http://spywarehammer.com/simplemachinesforum/index.php?board=10.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If these procedures look too complex - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a local, reputable and independent (i.e., not BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop.</p>

<h2>            How Do You Eliminate Groups In Windows 10 Mobile People App</h2>
                    <p>Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On My Lumia 950XL, I of course have the People application where my contacts are stored. There of course three options: Contacts, What's New, and Groups.&nbsp; Under Groups, I have created several groups using the Windows people app application, not the GroupMe
 component.&nbsp; I created most of them when I had a Windows 8.1 phone (Lumia 640). Now, most of these groups (for my job) are obsolete...but I can't delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried taking all of the contacts out of the group, but still no option to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>R:)</p>

</p><p>Thanks so much for the response. It's actually not the contacts that I need to delete; it's the groups of contacts that I have created. I can eliminate the contacts through People.live.com or the People app...but not the groups.</p>
