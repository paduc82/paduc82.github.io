<h2>            Account Stealing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Microsoft Enforcment Team. Today I was playing Minecraft with my two friends when I got a message from a stranger who's GamerTag was
<strong>[Moderator removed]</strong>. He said that there had been many complaints that the account I was using had been stolen, and he requested my account information. I told him no and he said that I needed to either change my GamerTag, give him my information,
 or he would ban me, I haven't got any other message about it or an email so I am not sure. I talked to a very kind woman on Xbox support who's name was Abegail and she told me I should report it to you guys. Again his GamerTag is
<strong>[Mod removed]</strong> thanks!</p>

<p>Unfortunately support gives the wrong information when it comes to the enforcement team. You need to file a complaint via the console in order for the enforcement team to investigate and take action. They do not take reports via the forums and don't actually
 read these parts of the forums. Calling out other gamers is not allowed on the forums.</p>

When i start the restore, I get "No disk that can be used for recovering the system disk can be found".<br />
I have even installed win 7 on the new 320 drive in hopes that it would allow the recovery, it does not......

            I finally just got it working.&nbsp; Trying to go from a 500gb drive to another 500gb drive and getting the same error.&nbsp; I went into Diskpart and type "select disk=0".&nbsp; Then I type "detail disk" to make sure I had the right drive.&nbsp; I typed "Clean", and then&nbsp;"exit"
 to get out of Diskpart.&nbsp; And then I started the image recovery and finally it works.&nbsp; Before I did these commands I had formatted the drive to one large partition, set the partition to active, and made sure it had a drive letter&nbsp;assigned.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Douglas M -&nbsp;&nbsp; I followed your instructions and installed the kobosetup.exe software.&nbsp;&nbsp; No problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is that my Windows 10 is simply not recognizing the "Kobo Touch"&nbsp; device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Kobo ereader says that it is connected to my PC and charging, BUT it isn't there.&nbsp;&nbsp; No device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked for an updated driver,&nbsp; no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a lot about individuals having problems with their Kobo ereaders on Windows 10, but it worked under Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just thought that perhaps Microsoft might have a resolution for the problem that would be in a future OS update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lot of experience with systems and computers, but this one has really stumped me..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            KB3201845 - USB connected WD My Book stopped working</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed as part of the WIndows automatic updates the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3201845).&nbsp; All appeared to go well - no hanging, no error messages and a reported "successful install" in the WIndows
 Update History log.&nbsp; However, two days after the install my weekly scheduled backup to a USB connected WD My Book starting running as it always has done using the WD Smartware.&nbsp; And so it ran, and ran, and ran, but it became obvious that no data was actually
 being written to the drive itself.&nbsp; The My Book was unlocked, all volumes and files were clearly visible and accessible through Windows File Manager.&nbsp; The device was also reported as working correctly in Device Manager so the disk itself appeared to be OK,
 but something is now interfering with the backup routine.&nbsp; Any suggestions as to where I should start looking or what may be worth trying?</p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I take your recommended actions, I have a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; From the information already supplied, what makes you think that there may be a data/disk problem on my C: drive?&nbsp; I have not experienced any problems other than the reported problematic backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I'm not happy about downloading unknown free software.&nbsp; Surely use of the built-in Windows Event Viewer will allow me to find the chkdsk log and provide it in notepad form for you to view.&nbsp; Yes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; My NVIDIA Graphics card is set to notify me of updates.&nbsp; I have installed many of them over the years.&nbsp; Your supplied link implies that I am to run an update dated 2009.&nbsp; Why do you suggest that I roll back my software by 7 years?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; My reported problem is utilising the USB connection.&nbsp; Why then do you suggest for me to update my
<span><span>Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller when this hardware is for my Gigabit Ethernet connections?&nbsp; (i.e. not my USB hub)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp; I am familiar with Nirsoft and have used some of the available utilities in the past.&nbsp; Having looked at the Nirsoft site I see that Driver View comes in two versions; standard and x64.&nbsp; You didn't mention it in your response so am I correct
 to assume you mean for me to use the x64 version?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>When I look at files from another computer I normally make suggestions regardless as to whether it is directly related to a user complaint. It is my belief that a computer performs better
 and is less prone to generate system errors if it is kept up to date. Eliminating unrelated errors helps to make underlying problems more noticeable.</span></span></p>

 These reports are stored in the System Volume Information folder which is not easily accessible. Treesize gets round that problem when Run as Administrator.</span></span></p>

            <p>Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week ago I had an irritating issue of my backup software not running correctly.&nbsp; After following your advice I ended up with 3 days of mayhem.&nbsp; I have now spent a considerable amount of time rebuilding my system and solving all the issues caused by your
 bull-in-a-china-shop approach.&nbsp; Needless to say, I will not be following any of your advice in the future.</p>
<p>

<h3> crumblyigloo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t download ISO files</h2>
                    <p>2 days ago, the site winworldpc.com was "down." I checked again yesterday and today, but it is still down. &nbsp;When I download ISOs from Getintopc.com, It takes me to this website, "http://filehoslguru.com/DedicatedRequest.php." I do not need a server. I can
 download fine from PCRiver though. I even unchecked ISO in WinRAR from "Associate WinRAR with:" but got the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Should I wait until next week or tomorrrow? Are their servers down but they're making no attempt to fix them?</p>

<h3> todd haehn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable High CPU</h2>
                    I am experiencing high CPU usage on the Antimalware Service Executable on my Surface Pro i7 1 tb (2017).&nbsp; This has been going on for a couple of months.&nbsp; It makes my computer almost unusable.&nbsp; The CPU sits at 100% any time I try to use it.&nbsp; The CPU has
 over 50% usage when nothing is being run in the foreground all the time (24 hours a day).&nbsp; &nbsp; The April update was just installed and the Antimalware Service Executable is still running at over 40% of the CPU utilization.

<p>Ok, I get on my xbox, haven't been on in a week, looking forward to playing Gears of War 2.. But.. I notice I got demoted all the way from level 86 back to level 1.&nbsp;All that hard work for nothing. I never boosted. Never cheated. I didn't do anything that
 would make me be demoted. I would just like to know if anyone knows why this happened. Help please?</p>

<p>If your war journal was reset also, it's because your xbox connected to live at the same time GOW was loading "something." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which means epic sucks at programming.</p>
<p>There have been multiple complaints filed with the BBB for them releasing such crap, yet they will keep your money and offer nothing.</p>

<p>I had the same problem I was around level 76 or 77 enjoying my climb to 100 and then out of no where the game locks up i restart the 360 and I am back to level 1. That is really annoying plus all the camos I unlock from the calander events are also gone...
 And then Fenix rising comes out and now you can prestige? GREAT... The other problem I have is when ever I play ANY game mode it boots me from the room and puts me with bots for a good 30 to 45 mins before anyone else can join... I loved this game a lot more
 them MW3 but it pisses me off when ever I start the game and just see everything is gone... Did i mention I have had 8 broken 360's since it has been out?</p>

<h2>            Mic&#47;Audio problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    Everytime I receive a call the sound &amp; mic stop working. If I disconnect the call &amp; do a test (tools/options/audio settings) everything is working fine. This is a new problem since I switched to windows 10. I have 2 different computers but am experiencing
 the same problem with both so I believe this is a Skype/Windows issue

            <p>Hola WooliestFever08,</p>
<p>Si está solicitando una tarjeta VISA canjeada desde la Bóveda, tenga en cuenta que solo puede hacer una compra de igual o menor valor con esa tarjeta. Para cualquier problema con la facturación, debe comunicarse con el proveedor de la tarjeta a través de la página prepaiddigitalsolutions.com con la que utilizó para canjear o con el Soporte de Microsoft (http://support.xbox.com/contact-us).</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t I have available partnerships in Sync Center&#63;</h2>
                    I'm new to Windows Sync Center.&nbsp; Should I be able to set up a partnership between my Windows Vista Business desktop PC and my Windows 7 Pro slate?&nbsp; This is a home LAN environment.&nbsp; No Windows domains involved.&nbsp; Both PCs have the same workgroup name.&nbsp; They
 communicate fine over the LAN in my home.&nbsp; Both have offline files enabled.&nbsp; And in facdt, the laptop uses some offline files on the desktop (though not very efficiently but that's another question).&nbsp; But when I go to the Sync Center task that I think is meant
 to show available partnerships, I don't see any available partnership on either PC.&nbsp; Am I supposed to?&nbsp;

            No, I have not set up a sync partnership in Sync Center.&nbsp; That's why I'm asking if I'm supposed to be able to.&nbsp; When I open&nbsp;the&nbsp;Synch Center "Set up new sync partnerships" option on either of the two computers, there are no options listed.&nbsp; That's what
 I was referring to when I wrote, "I don't see any available partnership on either PC."

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since both the computers are running the Windows OS the sync relationship will happen only if the device is compatible as described in the article that was provided earlier.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Sync-Center-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync Center: frequently asked questions</a>
</span></p>
<p>If you want to setup file and print sharing, then you can do so that way but the sync center will not work in this situation.</p>

            I'm afraid I am not being clear. There are no mobile devices involved in my question. Two computers. That's all. Just the two computers described in the original post. I read the article. I realize sync center syncs devices. But I understand sync relationships
 exist among computers too.

    <title>The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teresa_in_scv  say:</h3>
<h2>            The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.</h2>
                    When using a USB flash drive, I cannot save any .html file I open.&nbsp; I can save .doc files and .jpg files on the flash drive, just not .html files.&nbsp; When I save them to the desktop, I can save them.&nbsp; When I take the fash drive to a Windows XP machine, I
 can save them.&nbsp; I even tried copying them to a different flash drive but got the exact same results (the second flash drive works perfectly on the Windows XP machine also).&nbsp; The error I get when I try to save is "The process cannot access the file because
 it is being used by another process".&nbsp; I tried rebooting repeatedly, that was no help.<br />
<br />
I was also having a problem with the computer telling me there might be a problem with the flash drive when I plugged it in and that I should run the scan and fix utility.&nbsp; When I did that (several times on both flash drives), it said there was no problem,
 but prompted me to run the scan and fix the next time I plugged it in.&nbsp; I found on the internet an article saying I needed to run chkdsk /f at the command line to fix that.&nbsp; I did and it worked.&nbsp; But I still have the original problem of not being able to save
 .html files.<br />
<br />
Help!!!!

<h3> doughumphry  say:</h3>
<h2>            contacts first name last name live mail</h2>
                    I am using Windows Live Mail in Windows 7. When I enter a new contact, it prompts me to enter "first name" and "last name". I do that, but when I use the contact in a new email message, it always displays the contact as "LASTNAMEFIRSTNAME". I can outwit
 it by reversing my input to put the first name in "last name" and last name in "first name" but it is crazy to do this.

            <p>Hi, Sachin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same problem and resetting my computer to it's default pre-installed programs solved the problem. Resetting my computer takes a very long time, so if you could give us reasons as to why the problem happened in the first place would help us
 a lot too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to add that the Windows Store would not launch as I clicked on it's link on my taskbar&nbsp;at the same time&nbsp;when I had problems opening my photos as mentioned above. I was trying to perhaps reinstall the Photos app through Windows Store, but
 since Windows Store had problems as well, no hope there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

            Hi Sarah, <br /><br />I’d love to help! I’m not sure if your prior threads, but I have a few questions if you don’t mind. <br /><br />Wired mouse, hooked up to desktop or laptop? Make and Model if possible?<br /><br />Does the cursor only move in one particular application, or while you’re doing anything? Word, web browser, navigating around your desktop, etc.<br /><br />And when did this problem start occurring? <br /><br />Any info you could give me would help a great deal! Thanks!<br />- C
