<p>We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some
<strong>AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series</strong> adapters. </p>
<p>The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for
<strong>all versions of Windows 10</strong> to delete the <strong>22.19.128.0 driver</strong> from the system and recover the recommended driver version (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Start <strong>Device Manager</strong>. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> icon, and then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>, and <strong>right-click</strong> the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and verify driver version is <strong>22.19.128.0</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall Device</strong>.</li><li>Check the box that says, "<strong>Delete the driver software for this device.</strong>” This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.</li><li>The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select any device, then click <strong>Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</li><li>If the recommended driver (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>) is re-installed and this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here. (Repeat steps 1-3 to verify that the correct driver version is installed). Otherwise follow the next step to check for
 the driver using Windows Update.</li><li><strong>Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security</strong>, then <strong>Check for updates</strong> and install any available updates.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Summer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. If you are game sharing and your friend is set as home, then it will revert to their subscriptions. So if they have gold and game pass it will be available to you also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Batman Arkam City - Game add-on redeem codes - already registered</h2>
                    
<p>Hello - I am sure there are many more people out there that have just received Batman Arkham City for Christmas and have recieved the message "this code has already been redeemed" for the game addon "PLAY as CATWOMEN DOWNLOAD".</p>
<p>Can I please have a specific response from the forum moderators as to why a brand new "sealed" game could have had the codes duplicated or compromised?</p>

<p>Cheers...</p>

<p>[/quote]Forum Moderators don't work for MS so we could not really help with that issue.
<br />
<br />
You would need to contact&nbsp;Rocksteady (the games developers)&nbsp;about the code not working if trying different letters does not help you.
<strong>But I remember when the game came out there was an issue with the Catwoman codes not working correctly.</strong><br />
So if you still have no joy give&nbsp;the developers&nbsp;a shout and no doubt they will be able to help you :).</p>

<p>I've had exactly the same experience with the code as nullnvoids and there was nothing wrong with the way I entered the code. &nbsp;Clearly the games were shipped with the same code in multiple boxes as I've seen this same complaint in many threads.</p>

<p>Grey Pilgrim is correct, when Arkham City was first released, alot of people had issues redeeming the Catwoman content..but subsequent patches should have resolved this.

<p>You might want to contact Rock Steady by email to ask them to look into this issue for you *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 freezes</h2>
                    I've tried everything to update my Xbox 360 and it works just fine until I update it. As soon as I update it it freezes just after start up. If I'm lucky it'll make it to the dash board. I know it the update since I've ruined two know with this update
 and two USB drives. Why can't I wipe this stuff off the hard drive and start over. That what I would do at work is wipe it and start over.

<p>hi there is a reset for updates but first have you tried to remove the hard drive and see if it will work if not then here there are:</p>
<p>Reset XBOX 360 Failed System Updates</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With the console off, press and hold the sync up button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;While holding the sync button press the power button to turn on the console</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Continue to hold the sync button until the Console has booted up completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;During the boot process the console should clear any failed updates, allowing you to use it normally.
</p>
<p>Reset XBOX 360 All Installed Game Updates</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to the "system" blade</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select "memory"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press Y on the HD symbol</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press X,X, Left Bumper, Right Bumper, X,X</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A message will appear saying: "Do you want to perform maintenance on your Xbox 360 storage devices?"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Yes </p>
<p>hope that helps :)</p>

<p>It goes hay wire and has glitches in the start up they'll be pixels missing the as soon as the home comes up it'll freeze up with out any flash or hard drives runs like a champ. I tried the USB thing again the page asking to manually upgrade wouldn't even
 come up just asked me if I wanted to configure the flash drive. As soon as I configure it and restart the machine it starts all over again.

<h2>            Microsoft Photos App stopped creating auto albums</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I loved the auto-album creation feature of the Microsoft Photos App which used to group some of the photos saved around the same time into a album with a date as the album name. But some time back (around a month back, can't tell specific details as
 I have not reset my app while troubleshooting so all such albums are not gone), this feature stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting the app from Settings app, It is not even creating the albums which were previously auto-created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some version information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows : Windows 10 Home Single language, Build 15063.540, 64 bit</p>
<p>Photos App version - latest - 2017.35071.13510.0 (although not sure since which version the issue started but the issue started around a month or 50 days back)</p>

</p><p>You mentioned that the issue with Photos app started around a month or so, there might be updates that are waiting to be installed on your device. We suggest that you check for updates manually. If there are, kindly install them and restart your device.
 After restarting the device, see if the Photos app would start to create albums automatically. Here's how to manually check for updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>I </strong>to open the <strong>
Settings </strong>app.</li><li>From <strong>Settings</strong>, click <strong>Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>
Windows Update</strong> &gt; <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi David, I have already provided the version details of both Windows and Photos app. They both are up to date and have been up to date since 1 year now. I have auto updates enabled so I always get the latest version as soon as its launched. In fact, in
 the last month or so, the Photos App has been updated 3-4 times.</p>
<p>Let me know if any other information is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I checked in Event Viewer and did not see any related error / warning logs.</p>

<p>Other than that, I have tried the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Downloaded and ran the Windows App troubleshooter from microsoft support page - https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps.</li><li>Tried removing all the folders from source list of photos app and adding them back</li><li>Uninstalling the photos app from windows powershell and then installing it back from store.</li></ol>
<p>I must also mention that I also have this issue of not being able to edit photos in the photos app as mentioned in this discussion - https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos-winpc/photos-app-crashes-when-attempting-to-edit/5bc000c9-bc75-4f98-8640-72e4b1ebc51e</p>

            One test you could do is to use File Explorer to change the Date Taken of several photos to the current date. &nbsp;That should result in a new album.

            It doesn't. It's equivalent to adding/saving more photos into the source list folders and I do that time to time.

            Yes, I was just making sure the problem was still present on your machine. &nbsp;At this point we're all just speculating so feel free to ignore this. &nbsp;Another test you could make is to define a single source folder (naturally it should make no difference).
 &nbsp;And try to locate the folder(s) Microsoft uses for albums. &nbsp;I know it's hidden and MS will not reveal its location but you should be able to find it.

            No luck in figuring out where the created album is stored. No luck with having just 1 folder in source list either.

            I think I found where albums are stored but I'm not sure how much it will help. &nbsp;Go to &lt;user&gt;/AppData/Local/Packages/Microsoft.Windows.Photos_&lt;release ID&gt;/LocalState and see when MediaDb.v1.sqlite was last changed. &nbsp;Every time I introduce a new photo this
 soon gets updated on my machine.

    <title>Removing MS account without password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing MS account without password&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>I was given a laptop which had 2 accounts. One being a local account called "Admin", and the other is a Microsoft account. The account called "Admin" doesn't actually have administrator rights. So whenever I try to do something that requires admin
 confirmation, I need the password to the MS account, which is an Administrator. Is there a way that I can remove the MS account from the laptop, so that "Admin" becomes the Administrator, without knowing the password to the MS account? Help is appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the Microsoft account is possible, although the admin account that you're using will still need the password. The admin account that you're using still has some restrictions. For us to provide a solution suited to your concern, we need some clarifications.
 Can you answer the questions below? </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you the owner of the Microsoft account? </li><li>Which account name is the admin? Is it the Microsoft account or the other one?
</li><li>When the admin account credential prompt appears, are you using the password for the Microsoft account instead of the admin password?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can delete your Microsoft account, however, you cannot do so if you are signed in using that account. To delete that, create a new local account first by following the steps in this

<p>1. I am not the owner of the Microsoft account. But I do own the computer.</p>
<p>2. The administrator account is the Microsoft account, and this is the one I want to delete. The local account which is named "Admin" doesn't have Administrator rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I am not typing any password when it appears. I do not know the password to the Microsoft account, and the "Admin" local account does not have a password.</p>
<p>4. I don't necessarily want to delete another person's account, just remove it from the computer. And I can not create or change local accounts without the admin password.</p>

<p>The first thing to do when receiving a previously used computer is a clean install. That's the only way to know for sure that the computer is setup correctly and free of malware. Otherwise, it's a cr*pshoot.</p>

<h2>            Virus&#47;malware disabled Windows Security Center and microsoft security essential</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Home basic SP 1 64bit os. Just a while ago I open www.mahagenco.in and a zip file containing total_run_mahagenco.exe 612kb and click_me_installer_mahagenco.exe 616kb automatically downloaded When I run it, nothing happened and it
 suddenly disappeared from my desktop. After assuming it was a virus, I run Windows Security Essentials and began a quick scan. Just in the middle of the scan, Windows security essentials shuted down, and the flag of messages in my task bar appeared, saying
 that Windows Security Center was turned off. I tried to turn it on, but a message saying "The Windows Security Center service can't be started" appeared. I restarted my computer but everything was the same, no MSE and no Windows Defender.I also open service.msc
 and restarted security centre but it was disabled after sometime.Also in internet explorer9 and google chrome i was automatically redirected to another sites.
<div>Kindly help me.</div>

            <p>Hi, the activation methods don't work....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried telephone option but after selecting country the window does not load anything and just keeps spinning....Any commands to remove / re-install the product key give an error. I believe because the Software Protection service cannot be started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if refreshing the pc has caused this issue....</p>

            <p>I have had this problem on two of my computers.&nbsp; The first time this happened, MS support had me reinstall Windows 10 and then reinstall Office 2013 Professional Plus again.&nbsp; The whole process took about 4 hours.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the&nbsp; other computer, I decided to see if there was another method of getting my Office 2013 to work.&nbsp; I have another user on this computer with Administrator privileges.&nbsp; I performed a fresh start on the computer and signed in under the other user's name
 and password.&nbsp; I used the Window Key + R and typed Services.msc and hit enter.&nbsp; I looked for the Software Protection Service and right clicked the service.&nbsp; Under the Properties menu I clicked Start under the General Tab and the SP service started.&nbsp; (Using
 my own User interface, the entire SP Properties menu was grayed out.)&nbsp; I opened my Word 2013 program and the Office 2013 program started to work.&nbsp; I then shut down the computer using the full shut down option.&nbsp; After a short time, I started the computer aagain
 but used my own User &nbsp;name and password.&nbsp; The computer started up OK.&nbsp; I again used the Windows Key + R keys, typed Services.msc and found the SP service.&nbsp; I used the properties menu to start the SP service and exited the Services menu.&nbsp;( This time it was
 not grayed out.) &nbsp;I opened Outlook 2013 and the program worked as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why this worked but I now have a User called Test on my computer just to be used in the event there are other glitches that the OS encounters.</p>

<h2>            The only real issue I have with origins</h2>
                    
<p>Is the mud, it's way to effective at stopping you in your tracks even while jumping with stamin-up. I can see certain spots having mud but everywhere around the excavation site is a little to much. If anything I would've liked to have a few more wooden planks
 to jump to so I can at least dodge some zombies/ the dieselpunk panzer zombie.</p>

<p>Seriously? the mud is your ONLY issue? &nbsp;What about the fact that there is no double tap perk machine, and the only way to get it is by using the wunderfizz machine and its completely random and half the time when i use it i end up with dead shot or electric
 cherry. And also if the damn box isn't by generator 2 your basically condemed to by the MP40(who decidied this was good enough to bring back) and after round 10 with no double tap it takes half a clip to kill a dude, and forget about killing the steampunk
 robot with that thing.. And as of now having played this map 35+ times already i have only got the steampunk diesel rifle 1 time, but yet i got the PDW, AK74u and the b23R with an extended clip &nbsp;like 15 &nbsp;times apiece. I just hope they patch this map and add
 a double tap machine and not just the perk becuase thats just stupid relying on luck to get double tap ( even if you by 3 perks and then go to the wunderfizz machine and try to get double tap theres 9 perks on this map, so having 3 theres 6 left for you to
 get, that means you only have a little over a 16% chance of getting double tap and if you don't get it you would have to down yourself and try again which isn't possible becuase by the time you get 3 perks and get ready for your 4th its already around round
 10+ and its to hard to start from scratch on round ten without Jugg) &nbsp;and add the SVU as a wall weapon somewhere that way at least we have a wall weapon that can actually kill zombies after round 10.

<p>Personally, I am liking the challenge that this map is giving.... BUT, I agree double tap is a must - especially for later rounds...</p>
<p>The steam punk dude is a pain the rectum but so were the crawlers in Die rise to start with ,didnt have a clue how to beat them the first few days.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I like the fact that I can't get to the higher rounds (mid 20's - which is high for me alone) easily - I do wish that both or either one or the other of the fridge and bank were available....
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The map design means that players have to work together in order to get anywhere though and I'm all for team spirit! Haven't worked out a perfect strategy yet but there are several things that can be done slightly different and have a massive impact... e.g.
 do I go to area 2 or 3 first? do I go straight for a wall gun or do I save and risk waiting for the MP40 (which i like and wonder how good it will be PAP'd - Fairly Sure that Uneasy Mitchel will be pleased its back - seem to remember he is an advocate of this
 gun)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The mud isn't that hard to cope with, just try bunny hopping through it, I have managed to keep ahead of most zombies that way. I like the fact that the new pack-a-perk machine brings a different element to it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After Buried, which is not a bad map, just a bit tedious for my taste, that I actually have to think and care what is going on around me.</p>
<p>The higher number of Zombie spawn areas make it more of a challenge too as you can't just back away all the time whilst you reload.... rinse and repeat.....</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>From what I have seen so far, sure its not perfect but as I play it more I think I will start to enjoy it more and more and the niggles will be less important, for me anyway.</p>

<p>I generally always get double tap as a reward for turning on the generators, or the 115 headshot challenge so I don't have an issue there, as for the mp40 is seems a little nerfed when compared to something like the stg.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And as i said even with stamin-up and hopping in the mud you can still barely outrun the regular zombies and it's near impossible to outrun the dieselpunk panzer zombie (especially with it's claw).</p>

<p>The MP40 recoil is a little more than I remember but once I got DT from the perk-a-cola machine, it was beastly... I like the gun you can get from upstairs in the church (or in the sub-basement of the excavation area but still havent actually pap'd a gun

<p>I have played this once with friends, and a few dozen times solo. This map is definitely more challenging than the rest, and ridiculously hard to complete challenges solo. I have made it to round 16 or so Solo which is low for me, usually around 40 on most
 maps. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have found that diesel punk guy isn't as hard as I first thought, but get caught in a reload and you are toast. Solo, I usually run around the excavation site. Lots of wood planks and very few spots to get slowed down. Run the horde until almost all have
 spawned in, then turn and fire a half a clip and run away again. Takes a few minutes to kill him but usually I don't have an issue first time round. The second time he comes (around round 14), he kills me half the time as I am caught in a bad spot.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The key with him is to run away, turn and fire and run again, or get the Mark2 and life is a breeze.

<p>thats the truth the the mark 2 runs dry way to often i feel like on this map the normal ray gun works wonders and for me at least it pops up all the time so i'l use it until its empty drop it then pick it back up out of the box</p>

<p>I seem to have horrible luck with getting either of the ray gun's ( or anything decent for that matter) out of the box, mainly get the dual five seven's and the b23r every now and then i'll get the mg or hammer.</p>

    <title>Are glitchers banned in Gears 1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> portednutria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are glitchers banned in Gears 1&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, recently I decided to pick Gears 1 up again to play through the campaign again before September 20th but got a little bored so I went online to do some "Player Matches." &nbsp;I was playing and there was one guy who would not stop "Kung Fu Flipping" and "Crabwalking",
 eventually we got on Gridlock and he decided to "Skydive." &nbsp;I was just wondering if Epic is still banning people for glitching on this game, if I can get proof of them in video? &nbsp;I know for barrier breaking in Gears 2 you get banned if you are reported with
 video evidence to Joe Graf. &nbsp;I told him that I thought he would get banned if someone reported him with video evidence and he said you only get banned for doing it in "Ranked Matches", and that Epic doesn't care what you do in "Player Matches." &nbsp;Is that true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is greatly accepted,</p>
<p>PortedNutria &nbsp;</p>

<p>That's incredible!</p>
<p>What about reporting him directly to XBL - Stephan Toulouse also known as Stepto, he's the Director of Xbox LIVE Policy and Enforcement at Microsoft. On XBL you are not allowed to do anything such as that and it's hard to belieive Epic one of Microsoft's
 important partners doesn't care.</p>

<p>That's what I thought too, I didn't figure Epic didn't care since I know they are pretty good about banning people in Gears 2 and alot of the Gears community for some reason likes playing Gears 1 better.

    <title>hulu plus cancellation on xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doughackworth  say:</h3>
<h2>            hulu plus cancellation on xbox 360</h2>
                    <p>why is it so hard to cancel hulu plus. I have gone to both of the websites and followed all the guidelines, it tells you to go to your account access page and press a cancel button that doesnt even exist, then after that you try to go to microsoft support
 and get sent on a wild goose chase. If Microsoft is going to offer these apps to the consumer dont you think you should&nbsp;&nbsp;make it easier to cancel these apps instead of making your customers run around in circles.&nbsp;HOW DO YOU CANCEL HULU PLUS OFF OF AN XBOX
 360 ACCOUNT?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Cannot Boot, Reset, or Restore&#59; Recovery Media Does not work either</h2>
                    <p>My Situation:</p>
<p>One day as I was using my PC I ran a sketchy program which led to a prompt saying "REFORMATTING YOUR HARD DRIVE" and then a blue screen. I did not hesitate running it because I hadn't had problems with malware before and was confident in the antivirus to
 act if needed. After the blue screen my PC is now unable to boot and automatic startup repair doesn't work. I have tried multiple advanced options such as factory resets, system restores, and using recovery media tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?<br />

            Thanks for responding. I have tried these options are already, but I tried again, but they led to another error. I looked into my BIOS and suspect it is a hard drive problem. I have used recovery discs and apparently the Windows Hard Drive is not being
 booted although it is listed in the BIOS.

            <p>I found the solution.</p>
<p>First my problem was being cause by proxy settings!</p>
<p>What you do, download the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=268424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Accounts Diagnostic Tool</a>. Its just a few Kbs</p>
<p>Run it and make sure that you accept to apply fix when it brings up any errors. at the point where it will show you need to set up LAN settings manually, also click "Apply Fix". After you see no error, the last thing it should show at the end of the troubleshooting
 will be. "You need to sign in with a Microsoft account", then you can go back to settings and accounts and try it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try out these other steps if it doesn't work for you! <a href="http://www.kapilarya.com/cant-switch-to-microsoft-account-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 Vista Home Premium, Business, and Ultimate editions. Your Windows 7 upgrade will be to the comparable version: so you'll get either Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional (the upgrade to Windows Vista Business), or Windows 7 Ultimate, respectively.
 The Windows 7 Upgrade Option program runs from June 26, 2009 <strong>through January 31, 2010.</strong> Some Manufacturers may choose to shorten the Upgrade Option time frame.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.

<h3> xneurosiis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing gamertags...</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a silver account which I don't use, but I like the gamertag better than the one I'm posting with (which is the gamertag I play on). If I change my silver gamertag, will that free up the silver gamertag name for me to change this tag (the one I'm
 posting with) to?</p>


<p>Before you say it's not possible, if that's the case, my friend changed his gamertag (A) back to an old one (B), but took the first one (A), and created an account with it just so that way nobody else could have it. I figure if it worked for him, it should
 work for me.</p>


<p>Sorry if it's a bit confusing, but I didn't want to post his gamertags, or my silver account gamertag.<br />
<br />

<p>Awesome. It kinda sucks because I'm basically spending $20 (800msp + 800msp) to change my gamertag, but I couldn't remember the login info for the silver account, otherwise I would've used it from the start. And I didn't want to start over with all my achievements
 and everything.</p>

            Are you logged in with the same account on your console as you were before? If you reinstall a game, it will sync all the data from the cloud, unless you've been playing offline, and in that case it will only have the save file in cloud when you were last
 online.

            You say the account from your son is synched perfect. Could it be, that your missing game synch was not on your account? If you played with your account online and had the saves in the cloud this always would synch with a new install of any game.&nbsp;

<h2>            Need help with unsupported country issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I just bought an Xbox One two months ago and set it's region to UK as I'm living in Romania and my country is not on the list.
</p>
<p>I just found out that I can get a free month of trial gold membership and activated it. No problem, it worked just fine in the first 24 hours. After that it completely disappeared. I talked with support on chat and they told me this:</p>
<p>"Our system detects that you are currently located in Romania where the it's not yet support by Xbox live. But like what I said on you, we do have a other gamers who can hide there own IP address where they able to manipulate that they are located on the
 country where we support the Xbox live. So I would suggest you to check our forums support about it so they able to see it or learn it&nbsp; on how to do it because to be honest with you, it's against on our Terms of use and Codes of conduct."</p>
<p>So can anyone help me with this issue? </p>
<p>Also my credit card remained blocked on auto-renewal and can't remove it, since my gold membership doesn't show up, so no way to remove auto-renewal.....</p>
