<h2>            Flip&#47;Mirror&#47;Reverse Page Formatting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a fairly long document that, for the most part, consists of three text boxes on each page. The text box on the far left is colored and serves as a side-panel for information that is an appendage to the main text and also makes the pages less bland.
 I am planning on printing this document, and realized that if i print it as it stands then the red text box on the left will be on the left for each page, instead of how i imagined it originally (with the red text box on the outer side of each page).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could fix this manually, by going through every odd page and moving the red text box to the right side and the other two text boxes over as appropriate. This would make it so that when printed, the red border/text box would be opposite each other in the
 book. However, it would be much more convenient if I could somehow tell word to reverse a pages text boxes/formatting, as the formatting is all done except for the lack of mirroring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time, its a little long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-TWS</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I have access to word 2007, 2010, and 2013, but usually use 2010. The document seems to play nice in every version though, so if one version can do this i will convert it over.</p>

            <p>If you were going to have information in your text box reflect or repeat something on the page, then yes it is possible using different even and odd in the header/footer and putting your text box in the header/footer and using a
<a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/fields.htm#STYLEREF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
StyleRef Field</a> to repeat information from the body of the document in your call-out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you are in for a fair amount of editing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, even though a part of a header/footer, a text box can be in the body area of a document. This is how watermarks work.</p>

            <p>There is a way that's a little tedious but not horrible.<br />
<br />
Start by going to the Page Layout tab of the ribbon and clicking the little arrow in the bottom right corner of the Page Setup group to open the Page Setup dialog. In the Margins page of the dialog, set the Multiple Pages dropdown to "Mirror margins". It doesn't
 matter whether the left and right margins are the same or different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the tedious part: In each red text box, right-click the border (not the internal text) and click More Layout Options. In the Layout dialog, click the option button next to "Book layout", and set the two dropdowns on that row to "Outside" and "Margin".
 Click OK to apply the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the document won't be edited in a way that might change the pagination, then technically you need to change only the ones on odd pages, but it's safer to do them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought: If there's a way to distinguish the boxes within macro code, it will be possible to program a macro to make all the settings with one click. It would be necessary to know exactly which part (fill, border, or both) is red, and whether it's
 the color that Word recognizes as Red or one of the "theme colors". If you want me to pursue this, copy/paste a couple of pages into a blank document and send it to me at one of the addresses shown at

            <p>Thank you for the reply!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried the first suggestion you had. However, upon having the text box switch sides, the other two text boxes (that are not red and full of the main body of text) did not move, so the shifted red box now overlaps. It seems that means this method does not re-format
 everything on the page, but rather moves just that one box to the other margin, which is halfway there. Unfortunately, this leaves moving the other two boxes by hand, or perhaps i could align them to the other margin, but in the end this is about as difficult
 as just grabbing the boxes and moving them myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a border color, and i am pretty sure it is one of the reds from the theme options, but it would just do what i did right? Move just the red box on each page, and not reposition the other two accordingly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            Interesting idea, i'll look at the header/footers to see if there is a good solution there. Although, i already have about 100+ pages, with all of the red boxes on the left side, so i would have to go and remove them accordingly i think.

            <p>If the text box is overlapping, then you don't have the text wrapping set to Square. But this also suggests that the left margin was originally set to accommodate the text box. Since you already have "Mirror margins" enabled, you should make the Outside
 margin large enough to accommodate the text box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rereading your original question, I see you say you have three text boxes on each page. Why? Ordinarily, the body of your text would be in the document body and would wrap around (or to the side of) a text box.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 won&#39;t update build 10074 to 10122 &#91;I&#39;ve tried other fixes&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Exactly what it says on the tin...some additional details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some big problems with 10122 the first time it installed on my Surface, so I wiped everything, reinstalled 10041, and set everything up the way I wanted it.&nbsp; Since I stayed on the Slow ring, next stop was 10074, which went smooth as glass.&nbsp; I made
 a few additional tweaks, but nothing that should've caused a problem.&nbsp; So once everything was set the way I wanted it, I jumped back onto the Fast ring, and...well, you know the story.&nbsp; The update appears to start, but then fails out with 0x80070057.&nbsp; At first
 it was doing it after a restart, at the screen that had the rings on it, but now it's doing it right there in Windows as soon as it finishes downloading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the gamut of solutions I can find, I've run Disk Cleanup, I've done the command line thing that's supposed to clear up the device drivers--nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other solutions out there for us Surface Pro 3 users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I'm also aware of the thing with uninstalling devices from Device Manager--this exact same upgrade process went off without a hitch on a laptop with many more devices than the Surface; I don't want to start yanking device drivers out manually unless there's
 no other option.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The things that were different in your procedure that were different than my previous attempts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Open the command prompt (Admin) through Windows key + X. &nbsp;Previously, I was opening the command prompt (admin) via the "All Apps" list in the start menu.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Restart after rundll32.exe command and before updating to build 10122</p>

                    <p>I am thinking that what you are saying makes total sense,but my daughter is telling me that they,at the WalMart electronic dept. Told her she's gonna have to download the pictures and personal diary section of her phone onto a DVD 📀.... Which this they
 are doing for her at their store.for a minimum fee. I'm explaining what you are saying. Makes sense that everything,but the phone service,should remain. But they are insisting,so she's having everything down loaded off her phone 📞 to a DVD 📀 and then they
 transfer off the DVD disk ,onto her new phone 📞 seems more work than needs be done. I'm bringing my 520 in ,just to see what they say. Thanks

            <p>Hi BigZee,</p>
<p>Here's one way:<br />
• Add a custom document property named 'Counter' to your document, with the value 0<br />
• At the location where you want the number to appear, insert a DOCPROPERTY field, for the 'Counter' property.<br />
• Add the following macro to the document:</p>
<p>Sub MultiPrint()<br />
Dim i As Long, j As Long<br />
j = CLng(InputBox("How many copies to print?", "Numbered-copy Printout", 0))<br />
For i = 1 To j<br />
&nbsp; With ThisDocument<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .CustomDocumentProperties("Counter") = i<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Fields.Update<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .PrintOut<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
Next<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Now, when you want to print multiple copies, simply press Alt-F8, select MultiPrint then input the count when prompted.</p>
<p>To see how to install the macro, go to: <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Jomel_G, thank you for your quick response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the support page and my skype they look different. I don't have a favorites option in my contact details anymore. I have a "Pin Chat" option, but don't understand how it works. I manage multiple groups and keep them all in favorites. This allows
 me to look at chat history easily. These are the options I see in group settings:</p>

<p>It looks to me that "favorites" has been renamed in the newest skype version. To get back something similar, you'll have to do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. sort the chat list by "Unread"</p>
<p>2. right click on a chat / group chat and choose "Pin chat"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Pin chat" will pull the chat/group chat to the top of the list (just behind the unread conversations".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it solves the issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Arek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no longer option to make a group be part of your favorites list, however, when you enable
<strong>Pin chat </strong>for the group, it will pull your group on top of your chats list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this new version of Skype, only your recent chats will show on the left sidebar of the application. It is designed that way. You will need to click the

            The version is extremely uncomfortable to use. I used to have my favorites in the left hand column and those are the people that regularly have conversations with, they were always to hand. Now they are not. Pinning the chats might work but I cannot reorder
 them. Poor change, very unhappy with the new version

            I can only second @slsclark. There was no sense in redesigning a really well working user interface. At least they could let the user choose if he wants to go with the new one or stay with the old one. It takes so much time to get used to it and it's not
 intuitive at all. If I wouldn't be forced by certain factors to use it, I would just stop and move to other tools.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I've gone back to the previous version, so much better. As a software developer I know new versions sometimes take time to get used to, but this was a poorly researched and executed update. So unusable I've gone back to the old version as have all of my
 team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever did this redesign cannot have used the old version.</p>

<h2>            Onenote on Mobile Devices doesn&#39;t display properly.</h2>
                    <p>It is a really annoying thing I have to say.</p>
<p>When I resize my ink strokes on any devices other than Windows platform, i.e. on iPad, on Android, on Mac etc. it just doesn't display properly, showing some radiation-like lines. See details in attached photos. But when it is synced and viewed in Windows
 version of OneNote, it works fine, but on every other devices, it doesn't.</p>

<p>Yes, I have tried install and reinstall from the app store and play store to have the latest version. But when I open the notebook and synced, it still displayed inproperly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clarify, the situation is that, when I write something on my Surface pro, and try to resize it on ANY other platform other than windows, the problem appears. And deleting the app, clear cache and data and resyncing doesn’t work. But still, it displays
 properly on my surface pro even after doing the resize operation on other devices.</p>

    <title>office 365 security events. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kino-ma-kino  say:</h3>
<h2>            office 365 security events.</h2>
                    <div>After the reply that you can not know the unsuccessful login attempts of office 365, I wonder: what can be known about O365 logs related to security?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For example:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time an email is sent and returned by non-existent mailbox (usual when an account that sends spam is compromised and there are many wrong destination addresses)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When downloading / deleting mail files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the antispam detects an email as possible malicious.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When they try to send an executable or virus file ...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>all these actions do not generate logs in O365 that we can monitor?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a list of security events that O365 monitors?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for the help.</div>

    <title>Why is System Restore hidden away&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve1640  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is System Restore hidden away&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Some aspect of Windows 10 are much harder to accomplish than in previous versions.</p>
<p>I have always liked to create a system restore point before installing software or driver which I am not 100% sure of, and unless I missed something obvious, I have to open file explorer, right click on This PC, select properties and System protection (or
 use other methods such as right clicking in the very bottom left corner of the screen)</p>
<p>None of this is intuitive for a user, especially a 'normal' operator or indeed home user...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason not to put simple menu options in the new Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security menu -&gt; Backup &nbsp;to achieve this simple operation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History doesn't achieve this requirement, Backup and Restore (Windows 7) does but wildly over complicates it</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mind myself, which is why I am a Windows Insider, but I support others, and performing this simple task is witchcraft to most users, and shouldn't be, it should be easy, obvious and efficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

</p><p>You would need to find a copy of the font in order to add it back. &nbsp;You can import it back with Font Book, but I'm not sure if&nbsp;Outlook &nbsp;2016 will see it. The Word forum might be the best place on adding fonts to 2016.</p>

<h3> shlomofishelis  say:</h3>
<h2>            This command cannot be performed because a dialog box is open</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to do anything on word, a message pops up saying that the command cannot be performed because a dialog box is open (click ok and then close the open dialog box to continue). There is no dialog box that is open and I tried to see if it was
 hidden my pressing alt spacebar m but it doesn't show up- THERE IS NO DIALOG BOX. It doesn't let me do anything on Word- I can't open it, close it, open any other one or open the file tab. I have tried many different ways to fix it but nothing seems to be
 working. Please help ASAP!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>It sounds like you have a dialog box open off screen. It is quite a trick to do, but sometimes happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the taskbar and select "Cascade All". This will stack all of the open windows like a hand of cards. It will include any open dialog boxes. Just minimize the cascaded Windows until you find the open dialog.</p>

<h3> pete earl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 650 windows 10 &#34;You need to fix.....&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterdays (Oct 8th) enforced microsoft update strange things have happened. 1) I am now not getting any sound notification for texts/emails/whatsapp etc. &nbsp;2) Can't receive calls - answers with "person you're calling is temporarily unavailable" and
 3) receiving app. every 30 seconds the "You need to fix....." message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been into all the settings and I'm switched "On" in all areas.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if Microsoft gave details on "How to fix..." so I'm thinking of a Hard Reset. I've backed up pictures okay but worried that I might lose all the contact details.</p>
<p>Any advice would be really appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Pete,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and

Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before
 performing a hard reset. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you install the <em><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/contacts-message-backup/9nblgggz57gm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacts+message backup</a></strong></em> app from the Store. Contacts + Message Backup
 app is a Settings app that enables you to make backup of all your contacts (in VCF format) and messages (SMS &amp; MMS including attachments) to SD card (in XML format) for later restore to same or another Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download anything using Internet Explorer 10&#47;11</h2>
                    <p>OS: Windows 7 32 bit Home Edition</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first noticed the problem when trying to update Adobe Flash Player in IE 11. It kept failing. I had the latest Flash Player version on another browser but it wouldn't update on IE 11. I ignored it thinking it would resolve itself later and used the other
 browser to view Flash content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After attempting to update Flash Player on another occasion, which failed, I began to look for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I discovered I couldn't update Java either. I couldn't download anything or save it to desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using IE 11&nbsp;to download&nbsp;files would cause IE to "stop working" and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reverted back to IE 10 and still couldn't download files but I could save them to desktop. However, attempting to run the files from desktop would fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along the way I uninstalled Java and my Flash Player so now I have IE 10 with no Java or Flash Player installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the settings on IE 10 but I still can't download anything including trying to upgrade back to IE 11.</p>

            <p>Hi Maximillian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>This issue might have caused due to change in Internet Explorer settings.</p>
<p>To assist you better, I would require the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Have you install any software recently? </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run SFC scan and check if it helps.</p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to run System Update Readiness Tool and check if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then try to download and install Flash Player and Java.</p>

    <title>Outlook reading pane won&#39;t stay in place - Outlook for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanpiptinker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook reading pane won&#39;t stay in place - Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    <p>I like my reading pane fairly slim to the right. In the last&nbsp;few days, for no apparent reason, it now takes over half the screen. I keep moving it back, but every time I leave Outlook and then return - it's taking over half the screen again. This is irritating
 the hell out of me. How can I keep the reading pane permanently where I want it. There hasn't been an update recently, so I don't know why it should suddenly start hap[ening</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi susanpiptinker,</p>

<p>For your problem, please make sure that the Reading Pane(under the Organize tab) is set to Right in your Outlook. If it still take over half the screen, I suggest you try using the

            2010 on XP, did you happen to download a trial edition? When the time limit expires, the apps go into limited function mode, basically acting as readers only. If that is the case you would have to buy&nbsp;a full copy to and activate it.

    <title>Powerpoint 2013 font size in speaker notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellypatton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint 2013 font size in speaker notes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently purchased office home and student 2013. It comes with the new power point and I'm stumped. I cannot get the speaker notes to turn black.. (They are a&nbsp;dark greyish purple)&nbsp;or change their font. I want them Times New Roman in font 12. It is set
 to Calibri (sp) in 14 ish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to change in the normal way with the tool bar and even done the right click. I cannot figure it out past that. They change easily in the slide itself, so I'm thinking this is a pre-set font. I even opened up another brand new slide design
 and had the same exact issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's like it's locked into this format and will NOT change.. HELP! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Are you trying to change the notes text as seen in the notes pane beneath the slide in normal view or as seen in Presenter view. &nbsp;Or as printed when you print speaker notes?
<div><br />
<div>I don't think you can change the color in either of the first two, but you can change the font and size. &nbsp;You format the text as you would any other text but to get it to APPEAR as you've formatted, do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Click the View ribbon</div>
<div>Click Outline View.</div>
<div>RIGHT-click anywhere in the outline pane</div>
<div>Click Show Text Formatting</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your font and size choices will now appear in Notes pane and in Presenter view.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <p>I'm trying to change them in normal view, as I'm actively&nbsp;working on the presentation. I sent it to another person to have a look and she said they were in black, but not New Times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested and I was able to change the font size and make it a true dark black in the outline pane. The speaker notes, however still the speaker notes did not budge one bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does it look differently to others?&nbsp; I would not care if I didn't have to send this off to an instructor to have it graded (Back in school for grad degree and a newbie at this ppt stuff). I never had this problem in 2010.</p>

</p>
<p>Changing the text in the outline pane will affect text in placeholders on slides, but won't have any effect on the notes text. &nbsp;Once you've followed my suggestion to get notes text to show formatting, you also have to set the formatting ... select the text
 in the notes pane and change the font, etc.</p>

            <p>Hit ALT-F5 to go into presenter view from the "Normal" view of the slide.&nbsp; On the right side you will see your speaker notes.&nbsp; At the bottom, there is an icon to increase the size of the font in the speaker notes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can do the same if you use two monitors, where one displays the slide and the opther displays the presenter view of the slide.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Another KEY point is to change the zoom in the notes pane. Click in the notes pane and select View - Zoom - 100% on the ribbon. Then your fonts will appear with reasonable size.</p>
