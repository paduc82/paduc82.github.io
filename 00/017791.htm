<h2>            Table with duplicates in two fields</h2>
                    I have a table in access which has duplicates in two fields. I want to create a query to compare two fields in that table and anytime there is more than one record with exact same information in those two fields and I want to delete original and duplicate
 entries from the table? How can I do this in Access?

<p>
</p><p>Below is an example of data that I have in my table. I have over 100,000 rows in my table from which I want to delete all the rows (original and duplicate) if document # is repeated with a same amount in negative. In this example, you can see that document#
 3456 and 6100 are repeated with a same amount in negative balance. So, I want to delete both original and duplicate. What would you recommend to do?</p>

<p>Deleting is always risky - it's forever, there is no "undelete" button; and the data might have oddities you haven't thought of. What if there are THREE records, one with +200 and the other two with -200? Delete one pair? delete all three? What if there
 are two pairs? Do you have any way to UNIQUELY identify one record?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first guess was to use a Self Join query joining two instances of the table by Document Number and putting a criterion on the Amount field:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT A.[Document #], A.Amount, A.[Line#], A.[Posting Date], B.[Line #], B.[Posting Date]</p>
<p>FROM [Table 1] AS A INNER JOIN [Table 1] AS B</p>
<p>ON A.[Document #] = B.[Document #]</p>
<p>WHERE A.Amount = - B.Amount;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will find all the "duplicates" (which aren't duplicates, 620 is not equal to -620); but since you don't have (that I can see) a Primary Key that would uniquely identify a record, I don't think you'll be able to change this to a Delete query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: DO you have a Primary Key, or some way to uniquely identify each record?</p>

            Huh. Looking closer, you have a very nice Apple icon at the left of the toolbar and a reference to Sheet 1 - IS this a Microsoft Office Access database (which you might be displaying using some Mac tool) or some other software??

<p>I had sent you example from personal computer; however the situation belongs to my office which has Windows computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, a document number may repeat more than two times with one positive amount and may be more than one negative amount. I am trying to remove the records when a document's net balance of all lines is zero based of on the total of positive and negative balances.
 How can I do this in Access? </p>

            You should be able to do this on the basis of the sum of the amounts equalling zero.&nbsp; A query along these lines might do the trick:<br />
<br />
DELETE *<br />
FROM [Table 1] AS T1<br />
WHERE EXISTS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT [Document #]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM [Table 1] AS T2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WHERE T2.[Document #] = T1.[Document #]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GROUP BY [Document #]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAVING SUM(Amount) = 0);<br />
<br />
Be sure to open the query as a datasheet before executing it, and it goes without saying that the table should be backed up first.<br />

<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; T1 and T2 are aliases for the two instances of the table.&nbsp; This allows the subquery to be correlated with the outer query on the Documnent # column.&nbsp; The outer query is thus restricted to the rows for which the sum of the amount value per Documnent #
 value is zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; No, this is the SQL statement for the entire query.&nbsp; In the query designer, switch to SQL view and paste the statement in place of whatever is there already.&nbsp; Switch to datasheet view by means of the View icon in the Results area of the Design ribbon
 to preview the rows which will be deleted.&nbsp; To execute the query switch back to SQL view and click the Run icon, also in the Results area of the Design ribbon.&nbsp; But be sure to back up the table first.&nbsp; Once rows are deleted, they are gone forever.</p>

<p>Since you unfortunately have a blank in the fieldname, you must always use brackets around it. Otherwise Access thinks you're talking about one thing named "Undisbursed" and a different thing named "Obligations"; blanks are meaningful punctuation. Try</p>

                    <div>
<div><u>Device(s):</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HTC Arrive (T7575)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>Issue:</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Sudden" device restarts will render the mobile data connection unusable under certain conditions. &nbsp;A "sudden" restart is any restart in which the device applies a change and reboots immediately,
<em>such as</em> when changing modem modes ##634# &gt; Diag &gt; DM toggle&nbsp;ON, then&nbsp;OFF. &nbsp;This issue is
<i>not specific</i> to messing with Diag Mode and has been confirmed to have occurred during other sudden restarts, including with the phone just sitting on my desk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>Conditions:</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The device is connected to a Wi-Fi network with an SSID including one or more backslash characters (\).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>Result:</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upon reboot, you will find that all mobile data connections (1X/EVDO) have ceased and the Data Session State under ##634# &gt; FieldTrial &gt; EVDO Engineering will be 0=Null state rather than the correct 2=Dormant state. &nbsp;Ev or 1X will not appear next to the
 signal strength indicator.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>Troubleshooting:</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Differing from the DFRouter <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/any-solution-for-damaged-windows-phone-via-df/2109119d-0259-448a-9162-73ea1a7eed3a?msgId=8d5f4218-9760-4349-8d78-b5ece575dfc6&amp;page=1&amp;tab=AllReplies">
"wrong mode" problem</a>, the device can still connect to and sync with Zune. &nbsp;USB mode, if enabled, will function. &nbsp;However, WPDT 7.0/7.1 SDK tools (and community tools that rely on them, currently all XAP deployers) will fail to connect to the device (to
 dev register/deregister, deploy XAPs, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once the data connection is in "0=Null state", "change network settings" and "prl update" under Settings &gt; Cellular will no longer succeed. &nbsp;If EVDO parameters are replaced with false data in the ##3282# &gt; DATA menu, they will be corrected though the "change
 network settings" attempt gives a failure message. &nbsp;This failure occurs because the modem cannot be reset; the signal bars will not disappear or go to a "do not enter sign" like usual.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Various modem related settings changes in DFRouter, AdvancedConfig Tool, and GCFSettings have failed to make any difference. &nbsp;Deep digging with QPST and QXDM found the issue to be unfixable by replacing NV memory items and with any commands I was able
 to find using the Item Tester. &nbsp;Please, if you know QXDM Professional, it might be the only way to solve this problem besides ...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>Known solution(s):</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Device hard reset. &nbsp;Both Settings &gt; About and ##3282# &gt; RTN resets work. &nbsp;BEWARE: Restoring to a Zune backup made while the modem was in null state will RESTORE the problem as well! Make certain you make a good backup before testing this issue!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft/HTC/Sprint, please fix. &nbsp;Other device users, please test (carefully) and help confirm this issue. &nbsp;I am glad to answer any questions.</div>

            Well, one problem is a backslash character in the SSID is against the standard. If you have control over this access point, change it and stick to alphanumeric.<br />
<br />
Second, using a phone's Diagnostic app is unsupported territory. Are you changing it to get tethering or something?<br />

<p>Standards compliance, eh?&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a pretty messy business, actually ... I'm sure you've
<a href="http://www.wirelessforums.org/alt-internet-wireless/ssid-33892.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
seen this thread</a> if you searched the same way I did.&nbsp; In any case none of the devices on my network (a dozen or so) complain about it and Windows Phone 7 also connects to the network and transfers data just fine.&nbsp; It's only on WP7&nbsp;that&nbsp;this issue is
<strong>permanently OS-breaking</strong>,&nbsp;which makes it a BUG in my humble opinion.</p>

<p>As mentioned in&nbsp;my post, the primary issue has nothing to do with the Diag Mode toggle; that is just the simplest way I found to trigger a "sudden" device restart.&nbsp; If you know another way, please try that.&nbsp; This issue happened for me the first time while
 the phone was just sitting on my desk and restarted suddenly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to my use for Diag Mode, it is necessary for the serial-over-USB connection used by QPST and QXDM (deprecated Qualcomm servicing tools).&nbsp; I was using these to troubleshoot an issue I was having with MMS provisioning on Sprint's network that has since
 been solved.</p>

            Agreed. Standards are a tricky issue and we could go on and on about it. :) Heck, the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/winphone/forum/wp7-wpdevices/how-do-i-connect-my-windows-phone-7-to-a-hidden-wi/6a5fd51b-b50c-44ea-9f28-8315fe90648e">
hidden WiFi thread</a> is another great example. However, if you know this much about networking and tinkering, you would know that going beyond alphanumeric for SSID is just asking for trouble. Why would you even need a backslash there?<br />
<br />
Now, you're saying that essentially, upon a sudden reboot, mobile data may not work, due to the device connecting to a WiFi point with a backslash in its SSID? Did the device restart itself before connecting to the SSID? What if you initiate a restart?<br />

            <p>Haha, you're right.&nbsp; I guess I was getting too fancy&nbsp;naming my&nbsp;DD-WRT router <strong>
|&gt;|&gt;\/\/r7</strong>.&nbsp; Was not necessary at all and now it's something else :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For clarity, here's how this issue goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;I connect to a WiFi network which&nbsp;has a&nbsp;backslash anywhere in the SSID. </li><li>All phone functions are&nbsp;normal for days or&nbsp;weeks until ... </li><li>The device restarts or is restarted, "suddenly"&nbsp;(see notes). </li><li><strong>Mobile network</strong>&nbsp;data is dead as a doornail due to Data Session = "null state."
</li><li>Must hard reset phone to fix, sometimes multiple times.</li></ol>
<p><u>Notes:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>A "sudden" restart differs from&nbsp;a normal soft reset&nbsp;in that the phone&nbsp;goes black&nbsp;in&nbsp;~3 seconds rather than the usual ~15 (power button for ~4s, Goodbye! for ~11s) , and
<em>without</em> showing the Goodbye! screen. </li><li>Also, "sudden" restarts show the <em>airplane mode</em> symbol in the top left corner briefly before powering down whereas the usual shutdown process is obscured under the Goodbye! screen.
</li><li>Device always finds and connects to the WiFi and mobile <em>voice</em> networks fine.
</li><li>"Sudden" restarts when <em>not</em> connected to the WiFi network are fine (and&nbsp;if WiFi toggled off, after connected).</li></ul>
<p><u>Thoughts:<br />
</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Other "invalid" characters might also cause this issue; I only know backslash for sure because of my previous wierd SSID.&nbsp; As part of the troubleshooting I tried&nbsp;all available broadcast modes and&nbsp;encryption methods on two different routers so at least I
 am certain about the SSID's backslash being the&nbsp;cause&nbsp;of&nbsp;my issue. </li><li>It's possible that a WiFi network with a special character SSID somehow takes longer than expected to disengage, thus the device kills power before the modem state is properly reset.&nbsp; This would mean other SSID-invalid characters would cause the same problem.
</li><li>It's possible that some registry or file system command takes place during sudden restarts, and that command's path&nbsp;is inadvertently delimited by the backslash (taken as a Windows file system directory separator character).&nbsp; This would mean other invalid
 characters are OK. </li><li>There are separate antennae for mobile data/voice and WiFi - I assume that while connected to a WiFi network,&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;should be&nbsp;preferred over the mobile data connection (<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20028012-75.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">should be,
 heh</a>).&nbsp; Perhaps the sudden restart disengages the WiFi properly but fails to set the mobile data modem back to primary?&nbsp; This is impossible to know without a good&nbsp;debugger.
</li><li>I can't recall at the moment, but I think the "null state" issue also borks GPS and location functions.&nbsp; Would have to check on that though, and not sure its relevant.</li></ul>

I think this is exactly what's happening. But I don't work for Microsoft, so I couldn't tell you why. It's certainly an interesting bug and I'd be curious if it's a bug only with the Arrive (it being the only CDMA Windows Phone) or the entire OS.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My Outlook.com account has been broken since Windows 8.1</p>

<p>
</p><p>I followed a troubleshooting web path for Outlook and&nbsp;ended up on a page to reset my password, but the</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't want to reset my Microsoft Account passwsord I want to fix Outlook.com.
</p>
<p>I don't trust that web page because I'm not sure about "Microsoft Account" </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could a kind soul point me to a webpage that has accurate and explicit info to help me fix Outlook.com?</p>

            <p>Your Microsoft ID is the address you use to sign into Outlook.com and, typically, Windows 8 or 10. If you log into Windows 8 or 10 with your Microsoft ID, the built-in Mail app will connect to Outlook.com and show you the mail in that mailbox and the People
 app and Calendar app will connect to that mailbox as well and show you your contacts and appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't need to connect Windows 8 to a Microsoft ID, but you don't get access to the Windows Store. I haven't tried it yet, but I understand it's more difficult in Windows 10 to keep it disconnected from the Microsoft ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use a completely different Microsoft ID for Windows than you use to access Outlook.com using a web browser. It will have a different mailbox, contacts, and calendar as well, so you don't need to mix Windows data with online Outlook.com data
 if you wish, but you may find it harder to sort out that way.</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint variation and root level sub-site</h2>
                    
<p>I created a private site collection with Publication Site template with Variations feature enabled for our Intranet. &nbsp;I have two labels configured as fr-ca (source) and en-ca. &nbsp;I created a sub-site in fr-ca for our department (IT). &nbsp;So now we have two sub-sites
 /fr-ca/IT and /en-ca/IT. &nbsp;With Variation, when you access the root of site collection, it should redirect automatically to corresponding variation label base on my browser language. But it doesn't seam to work.</p>
<p>I created a page in [CollectionSiteRoot]/fr-ca/ called "test". &nbsp;If i call the page directly it works well but if i call [CollectionSiteRoot]/test, it tells me the page doesn't exist. &nbsp;I was thinking that Variant feature was able to redirect every call from
 the root to the right label. &nbsp;Should it be possible to call sub-site in label, ex.&nbsp;[CollectionSiteRoot]/fr-ca/IT or&nbsp;[CollectionSiteRoot]/en-ca/It by accessing&nbsp;[CollectionSiteRoot]/IT?</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks for you help.</p>

3. if you try to access the root site collection directly from a web browser in the en-ca language, will it work?<br />
4. please share a screenshot about the root site's variation labels like below.<br />

<h3> killerbob71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rebuilding Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 15.8.2 and have a problem which I would normally have solved in Outlook 2011 by rebuilding the database. I have a reminder for a calendar entry popping up every time I open up Outlook, even though the calendar entry has long since been
 deleted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally I would rebuild the database, but I wonder how to do this in Outlook 15???</p>

            <p>Thanks for that info...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This however means I have a problem which needs another solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I open Outlook, which is up against an Exchange server, I get a reminder about a meeting, and I can't "Snooze" or "Dismiss" it. I can only get rid of the reminder by closing the pop up, i.e. "red x". Then it is gone, and only reappears next time
 I open up Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use Outlook on my Mac Pro at home, and here the reminder does not pop up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I possibly do to get rid of that annoyance?</p>

            <p>As you have discovered, there are some bugs in the Reminders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take a moment to report the problem to Microsoft by using the Smile (or frown) button in the upper right corner of the Outlook window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem such as this one will probably have to be corrected in a software update.</p>

<p>Hi Jason - thanks for the quick response!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens no matter what worksheet I try to copy. Yes it in the same workbook but this workbook was created from another that had links the I have already cleared...at least that I can see... &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Worksheet name 'Capitol Labor Estimate 2019'</p>

            Are there any hidden worksheets in the workbook? They may have links on them. I had this same problem quite some time ago on some workbooks that I had, and I&nbsp;corrected it,&nbsp;but I currently forget what the solution was.

            How many worksheets are in the workbook? Maybe try saving copies of the worksheets to a new workbook and see if that clears it up.

    <title>Skip Record if in MS Word MailMerge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skip Record if in MS Word MailMerge</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing&nbsp;a mail merge with about 10 different types of letters, letters A-J, which are files in MS word, and one data sheet in Excel. Im using the "Skip Record If.." so each person gets the correct letter. (EX: if the persons an alumni, they get an alumni
 letter, if they've donated over X amount, they get a letter for that, and so on.) They can receive up to a maximum of three letters per person. I don't know how to make it so each person would get up to three letters as a mergefield. My attempt at trying this
 was by typing: { SKIPIF {MERGEFIELD Letter_Type {MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_2 { MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_3 &lt;&gt; "A" } } }}
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click "Finish &amp; Merge", the result is three letters, (should be more), and it leaves the mergefields and address blocks blank. If I only do one SkipIf Field, it works perfectly fine.
</p>

<p>

            <p>Your approach is wrong. You should be using&nbsp;ten ordinary IF tests along the lines of:<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_1}&lt;&gt; "" "Letter Type 1"}<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_2}&lt;&gt; "" "Letter Type 2"}<br />
{IF{MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_3}&lt;&gt; "" "Letter Type 3"}</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>{IF{MERGEFIELD Letter_Type_10}&lt;&gt; "" "Letter Type 10"}</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each "Letter Type ' output should contain the entire content for that letter or an INCLUDETEXT field pointing to it.</p>

    <title>Keyboard becomes unresponsive during PowerPoint presentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smurray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard becomes unresponsive during PowerPoint presentation</h2>
                    I have my MacBook Pro hooked up to a projector in my classroom and I use PowerPoint 2011 to give lectures. For some reason my keyboard becomes completely unresponsive about every 5-10 minutes when displaying a presentation. At first I thought it was an
 issue with my remote I was using, however today I used just the keyboard to advance slides and it did the same thing. It's just the keyboard that stops working, the mouse/trackpad works fine. The only way to get it working again is to exit the presentation
 and start it up again. I don't have to quit the entire program, just exit out of presenter view and start it back up again. Any idea what could be causing this?

            If you have not tried it yet, you could perform a hard reset, but if every memorycard you have work on other phones but not the 5310, it might be a hardwareproblem with your device.<br />
<br />
A Nokia care point might be the only solution.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>your 5310 will not accept more than 4gb normaly. First thing you can do, is reinstalling OS, you can do it your self with software updater :).</p>

<h2>            No, I do not want to enter Tablet Mode.</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Windows 10 TP on my SP3. Every day, I see somewhere between 20 and 50 notifications asking me if I want to enter tablet mode. I don't think that I am doing anything to prompt it to ask me; I'm not disconnecting the keyboard more than once
 a day. So, I'd like to know what the conditions are that it looks for to trigger Tablet Mode. Is this an expected behavior, or is there a software or hardware issue that's causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the idea of Tablet Mode and do occasionally use it, but I don't want to be prompted to switch 50 times a day.</p>

            This is not an option in Outlook for Mac at this time. If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />
<br />
The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list to be fixed.<br />

            I'm updated to build 10130 and that was where I reported the problem still existent from. I had noticed the problem in the previous build but that was my first exposure to Edge and I figured it would be taken care of in the next release. I still can't
 arrange the Favorites Bar items as I wish and have them stay that way at next Edge launch. This is especially a nuisance when I have more items than can be displayed and I can't manipulate placement of the new site.

            I have N-93. I dont see any of the problems you stated. It seems you were putting your phones on tight-fit jeans. These phones are delicate and needs gentle handling. Nokia will replace worn out body parts at a cost.

<p>Every time I open .docx, <strong>There was a problem sending the command to the program</strong> pops up, but I still get to the file. However, if I open .doc or anything else that is compatible with Word, it smoothly opens. I have already checked many forums

            <p>If you just keep inputting data should be added automatically and the text will continue over onto that page.</p>

<p>If you want to force a new page, click on the Page Layout tab and then expand the Breaks item in the Page Setup section of the ribbon and click on the Page item under the Page Breaks heading.</p>

            You have to try it with a Surface Pro, using the pen/stylist, not typing on a keyboard.&nbsp; The problem is what I'm writing with the pen is a saved as a graphic, not text.&nbsp; So the curser remains at the top of the page.&nbsp; I can not force the curser to the bottom
 of the page, so a new page does not automatically appear like when your typing.&nbsp; In addition, when you insert a page it inserts at the top of the page, where the curser is, not at the bottom where my writing is.<br />

            This works, but I haven't found a quick and efficient way of transitioning from the stylus pen setting to the cursor setting.&nbsp; Is there a quick way to toggle between the two so I can easily insert pages?
