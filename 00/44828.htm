<h2>            Surface Book 2 Adaptive Screen Brightness</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought the new surface book 2 today and I absolutely love it. I have one issue though. I am not comfortable with the adaptive brightness. I switched it off in the control panel but still the adaptive brightness is on. From what I read on the internet,
 it is the problem with the intel graphics driver. I tried downloading the driver but I can't seem to get to the right driver. Can someone help me in figuring out the right driver/ fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Kapilan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are threads posted here in the Community that discussed similar concerns as yours and they've described that this adaptive screen brightness behavior can be associated with the device's Intel graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download and install the latest Surface firmware and drivers from here:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download drivers and firmware
 for Surface.</a></strong> You may also visit Intel's official website and look for the latest driver for your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can carefully review and follow <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/surface-pro-4-automatic-screen-dimming-even-though/baee2465-db7f-452c-a96e-e6174c8eab07">this
 community thread</a></strong>&nbsp; and look for MikeBattista's suggested solution. His suggestion was found helpful by several members who experienced the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to reply should you have further concerns.</p>

<p>Hi Kapilan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if you saw my post but your issue sure sounds like the same problem i already worked with Microsoft and have a solution for. See my thread here (with fix):</p>

<h2>            extended desktop - primary monitor settings will not lock in</h2>
                    <p>I have nearly the same question as a user in windows 7</p>
<p>in windows 10 my primary monitor settings will not lock in&nbsp; see previous post&nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"&nbsp;Whenever it goes to sleep, is undocked, or re-booted, it "forgets" the display settings and reverts to&nbsp;a default setting of cloned desktops with the monitor (not the notebook)&nbsp;set as primary. Oddly, before it reverts to the default settings, it very briefly
 displays the extended desktop with my preferred settings. I then have to manually reconfigure the display properties. A real pain to do&nbsp;several times a day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate advice about locking one monitor as primary if possible and the resolutions too</p>

<h2>            Free copy of South Park The Stick of Truth</h2>
                    <p>I preordered South Park The Fractured But Whole Gold Edition on Oct. 27, 2016 from the Xbox One marketplace store. I have not been able to download the free backwards compatible copy of South Park The Stick of Truth that is included as a promotion. I spoke with an Xbox representative and he directed me to this forum to have this issue resolved. He said that I did not get a license for Stick of Truth when&nbsp;I purchased The Fractured But Whole.</p>

            <p>I'm also having a problem with the backwards compatible 360 Arcade title Dead Space Ignition.&nbsp; I purchased that game in October of 2010.&nbsp; It does not show up on my Ready to Install tab. The listing for the game on the Xbox One store shows that I need to pay for it, but the Xbox.com listing shows that I have already purchased the game.&nbsp; For some reason, the representative was unable to find a record of the game in my purchase history.</p>

<h3> ziatahir  say:</h3>
<h2>            The &#34;message window&#34; on Dell Latitude 7490 in windows 10 Pro is too small</h2>
                    <p>Hello, have seen lots of people complaining about the same issue and the thread had been locked but want to know if there is a solution. My pop up windows and message windows not only from third party but even from windows itself and microsoft office appear
 so small for some reaso and this is brand new laptop. Just to give you an example, the print window is so small that it can barely be read. I have two extended secreens too, when I throw that window on other screens, then it appears fine but not on laptop.
 Mine is touch screen too. I am not sure what is the reason, but this is the company laptop and my IT guy does not know how o fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate some help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Zia,
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />If your screen resolution on that laptop is greater than 1920 X 1080 then you have a hi-def screen
<br />
<br />If you do have a Hi-def screen try increasing the scale factor on that laptop screen
<br />
<br />Increase the scale factor by 10% and see if those dialogs look any better
<br />
<br />If not, continue to increase that until you are happy with the view
<br />
<br />Once you have finished setting a scale factor, you may need to change the size of your Desktop icons to make them smaller - Press Ctrl and scroll down on your mouse wheel
<br />
<br />You may also need to set the zoom in Office applications to zoom out on your documents . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Inspiron 11 3000 2-1 laptop will not start when lid is opened</h2>
                    I have a Inspiron 11 3000 2in1 laptop that originally had Windows 8.1 but was upgraded to Window 10.&nbsp; Before this upgrade, when I opened my laptop, the computer would turn on automatically. Now since the upgrade,&nbsp; I have to hold the power button for about
 5 seconds until the power&nbsp;light turns on then fades off without starting up.&nbsp; Then if I push the power button once more, then the computer will start.&nbsp; It takes a while for Windows 10 to start and I sometimes loose my curser, like I am in tablet mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any
 suggestions on how I can get my computer to start when I open the lid?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) What is the exact error message when you open Apps Store?</span></p>
<p><span>b) Is your system connected to a proxy server for internet connection?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that&nbsp;the apps store is force closed when you try to download any app.
</span><span>This might occur due to Windows store corruption, proxy internet connection etc. I would suggest you to try the following
</span><span>methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>

</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Reset store cache:</span></p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
The WebCam would normally not be in the BIOS. Check with your System Maker,<br />
their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any) about known<br />
issues.<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

            Your best bet is probably to put your files into the Public Folders because they are then accessible to everyone. Click the Start globe, then Help, then look for help on "share files". Now click "Share files using the Public folders" to see how it's done.

<p>Check the registry (Click Start -&gt; run and type regedit). Look for<br />
'No modify accts'<br />
in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Outlook Express<br />
and set it to 0.</p>

            <p>Hi Prasanna, </p>

</p><p>The issue could have happened due to some file corruptions.&nbsp;I would request you to perform SFC scan and then check if it helps.

    <title>Unidentified Program Opening on Windows 10 Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petedln  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unidentified Program Opening on Windows 10 Startup</h2>
                    <p>When I startup my laptop upon getting to the desktop an unidentified program briefly loads up multiple times and then disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried having task manager open when this happens so I can identify it but it is too slow to open. I also cannot find a program on my programs list that matches the icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to Google a description of the icon hasn't yielded any results either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what it is (below)? Is it a virus of some kind? Not much seems to happen, it slows down the startup of the laptop somewhat but after initially opening and closing multiple times in quick succession there appear to be no further effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

            Have you checked the startup programs to see if there’s anything unusual in there?
<br />Using task manager there should be a startup tab.
<br />
<br />Just in case of malware run these programs:

    <title>Windows 10 reset external monitors settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefan traistaru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reset external monitors settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;When I connected my Laptop to a 4k TV with a HDMI cable I tried different resolutions for the TV. Of course I tried the 4k resolution just to see if there is any noticeable difference and thinking that if I don't like the performance I can always change
 it back to 1080p. Before I applied the 4k resolution I changed the settings to "Second screen only" ( really bad choice) and right after I changed it, my TV screen went white / a light grey. After I disconnect the hdmi cable my laptop monitor stays white for
 a few seconds than it goes into the lockscreen (fully usable after that).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is that because I changed the settings to second screen only, every time I connect my laptop to the TV it automatically changes the settings to that mode and the TV resolution to 4k, so I can't go in the display settings and change the resolution
 back.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;How can I reset the TV's settings so that windows will think that is the first time I'm connecting to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have found a solution for my problem but I had to delete three registry keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Warning!&nbsp;</strong>This solution worked for me and I do not guarantee it will work for you. I am not responsible if anything happens to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Press <strong>Windows + R</strong></li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Type <strong>regedit </strong>and hit ENTER.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; If a message pops up saying "<em>do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device</em>" click YES.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; A window called "Registry Editor" should show.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Locate this three registry keys:
<ul>
<li><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration</em></li><li><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Connectivity</em></li><li><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\ScaleFactors</em></li></ul>
</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; After finding them <strong>right click</strong> on each folder and select
<strong>delete</strong> than <strong>yes</strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Basically what this did was to force windows forget the monitors (and their settings) that you used with this PC. After this when you connect your PC to a monitor, windows should "rediscover" it as if it was the first time and all the settings will be
 at their default values again.</p>

            You can display your personal folder as a menu on the right side of the Start menu, then add your custom folders to your personal folder. Right-click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, then click <strong>Properties</strong>. Next, click
<strong>Customize</strong> and scoll down the list to <strong>Personal folder</strong> and select to display it as a menu. Now add your custom folders to your personal folder and they will display as a sub-menu on the Start menu.<br />
<br />
Is that what you are looking for?

            Of course you could also do the same thing for your&nbsp;Documents folder (display it as a menu on Start and put your custom folders under it).

<p><span>BBc i-player streaming</span></p>
<p>For over a month now I have found that&nbsp;I cannot play the BBC&nbsp;i-player, without it freezing after a few minutes, with the buffering symbol appearing. Occasionally it will start up again of its own accord, but this is rare and it never continues to work to
 the end of&nbsp;a bradcast. I have checked bandwidth and other settings with my inernet service provider and they have assured me that they are all o.k. There is no problem there. I have made many calls to other services and helplines, and tried out various suggestions,
 but the problem persists.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that your normal account works fine. The fact remains that new accounts don't, which suggests that something damaged the default profile on your machine - hence my suggestion that your installation might be damaged. If you are unable to
 locate something malicious then you could move in the opposite direction: Use your own and apparently healthy profile as a basis for all new accounts. These links should help you:</p>

<p>1) be able to play ranked 2 headed giant with a local player.</p>
<p>2) be able to invite your friend/party to a ranked game.&nbsp; Constantly people go in and out of games just so that they can play with their friend.&nbsp; It's so annoying.&nbsp; Either allow people to join with friends, or don't allow any selection.&nbsp; it's just silly.</p>
