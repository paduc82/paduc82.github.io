    <title>Moto Q Voice notes no longer recording - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evilipoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moto Q Voice notes no longer recording</h2>
                    
<p>I don't use the Voice Notes feature that often, but I do find it extremely handy!&nbsp; Having said that, I no longer have the ability to record Voice Notes on my Q.&nbsp;
I know that accidentally I deleted a file some time ago and now I see what it was for...&nbsp; :-(, problem is--I don't know what the file is called or where to retreive or download it from.&nbsp; Here is the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I record a voice note, I get only slight static on playback.&nbsp; Earpiece is turned up all the way.&nbsp; I
<u>do</u> hear the background hiss, just no new recording.&nbsp; Old Voice Notes recording plays fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to identify and re-install the missing file(s) without doing a complete upgrade and wiping my other customizations?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No, not really.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is my advice.&nbsp; Backup your device, hard reset and then check to see if the record feature is working.&nbsp; If it is, then you will need to reinstall everything back ... whish is easier than it sounds since most likely everything is already
 on your PC.&nbsp; You can reinstall right from AS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it did not work, then you can restore the backup and you are back where you were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an advantage to the hard reset.&nbsp; You will get everything back to factory default and you will now have a clean device.&nbsp; Now you will probably choose tonoto reinstall programs that you no longer use so the end result is that you will
 have a better running device.</p>

    <title>iPhone 6&#43;&#39;s iOS Mail app shows over 260 draft e-mail, but not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ant dude  say:</h3>
<h2>            iPhone 6&#43;&#39;s iOS Mail app shows over 260 draft e-mail, but not showing up in USC&#39;s Office 365&#39;s Outlook Web App &#40;OWA&#41;...</h2>
                    <p>For the last few days ago, there were over 260 e-mails in draft folder showing in iPhone 6+'s iOS (v11.4.1 and v12) Mail app! Most of them came from Inbox! Also, none of these draft e-mails don't show up in web site's OWA (USC's Office 365 (https://www.usc.edu/office365)'s
 Outlook(.com)). Rebooting the iPhone and upgrading its iOS (v11.4.1 to v12) didn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even move all iPhone's draft e-mails back to inbox to keep them. I also noticed there is a spinning circular animation process in the top of iPhone screen to say it is synchronizing(?) or something that never ends. I don't want to lose all of these
 draft e-mails especially when making a new Exchange account, another mail client app, and they're not on OWA web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on and how to fix it? :(</p>

<p>Hi Ant Dude,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description I understand the issue is related to the default Mail app on your iPhone which was undesirably moving your emails from Inbox to Drafts folder. Since the issue doesn't happen
 on OWA, the service from Office 365 side is OK and it may relate to the sync process on Mail app. Given the situation, our suggestions are:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Use Outlook for iOS instead of the Mail app. Outlook has more features (like Group management ability) than Mail app, it’s recommended for Office 365 users to use it on mobile devices. And since
 the emails are OK on OWA, the emails should be in right place in your mailbox and it's OK to configure your account in new clients like Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)If you still need to use the default Mail app, please contact Apple support for further troubleshooting since the service is OK on our side and the issue is related to the Mail app. It would be
 much more efficient to directly troubleshoot the issue with the app manufacturer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and understanding and hopefully the issue can be resolved soon.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h2>            Problem with Excel 2016 - stuck on loading and requires restart</h2>
                    I have office 2016 installed with OS X El Capitan on my MacBook Air and Excell is giving me grief. It keeps sticking so that the little rainbow wheel goes round and round for ever, it says "loading" but the only way out is to restart my computer every
 time which requires force quitting Excell. Has anyone else had this problem?

<h2>            Windows Build 14316 Mobile Build 14322 cannot use connect app.</h2>
                    <p>So I'm on build 14316 on the Desktop. Build 14322 on the Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pull down the notifications on the phone and hit connect, it endlessly searches for a device but never finds anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC and Phone are on the same network but the PC is wired into the router, the phone is wireless, I've tried both 5Ghz and 2.5Ghz.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an Xbox One that I've tried wired and wireless that you can apparently get to work with continuum but I cant work that out either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is setup as a DMZ in the router. Ive tried UPNP on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me exactly what is supposed to happen and shove me in the right direction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried in desperation removing and re-installing the connect app through the powershell.</p>
<p>I've tried with and without the USB cable, in both USB 3 and 2 ports on the PC</p>

<p>Really? Copying and pasting a basic troubleshooting step was helpful? Please explain how a soft reset would a) Help and b) possibly be any solution?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No shockingly a soft reset/hard reset didn't help. Maybe you could re-read my question and think about a technical answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mind re-doing the basics but&nbsp;really that step is utterly pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked how it was supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe what ports the phone/connect app uses so I can try port forwarding. Maybe a little more in depth info on exactly how the phone/connect app see each other on the same network, specifically. OFC from a standard networking point of view they are on the
 same network, but the phone is wireless and the PC is wired, to the same router. On the same IP Range, Subnet and are both using the same DNS, WINS and Domain. It is a home network with only one router which manages 2.5Ghz, 5Ghz and wired connections.</p>

</p><p>Come on, even the ports used would be beneficial, so i can try port forwarding my phone. Will plugging in USB-C to Ethernet work?</p>

            <blockquote>Same in build 14328 and Mobile 14328. </blockquote>
<p>Okay, I thought that I was the only one. I was able to use the Connect app in the first build in which it was available (14316? 14295?), but since then I've been unable to connect my 950XL to my Surface Book. I had the "device doesn't support Miracast" error
 after upgrading to a new build which went away after reinstalling the Surface Book drivers pack. I can see the device on my 950XL's connection screen. When I try to connect, the phone's screen flashes black a couple of times, then a connection failed error
 shows up. Nothing happens on the Surface Book. When it worked last month, I saw the message on the SB change to indicate things were pairing and setting up, but now it just sits at the "ready to connect" screen. Network connections in general have been buggy
 in the new desktop builds, so I'm wondering if that's a contributing factor.</p>

<h2>            Deleting mail account</h2>

 will I lose use of that account in outlook only - which I prefer - or will I lose ofmthe account altogether?

<h2>            Sharepoint Workspace 2010&#58; opens and closes repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>I am really at a loss with this one - Sharepoint Workspace has been opening and closing over and over. Its not a full close and launch - I don't get the Sharepoint splash screen. I'd almost describe it as the launcher&nbsp;window minimizes and then immediately
 opens back up. The big problem is that, at the same time, if I have the workspace open, it shuts that window as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Editing to add: I've since noticed that every time this cycle happens (about every 50 to 60 seconds), there is an entry in the Event Viewer in Windows related to the Office Software Protection Platform Service. The detail of the entry reads:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The Software Protection service has completed licensing status check.</p>
<p>Application Id=59a52881-a989-479d-af46-f275c6370663</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried leaving Word and PowerPoint open at the same time to see if it would happen to those applications but it does not - only Sharepoint.
</p>
<p>Has anyone run across anything like this and have any idea what a fix might be?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yammer is social enterprise networking website for organizational purpose, where you can create groups, external network, post files messages, can communicate with your employee and share the files and messages.</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Yammer-admin-guide-a9c206d4-fb18-4250-bec6-e783b926e4f6</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn848414.aspx?ppud=4</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one option to add Org chart in user profile under edit settings there they can add other user as a manager or colleagues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However yammer is not a matching tool or something which you are looking for.</p>

<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with the issue related to Office.</p>

</p>
<p>Since you are unable to locate Office in the control panel, I would suggest you to run the fix it from the link below to remove the&nbsp;traces of Office:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0563c1">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></span></a></p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: Try to save the fix it tool to the desktop and then run it to remove Office.</span></font></p>
<p><a href="https://cat.microsoft.com/Ticket.aspx?id=2314226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<h2>            My Internet browsers will not connect</h2>
                    I am on a home network and my brosers(IE,FF and Chrome) will not connect to the internet. My other computers will and I can access the internet from this computer when I connect to my workplace VPN. I have ran security scans and found no virus and I have
 shut off all Proxies and tryed reseting the netsh and system restore. When I keep clicking refresh on IE it will show a blob of what I think is some type of code.

            Are you only getting the error message when you try to install those two applications? How about when you try to install other applications? What connection are you using, by the way? If data connection, you can try to switch to WiFi.<br />
<br />
If above wouldn't help, you can try to download and install the applications using Nokia Suite. If this would fail still, you may consider re-installing the software of your device.<br />
<br />
Cheers.

<h2>            Bing images no longer allows open new tab with middle mouse. WHY&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So a few months ago, I noticed that with the bing/windows update that changed the bing images layout, I can no longer open an image in a new window with the middle mouse slick. I've tried searching for this problem but unfortunately every find was very outdated
 and so were the suggested solutions. Despite the age of the posts, I DID try the suggestions to no avail. in order to open a new tab in bing images, I have to constantly right click and "open link in new tab". Not even the HOLD CONTROL AND THEN CLICK trick
 works. it forces me to right click and open in new tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked and rechecked the tab options in both IE11 AND the bing home page. ive checked the mouse itself and it does not require any updates / drivers and I have been using the same mouse for almost 2 years now, and have NEVER encountered this problem
 before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Professional SP1 (64b),&nbsp;IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help. ty</p>

<p>Hi Aberro, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be caused by a corrupted cache or cookies of your browser. To have a further view of your issue, we need the following information:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried to use another browser?</li><li>Have you tried to look for another image? Is it doing the same thing?</li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, we suggest that you clear cache and cookies on your current browser and see if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. </p>
<p>

<p>1) I haven't tried using another browser only because I don't either like or trust any other (I have tried other browsers like chrome and firefox, but not since this issue had started). I will however try FireFox as soon as I can, and let u know if this
 problem occurs there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) ALL images have the same problem. It doesn't matter what im searching: from puppies to monsters, toy cars to super cars, atoms to stars, the problem is the same all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have cleared all browsing history, caches, cookies, download lists, (and reluctantly) saved forum data, etc., and still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, I will try firefox and will let u know if the problem is the same there or not.</p>

<p>Sorry for the belated response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive just tried FireFox and the problem is not replicated there - when I middlemouse click an image, it properly opens that image in a different tab. however I do not intend on using firefox or anything other than IE for that matter.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>A custom contour is a property of the assignment it is entered for, and it will be saved in the assignment when the file is saved. It is not an object that can exist or be saved on its own right. Hope this helps,</p>

            Hi&nbsp;problem here today,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for participating in the forum. We apologize for the inconvenience the issue may have caused you. I understand that you're not able to add attachments to your emails. Let us help you on the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As of this writing, there is no announced issue from Outlook.com about adding attachments to emails. It's possible that the browser you're using is causing the issue. I suggest that you optimize your web browser then try again. Please refer to the link
 below for steps on how to do so:</div>

            I am getting the same problem tonight.&nbsp; Never got this prior to the migration from hotmail. It seems to be an ongoing performance issue with outlook.com.&nbsp; If you do it in slack period it works fine, but try in the evening when everyone is hacking into
 their e-mail and it give this silly 'geting set up please try later' message.&nbsp; I just wish they would get it sorted, its been doing it for months.

<h2>            Something went wrong. We couldn&#39;t start your program. No error code.</h2>
                    <p>hi there</p>
<p>I purchased microsoft office 365 University in February but I have been unable to open any of the files, WORD, Powerpoint, Xcel etc or any of the files I have created on my laptop for the last few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I am getting on my lap to is : "Something went wrong. We couldn't start your program. Please try starting it again. If it won't start, try repairing office from "programs and features" in the control panel. You can go online for more help."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to access the online chat service for three days but, intriguingly, I get through to the same person each time I try, I wait for the link up for a few minutes, then I get told that she is busy, then I get told that nobody is free and do
 I want to phone instead. I have left my phone number but after 24 hours I have heard nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the comments on this site and one which i tried to follow through on was to access my account, uninstall the software, then remove all trace from my laptop, then re-install. It sounds straightforward but I can only deactivate in my account, not unstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more bizarrely, I cannot access the account page where my software is. I managed it once but every other time I have tried I get through to my account page with all my personal details on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>has anybody got any ideas</p>

I have the same exact same issue, no idea how to fix it, this is really frustrating. Sorry and I send you my condolences for choosing this unreliable software. 



Microsoft, 



Please put your **** together I paid money for this software and I expected it to work when I click on the icon of the software, I do NOT have time to read hundreds of threads in forums or follow "workaround" instructions to fix this problem. TIME IS MONEY AND YOUR ARE COSTING ME MONEY.I NEED THIS FIXED OR GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.

Girish 



I am suffering the same problem. 



1) I have successfully run the Fix it tool.  It didn't list any previous Office installations 



2) I have rebooted the computer numerous times 



3) I have re-installed Office365 and this still persists. 



I am still unable to access any Office application and the computer is still determined that there is something still installing.   



I am unable to fix the install as something is apparently still installing 



I need my Office documents for my business and don't need this ****.

<p>
</p><p>Hello Ivan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description it looks like you have a Click-to-Run installation of Office installed on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2013/365 versions (Office 365 Home, Office 365 Personal, Office Home and Student 2013, Office Home and Business 2013 and Office Professional 2013) are Click-to-Run versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you may skip the section ‘Step 1: Determine the installation type of your version of Office’ and follow the steps under ‘Step 2: Manually uninstall Office 2013 or Office 365’ for Click-to-Run installation and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the Windows Phone Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two things I recommend&nbsp;to do to make sure everything is completely gone from your phone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, you'll want to clear the cache.&nbsp; To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Applications -&gt; Internet Explorer, and tap on Delete History.&nbsp; This deletes all temporary files from app installations, files downloaded through Internet Explorer, as well as browsing
 history and bookmarks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; About, and you'll find a Reset My Phone button there.&nbsp; This step takes the phone back to factory settings and removes your account from the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've done these two things, there shouldn't be anything left on the phone anywhere and you can sell the phone or give it away and start enjoying your Windows Phone 8!&nbsp; As long as you set up the new phone with the same Microsoft Account you used for
 your Lumia 610, all your contacts and calendars will come back, and any apps that you purchased (that are also compatible with WP8) can be reinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in touch if you have any other questions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Kevin J S</p>

<h2>            VBA for Excel &#58; Dimension UserForm as Object</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want my code to show my UserForm. Got this code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub FormatCODSfile()<br />
'<br />
' FormatCODSfile Macro<br />
'<br />
If SheetExists("vesselReconciliation.jsp") Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UserForm1.Show<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox ("No CODS report found. Please export Cargo Readiness report to excel before running macro again.")<br />
End If</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>This step should be as easy as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UserForm1.Show</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but not working.&nbsp; Any ideas why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried also</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim UF As Object</p>
<p>Set UF = UserForm1</p>
<p>UF.Show</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the reference to the UserForm1 is not usable by VBA not sure why...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That code works fine and there's nothing I can see that would give a 'subscript out of range' error. If the userform name was wrong you would get Runtime error 424 - Object required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best guess is that as the userform tries to load you have some code in the initialise event that looks for something that isn't there such as a worksheet. That would give a subscript out of range error and the userform wouldn't load. Instead the code
 would fail on the line userform1.show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any initialise code in the userform? Yes? Carefully check the code for spelling mistakes for things like worksheet names.</p>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The problem isn't with the UserForm1.Show line of code. The problem lies in the code within that form's code module. You need to change your error trapping settings to get to the error. In VBA, go to the Tools menu and choose Options. There, go to the General
 tab and select "Break In Class Module" in the Error Trapping group. Now, when you run the code, the debugger will take you to the actual line of code that is causing the error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error trapping setting is not "Break In Class Module" and an error occurs during the initialization of a class (and a UserForm is just a special type of class), the debugger will stop at the line of code that created the object from the class, which&nbsp;in
 your case is the UserForm1.Show line of code. When "Break In Class Module" is in effect, the debugger will take you inside the class to the line of code that caused the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should *always* have "Break In Class Module" selected. There is no reason not to.</p>

<h2>            Changing sim card nokia e71</h2>
                    
<p>Last year I bought an E71 as part of a 24 month contract. Recently, my sister and I swapped phones and kept our respective sim cards (which are on the same network provider), my former phone accepts the sim card and she is able to send and recieve texts,
 and phone calls. The problem being that when she tries to make calls (from my former phone) there sometimes is no dial tone. I was told that the phone had saved data from my sim card and needed to be reformatted, is this the case?</p>
