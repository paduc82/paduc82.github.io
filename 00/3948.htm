<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/10c244c3-88be-4def-a293-8b217f9b67c0" title="maureenburns1">
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your Skype version, you can delete entire conversations by following the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Skype for Windows</strong> <strong>10 </strong>v.12.18:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From your <strong>Recent </strong>list, locate the conversation you want to delete and right-click on it.
</li><li>Select <strong>Delete conversation</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>New Skype on Desktop</strong> v.8.19:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>From your <strong>Chats </strong>list, locate the conversation you want to delete and right-click on it.
</span></li><li>Select <strong>Delete ch</strong><strong>at</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: You may only delete one conversation at a time. Skype for Windows 10 and the new Skype on Desktop does not offer the option to delete multiple chat conversations at once</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, classic Skype for Windows desktop v.7.41 does not have the option to delete conversations, however you may hide them. Right-click on the conversation from your
<strong>Recent </strong>tab and choose <strong>Hide conversation&nbsp;</strong>or you can also try clearing your history by clicking
<strong>Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Options </strong>&gt; <strong>IM &amp; </strong><strong>SMS</strong> &gt;
<strong>IM </strong><strong>settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Clear history</strong>. Please be reminded that this will delete
<strong>all </strong>your conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I draw symbols that are the same size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to be able to draw certain decorative shapes on my document such as 3 trianges in a row with perhaps the middle triange upside down. I can so this by going to insert/shapes.&nbsp; I am able to draw the triangles and turn the middle triangle upside down.&nbsp;
 I am also able to shrink them down to size so that they are all about the same size.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there an easy &nbsp;way however to insure that they are exactly the same size?&nbsp;

            The simplest way to make sure they're all the same size is to draw the first one, copy it to the clipboard, and make all the others by pasting from the clipboard. Then you can rotate or otherwise format each one individually, but be careful not to drag
 their bounding boxes.<br />
<br />
The other way, if you must deal with shapes that have already been drawn separately, is to select one and note the measurements in the Size group of the Drawing Tools tab of the ribbon. Then select another one and set the Size measurements to the same values;
 and repeat for each of the others.<br />

<p>I'm sorry but this is not very user friendly.</p>
<p>SE has an option under Settings to Schedule a Scan, that is easy, but that's my opinion.</p>

            <p>I can see both sides.&nbsp; On the one hand, it's really awesome that you can set one specific time and know that your computer will take care of everything then.&nbsp; It's like housekeeping coming around to empty your trash, dust, clean, and make your beds all at
 once.&nbsp; You don't have to "micro manage" and set a new schedule for every little thing.&nbsp; Normal people that use their computers like an appliance love this, it's a one-click-and-done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power Users like us want all the control we can get, and we want to tinker and set every tiny little option, spending hours or days configuring exactly when/how/what gets scanned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to please both groups sometimes, unless you just hire two fleets of programmers and have one team develop for one group, and another develop for the other. Then you end up with version conflicts, feature creep/bloat/bugs. It becomes hard to manage.&nbsp;
 I've worked in development for years and know how hard it can be to battle this, even at the developer level. And of course the upper management is battling the same dichotomy.

<p>Also IF this Automatic Maintenance is working the way it should, then Defender should be getting new definition updates every day and it isn't.</p>
<p>I know when Win 10 first came out I was told auto update for definitions wasn't working. I'm guessing that it hasn't been fixed.</p>

<p>Windows Update is getting the def updates if you check for them. The problem is they aren't being pushed and if you look for them you can get anywhere from 8-10 in a 24 hour period. LOL</p>

    <title>Powershell Script to grab delegate and calender permissions for all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamarr2018  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powershell Script to grab delegate and calender permissions for all users in an organization and export to CSV</h2>
                    <p>Currently I can use a command&nbsp;<strong>get-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity email@domain:\Calendar&nbsp;</strong>and get the sharing permissions for an individual account and check sharing properties each user has to the email@domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a script I can run to target an entire organization to find these properties and export to a CSV?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a script that can do the same but target delegates of a mailbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            This depends on what you understand by delegates. The script above will list any users that have been granted any permissions on the Calendar (or any folder) in user's mailboxes. The actual "Delegate" flag is not visible via PowerShell, you will have to
 use some EWS based script for that. Here's one:&nbsp;http://www.flobee.net/powershell-module-for-managing-exchange-2010-mailbox-delegates/

<h2>            Auto rotate not working properly in Surface Pro 3 after installing Technical Preview.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: auto rotate surface pro 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Surface Pro 3 I did install windows 10 technical preview.</p>
<p>The machine is running smooth and facing just one issue.</p>
<p>I can rotate the display by turning the surface horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>To prevent rotating you can right Swipe, settings =&gt; screen (this bar got also a (un)lock button and a slider for brightness)</p>
<p>One's in a while the (un)lock button disapears. I cant figure out why! (today its back)</p>
<p>Keyboard attached or not does not alter this.</p>
<p>At the same time the auto rotate fails also.</p>
<p>Finally I have to use the display settings to transform from landscape to portrait.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to not installing latest drivers for the Surface Pro3. In this scenario, I suggest you to try installing the latest drivers and updates from Windows Update and check if the issue persists.

    <title>how to change &#34;save as&#34; default file format in visio from .vsd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shaking928  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to change &#34;save as&#34; default file format in visio from .vsd to .emf</h2>
                    I use visio frequently and i would save individual image element in .emf format and then insert it in word documents. Every time I save it, the default format is .vsd. I have to activate the dropdown list and pick the .emf format carefully. This action
 repeats so many times and it irritates me most. I try to change such kind of situation. There is no corresponding settings in&nbsp;visio. I&nbsp;just find that there is some key in the registry may be related to this.&nbsp;The&nbsp;key is MTTF and MTTA. I&nbsp;searched the explanation
 about these two keys and there is no&nbsp;material at all on the web.&nbsp;So I turn to&nbsp;this place and hope to find an answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Thks!

<p>What you should do is create a macro like<br />
<br />
Option Explicit</p>
<p>Sub Macro1()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application.ActiveWindow.Page.Export "C:\Users\John\Documents\Drawing1.emf"</p>
<p>End Sub<br />
and save it to a ctrl key or a button on a menu.<br />
<br />
The save is actually an export command. The file extension indicates the file type to export as. You will need to embelish the code to prompt for a full file name.<br />
<br />
I apologize for such a brief answer, I am a bit tired from a very long flight, but hopefully there is enough information for you to continue or others to help you along.</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 does not show all open windows in taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mxrdr21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 does not show all open windows in taskbar</h2>
                    <p>We're having a frequent issue with opening multiple Excel documents, intermittently (10+ times a day for some users) Excel will only display one open document in the task bar, when there are multiple documents open. In order to switch between the documents
 you need to use alt-tab or View&gt;Switch Windows in Excel. I've verified the Excel &gt; Advanced &gt; Show all windows in the taskbar option is checked, and we've also tried setting the taskbar to never combine labels. I'm able to replicate it on multiple production
 Windows 8.1 Pro PCs, and a test Windows 8.1 VM which has nothing but Office 2010 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*Edit*</strong></p>
<p>Just to clarify we only see this issue on Windows 8.1 clients running Office 2010. We've tested it with 2010 on Windows 7 and do not see the issue with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching I found a few threads over 2 years old with people reporting the same issue, and it seems like there is still no resolution.</p>

            <p>That wouldn't function as much of a workaround, I think alt-tab'ing is easier than tiling/splitting the windows particularly when dealing with wide worksheets. Alt-tab'ing isn't a working fix either, we need to be able to see the open workbooks in the taskbar
 which is the expected behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is inherently solved in Office 2013 because they changed the UI giving every open workbook it's own window (presumably so people with multiple monitors can easily view multiple workbooks) but I can't simply upgrade all of my users to Office 2013
 because of this, especially with the 2016 release being so close.</p>

            I assume you're talking about the "Show this number of Recent Documents" option, that just dictates how many documents should be displayed in the File&gt;Recent list...but our's is set to the default of 25.

</p><p>I want to export my notes from my classes into a PDF so I can save space and back-up on an external hard drive. Every time I select pages to export as PDF or print as PDF, OneNote consistently crashes, shuts down, and doesn't print the document I want. It's
 becoming extremely frustrating and becoming more of a waste of time using this program if I cannot even export my own notes out of OneNote.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using both a PC and Surface Pro 3, Windows 7 on the PC, Windows 8 on the Surface. Both have the desktop software installed, exactly the same result on both. The export appears to get about three quarters of the way through, and then One Note crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the printer 'Fix' mentioned above, with no improvement.</p>

 generic printer. Try setting </span><strong>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</strong> as your default printer and check if you are able to export page/sections/books from OneNote as PDF without OneNote crashing.</span></span></p>

            <p>First thing to do is check to see if the preview is activated. It must be activated to do a clean install of windows 10. You cannot upgrade or convert since a clean install is required. If it is not activated and you cannot activate because you don't have
 a valid product key for windows 7 or 8.1, you will have to reinstall 7 or 8.1 activate windows and upgrade again. Or if you never did the upgrade and don't have win 7 or 8.1 to qualify for it, you can buy windows 10 license at the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is activated download the Create Media tool for another computer, burn an install disk and do a clean
<em>custom</em> install. Create media tool is here</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the directions carefully. You will delete the drive with windows preview and everything will be lost so make copies of all your personal files on external media.</p>

            <p>If it is pasted as a picture, you cannot change lines in PowerPoint. Do you see these lines in Excel? If so, remove them there before copying. Which picture format do you use? Use File&nbsp;- Paste Special and&nbsp;try Enhanced Metafile Format (EMF) or PNG, they usually
 work better than JPEG.</p>
<p>If this does not work, you need to copy as a picture in Excel: On the Home tab, click the small triangle arrow to the right of the Copy button. Chose Copy as Picture - As shown on screen. Then in PowerPoint Paste Special in one of the above mentioned formats.</p>

<p>

<p>Not the solution I was looking for. But thanks for trying. The idea is I want to link my current Microsoft linked email address to a local account without a password.<br />

    <title>How do I prevent outlook from defaulting to the first alphabetical - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#201;ric langevin  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I prevent outlook from defaulting to the first alphabetical alias&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my hotmail address. The question is: how do I prevent the outlook.com website and Outlook 2016 Windows 7 desktop application from defaulting to the first alphabetical alias? Full details and what I have tried are below, please read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an Office 365 home member. For a long time, I have had my hotmail adress. It worked good. I added an alias 1 or 2 years ago for subscribing a specific category of incoming e-mail (like newsletters). It still worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, recently, I created a second alias for another category of incoming e-mails from the Outlook.com website (since you cannot create such things directly from Outlook 2016). Something went wrong. Now, every single e-mail I send out from my hotmail
 appears like this: First Name Last Name &lt;second *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;. Basically, my second alias seems to have taken over my account as the default sender of e-mail. However, my hotmail adress is still the one I connect with and still the one displayed at the
 top of Outlook 2016 and the outlook.com website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is problematic to me. I just want to keep going with First Name Last Name &lt;original hotmail adress&gt; but keep the second alias for subscribing to stuff like newsletters (some incoming e-mails, not all outgoing e-mails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the most likely cause of the problem is that my chosen second alias comes first in alphabetical order (before the main account and my first alias).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a serious problem because :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In Outlook 2016 (the desktop program) there is no way to manually override this default alphabetical behaviour of Outlook. Any e-mail sent with Outlook 2016 and my hotmail account will look to the receiver like it was sent by my second alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) From the Outlook.com website, it's super annoying to changing the "from" address from my second alias to my main account every single time I send an e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I have tried to fix the problem:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In Outlook 2016, I added the "From field". It clearly displays my original Hotmail adress (which is what I want), but when I send a test e-mail to myself (from: my hotmail, to: my hotmail adress), I receive the e-mail as from: First Name Last Name &lt;second
 alias&gt;, to: my hotmail. Basically, Outlook 2016 doesn't care what I put in the "from" field and uses my second alias to send all e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I went on outlook.com to see what I could do. When I try to write a new e-mail, it immediately defaults to First Name Last Name &lt;second alias&gt;. I can change the "from field" from there. That works out (the test e-mail can be seen from Outlook 2016 as
 from: hotmail, to: hotmail), however that approach has 2 massive disadvantages: 1) it only works if the e-mail is sent from the outlook.com website, it does not work from Outlook 2016 and 2) it has to be restarted every single time I want to send an e-mail
 (it doesn't even hold up 2 e-mails in a row).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have posted a tread similar to this one in the Office / Office 365 / Microsoft Outlook / Windows 7, and once they understood the problem, they determined that they had no idea how to fix this and referred me to you in the "outlook.com" section.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please provide solutions or ideas of solutions.</p>

<h2>            how to get refund for unauthorized debit for subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After receiving a mysterious charge on my checking account I contacted a Microsoft representative by phone that stated that the Zune 14 day trial period does an auto renewal at the same time that Xbox Live auto renews itself. To their credit, the Microsoft
 rep was able to refund (waiting 24-72 hrs for credit now) the unauthorized debit for Xbox Gold membership, but was quick to tell me that the Zune auto renewal ($10.81) was not a charge she could resolve. So I was then given<u> Zune.net</u> as the solution.
 It took me almost an hour to find the correct path in order to submit a service request for the refund. I hope this is helpful for someone else that might be experiencing the same problem:</p>

<p>Once I submitted the service request, I received a response by a rep within 1 busines day via email.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was then asked to reply with contact info: phone #, best time to contact me including my time zone. I just replied with my contact info today so I am
 now awaiting a phone call to get this issue resolved. Hopefully&nbsp;it will be refunded to my account as soon as I am able to speak to someone instead of just sending an email back and forward.
</p>
<p>Will keep you posted if there are any other steps that are necessary for resolution.
</p>
<p>Hoping this will do it. </p>

            <p>Hi Radney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have tried 6 different browsers on 3 different devices, 2 different MS insider accounts. Same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have narrowed this issue down to only 1 thing: Edge browser did attempt to download same file over and over, I think that it got into an endless download request loop. Not sure if this was caused by Edge itself or if the site code is the cause
 (as I have also experienced endless login attempt loops using multiple browsers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think has happened now, is that my IP got blocked from the download server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But HOW can I solve this? Is this something that will go away automatically with time?</p>

            <p>NO I am NOT going to go there again. No-one could help me from that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been chatting with every possible help desk from Microsoft there is, and they all seem to wanna redirect me somewhere else. They all say that there I will get my answers and the problem solved. Most of them did not even understand the question/problem,
 but wanted to get remote access to my computer or offer me Windows 10 Home, or any other things that does not make sense at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So who can actually check server logs and fix the problem? Someone here or someone, somewhere, else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that everybody just want to redirect me somewhere else, and nobody really knows who can help. It's a waste of my time, a waste of your time, a waste of everybody's time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is so simple: My IP got blocked because of a glitch in either the server, server code, or by my browser (MS Edge). Either way I just want to get rid of the IP BAN and happily download current and next released Insider ISO-files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also confirm that the BAN is IP-based not account based, because I tested this using my LTE network, and no issues what so ever. BUT I am NOT going to use slow LTE for downloading 20-40GB of data every now and then. I need this issue fixed, so I can
 continue being a Windows Insider and test stuff in a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How hard can this be? I have been patient for a long time and I am starting to get frustrated now...</p>
<p>
