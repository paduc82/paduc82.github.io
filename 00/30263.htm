<p>nah. its happened to me and i have 18+ Mbps. i'm also getting very tired of people who host and manipulate their networks so that if a game is voted in that they dont like they can cause a map fail event to occur and cause a new map vote to happen. this
 happened twice in a row IN THE SAME BLOODY LOBBY less than 30 seconds apart. what gives? and how can you stop yourself from winding up on those lobbies again? i dont want to see these dillholes again...sigh</p>

<p>Your connection speed isn't going to change whether most network issues affect you or not.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Dropping out continuously due to a dodgy router could be his problem, for example, and it doesn't matter what his connection is at that point.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You can't stop yourself from playing with people you don't want to. You could try submit a negative review but that's all you can do.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, the map failure may or may not be Host-related, I personally doubt it is. Some minor kind of manipulation, probably.</p>

<h2>            my account was temporarily blocked for no reason in December and i still cant access it</h2>
                    ok so in December my old account was temp blocked for no reason when all I did was play call of duty with my uncle and friends. 2 days later is when it happened. i have tried contacting support many times and they always say that they cant discuss why
 it was blocked or when it will be unblocked. One person i talked to sent me here and the rest ignore me and close my support requests without replying. I do not understand why I get blocked almost 3 years of of being a good sport. I don't swear when people
 kill me and when they start trash talking i mute the. still had almost 4 months of gold left, which will not be refunded. The main reason I have my account is to play with friends and family who i do not get to see because we are in different states and it
 provides us a way to still play things together. Can someone please help me. PS it is my whole microsoft account that is blocked not just on xbox.

    <title>copying to new drive error says not legitimate copy of windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            copying to new drive error says not legitimate copy of windows 7</h2>
                    <p>mahcine is standard issue mid range HP computer about 4-5 yrs old.</p>
<p>bought a new 1tb drive and used ghost to copy my existing legit and registered software to the new drive.&nbsp; Ghost says that transfer was completed successfully</p>
<p>fired up the new drive, removing the old one.&nbsp; startup proceded, but ended with a blue screen and notation in lower right hand corner of screen saying the win 7 was not a legit copy.</p>
<p>Back history:&nbsp; only changes since upgrade to win 7 were the periodic updates and service packs.&nbsp; Only intervening hardware change was upgrade to a new, faster video board.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Win 7 installation was early in product cycle - won't reinstall over current moved copy because too many installed files are later than the ones on the CD.</p>
<p>How do I overcome this problem.</p>
<p>Another problem, I bought 3 win&nbsp; 7 upgrades for my computers.&nbsp; all installed correctly and have been upgraded.&nbsp;by a process of elmination, I'm not sure which of two sets go to the target machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Dave Aberson</p>

            Disk copying (aka cloning) usually works well.&nbsp; It has been awhile since I last used Ghost (I now use Acronis True Image.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The Genuine "validation" of Windows 7 requires a working Internet connection, during the boot process.&nbsp; My "valid" Windows 7 Ultimate was not legitimate for a few hours when my Internet connection was not working.&nbsp; As soon as my Internet access came back,&nbsp;
 my Windows 7 was then returned to "legitimate" status.<br />

I have got 2 of the same messages form different accounts.

Xbox please reply or sort this out because me and my friends can see what's happening but not little kids cant se what's happening&nbsp;so Xbox please sort this out. 2 of the accounts that sent me the messages where TepidCastle6058 &nbsp;VadoseClock6953 .

            Hi! Chris, if you are referring to drag and drop on the desktop. I think you just need to right click anywhere on the desktop, hover on View and uncheck "Auto-arrange icons". Please let us know if that's not the issue.<br />

</p><p>I had to delete my second response, thought it might be irrelevant. Anyhow, I think we'll need to reset all the file permission on all files. It can also be a problem with Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st Method</p>
<p>- use the system file checker to check for any system inconsistency</p>
<p>- open cmd and run as administrator</p>
<p>- type in : sfc /scannow</p>
<p>- if it can't find any corruptions proceed to 2nd method</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Method</p>
<p>- reset all the file permission</p>
<p>- open cmd and run as administrator</p>
<p>- type in : icacls * /T /Q /C /RESET</p>
<p>- if issue is still not fixed, proceed to 3rd method</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd Method</p>
<p>- use an anti-virus to see if there's anything that corrupts the Windows Explorer</p>
<p>- download the Hitman Pro scanner from http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro</p>
<p>- activate the software using a 30 days trial</p>
<p>- scan the PC for some viruses, if viruses are found, clean and reboot and see if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works.</p>

<p>Hello ChrisW-uk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. When you stated that you completed a full reset on the console, did you mean a<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> full factory reset</a>?
 This is the type of factory reset that removes all games, profiles and downloaded applications. Is the Xbox One enrolled in the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider program</a>? The Xbox Insider program has been known to cause issues with the console. This is due to the Xbox Insider users utilizing the alpha and beta versions of the new operating system software. If your console is enrolled in the Xbox Insider
 program, we suggest submitting feedback through the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox Insider Hub application

<h2>            Bitlocker password is ruining my life&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Need urgent help! I never saved this Bitlocker recovery key, and can't access Windows because of it. Tried all the commands on manage bde, trying to unlock the computer, all unsuccessful. Autounlock (recovery key) is not enabled. How can I find this key.
 Would calling Microsoft help? It'll be my first ever call to MS. I don't want to re-image the drive, because I still need the files! Help me! I am desperate! Frustrated too! The computer says when calling microsoft tell them the error "critical_process_died".
 What number to call? Any idea how to recover this key? Thank you so much!</p>

No, unless you try ctrl+Alt+Del and hold down the keys, or press and hold any Laptop pwr btn which generally forces a close (Not advisable unless the normal shut down doesnt work)

                    <p>I recently had a problem with Xbox One giving me an error code that prevented me from chatting in game or in party chat. &nbsp;I looked all over the web for advice and found little help. &nbsp;I stubbled across what fixed it for me and I hope this serves others well. &nbsp;After checking pretty much everything, I tested the multiplayer from the network settings. &nbsp;It said it had a problem with the "Teredo IP". &nbsp;I have an Apple AirPort Extreme but I'm sure this may be of help to others of other router makes. &nbsp;I found in the router settings a box to enable "Teredo tunnel". &nbsp;Thats it!!! Updated the router settings and everything is fine. &nbsp;Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Media Player Says my blank CDR is &#39;filled&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a newish laptop (Sony Vaio) running on Win 7 64Bit, Until; today, I have decided to burn a music disc. I used a new pack of Verbatims (I usually use this type) and the WMP said that the disc is 'filled' so I cannot burn?! I click on 'my computer'
 and thats fine, it says 'Blank disc' etc. But WMP doesnt like it for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded Itunes and my laptop burns fine, but I prefer WMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody shed some light?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>What is the type of CD are you using when trying to burn? It is a writeable CD?<strong>CD-RW</strong>&nbsp;or
<em>CD-R?<br />
<br />
</em>I suggest you use the following Automatic FixIT from Microsoft that might be able to fix your Burn issue.</p>
<p><strong>Your CD or DVD drive cannot read or write media<br />

    <title>Old password no longer valid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suehuggett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old password no longer valid</h2>
                    I was suddenly asked on all three devices on which I have skype account to sign in. When I tried to do so I got the message "old password will no longer work" try hotmail/microsoft password. This did not work. Trying to reset password only reset my hotmail
 password which I had no desire to do. All the recovery options seem to be the phone and email adresses of a friend on whose computer I signed into skype once some time ago. He no longer has skype on his computer. I cannot get back into my old account and thus
 my old contact list and credit of some £10. Any suggestions?

<h3> marchoppe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Update Stuck on &#34;Searching for Updates&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a used computer with Windows 7 Professional installed. The company I purchased it from did not have the computer running and connected to the internet since November of 2015 so a little over four and a half months. When I try to search for
 updates now it just sticks on "Searching for Updates" for as long as an hour and a half without finding anything. I shut it down after that time period not knowing how long it would be stuck in that search as I don't want to over tax the system.&nbsp; I have Automatic
 updates selected but the system will not look for updates until I start manually.&nbsp; It shows the last check for updates was 11-06-15.&nbsp; Is this normal and how long should I wait before I give up on the system to find updates ? In the end I really want to update
 this computer to Windows 10 Pro if possible. But when I click on the Windows 10 Update Icon on the taskbar the window will open up for about three seconds and then close. Nothing happens and I have read that this might be because Win 7 is not up to date.&nbsp;
 Will I be allowed to update this computer to Windows 10 Processional and if so can I do it without first updating Windows 7 ? Thank you for any help!&nbsp; This forum has helped me in the past on other systems and I'm very grateful for the assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Since this is the first question anyone will ask I should have added that I do have Internet access and it is functioning perfectly. Oh and I did a search but found conflicting and somewhat confusing results so I thought I would ask the question again
 and see if there are any fresh answers. </p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The System Update Readiness Tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located at the following location:
<br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log <br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The system root is normally

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select
 View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before
 "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do not use Search to find the files. Open Windows Explorer (keyboard shortcut Win+E), locate and expand the file path (item

            <p>KB947821 v34 x64 Running for 10 minutes "Searching for updates on this computer". The hard drive indicator light is only blinking intermittently so I don't know if it's actually searching for anything. I'll let it run for a few more minutes to see if anything
 happens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: It's been running for about 45 minutes still no change.&nbsp; I'm going to shut it down now, CPU is running at 50%.&nbsp; It did not create either of the CheckSur logs in Windows/Logs/CBS however there are CBSpersist cab files, the latest of which was dated
 yesterday 03-18-16. The CBS text document is dated today. According to the Task Manager there was no network activity or hard disk activity when
<span><span>the System Update Readiness Tool was running, only CPU usage. It's like something is stopping it from even trying to find or install Updates. The "Get Windows 10" icon does the same thing. It will open a window for a couple of seconds with the message
 "Please Wait" then the window closes. Nothing happens. &nbsp;</span></span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I bought two computers from this company and neither will update.&nbsp; I seem to think that's not a coincidence so either their I.T. person has done something to mess with updates or perhaps it's because they were both disconnected from the internet for so
 long. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I've discovered that it's "wuauserv" that's causing the CPU load. Stopping it brings the load down. So it's like the update service is trying to work but is stuck in a loop or something. After Googling the issue I'm trying some of the suggestions
 I found on the second computer to see if they work.&nbsp; I'm more concerned about the first one as it has better specs and I'd like to use that as my new Internet machine.&nbsp;

            <p>If searching for updates hang on a current install,</p>
<p>Make sure and go to Uninstall a program and see which Microsoft Net framework you have installed,</p>
<p>4.5.2 is the most consistent to have installed,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Switch your windows update setting to Never check for updates temporarily</p>
<p>Restart the machine</p>
<p>You can try and install the newest update client manually leave your update settings at Never check for updates until you install this,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then download this to your downloads folder to run it from there,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Download the x86 for 32 bit system or x64 for a 64 bit system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install it and restart when prompted too after it does a stand alone search for updates which shouldn't</p>
<p>take too long it took all of 5 seconds "If" the windows update settings are switched to Never check for</p>
<p>updates before running it from the downloads folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it installs and restarts</p>
<p>You can reset your updates setting to whatever you had prior = Default....</p>
<p>Then manually check for updates.</p>

</p><p>You'll have to do a search as I don't remember in which thread I found the answer.&nbsp; It involved running a simple batch file and then running an "update readiness tool" from Microsoft. I don't remember the KB number......303 something. Anyway the whole process
 took about five hours as it found about 150 updates since the computer had been disconnected for so long. So it was simply run the batch file, run the readiness tool and then sit back and wait.........check every hour or so to see if the updates are downloaded
 and ready to install.&nbsp; This worked perfectly on two different systems and the best part was I didn't have to run a boat load of diagnostic tools and post reams of information about my system only to never receive any actual help.</p>
<p>

            <p>If XP is still functional try a product key finder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some utilities, all of which will display your product keys: </p>
<p><br />
Belarc Advisor: <a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a><br />
(It does a good job of providing a wealth of information. <br />
However may not detect an Office key, so try one of the other two listed below)</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
Paid (Free demo available): Recover Keys: <a href="http://recover-keys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://recover-keys.com/</a><br />
"quickly analyzes your system for over 3000+ software programs<br />
and produces a list of software activation keys"</p>
<p><br />
13 keyfinder programs:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Also check the side of your PC case or bottom of the laptop for the <br />
OEM key code. If there is a sticker with the code it will most likely not <br />
match what is displayed by the utilities mentioned above as OEMs such as<br />
Dell use an internal key code when they build your PC. </p>
<p><br />
The key code on the sticker is for use with your Windows CD <br />
(that hopefully came with your PC) if you ever need to reinstall Windows.</p>
