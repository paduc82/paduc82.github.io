<h3> sm_3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Sent Mail folder for IMAP icloud account using 2 folders for sent mail</h2>
                    <p>My IMAP icloud mail account for my apple devices (iPhone, iPad &amp; Mac) email use the "SENT Messages" folder that appears in Outlook 2016 (windows 10) but my Outlook 2016 uses another folder called "Sent Items" (that is the default used for exchange mail accounts)
 to send email for the icloud IMAP account. </p>
<p>My apple devices correctly show the "Sent Items" folder created by Outlook (with all the emails in sync) but do NOT use this to send emails, instead they use the icloud default "SEND Messages" folder.</p>
<p>Although my INBOX IMAP mail from icloud works the same across both apple and windows/outlook email clients (i.e. only one inbox), for the Sent mail I end up with 2 sent mail folders for the icloud IMAP mail account - one used by apple devices and the other
 used by outlook (windows 10) that contain different sent messages depending which device(s) they are sent from. Hope that is not confusing...</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to configure Outlook so it uses the icloud&nbsp;"SENT Messages" (instead of creating an additional "sent items folder) to have just one folder across both apple mail and windows/outlook?</p>

<p>Hi SM_3,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my research, I found that folders provided in an IMAP mail account are specific to that mail server, and not controlled by Outlook. However, you can<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-email-messages-by-using-rules-c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 create an inbox rule</a> to move a copy to the sent messages folder after you send the message. And if you only use Outlook in the future, you can move the emails from the sent messages folder to the sent items folder and then delete the sent messages folder.
 If you want to use both iCloud mail and Outlook, you may keep the two folders. But you can’t replace the sent items folder with the sent messages folder in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            "Multiple Accounts" was the needed info. I fixed this when I realized the person with the error has two Brightree logins (in correcting a misspelling they just added another account for her) and I was using the "other" one in the link I provided for her.
 I simply switched the login id to the one she uses and voilá.

    <title>CK-200 Nice one Nokia&#33; Reviewed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sillygoose0  say:</h3>
<h2>            CK-200 Nice one Nokia&#33;   Reviewed.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new car and my employer put in a bluetooth car phone kit from another manufacturer (CK-3100) I wasn't impressed with it from the start, it was clunky to operate and felt poorly made. Worst of all is it just wouldn't work with my phone properly
 - a Windows Mobile V6.1 based device, specifically in-call volume was pitifully low, it was unusable! An engineer was sent with a new unit but that was no better, proving it was an incompatibility issue. I contacted the manufacturer who told me that as my
 phone was launched 2 years ago they were not interested in fixing the issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had enough! so started looking around, the Nokia CK-200 looked good, although its so new there is very little information or reviews around for it. I posted some question here but got no answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took a gamble and bought one, its not very expensive at all (about the same price as the CK-3100) having watched carefully how the engineer took my car apart I fitted the CK-200 myself, it was easy in my Honda as a SOT ISO adaptor lead had been fitted
 for the other kit. The SOT cable adapted the Honda's own connections to ISO connections.&nbsp;I had ordered the ISO version of the CK-200 with the CA-160 ISO cable. It all just plugged together! &nbsp;Mounted the display up on the centre console, tie-wrapped everything
 secure (behind the heating control panel in my case) fixed the wireless remote with strong double sided tape to a flat area and.... powered up. It worked. I paired my phone, called my voicemail&nbsp;and was DELIGHTED to hear it BOOMING out loud and clear!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using it for a week now, I recently updated the software but have not had a chance to see how much difference that will make. But straight away its been a pleasure to use, the remote control feels good, the software is responsive and intuitive,
 it just gets on with its job! have no problem hearing the caller at high speed and everyone can hear me fine using the microphone in the display. It looks fantastic too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any issues? well the weak spot of the kit is I would say the display mount could be improved, its a bit fragile looking, you wouldn't want to keep unplugging the display from it. I installed it by removing the sticky pad and sliding the plate in-between
 two bits of trim.</p>
<p>The display connector fits to the mount via a small plastic ball joint which is quite sloppy, the display can flop about even under braking! I have found a solution to this of stretching a small bit of plastic bag over the ball before fitting it in its socket,
 tightens it up really well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its brilliant how you can take the display to your PC and update it via usb (needs a CA-101A usb cable very cheap), the CK-3100 you had to take the PC to the car and do it over bluetooth..my employer locks out bluetooth on our laptops for security so its
 not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other thing for my wish list would be the ability to get contacts from the SIM, I keep my contacts in the SIM instead of the phone so I can switch easily if the phone fails. The CK-3100 managed to retrieve my contacts from SIM but the CK-200 can only retrieve
 from the phone contacts memory.</p>
<p>I have a work around for this, and as I don't add contacts very often its not a big issue! I 'select all' and copy all my SIM contacts to Phone, sync. with the CK-200, then take the SIM out my phone, clear the contacts and then put the SIM back in.</p>
<p>Since updating the memory I now have 'spoken menus' but I tend to have the volume up high for calls, but then the spoken menus are VERY loud! it would be nice if it had separate volume settings for spoken menus and calls. I have switched them off for now.</p>
<p>The ring tone is not very loud and there are no settings to make any choice of tones, it does mute the car radio though so you won't miss the call.</p>
<p>Finally as I found last night, obviously the remote is run from a little battery so cannot be illuminated, you need to practice finding it in the car at night! although once you find it, it is easy to use just by touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion I am delighted with the CK-200, although my phone is not on the tested list, it does meet the bluetooth specification required and works completely! This has saved me having to change my phone, all the expensive software I have put on it, the
 accessories etc etc. The electronics module is small and amazing how much power comes out of such a little thing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was getting sad with the other kit as I missed not being able to keep in touch with my colleagues, now its good to be able to have a conversation again. I shall be putting the other kit on an auction site shortly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For about the same price this product make the other one I had a redundant product now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very last thing, I found the installation instructions a bit confusing at one point, there is a diagram of the CA-160 cable module, it shows the cables to the CK-200 box coming out the same side as the cables to the car radio, I found it was actually
 the other way around, the cables to the CK-200 box come out the CA-160 module on the same side as the cables that connect to the car speakers, perhaps Nokia may want to check this. I worked it out after a while.</p>

<p>Nice Review!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a quicker way to add contacts from the SIM card to the kit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply select the contact and then manually send it to the CK-200 via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CK-200 will then save it automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also select multiple contacts, or the entire phonebook and send it manually.</p>

<p>Thank you, its important people get to know about this product more, 100's of company cars must have phones installed every week. Windows based phones can be a bit problematic for volume issues over blue-tooth, the web is full of threads of peoples attempts
 to boost it in software, they rarely make any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installers should be aware that if their customers are using such phones that the CK-200 may be a 'safer bet' than many others to install, as well as being fantastic anyway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try sending contacts as suggested above but&nbsp;I am not sure my phone has that option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just tried calling my own answer phone so I could hear how I come over to others, got home and listened to the recording marvellous!! loud and clear from the microphone in the display speaking with a normal voice.</p>

<p>There is another software update planed for the CK-200 which will allow the user to switch the contacts display so it is sorted by first name / last name, also the possibility to send DTMF tones using the remote for voicemail and call centres etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once it is available, I will post on this forum.</p>

<p>Thank you for that . I currently have V2.0 installed. I can't see the DSP settings in the installer menu, I can see the microphone selection choice so definitely in the right place, has this setting been removed now?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Confiture,</p>
<p>Did you find any more information on the software change? any news on future enhancements in software? as the CK-200 is incredibly easy to update I hope Nokia plans to continue enhancing the features?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rob</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS the CK-200 is on sale lots of places here in the UK at amazing prices for Christmas, it should give the competition a headache!</p>

<p>Recently upgraded from the Nokia CARK-91/6310i to the Nokia CK-200/E71 combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let me say that the first couple of days of use have been a great experience!
<strong>Simple installation </strong>(instructions could be improved slightly with better images/picture though),
<strong>Good sound quality </strong>and <strong>lots of great functionality</strong>. Much, much better than the CK-7W I threw out a couple of years ago after four days of use :-( &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I used the&nbsp;Nokia Car Kit Software Updater to <strong>upgrade from V2.0 to V2.1</strong>. The thing I noticed straight away was the icon in standby mode when&nbsp;the&nbsp;CK-200 is downloading, but cannot find a l<strong>ist of all changes</strong>
<strong>in this version</strong> anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found out that <strong>upgrading erases all paired phones and other personal settings</strong> including custom display settings, contacts etc.&nbsp;Would it be possible to add the
<strong>possiblity of a backup</strong> before upgrading in a future version (like the Nokia Software Updater for mobile phones)?</p>

<p>Thanks for the post. Just updated too. There doesn't seem to be any system for being notified there is an update other than seeing it here or running the updater and seeing if it fetches a newer version. There are also no release notes published with what
 changes are made... strange!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I cannot see any changes from 2.0 to 2.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried pairing my wife's phone with it too, its an LG, seem fine and switches between them easily.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update above included some improvement in the contacts download on certain phones and also some improvements in audio settings for better call clarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mostly though this was fixing some small bugs which were only visible in a small number of cases. I will try to get a definitive list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version 3 is due for release in February. I will also get some more information on what improvements are included.</p>

<h2>            Email reading pane not stretching to the edge of the screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have bought a Dell Experion laptop and installed Office 365 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>I find it strange that in Outlook, I click on View/Layout/Reading pane and select "Right", then there is a blank space on the right handside of my screen. I would much prefer that my reading pane went to the far right of the screen, but I can't stretch the
 reading pane window any further. The same issue emains if I select "bottom" or "off" for the lay out of the reading pane.</p>
<p>The blank space seems to be where I had the ad displays in the free version.</p>
<p>Is there a way of getting rd of the space to make the pane wider?</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>
<p />

            Hi KHrult
<br />Have you tried to do a repair on your office? 
<br />Close all Office applications
<br />Click on the Windows key on keyboard and i this will open up settings 
<br />Click on Apps
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office Click on it 
<br />Click Modify. You'll get a pop up
<br />Select Quick Repair. 
<br />Once the repair is done I would restart my system. 
<br />When it comes back up open outlook and see if it is still showing the blank space on the Side. 
<br />If it doesn't work then try the online repair. 
<br />Hope this helps let me know please. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

    <title>Lumia 950 XL Glance screen stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dcjoshua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL Glance screen stops working</h2>
                    <div>On my Lumia 950 XL, the Glance screen just quit working after a couple days.&nbsp; No idea why.&nbsp;
</div>

<div>Because of another problem (no email images showing up in Outlook) I had to do a hard reset and restore from backup.&nbsp; That fixed my email images, and the Glance screen also came back.&nbsp; (The restore was not perfect, by the way.&nbsp; It couldn't get past 93%.&nbsp;
 I guess I should at least be grateful that the restore process has a monitor that detects when it is not making any progress and gives you a popup option to stop trying.)</div>

<div>Last night the Glance screen stopped working again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried power cycling, and a soft reset.&nbsp; Still no Glance screen.&nbsp; (All black, nothing shows up at all.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought maybe there is a battery threshold and it will start working again after it charges
 back up.&nbsp; But this morning, it is still not working.</div>

<div>Yes, I have Glance screen set to Always on.&nbsp; </div>

<div>No, I am absolutely not going to do another Hard Reset to fix this issue.</div>

<div>I was so upset that I had to wait from October 6 to November 25 to get this device.&nbsp; (I had been suffering along with a Lumia 928 on Verizon since May 2013.)&nbsp; I guess Microsoft still rushed it.&nbsp; Iris scanner is cool though...<br />

            I solved the issue with my Glance screen, along with two other problems!&nbsp; I was also having trouble with the screen going black as soon as I started a phone call.&nbsp; (Workaround for that, by the way, is double click your Power button.)&nbsp; And notifications
 from apps or text messages were not waking the screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
None of it is was software or phone hardware related.&nbsp; When I thought the problem went away after the hard reset and then came back a couple days later, it must have been coincidence with some other settings I was playing with before the hard reset (and possibly
 faulty memory :)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I figured out through some WindowsCentral forum discussions that these problems could be related to the proximity sensor, and can be caused by tempered glass screen protectors that cover the proximity sensor.&nbsp; My screen protector arrived several days after
 my phone (and right after that hard reset) and that was when the Glance screen problems started for real.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
My original tempered glass screen protector only had cutouts for the speaker and for the IR camera (Iris scanner).&nbsp; I gave it a one star rating on Amazon and returned it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I bought a different one with a cutout along the top right from the speaker all the way to the edge.&nbsp; So none of the sensors or even the selfie camera are covered by the protector glass.&nbsp; It also has a cutout for the red light that comes on during Iris scanning.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once I switched to the new new tempered glass screen protector with the full cutout, all three problems were solved.&nbsp; Glance screen works, phone doesn't go black during calls (except when I actually hold the phone up to my ear), and notifications can wake the
 screen.&nbsp; YAY!<br />

<p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not recommended to sign with two different Office 365 accounts in one browser at the same time. When we sign in to Office 365 and access to Office 365 web apps such as Mail App, a session is established between your browser and the Office 365 web app
 you’re using. It will let the resources we requested confused and don't know which the account you need to use to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to do that, I suggest you sign in to Office with your one account in a normal window and sign with the other account in a

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern. Let me help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What&nbsp;devices are connected to the computer when you hear the disconnection tone?</li><li>Do you have an external mouse connected? </li><li>Is this a Laptop or a Desktop?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a Laptop, I suggest you to disconnect the external mouse (if any) and use the mouse pad to check the status. If you do not hear the tone, then the issue lies with the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could arise with other devices too. As a workaround, you can disconnect all the external devices and check the frequency of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep us posted with the results, so that we can help you further.</p>
<p>

            <p>1. Not that many devices: wireless mouse and wireless keyboard, 2 USB (both with at least some USB3 ports)hubs, one of which has a gigabit ethernet (not connected) built in, a WIFI adaptor (USB3, currently with the radio off), a printer (Canon MP830), and

            Nothing is wrong that I can tell, I just want to know what's going on and why, so asking which devices I have, etc. is a waste of time. &nbsp;This is really a simple question - is there a log of device connects and disconnects. If there isn't there should be.

            I think your suggestion is a good idea. &nbsp;I feel it should be placed in notifications, which device connected or disconnected, with a timestamp if possible. &nbsp;I hope you put your suggestion in the feedback app.

            I am having the same issue. I will randomly hear the sound that something was plugged into the computer but I have not plugged anything in. I mean it happens at random times and always confuses me as to something might be wrong. I have never had this issue
 running windows 7

                    Hello all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently my office has been using One Note as a knowledge base, and there are a few things we would like to know how to do if possible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First, we would like to be able to see what pages employees are referencing most frequently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Second, we would like to be able to search by author, to get an idea of how much each user is contributing to the Notebook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If Either of these are possible I'd love to know how.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Adam</div>

    <title>&#39;record changed by another user&#39; - split form error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff_lewis_sg  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;record changed by another user&#39; - split form error</h2>
                    <p>Designed in Windows XP Office 2007, running on Windows 7 Office 2010</p>
<p>I have a classic split form with records that show tasks to be done - quotes, call backs, etc.&nbsp; When a new entry is created the time and date is dropped into a field and then a table is searched to see how long is allowed for the delegate to respond to this
 particular type of task&nbsp;- 2 hours for a quote, 24 hours for a specially sourced product etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so good.&nbsp; At various points along the way&nbsp;a 'time lapsed' field is updated that shows the operator how much time has already expired since the enquiry was
 received.&nbsp; Three quarters of the way through the allowed time, the lapsed time field turns yellow and finally, at 'time up', it turns red.&nbsp; All this works fine.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;all too often, when a record is modified, be it the notes or whatever, on clicking the save button or clicking into the next record, I get the 'this record has already been editted by another user' (or whatever it is)&nbsp;with the option to save, copy
 to clipboard or cancel.&nbsp; Clicking save is actually fine but this shouldn't happen!&nbsp; The other time it happens (sometimes!) is when you click the tick box to say that the job has been completed.&nbsp; This has an 'on update' event that drops the time and date into
 the 'completed time' field and updates the time lapsed field one last time.&nbsp; Conversely, if you fill the finish time in (by clikcing a little button beside the field) the system also ticks the done box.&nbsp; Then, on clicking save, the dreaded may, or may not,
 happen.</p>
<p>Clicking Save is meant to do various things such as update all the time lapse fields, check for incomplete data etc, but I have stripped it back to a plain docmd.save ac form... command and the result is the same.</p>
<p>I thought, perhaps that manually editing the 'Done' tick box and then programmically filling in the time and date made the system think that it had been edited from 2 directions&nbsp;but various experiments prove this not to be the case.</p>
<p>I haven't yet, even after some hours of playing around with it, managed to establish any pattern in its behaviour.&nbsp; Maybe I have a rogue property that I haven't changed or maybe I'm doing something fundementally wrong - please enlighten me!&nbsp; I don't use
 split forms very much as I am not particularly fond of them but I have never had such a persistant problem with this error before.</p>

            Could you please post the code you are using for these various events?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do operations on a form by referencing form controls via "Me" (e.g., &nbsp;Me.SomeField = SomeValue)&nbsp;and also update that record via DAO (e.g., CurrentDb.Execute "Update MyTable
 SET SomeField = 'foo' WHERE MyTable.ID = " &amp; Me.ID), then you can expect a write conflict of this nature.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Outlook 365 from permanently deleting emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently "upgraded" from Office 2013 to Office 365.&nbsp; With Outlook 2013, when I read an email, I'd delete it, it would go into my Deleted folder, then I'd move the emails in my Deleted folder into a historical PST for safekeeping every two months, and start
 with an empty Deleted folder.&nbsp; This way, my read emails would be kept forever, which is required by compliance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Outlook 365, this cannot happen.&nbsp; When I delete a read email, it goes into the Trash folder, rather than the Deleted folder.&nbsp; Then, the application on its own deletes emails more than a week old from the Trash folder.&nbsp; I am not permitted to permanently
 delete emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I stop Outlook 365 from permanently deleting emails?<br />

</p><p>Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
Outlook can't delete email on its own. It's deleted from the server.<br />
<br />
It has nothing related to Outlook. The only folder Outlook has for deleted items is Deleted Items. It has no folder named Trash. Those folder names are coming from the IMAP server side, not from Outlook.<br />
<br />
You need to assign the correct folders on the mail server. To do this, you must log on to the web based interface provided by the ISP hosting your IMAP mailbox.<br />
<br />
Follow the suggestions in that link -<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> https://www.msoutlook.info/question/736</a><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this may help!</p>

<p><span>Hi Mike Row Soft</span><span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d like to confirm with you that if your Office 365 subscription is O365 for business
<strong>E3</strong> and O365 for business <strong>E5</strong>. If so, you can try to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn743673(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enable the litigation hold</a> for the mailbox under the O365 for business account to prevent the email from being deleted from O365 server. And you can find the deleted items back by
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/run-a-content-search-in-the-office-365-security-compliance-center-61852fd9-fe8a-4880-a339-cb19ed3bff4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
running a content search in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center</a>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If not, your mailbox provider supports web app, you can sign into web app to check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>Lisa - your explanation needs a few more details. How did you export to the Microsoft Store? Why would you "copied the autocomplete" or did you just copy the .dat file from the backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook AutoComplete or nickname cache is not shared with OWA.&nbsp; OWA maintains its own AutoComplete list. Also, Outlook 2010, 2013 and 2016 store the AutoComplete list in a hidden message store that is a .data file - they do not use the .nk2 file.&nbsp; Nirsoft's
 NK2edit has command level features to export to the Message Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recommend using Microsoft's article:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2199226</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Hide rows with no data in specific columns</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a callcenter as team coach. Every week we get an export from our customer with the stats of our agents from the previous week. I'm trying to make my work as easy as possible and let Excel do most of the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem at this moment is that if an agent is on leave/holiday specific columns will remain empty. In this case columns 'C' to 'N'. When these columns in a specific row are empty I want to hide the complete row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it's important to know the cells will appear empty, but actually they will contain a formula (mostly VLOOKUP's). If no result is returned by this formula the cell will appear empty. And second, column 'B' will never be empty as it contains the agent's
 name. Since I'm not that familiar with macros I'm kind of stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone who can help me?</p>
<p>If it's not to much trouble, can you also give a short explanation about what the different sections of the formuly do? This way I maybe can adapt this formula when I need it in other files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance guys!</p>

<h2>            Public Folder conversations not threading between Outlook and Entourage</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We recently upgraded a customer to Exchange 2010 from Exchange 2003.&nbsp; Windows PCs are running a combination of Outlook 2007 and 2010.&nbsp; Some of the Mac clients were running Entourage 2004.&nbsp; We initially upgraded those to Outlook 2011 for Mac, but found that
 the "Post" and "Post Reply" buttons had been removed from the Public Folders view.&nbsp; This was a deal breaker, so we ended up downgrading those clients to Entourage 2008 Web Services Edition.</p>
<p>We've uncovered a problem with using the "Conversation" view between Entourage and Outlook.&nbsp; Here's how to replicate it:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook, create a new post in a public folder using Subject "Title 1". </li><li>In Entourage, post a reply, but change the Subject line to "Title 2". </li><li>The reply will show up in Entourage under the same conversation.&nbsp; In Outlook, it will show up as a new conversation under "Title 2".
</li><li>If you reply to "Title 2" from Outlook and change the Subject to "Title 3", it will show as a new reply under that conversation.&nbsp; In Entourage, it will appear as yet another conversation under "Title 3".
</li></ol>
<p>If you keep the Subject lines unchanged, they will thread properly on both clients.&nbsp; The customer uses changes to the subject line to track the "status" of the conversation (in progress, proof, ready, completed, etc) without having to click on each message.&nbsp;
 They can just scan the contents of the folders without clicking anything.</p>
<p>Is there anything that can be done to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <div>I would imagine the issue is caused by how Outlook for Windows and </div>
<div>Entourage EWS for Mac are handling "conversations". For Exchange </div>
<div>environments messages can be threaded by conversation ID, which is a </div>
<div>unique identifier assigned to a group of messages. This purpose of this </div>
<div>identifier is to do what you're wanting, which is to thread messages </div>
<div>from the same conversation together even if the subject changes. I'm not </div>
<div>sure if conversations support was ever included in posts. It should be </div>
<div>there for mail messages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't recall Entourage 2004 having support for conversations, though, </div>
<div>so I'm surprised this was working for you there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Public folders support was de-emphasized in Exchange 2007, which means </div>
<div>at some point this feature is going away. Development has ceased beyond </div>
<div>just maintenance support. I urge you to consider implementing SharePoint </div>
<div>in your environment. This is Microsoft's suggested path away from public </div>
<div>folders.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'm afraid that if post conversation threading isn't working for you now </div>
<div>then it probably will never work. At minimum be sure you've applied the </div>
<div>latest updates to both versions of Office just in case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            Unfortunately, in Word 2007 and 2010, page breaks are displayed (even in Draft view) only if you have nonprinting characters displayed (Ctrl+Shift+8). Also, the line is short; it does not extend all the way across the page.

            <p>Hi Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you happen to have Norton AV installed. There is a known bug in this: NIS starts a scan when the system is Idle which causes a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, try to do without any 3rd-party AV while in the Fast Ring. This is combining 'Test-environment' with 'Production-environment'. This is not something that Norton itself can do anything about, they get the bits as fast as you get them and need
 time to update their product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<h2>            Nokia X6 No Network Signal problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start with am hard core fan of Nokia products. With the same madness i bought
<strong>X6</strong> when it is launched first in India. Used for about 9 months with some intermittent touch screen issues and finally one day i found that
<strong>no network signal</strong> which eventually became a permanent problem.</p>
<p>I had given it to the nearest Nokia service centre in Bangalore ofr fixing it and they were not able to rectify the problem after having the mobile with them for more than 2 weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried using my sim in other mobiles which works but when i try it with my X6 it doesnt work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I request the folks here to help me out in fixing the problem.</p>

<p>2- Format your device through dialing *#7370#. A lock code may be required (12345 for all phones unless you change it), but you may need to back up your data first before performing this step as formatting the device may cause deleting your data.<br />
<br />
To backup your data, kindly follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
A. Connect your device with your PC using the "USB" cable and open Nokia Suite.<br />
B. Click "Tools" then "Back Up".<br />
C. Choose a folder on your PC to store the "Back Up" file in it and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the same procedure of back up you can easily restore all your data after software update, but instead of clicking on back up, just click on restore.<br />
<br />
<br />
3- Make sure that you have latest software installed on your device. Kindly refer to steps below:<br />
<br />
A. On your PC, open Nokia suite and connect your phone<br />
B. In Nokia suite, select Tools &gt; Software updates.<br />
C. From the list of available updates, choose what you’d like to install.</p>

<h2>            Kindle App crashes on loading</h2>
                    <p>Nokia Lumina 900 &amp; Amazon kindle App</p>
<p>My kindle app recently started crashing on load.&nbsp; Worked for 8 months previously.&nbsp; Reinstalled several times and each time it only works for 1 instance.&nbsp; After getting the app set up, downloading 1 or more of my books, reading for a bit and closing the app
 it always crashes, get the startup screen and then it closes.&nbsp; I've also reset my phone to factory defaults and reinstalled the app; still doesn't work.</p>
<p>Does anybody know of a fix?</p>
<p>Did the Kindle app get an update or change in the last couple of weeks?</p>
<p>Does my phone have a problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You've done just about all of the troubleshooting you can. My next step would be to contact Amazon and see if there is something messed up in your account that keeps getting downloaded and crashing the app.

<p>Indicates the last app update was <span>6/28/2012, but that doesn't mean something wasnt done on the backend. I'd take Ed's suggestion and contact Amazon in some fashion. They may be aware and say so, or you might be clueing them in. The more complaints
 the more response.</span></p>

Excellent. Amazon has pretty good support on all levels, so glad it is moving for you. Keep us posted.

 request with Amazon, waiting for their&nbsp;</p>

            Interestingly, both windows phone 7.5 and 8 appear to be affected, it would also appear to affect new installs&nbsp;(over the past week or so) since my trusty HTC Titan has no problems, I installed the app on that a year ago.

            <p>Same issue with my new Lumia 920. It only fails to start after I've signed in. If I uninstall, reinstall, but don't sign in, I can close and start the app just fine. It's completely useless, but shows that the issue only occurs when it's trying to start
 up and login. I even turned on airplane mode to rule out bad connectivity. Hopefully they'll push a patch soon.</p>

            <p>I've had this problem on my HTC Radar for the past week or so.&nbsp; I've contacted all the help desks at microsoft, Amazon, etc.&nbsp; They just keep sending it "up to the next level."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really DID like my Windows phone (I learned to live with the fact that it didn't have flash player).... I am now nearly certain that I'll be switching to an Android OS next time I'm due for an upgrade.</p>
