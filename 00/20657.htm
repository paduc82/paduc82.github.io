                    Hi,<br />
Can anybody confirm that GetChartElements method not work on a protected chart?<br />
<br />
Is there any way to get the mouse events when the chart is protected?<br />

    <title>Unable to view all sections of notebook at once - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to view all sections of notebook at once</h2>
                    I am using OneNote 2010 on a desktop pc, running on Windows 7.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have several notebooks, all of which contain multiple sections and pages. These are saved to a personal drive on my university server, rather than to the hard drive of the pc I use.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the last week or so, when I open a given notebook, it only opens up some of the sections, instead of opening the whole notebook. Previously, if I clicked on a notebook all sections would open (i.e. all of the section tabs would be visible along the
 top of the window).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am still able to access all of the sections in all of my notebooks. However, when I open up a section that hasn't automatically opened, the sections that were open close down. So it will not allow me to open all sections at the same time. This is obviously
 frustrating as being able to easily navigate between different sections of the notebook and having them visually laid out before you instead of closing and opening multiple files is one of the key advantages of using one note rather than simply saving notes
 in a series of word documents.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help much appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            Halo.<br />
<br />
Do you mean that the space at the top is not enough for displaying all the sections ?<br />
<br />
If yes, then you can see all those section by expanding the notebook-title pane/Navigation Bar (by default it is at the left side of the screen).<br />
If you see that the notebook titles are in vertical position, then click the "&gt;" (Expand Navigation Bar) at the top. It will be in horizontal position. Then, click the "v" (Expand) icon (next to the notebook title) to display all sections within the notebook.<br />
<br />
Does it solve your problem ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
.<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>No - this is not the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know what you mean, and in the past sometimes if there was not enough space to show all sections the final tab would have a drop down where I could choose from the sections it could not display. This is not happening any more, it is simply acting as
 though some sections do not exist.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, for example, I have a notebook called 'Postdoc'. This notebook contains the following sections:</div>
<div>Admin</div>
<div>Conferences</div>
<div>Contacts</div>
<div>Next steps</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>Public Engagement</div>
<div>Reading<br />
Teaching</div>
<div>Training</div>
<div>Writing</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I go into windows explorer and go to the folder where this notebook is saved, all of those sections are listed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if I go into onenote and open up the 'postdoc' notebook, it only displays the 'reading' section (which is the one I was most recently working on before I started having these issues). If I expand the 'postdoc' notebook in the navigation bar as
 you suggest, the only section it lists is the 'reading' section. The other sections do not come up either as tabs along the top or as listed under the name of the notebook in the navigation bar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can still open up the other sections if I go to the 'postdoc' notebook folder in windows explorer, select all of the sections, and right click: open. However, the 'reading' section that was open then disappears (even though I also selected this to open).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also now found that when I try and open all sections from the 'postdoc' notebook via windows explorer it's also mixing in some sections from another notebook which I recently had open.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea what is going on!</div>
        </p>

            <div data-bi-id="message-username-image-link" class="message-user-image message-username-image-link circular-display avatar-size-extrasmall" role="img"
<h3> disco2000  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Add to that,
<div><br />
<div>I've now discovered that if I keep messing about and selecting different combinations of sections to open from the windows explorer folder, I can get different combinations of sections to open up in onenote. But what I select does not correspond to what
 opens up!</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, for example, I just managed to get the 'writing', 'reading' and 'teaching' sections of the 'postdoc' notebook open together, by selecting 'reading', 'writing', 'teaching' and 'training'. For some reason the training section hasn't opened!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok, now I selected 'admin', 'conferences', 'next steps', 'overview', 'public engagement', and 'reading' and the following sections have opened:</div>
<div>Overview</div>
<div>Admin</div>
<div>Conferences</div>
<div>Next steps</div>
<div>Overview (again)</div>
<div>Public engagement</div>
<div>Teaching</div>
<div>Training</div>
<div>Writing</div>
<div>Conferences (again)</div>
<div>Next steps (again)</div>
<div>Overview (again)</div>
<div>Public engagement (again)</div>
<div>Public engagement (again)<br />
Admin (again)</div>
<div>Teaching (again)</div>
<div>Writing (again)</div>
<div>Training (again)</div>
<div>Next steps (again)</div>
<div>Overview (again)</div>
<div>Public engagement (again)</div>
<div>Conferences (again)</div>
<div>Admin (again)</div>
<div><br />
<div>So - multiple copies of each section (even though there is only one of each section in the folder that I was opening them from), some sections that I did not select to open have opened (i.e. training, teaching, writing), and some sections that I did select
 to open have not opened (i.e. reading).</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is utterly bizarre.</div>

            I *hope* I have now solved it.
<div><br />
<div>I have created new versions of all my notebooks, and copied the appropriate sections of each (old) notebook into the new version. I had to play around with opening different combinations of sections via windows explorer, then copy across the sections I
 had open, then play around again to get some different sections open.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think/hope that the new versions of the notebooks will now work as normal - displaying all sections when I open them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still have no idea why this issue occurred, or whether I could have fixed it without creating new notebooks.</div>

            Nope - not solved. It's now doing the same thing with the new notebooks I created. Though so far only seems to be a problem on my work computer not my home computer.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            OK, here are some screenshots to try and show you the problems I am having:
<div><br />
<div>1. I click on the OneNote icon I have pinned to my task bar to launch onenote:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66461a84-f0c8-4db3-befe-2df542f36128" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>2. It opens up on the last notebook I had open 'ESRC postdoc', but for some reason there don't seem to be any sections in this notebook:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3e7d70f-f1cd-4cac-b6e1-4a358901e192" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>This is odd, because as you can see, this notebook actually has several sections:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b22c26e8-e240-4976-8313-19b7d6f1844a" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>3. So I try opening all of these sections at once from Windows Explorer:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4120f05f-87ec-47ba-a8e2-cc5fdee2c6b3" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>But for some reason this ends up opening two copies of all the sections in the ESRC postdoc notebook:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8c190c4-fcf7-4fbe-ab98-a57b5ac9c9a8" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>And as you can see from the red circle on the left, the ESRC postdoc notebook itself still has the icon for a closed notebook, not an open notebook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Ok, I'll try opening a different notebook and see what happens. I choose the 'PhD archive' notebook from the left hand margin:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/198a49c4-3bfe-49b8-bb06-f7afd47e9125" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>When I click on the notebook opens up, displaying five sections.</div>
<div>But that's weird because as the windows explorer panel shows, there are 12 sections in this notebook:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46f89751-2ed4-4fe1-85a1-6d652ae34761" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Ok, I'll try opening all of the sections from the PhD archive notebook at once, via Windows explorer:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37eb4013-4fda-4043-99c1-880f41ae9ed2" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Result: It opens up the other 7 sections alongside two copies of all the sections from the ESRC postdoc notebook, and closes the 5 PhD archive sections that were open. And neither notebook is showing as 'open' according to the icons in the left margin.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WHAT??????</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53f19077-a135-404f-bb89-ae9a3e5aaca5" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>6. Er.... so this is weird. Ok, I'll try opening the ESRC postdoc notebook again from the left hand margin:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef11526d-c9eb-4637-9eb8-f04646e1779a" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>Result: It opens up the ESRC postdoc notebook showing just one random section:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5fab8f3-00eb-43f5-84d6-c7a1ec8277cc" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>7. Ok, lets try opening up a different notebook. I select 'personal life' from the left margin. It opens, but only displays 3 sections, despite the fact that (as you can see from the Windows Explorer pane) there are 10 sections in this notebook:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a673aee2-d128-4fa4-99ec-f5b3ffbcf4bd" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>8. Well I'll try just opening one more section via Windows Explorer:</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/deb08ffc-8530-4786-b926-dd2e00874a14" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>WHAT??????????????????????????</div>
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/703c0ffe-609f-498d-91a4-44305755d241" /></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>So.....</div>
<div>Basically, if I open up notebooks via their icons in the left margin, only a few apparently randomly selected sections open up.</div>
<div>Meanwhile, if I try and open any sections via windows explorer, all sections opened this way get opened up together, despite being from different notebooks and being opened at different times.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea what is causing this or how to stop it, and I am worried that I will end up losing work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would appreciate some advice.</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>This is wrong.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A "closed" notebook on the left bar means: This notebook is open (!) in Onenote
<b>but</b> you are <b>not &nbsp;positioned at it </b>(not actually displayed).</div>
<div><br />
<div>An "open" notebook on the left bar means: This notebook is open (!) in Onenote
<b>and</b> you <b>are positioned at it </b>(is actually displayed).</div>
<div><br />
<div>A really closed notebook just doesn't appear at the left bar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So it seems your config is inconsistent.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should "reset" your Onenote by closing explicitely ALL notebooks; either by right clicking each notebook (at the left bar) and select Close or by
<b>RUN Onenote.exe /safeboot </b>to clear the cache.</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Then re-open your notebooks by using <b>File, Open, Browse</b> (navigating to the notebook
<b>folder</b>);</div>
<div><b>not</b> by using Windows explorer.</div>

<div>I come to the conclusion that your server, where the notebooks are stored, is to blame.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A crucial question in the context of Onenote's "excessive" use of the SMB protocol is:</div>
<div><br />
<div>What OS is running on that server ? Windows or any flavour of Unix/Linux using e.g. SAMBA ?</div>

<p>
</p><p>I love Skype, but I now have phone service on the ranch and no longer need Skype or my Skype number.&nbsp; Can I just stop my monthly bank autopay for these services?&nbsp; I would rather do it "right," but I can't find anywhere on the site that allows me to cancel.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

</p><p><span><span>True. You are correct that it is possible to cancel the Skype Number service check reference link below.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Home Networking Windows 10 and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi All - Just wondering if anyone&nbsp;is successfully able to use a Home group between a Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 computer. I can create and/or join a Home group, but when I try to browse in File Explorer, I get a panel telling me that no other Home group
 computers are available right now.&nbsp; Home group trouble shooter does not solve the problem. I do have network and file sharing turned on on&nbsp; both computers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't see any way to expand or resize columns in Yahoo mail. I'm still using the "old" mail interface. Have you upgraded to the new version?</p>
<p>Does it help if you switch to Full Screen Mode (F11 key) and combine that with zooming out [Ctrl and -]&nbsp; or &nbsp;[Ctrl and +]</p>
<p>See if this helps...<br />
From Internet Options&gt; General &gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete (next screen) uncheck Preserve Favorites website data then check and delete Temporary Internet Files and Cookies.</p>

<p>2. See if a browser add-on is causing the problem. <br />
Start Internet Explorer without add-ons by right-clicking the IE icon on the desktop. Choose Start without add-ons.<br />
or<br />
from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />

            <p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>See if a combination of zooming out and changing resolution lets you see&nbsp;that column and move it back.</p>
<p>Right-click the desktop&gt; Properties&gt; Settings&gt; Screen resolution&gt; move toward "More."</p>
<p>E.g. If you're at 1024 x 768, try 1280 x 800.</p>
<p>Then zoom out with the Zoom button or [Ctrl and -]</p>

Look for Options in the upper right of the Inbox page, click the down arrow and switch back to Classic mail.</p>
<p>You may be able to switch back to the new interface later and find the column issue is gone.</p>

            My sincere apologies. Custom templates in Excel mobile app (both Android and iOS) are currently not supported.
<br />
<br />This is a feature which was demanded earlier and Microsoft has started development work on this feature. This will be made available anytime to general public (no date is committed as of now for this feature for general public release)

    <title>Embedding Avi movies into Powerpoint 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karl_in_georgia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embedding Avi movies into Powerpoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am preparing movies using the wildly used science program ImageJ; the original file formate is ND2.&nbsp; From ImageJ, I save the files as uncompressed AVI. So far these files where playing without any problems in earlier versions of Powerpoint (2010).&nbsp; Powerpoint
 2013 does not play these files (Error message: Cannot play media). The Windows Media Player and Quicktime play these files without problems.&nbsp; Is there a setting in Powerpoint which will allow to play these movies as before (just as an object in the slide,
 not within an extra media player window).&nbsp; Or is there a way to convert the files that they can be used for Powerpoint presentations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried FIJI, the extended version of ImageJ which allows codec settings, 'H.264 video etc without success.</p>
<p>Instructions on how to save videos from FIJI so that they will play in PPT with full quality would be also helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, when I open such a ImageJ derived AVI in Quicktime (I do this for scene selection/cropping of video length) and export it from Quicktime as an AVI Powerpoint 2013 will not play the file (as before no problem in Powerpoint2010) or it will modify
 the file when I insert it, which will result in a reduced quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karl</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Office PowerPoint Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you better, I need few details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How are you trying to insert the AVI file as object in PowerPoint?</p>
<p>2. Are you trying to insert as ‘Insert’ tab &gt; Object &gt; Create from file’ or inserting through ‘Developer’ tab &gt; More Controls?</p>
<p>3. Try to save the AVI file in different MPEG format then check if that plays in PowerPoint 2013.</p>

            <p>You computer probably already has <em>Window Movie Maker</em> installed on it. You can import your AVI into that program, then export as a WMV file. As a side benefit, your video will also be much smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't already have the program, you can download it for free from here:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker Download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When exporting from Windows Movie Maker, always choose Publish to <strong>This Computer</strong> for best quality.</p>

<p>as in the title. i'm doing this for archiving purposes.</p>
<p>i expected that this rule would do the job (see screenshot below), but it doesn't. the licensed assigned to the user i'm using for testing is a "office 365 enterprise e3" license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what am i doing wrong?</p>

<p>My mistake, had firewall rules on my archival box that blocked inbound connections on port 25 from anything other than a bunch of trusted hosts. Can confirm the rule works perfectly as shown above.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 Deleting messages from server</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden last week on Tuesday November 20 I noticed I was missing some emails. My service provider says that something is sending a message to the server telling it to delete the messages. I have 4 email accounts, and it is only happening on two of
 them, which makes me think it's coming from my desktop. I have reinstalled Outlook 2007 and it's hasn't fixed it. I have changed the profile when reinstalling it, and then importing my pst file to get all my folders and contacts back.
</p>
<p>These are all POP3 accounts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to find the glitch that is sending this message, even though everything is set to leave messages on the server?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home Premium subscription - Pending Status - No email invite</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need assistance with an issue that I am unsure how to solve. My dad recently purchased office 365 ( subscription )&nbsp; and installed it on my laptop. I now have office 2013 and he installed it on his computer as well. He sent an invite to my email address
 ( which is a gmail account ). This was before I was registered with this email address. I didn't receive an email anywhere (inbox or spam ) and so I knew I maybe I should register which I did with the same email address. He resent the invite and its still
 showing a pending status to his account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I of course still have not received an email, I know the software is already installed and I am able to use it and sign in. I am unable to use cloud service, I am how ever able to get into outlook online. I thought maybe the email link to activate everything
 would be there, it is not. When I do try to log into office online I get this message shown below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office isn’t associated with this account.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve already activated Office, sign out and then sign in with the Microsoft account you used to activate Office.</li><li>If you have Office but haven’t activated it, you can use your product key to activate.
<a href="http://o15.officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidOfficeSetup?clid=1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Activate Office now</a></li><li>If you don’t have Office, you can buy it in the Office store.</li></ul>
</div>
<p>I know the account isn't activated for me to use, I am still able to use some of what office 365 provides ( word,excel.etc ) but not the cloud services. Is this still possible without activation ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stumped on how I am not getting his email invite. Please provide any information that can assist me in this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Hi Senjin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to explain that you have the license of Office 2008, however, as you have update the Office 2016. So Office 2016 couldn’t be activated by the Office 2008 license.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you didn’t want to subscribe Office 365 subscription, you can try reinstalling Office 2008 to activate via

<p>
</p><p>Besides, Mainstream support for Office 2008 for Mac has ended since April 9, 2013. You can view the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=Office%202008%20for%20Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support Lifecycle

<p>We suggest you upgrade to Office 365 plans (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=Office%202008%20for%20Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">home&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">business</a>)

            <p>Hi export83,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the forum and I'm sorry for the delayed reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be glad to assist you in resolving your issue so that you'll be able to receive messages on your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please know that if there are changes applied on your account settings, these can be possible reasons why your account can no longer receive emails. These settings are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Blocked and Safe senders list<br />
- Junk mail filter<br />
- Message rules</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check on these settings, please refer to this article: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/hotmail-email/im-not-receiving-emails-sent-by-my-family-or/377a9bf3-7975-4d76-a6eb-04dcc6d68097">
I'm not receiving emails sent by my family or friends</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your post as well, a sender received a bounce message after trying to send an email to your account. For investigation, please provide us the following information in the private message area:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>• Final-Recipient:<br />
• Action: failed <br />
• Status:<br />
• Diagnostic-Code:<br />
<br />
You need to view the full message header of the email to get this. Right-click on the unopened message from the message list then choose
</font><strong><span>View message source</span></strong> option.</span><br />
</p>
<p>Note: To view it, please sign in using a Microsoft account and click Private Messages tab across All Replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regard to the sent items that are not showing up on your phone, I'd like to know if the same issue applies if you check your account on the web-based Outlook.com?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with this, I recommend checking the Saving sent messages settings on your account by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. Sign in to your Outlook.com account.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">2. You’ll be directed to your Inbox.</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">4. You’ll be directed to the Outlook.com Options page, under
<font><b>Writing email</b>, please choose <b>Saving sent messages</b> and then choose
<b>Save all sent messages in the Sent items folder</b></font>.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">5. Then click

<h2>            Outlook in mixed environment</h2>
                    <p>I want to run Outlook and synch calendar, contacts and email on different devices -- Windows PC 8.1 and iPad and iPhone. I have been using Outlook on PC and synching with Apple's email. Now I want to used Outlook for all devices. My primary email and my
 outlook.com email is att.net.</p>
<p>So, is there a way to have Outlook function on all three devices? How do I do it, and do I have to create an outlook.com email address to make it work?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Outlook 2013 can connect to Outlook.com using POP, IMAP, or Exchange ActiveSync. &nbsp;The default account type is EAS. &nbsp;EAS, however, won't allow you to copy messages from a local PST to the Outlook.com folders. It's a drawback in the protocol. &nbsp;IMAP, however,
 will allow it. &nbsp;So you can connect to your Outlook.com mailbox using an IMAP account (configured manually) and then drag/drop or copy/paste the messages from the local data file's folders to the Outlook.com folders. &nbsp;You can, simultaneously, connect to the
 mailbox using an EAS account (configured automatically), which will allow you to copy the contacts from the local data file to Outlook.com's contacts folder. &nbsp;You can do the same with the data file's calendar folder. &nbsp;Once your data has been moved, you can
 remove the IMAP account so you don't see the same folders twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If iCalendar has a way to export the contacts as a comma-separated values file or as an ICS file and you can then get that file to the PC, you can import the data into the Outlook.com calendar, which will then show up in Office Outlook. &nbsp;After that, you
 can set up an EAS account in the iPhone with Settings&gt;Mail, Contacts, and Calendar&gt;Add Account, choosing Hotmail or Outlook.com as the account type. &nbsp;This will allow the phone to sync to mail, contact, and calendar on Outlook.com so the PC and the phone will
 see the same data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this, be sure to enable two-step verification, which will protect your account from hackers. You can add the phone to the account, if you haven't already, to display the code you'll need to log in. &nbsp;This code can ge either SMS from Outlook.com
 or you can install the Google Authenticator, connect it to your Outlook.com account, and have the Authenticator generate codes. &nbsp;Designating your PC and your phone as trusted devices will mean you don't have to enter a code every time for those two devices.</p>

<h3> r. tifou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Log into MS Outlook 16 Following 365 Migration</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
<br />
I work remotely and have been unable to log into MS Outlook following our org's migration to Office 365. On opening it previously would say "Password Needed" or something similar on the MS Outlook taskbar, but when I would attempt to enter the password it would
 say "This feature has been disabled by your administrator."<br />
<br />
I then have done everything from deleting all values in "Credential Manager" related to MS Office and restarting using my network address as a new user, to fully reinstalling/repairing MS Office and temporarily disabling administrator requirements via the "net
 user administrator" value in the Command Prompt. Nothing has worked, however, and I am still unable to log into my Outlook client (despite it working on my phone and being able to access the browser-based client).</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />to download visio pro for office 365, please go to office 365 portal software and click visio&gt; install (the option should be separate).
<br />If the issue still persists can you send a screenshot?
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Manuela
