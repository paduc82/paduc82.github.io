<h2>            Microsoft Health Calories and MyFitnessPal</h2>
                    <p>I've successfully used a combination of Band2 and MFP to lose over 3 stones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however, recently The integration of Microsoft Health and MyFitnessPal has gone bonkers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, 2 hours after getting up and a measly 200 odd steps, and Microsoft Health has sent a calorie adjustment of +800 calories to MFP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried twittering both Microsoft and MFP for help, and everyone is just shaking their head and sending me to forums (guess what, guys, WE don't know how to fix YOUR problems).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done factory reset of the band, I've removed and reinstalled all the apps, I've unlinked them and relinked them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want (need!) my old weight loss combo back, but at this rate I'm going to end up weighing more than when I started!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else fixed this problem (other than by switching to another fitness tracker?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

            <p>I have actually had this issue occur several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know the root cause, but sometimes it looks like elevated heart rate causes it to do a massive overestimate of calorie burn in MyFitnessPal. I haven't had it happen from steps alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it has happened to me, the inappropriately high calorie burn seemed to correct itself after a few hours. This normally would do something like show 800 burn at noon, 400 at 5p, and continue to drop until it stabilizes to a more reasonable number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you looked back on days where this happened as seen whether or not the numbers changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other idea which might be helpful is to manually delete the false activity information from MyFitnessPal itself. I can't remember if you can remove it in the app or not, but you can do it online, if my memory is correct.</p>

                    <p>Today I got a new family Office365 Home subscription and look forward to 1 TB of onedrive storage.
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;already had Onedrive from before but when I go to Onedrive I still see my previous (or current) storage&nbsp;<br />
capacity and not 1TB. How do I upgrade my storage to the 1TB capacity?</p>

    <title>build 10565 stalled at 84&#37; overall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riet strijker  say:</h3>
<h2>            build 10565 stalled at 84&#37; overall</h2>
                    <p>The download and installation went well until at the last and third installation part the installation stalled overall at 84% and tha particular installation at 39 %.</p>
<p>If I reboot again the pc goes to the previous installation (build 10547), and I get a notification that the installation was not successful. If I click on that message, it takes me to settings and updates, but I never see why the installation wasn't successful.
 I don't get a message what kind of error was made.</p>
<p>I remove every usb connection (even of my keyboard) but still this fault remains.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

            <p>First, I just want mention that when you force a reboot, it does interrupt the install, and it does, always roll back to your old build/OS, so there's no mystery there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, when the install falters at the stage you have described, it's almost always because it's run into previously installed software that it will not tolerate ... and that's usually a 3rd party security program of some kind. Sometimes, it's a "registry
 cleaner", or that sort of thing that it finds to be objectionable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We ask that all 3rd party security programs be cleanly uninstalled, which, in some cases, requires a special uninstaller provided by the manufacturer. (And, disabling it is not the same as cleanly uninstalling it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One person said, "no, I'm not going to uninstall it ... I've used it for years, and I fully trust it". I explained that it's not a question of trusting it, it's whether or not Win 10 sees it as compatible, so he reluctantly uninstalled it ... then, after
 the installation completed smoothly, he didn't want to talk about it.</p>

            <p>Question that I do not think has been answered.</p>
<p>After uninstalling the AV and installing Windows 10 update can the AV be reinstalled and will it work?</p>
<p>Then if another update comes along it would have to be removed again.</p>

            <p>Some of them can be reinstalled after installing the Windows upgrade, and will appear to be working, but upon reboot, cause failure. Others will reinstall and not cause complete failure, but may cause various malfunctions that usually get blamed on the OS,
 perhaps generating feedback that is misleading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one that has caused install failure, and has been removed, it is very likely that, if reinstalled, it will also cause trouble with installing the next build, and need to be removed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, some are compatible now, so won't cause a problem at all; however, when a build install fails in late stages, it's quite likely that cleanly uninstalling the 3rd party security program is what's needed.</p>

            <p>Answers to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to remove and reconnect my Gmail account to my Outlook account.&nbsp; Someone else helped me set up the connection between the two accounts.&nbsp; I am not sure how to do it, so that is why I have not removed the connection between the accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have a Gmail account being forwarded, so I have no other email account from which to compare against.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In looking at the settings on both the Outlook account and the Gmail account, it looks like IMAP is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use MS Edge browser, but I did try it in MS IE and the same thing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am still in need of help on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Okay, so I "disabled" email forwarding from my Gmail account and saved the change.&nbsp; I then re-enabled it shortly afterward and after doing so, I refreshed my Outlook.com account to see if emails were still showing up multiple times in conversation view.&nbsp;
 The problem was still present.</p>

<p>Well, I tried again to stop forwarding of emails from my Gmail account, but this time I did not disable the option, I totally deleted my Hotmail.com account from the Gmail system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the Hotmail.com account from the Gmail forwarding email option, I restarted my computer because Gmail would not allow me to add the Hotmail.com account again because it said the address was already set up for forwarding.&nbsp; After the computer
 restart, this problem disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a new problem.&nbsp; I added the Hotmail.com account to the Gmail.com account and told the Gmail account to forward to the Hotmail account, but the Hotmail account does not show that there is any account connected and my Gmail emails are not forwarding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to the 'Connected Accounts' section to try connecting my Gmail account, but after following the prompts, it says that it is already connected.&nbsp; It still does not show up on the connect accounts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>

<p>To answer the other questions about sending emails from my Hotmail account using the Gmail account, the answer appears to be yes.&nbsp; The Gmail address appears in the drop down 'From' menu on the compose email page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; It appears that I am now receiving emails into my Hotmail account that are forwarded from the Gmail account.&nbsp; That said, the Gmail account still does not show up on the 'Connected Accounts' page of my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when trying to change the default 'From address,' the only email that shows up is my Hotmail account, but on the compose new email page the 'From' section allows me to choose from both accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to set up my Gmail account as the default 'From' address, but I can't until it shows up in the drop down menu when selecting the 'From' address.</p>

<p>When you add a connected account, outlook.com retrieves the emails from the connected account.</p>
<p>Forwarding is a different operation.</p>
<p>Either forward the emails or add a connected account.</p>

<p>Okay, so I disabled forwarding from the Gmail account so I could add the Gmail account as a 'Connect Account' on the Hotmail account.&nbsp; When trying to do so, Hotmail said the account is already connected.&nbsp; This may be true, because I can send emails from
 the Hotmail account, using the Gmail account in the 'From' field.&nbsp; That being said, the Gmail account does not show up on the list of 'Connected Accounts'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still looking for a way to make my Gmail account the default address that emails are sent from within my Hotmail account.&nbsp; I had it set up that way, but through this process of trying to fix the problem of emails downloading multiple times, that setup
 got lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still having the issue of emails showing up multiple times within conversation view.&nbsp; It is making it difficult to keep track of things when the same email is showing 2,3, or 4 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have tried all the fixes suggested so far, but nothing has changed.&nbsp; Additional help is needed.</p>

<h2>            Pro Tour Golf</h2>
                    I've been playing Pro Tour Golf on the 9300 recently and I've managed to get a high score of 5 under par on the Pinetree Bay course.
<br />
<br />
How does this compare to your scores?<br />
<br />
If you haven't tried Pro Tour Golf yet you can download it for free at:<br />
<br />
http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,8764,65018,00.html for 9300<br />
or<br />
http://www.europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,,63513,00.html for 9500<br />
<br />
Once you download the SIS file to your pc you can install it with pc suite. Alternatively download direct to your phone with the web browser.

            I'll probably get slammed for this for spamming, but in my humble opinion, PTG is far too easy. One of my claims to 'fame' has been writing my own golf sim for the 9300/9500, maybe you'd have more of a challenge with

<h2>            E72 automatically connecting to internet</h2>
                    
<p>Sounds ok but alas no. It always connects around midnight, i presume something is trying to update. As i have no free net usage is costs me £1 per night :smileymad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the phone for around 2 months and this has started since i had the phone, the only thing i have installed is the network provider info, no apps or nothing. My service provider says there is nothing wrong their end and it must be the phone, they
 have cut off my internet and the charges have stopped, so something is definatly trying to connect, but as i have said the phone is standard. I cannot find any reference to anyone else having the same problem on the internet, i have downloaded kaplinsky anti
 virus and it has scanned my phone and says there are no viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>could someone please shed some light as to what may be happening</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yeah I've got the same problem too, sorry I can't help you. I think it's a good idea to send your most important messages somewhere else and then message it back again to another SIM but that's also a bit weird.<br />

<h2>            Can Excel be set up to accept sku numbers via a scanner&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible for excel to accept scanned in sku numbers?&nbsp; We are starting to think about end of the year inventory and it would be so much easier if we could scan in the product sku numbers as we count the number of items.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>ps - does anyone know of perhaps another software that&nbsp;would accomplish the same thing?&nbsp; Ideally, it would be on a laptop.&nbsp; Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Take Palcouk's suggestion and run with it - you need to be looking at the peripheral device to see what it supports.&nbsp; Here's a discussion in another forum where someone asked pretty much the same question, and the discussion goes on to tell how one person
 did it, and answer some questions like "where do I get the bar code font if it doesn't come with the device", that kind of thing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.excelforum.com/excel-general/488636-does-excel-support-barcode-scanning.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.excelforum.com/excel-general/488636-does-excel-support-barcode-scanning.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the recent transition from Windows 7 to Windows 8, you'll want to be sure your device works not only with Excel, but with the version of Windows you plan on using.&nbsp; Since the input is treated pretty much like keyboard entry, that means it has to be
 detected by and processed by the Operating System before it actually gets into Excel.</p>

            When you say SKU, do you mean Barcodes and / or printed numbers.<br />
<br />
As others have pointed out, basically what you are looking for is some sort of device, such as a dedicated bar code reader or even a simple hand held scanner.&nbsp; You also need some sort of program to convert the scanned images (all scan output is an image) into
 text character output that Excel can handle.&nbsp; Ideally the scanner will have the OCR program built into it so that the output is directly translated into excel friendly text output.<br />
<br />
<br />
The long way would be to capture scan images then submit them to a site or tool to convert them to readable format, sites like this: http://www.onlinebarcodereader.com/<br />
<br />
A quick google search found this example page with HUNDREDS of scanners:<br />

</p><p>Currently, the pop up blocker settings is only available for the desktop app version of the Microsoft Edge browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you submit a feature request for the mobile app version of the said app, using the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong> app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can try using other browsers found in the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/search/apps?q=browser" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="browser">Store</a></strong> that will hopefully allow you to access pop ups.</p>

<h2>            Access VB code - Dlookup with multiple criteria</h2>
                    <p>I have a form with a text box that I want populated based on the selections made in two other cbo boxes on that form.
</p>
<p>Note - these two fields already use a waterfall type query that if you select a specific type - it will only show the dates associated with that type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the objective is&nbsp;to put the MeetDateType that is associated with the specific Meeting Type and Meeting Date.&nbsp;

<p>There is a table (tblMtgDates) that contain these same fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the Dlookup I created - but it's not working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, not&nbsp;sure if I should be it on the last cbo field I populate with the AfterUpdate option, or if I should make the dlookup the Control Source of the text box.&nbsp; But if they change the date, I want the textbox to update as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Me.Text24 = DLookup("[MeetDateType]", "tblMtgDates", "[MeetingDates] =" &amp; [Forms]![frmAttendance]![cboMtgDate] And "[MeetType] = " &amp; [Forms]![frmAttendance]![cboMtgType])</span></p>

            All those tools won't work anymore, I think the trial period is over. I've tried every trick on this forum to get it to install, and there is no solution, only suggestions. For example, you could re-install Windows, and try to install it and it won't.

            <p>Thanks Cbarnhorst! I've tried several of those, but non of them created a decent .ISO file. They maybe work for older versions of Windows, but not for 10. Yes, Hyper-V supports reading DVD drives, but you can't make a virtual machine to boot from it. I don't
 want to use a third party software since I have one in my system. Thanks for the tips though, I can use them some day!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all guys for your responds. I found out that the Download Tool has an option to download an ISO file. I downloaded it and tried to install it in the virtual machine, but it didn't work because I didn't have a product key ( I have one, but it is
 for my host system and it didn't work in the virtual one). What I did was: I installed Windows 8.1 on the virtual machine and upgraded it to Windows 10 using WU. Everything works just fine now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>This doesn't work without an activation key. When you start installing, it asks you for the key and there is an option&nbsp;<strong>skip</strong> that doesn't work. I upgraded my system to Windows 10 successfully, and I wanted to continue with the insider program
 without experimenting with my main system. That is why I wanted to use Hyper-V to load a second Windows 10 connected to the fast ring, so I can continue receiving new builds and evaluating them without any risk.</p>

            The virtual machine requires a qualifying OS to upgrade just like any other computer.&nbsp; If you try to install any other way, yes it will require a retail product key.

<p><br />
Can I ask if all you want to show in the Header is the text of the new section heading, then you can do this automatically with the use of a StyelRef field, see below article for instructions and tips.</p>
<p>Also if this is what you are only chnaging in the Header(s) then you do not need section breaks and the multiple linked Headers.</p>

<p>Hi Crimson,</p>
<p>Since the solutions do not work in your environment, we need to collect OneDrive for Business logs and your tenant information to further investigate on the issue. To protect your privacy, I have sent you a private message for further instructions. You can
 go to this link to access to the Private Message: 
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Meanwhile, can you share us with the following information?<br />
1. Windows versions of your affected users.<br />
2. OneDrive for Business 2016 version. You can find it via Task Manager &gt; right click on OneDrive for Business &gt; Properties &gt; Details.<br />
3. Capture a screenshot of the error message you encountered. You can upload screenshots by clicking
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> &gt; the first<strong> Insert/Edit Media</strong> icon.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,<br />
Ryan</p>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only a subset of items are synchronized in shared mailboxes or public folders in Outlook 2016. If you only received the last 24 hour emails, it might be due to an incorrect configuration settings. For us to come up with an effective resolution, we would
 like to know the following:</p>

 would do the trick. If you already did this step, kindly disregard.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I get rid of annoying markings on all my Word documents</h2>
                    Each time I open a Word document there are blue markings at the end of each sentence and between paragraphs.&nbsp; The markings look like a reverse capital P.&nbsp; I may have changed a setting without knowing.&nbsp; This problem has only started within the past month.&nbsp;
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.

                    My iPhone account doesn't see my credit that shows on my computer. When I log out and try to log in using the same log in that works on my mac it says its the wrong password although that is what is saved in my keychain on both devices. I just want one
 account and since the one on my mac has the money loaded that's what I need to use. Help please.&nbsp;
