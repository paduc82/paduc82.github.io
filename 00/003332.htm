<p>Hi Amy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I'm afraid there is no out of the box option to use move/copy feature in OneNote Online. You could click the button "Edit in OneNote" to launch OneNote client to do this. To address your concerns, I encourage and suggest you vote for<a href="https://onenote.uservoice.com/forums/327183-onenote-online/suggestions/17824195-copy-a-section-and-paste-into-same-notebook-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Copy
 a section and paste into same notebook online</a> or deliver a new feedback in OneNote Online UserVoice which is the best platform for us to listen from you and others. Thank you for your understanding and feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Eli</p>

<h2>            Does &#34;MS Answers&#34; suck, or is it just me&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what the deal is with this site, but trying to find answers for me is just about impossible.&nbsp; I think the "answers" in "MS Answers is an oxymoron!</p>
<p>I used "MS Discussions" for close to 10 years and it was EXCELLENT!&nbsp; If I had&nbsp;a&nbsp;question, I type it in and relevant posts came back, from simple questions to complex questions, instantly 98% of the time .&nbsp; An excellent excel data base!!!</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;MS changed to "MS Answers" I have very seldom found answers here (with the exception of asking and the excellent help I have gotten from the gurus... same as wtih MS Discussions).&nbsp; But early on in "MS Discussions"&nbsp; I found&nbsp;posts that said "research
 first before asking questions" and I fouind that to be true about 98% of the time on "MS Discussions" and true about 10% of the time on "MS Answers".&nbsp; S,o either I am really doing something wrong or MS Answers" sucks.&nbsp; Please help if it is me.</p>
<p>Here is my current example.&nbsp; A&nbsp;VERY simple question and I can not find the "Answer".&nbsp; I am writing a routine that part of it closes an open workbook and a message box comes up and asks if I want to save it and then another one ask about dumping a lot of
 info on the clip board.&nbsp; I know there is a very simple command out there, that I have not used in years, that will bypass the message boxes and the routine will continue.</p>
<p>So I go to "MS Answers" and search "bypass message box" "continue routine", "bypass", "ignore message box" and all I get is garbage.&nbsp; It brings back total garbage when I do not use quotes, because it returns any post with the words anywhere in it and I find
 if I use quotes it seldom bring back anything!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides not asking the right question.&nbsp;what am I doing wrong on "MS No Answers".&nbsp; As a programming layperson I do not know what the correct jargon is for "bypassing message boxes" but I know "MS Discussions" would have figured out what I was&nbsp;asking and I
 would have had the answer in about 1 min rather than 1 hour.</p>
<p>Ronbo</p>
<p>PS&nbsp; I looked up the code in another one of my workbooks and found the very simple answer "Application.DisplayAlert"...&nbsp; That is not the point, the question is how do find answers on "MS Answers"?&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Or should this site be named "MS
 No Answer without asking"?</p>

<div>Is there a way to permanently resize the favorites organizing window in windows 7,so that you don:t have to scroll to get to folder you want.For example,when placing a topic under the software folder you have to scroll to it and then again if you want
 to insert another software topic you have to use scroll again to get to the topic.&nbsp; Or is there a way to keep the software folder open(or highlighted) when putting successive software topics into software folder.(in favorites)Thanks!!</div>

<p><br />
Open it as an Explorer window and drag the icon in the IE Address bar to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could also do that with the Favorites bar, e.g. press&nbsp; Ctrl-Shift-I.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or you could use the new Add to Favorites Bar button, then open that directory (Favorites Bar) in an Explorer
 window and drag whatever you wanted out of there to wherever.</p>

<h2>            Outlook Error 1025 - Mailbox does not exist</h2>
                    We use IMAP.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a user who can use Entourage 2008 fine with no problems (using IMAP). When i convert her profile to Office 2011, Outlook imports the data in and whenever she sends and receives we receive an a message "Mailbox does not exist". Under the Error Log
 it says&nbsp;</div>
<div>Error &nbsp;Mailbox does not exist</div>
<div>Details Mail could not be received at this time. Account name: Nameofuser</div>

</div>
<div>Error Code: 1025</div>

</div>
<div>-----</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also thrown the identity away and created a brand new account and receive the same error. Entourage still works fine with out any problems. It is sending and receiving email but the "Send/Receive" button doesn't act normal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am completely patched running 10.6.8 and Outlook for Mac 2011 version 14.1.2</div>

            Thanks. Unfortunately this user has a ton of folders (250 plus) and emails and I am not able to clean it up (due to the emails not being mine to clean up).
<div><br />
<div>I did call Microsoft and they had me change the Root Folder 2x from INBOX. to Inbox to nothing and change how it stays connected to the server. None of these solutions worked. He then suggested I delete the account and re-create it on the server which
 is not a possible solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Long story short - Entourage works so this user will be using Entourage or may switch to Apple Mail.</div>

 fine to a new file, but that creates an issue with having to cut and paste or recreate the files that I use on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>            Unable to check the &#34;change content sync settings&#34; boxes</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to "Change Content sync settings", I want to check the "Contacts", "Calendar", "Email", "tasks", and "Notes" boxes, but it won't allow me to do it.&nbsp; Has anyone else ever experienced this problem.&nbsp; I just got a new Notebook and on teh old one used
 to use Active Sync and now I am using "Windows Mobile Device Center" that came with the Notebook for Vista. I need this as I have all my tasks, calendar items and contacts on my IPAQ still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your microphone
<br />
<br />Scroll further down and make sure Skype is toggled on.
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Skype
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, I suggest you install Skype Classic:
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

            Hi Mike, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate app is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

    <title>Preview Pane Issue - Word - Office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kferris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview Pane Issue - Word - Office 365</h2>
                    <p>First let me say that I have no trouble opening Word.&nbsp; I have no trouble using it and saving files.&nbsp; My issue occurs once the file has been created and I go in to my file explorer and try to open or choose right click for options to move, delete, edit, preference
 etc. if the Preview Pane is selected. I get the error&nbsp;"Word could not create the work file check the temp environment variable" error. Also it does not show a preview until I have cleared a number of those errors.&nbsp; Also I get a message that any excel files
 "can't be previewed".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new Dell and I choose to go with Office 365 Business. This is the only computer I am having issues with.&nbsp; &nbsp;I imported my files from a back up drive.&nbsp; At first I thought it might be a compatibility issue with the old files.&nbsp; However
 after I create a new word document I have the same error issues.&nbsp; Basically I get the error message once I select the word file then I need to clear it from one to a few times.&nbsp; Once I do that I can open the word file and I will have the document in the preview
 pane.&nbsp; But if I close file explorer and reopen I have to go through the same steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not get a preview of an excel file at all.&nbsp; However excel opens, closes and saves normally.&nbsp; No selection issues either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a number of recommended fixes including the registry edit to change the Cache wording to Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp; That caused 2 error messages to show up when I rebooted.&nbsp; So I restored that back to the original&nbsp;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the short repair and the long repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cleared Temporary Internet files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably did a few other fixes from searches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix is if I close the Preview Pane I do not get an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like to know if this is a known issue and/or if there is a fix.&nbsp; I really like the Preview Pane as it lets me see what is in the file in many cases so I don't have to open the full document.&nbsp; Especially when I might only be looking for a date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Never mind.&nbsp; I was still researching and I came across one person's solution and that was to check if my Office version was 32 bit or 64 bit.&nbsp; I assumed that I had downloaded the 64 bit version as my Win 10 is 64 bit.&nbsp; As it turned out 32 bit is the default
 and recommended download version and that was the problem.&nbsp; After I uninstalled the 32 bit version I was able to install the 64 bit Version of Office 365 Business and now everything is working.</p>
<p>

                    While writing my thesis word crashed and with it my file. I have found word work .tmp file that I think has almost all of the information that I lost. However ,when I try to open it with word it opens in coded format and I cannot use any of the information
 on it. How do I open it in the same format that my thesis is written in? Thanks!

            <p>I know this question was asked a while ago... this answer is probably more for those who may now encounter the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just&nbsp;did and managed to recover!</p>
<p>(same story - excel crashed&nbsp;- file vanished - .tmp file in it's place.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Excel</p>
<p>Open file</p>
<p>Browse to .tmp file location</p>
<p>Change the file type to open to "All files" in stead of the default&nbsp;"All Excel files"</p>
<p>Open the .tmp file in Excel</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, that opened an earlier version of the document, with minimal loss of data.</p>
<p>Just save as &amp; you're good to go again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can be helpful to someone...</p>

<h2>            Email notifications upon delegate making changes to calendar</h2>
                    I manage my boss' calendar on Outlook. He has given me delegate access and in fact made me the "Owner" of his calendar, although of course we still have our own emails, and I am still managing his calendar with my own log in, and it appears the system
 still recognizes that he is the "primary" owner of the calendar if you will. Currently
<strong>he receives email notifications whenever I make any adjustments to his calendar, is it possible that he stop receiving these emails?</strong> How can we change that? Thanks!

<h2>            Microsoft Safety Scanner can not be downloaded&#33;</h2>
                    I have been trying to download and run the&nbsp;"Microsoft Safety Scanner", (MSS),&nbsp;but I keep getting the following message; "Security Alert!"&nbsp; "Your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded!".&nbsp; This is my wife's PC and I have to check
 her system for maintainence issues as she never runs "The Malicious Software Removal Tool", (MRT),&nbsp;or any other security programs that she has to run herself but rather counts on "Microsoft Security Essentials", (MSSE), to cover all her security issues!&nbsp; I
 also do the weekly back ups to a flash drive for her.&nbsp; Her PC is running IE 11 and her OS is Windows 7 Pro, (32-bit version). We have never encountered this before!&nbsp; I keep a short cut on the desktop so I can download the new version every 10 days from there.&nbsp;
 Tonight when I tried to download the MSS I got the security alert I mentioned above.&nbsp; I still consider myself a novice but I did try and resolve this as best as I know how.&nbsp

            <p>There have been other reports of Safety Scanner not downloading properly. In fact I just got a 404 error using a link I had been using. Perhaps you need to set a new shortcut. Try the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2012/11/15/microsofts-free-security-tools-microsoft-safety-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2012/11/15/microsofts-free-security-tools-microsoft-safety-scanner/</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now for some other information. Since your wife's computer has Microsoft Security Essentials installed using the Safety Scanner is redundant. The safety scanner uses the same definitions and antimalware engine as MSE, basically it's a portable (not installed)
 version of MSE That being said, it would be useful if the computer was infected with malware that disabled MSE and you needed to scan the computer to detect and remove the malware. Note that the Safety Scanner can be downloaded to a USB flash drive from a
 clean computer and then run on the infected machine directly from the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Malicious Software Removal Tool scans for a small subset of the antimalware definitions and is updated every month during the installation of Microsoft Security Updates. It does a quick scan at the same time and if malware is found it will provide a
 report and may suggest performing an additional <strong>Full</strong> Scan.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Instead of running duplicate scans with the Safety Scanner and MRT I would suggest doing weekly scans with the
<strong>Free version of Malwarebytes Anti-malware </strong>and <strong>AdwCleaner</strong>.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ShellianneDuffin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for your forum contribution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hotmail account, is that your primary windows live id on your phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is not, have you tried to delete and re-enter the account and see if that solves the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is, please try a softreset. That means:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Turn off your phone</p>
<p>2. Remove the battery for approximately 15 seconds</p>
<p>3. Turn your phone back on again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that did not solve the issue, try deleting cache and cookies under your internet explorer settings. Normally, opening an email on your phone should not cause such an issue, therefore there must be something wrong with the communication between your windows
 live id and your phone when it tries to synchronise. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last option would be a complete hard reset. Please look at the link below to see how to do that:</p>

<h2>            Office 2013 Preview expired and non-functional, my old Office gone.  Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried the Office 2013 preview and love it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But to do that I had to uninstall my old office.&nbsp; Now I'm at work, 2013 is non-functional, there's no way to buy the upgrade, and I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling a new preview to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try reinstalling the preview I get "Error:&nbsp; Couldn't install Office"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How could the trial expire without any option to extend or purchase?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do now?</p>

<b>Premature Office 2013 Preview expires messsage</b>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/567b6ce5-f4c9-4589-8af3-1052a88b6ec7">Office 2013 expires soon, how to buy?</a></p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>After playing around a bit with this, I found a solution. </p>
<p>After warning you this will expire, if you click on the link it keeps posted at the top (warning you it will go to read only mode in a few days) it will bring you to your account section in office.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you hit the File tab, at the bottom you can click on account.</p>
<p>It will give you an option here to upgrade to the full version (noting again that yours will expire soon) and you can hit upgrade. &nbsp;You need to resign back into your MS account.</p>
<p>Then, all is well again. &nbsp;Still looks like the preview, did not ask for money, and when I checked my web MS Office Account, it did not take up another install slot.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>

<b>How long will Office 365 Preview last / Expire</b>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; If you have installed Office 365 / 2013&nbsp; Preview, it will expire 60 days after the next version of Office becomes available in your market. As the date approaches, you will receive notifications in the Office applications alerting
 you to the pending expiration. Once the Preview has expired, the applications enter read-only mode, which means that you can view or print documents only. It isn’t possible to create new documents, edit, or save them. You must uninstall the Preview version
 of Office before installing a newer version of Office. <br />
<br />
If you installed Office 365 Small Business Premium or Office 365 Enterprise, all data in the Preview account will be deleted when the Preview ends, including email and calendar data, web sites, and uploaded documents, so be sure to move any information you
 want to keep to a different location.<br />
<br />
If you installed one of the Preview products for IT pros on TechNet, the product will expire on June 30, 2013. At that time, it will not be possible to use the product any further.</p>
<p>If you installed Office 2013 on your local HD rather than Office 365, you will NOT lose any files when you uninstall it.

    <title>Contact Lists do not appear in Office 365 Outlook for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Contact Lists do not appear in Office 365 Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    In Office 365 Outlook Web App I have a few contact lists (lists that I use to send mass emails to 30 - 50 people). I would like to send one of those contact lists to someone else. In Outlook Web App it doesn't seem I can send any contacts at all. However,
 in Outlook for Mac (version 15.19.1), where I can send contacts in vcards, the contact lists do not appear among my contacts.

<p>I can create groups in Outlook 365.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a group would be okay too. But I don't seem to be able to import contacts from a contact list. I can only copy-paste one-by-one. There should be an easier solution to that. Can you imagine if someone has a company list with hundreds of addresses

            <p>Still haven't got any answer... </p>
<p>It seems like Microsoft didn't think about importing contacts from a contact list when adding contacts to a group. Also, Outlook web app lacks the functionality of sending contact cards. Seriously, Microsoft needs to think over these basic things before
 adding more and more functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a new list, I can add a list (from my contacts) as a member. If I create a group, I cannot add a list as a member? Totally inconsistent.</p>

    <title>My format changes when i open a workbook on another computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rofrpe  say:</h3>
<h2>            My format changes when i open a workbook on another computer</h2>
                    I created a workbook with 12 sheets (I used Office 2007 - Excel 2007 and Windows Vista). All the sheets are formated, some with text, calculations and so on. On the computer I created that workbook (PC) everything works fine, looks good on the screen and
 the printout is perfect. Whenever I copy and use that workbook on other computers (they use Office 2007, Excel 2007 and Windows Vista or Windows 7) it looks like I lose somehow the format. Cells with text won't show all the text and does not print out the
 sheet the way its supposed to. I have print areas in that sheet but the print out in other computers is completly different. How do I make sure that my workbook looks and prints out the same way on other computers (PC desktop and laptops) as it does on my
 PC desktop. Page setup is ok. The other computers have different sceen resolutions and different printers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>the different printers and their respective printer drivers are the most probable cause for the different appearance. Excel's screen rendering is dependent on the capacities of the installed default printer. Worksheets can look different on different computers,
 because not all printers are the same, for example cannot print as close to the paper edge as the other printer, so that will reflect in the page breaks.</div>

<div>If you need to print a file on a different computer without having to edit it first, consider saving it as a PDF and sending the PDF to the other computer.</div>

    <title>How to return newest date if there is a duplicated value - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to return newest date if there is a duplicated value</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I need to have the newest date when a duplicated value is found (see the column that says key) which is a combination of the country of sale and the product name.</p>
<p>In this case there is a pair duplicated in light red, so I would neeed to see 29/06/2012 on both cells (see green values), however I cant get it right, and is returning me the highest values of all the cells.</p>
<p>I was using and if+countif+dmax function like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=+IF(COUNT.IF($F$2:$F$6;F2)&gt;1;BDMAX($A$1:$F$6;$B$1;$AD$1:$AF$873);B2)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6474ab0-1e66-4275-826d-b90976ce68b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6474ab0-1e66-4275-826d-b90976ce68b2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to get it right?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this formula in cell H2 and copy down</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MAX(INDEX(($E$2:$E$6=E2)*($D$2:$D$6=D2)*($B$2:$B$6),,)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Office365 Pro Plus, then you may also use the MAXIFS() functions.</p>
