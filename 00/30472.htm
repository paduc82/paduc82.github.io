    <title>USB Port not recognising blood glucose meter after Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Port not recognising blood glucose meter after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>I run a HP Pavilion. It has USB 2 and USB 3 ports. I connect my Accu-chek blood glucose meter to the USB 2 port to download my test data. I also use a USB Infrared Reader called Accu-chek SmartPix which reads data via IR from another meter. It can't be read,
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed the Windows 10 anniversary update the machine fails to properly recognise the connected meter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "Devices and Printers" is shows "Meter". However, it doesn't appear in File Explorer where it's required to be opened so that its data can be viewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the diagnostics and this is result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8929335/USB%20Device%20Diagnostic.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there are many so-called "solutions" where they talk about the "USB Root Host". However, my version of Windows 10 doesn't have this. Instead it has drivers that refer to USB 3.0 and a different type of USB Root Host called xHCI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8929335/Device%20Manager%20USB.JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what was there before I installed the Anniversary Update as everything was working just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as to what I can do, including how to roll back to the previous version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you receive any error code or error message when you connect the USB hard drive to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I don't receive any error messages when it's connected. Please view the links in my original message where I've created screen shots from Device Manager when I ran the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and installed HP's latest chipset drivers for this machine, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall make a request for help to HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating. And inconvenient now that I cannot retrieve my blood sugar data from any of my blood glucose meters.</p>

<h2>            The mouse pointer in windows 10 has disappeared and the keyboard in not working at all &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Okay that's it , windows 10 is the most awful system that microsoft have ever made ..... I'm having windows 10 since 1 year now and still can't get rid of the problems in the system ... a few days ago , I started to use this community to find answers instead
 of searching for hours and days to find the solutions on youtube and other websites , can't believe that .. almost gonna cry , Finishing from one problem and after a few days I'm falling into another !!!!<br />
a few days ago I was having a problem with windows 10 cause I wasn't been able to transfer the photos from the iPhone to the laptop , and after solving this problem (finally after installing itunes) the next problem appeared ...... The mouse pointer has disappeared
 ... can't use the computer anymore .. The keyboard is not working , and the touchpad for the laptop is not working too ... I tried like every single key like : fn+f3 / fn+f5 and other keys , I also tried to search youtube , but they are all using their keyboards
 and mouse pointers forgetting that the main problem is the pointer has disappeared and the keyboard is not working (including the windows button ) actually I'm using my iphone now to ask this question .... cause the pc is still not working .....I am a 16 years
 old and almost gonna be an IT professional because of the problems of windows 10 ... and if I go to any programmer he'll probably gonna format the computer or he'll gonna tell me that there is no solution for this , and I have like 13 files on the computer
 , if I don't get them back I'll be in a big problem !!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for answering my question , I don't know what is the laptob model .. but the company is compac and the laptob is actually old , it is from 2008 , and no I didn't make any changes . As for the problem I restarted the laptob and it's still the same
 , I tried restarting it like 4 times and nothing is happening . And for restarting in safe mode I still need the mouse pointer to do this , also there is no sign-in screen , it took me directly to the home screen that contains the files and the softwares.....etc
 &nbsp;, but I can't do anything with it .</p>
<p>I can't use a different keyboard ... It's a laptob :(</p>
<p>is there any other ways to solve this , like maybe using an actual computer mouse , cause I'm using the touchpad .. please tell me if it's possible for the laptob , and also when I restart the computer this error always appears , so maybe it is related to
 the problem ...</p>

            <p>I heartily recommend against a self repair in the Xbox One.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the Xbox 360 before, the optical drive is cryptographically "married" to the console motherboard. While there had been instructions on the web for the 360 to exchange drives, the process of "marrying" the drive to the console is not fully understood, and lead to console bans and bricked consoles after a console update.&nbsp;</p><p>So I'd say a self repair is usually either not doable, or sooner or later leads to buying a new replacement console anyways, after the console has been banned/bricked.&nbsp;</p><p>If you already opened the Xbox One console, Microsoft will also not accept it for repairs anymore. So your only option then is to buy a new console.<br /></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD with mouse&#59; no option to boot to SAFE MODE in Advanced Options</h2>
                    <p>I do not know which build I have, it was an automatic update from Windows 8.1 over 2 months ago. &nbsp;Windows 10 was working fine until I watched an online video (several times), then my screen froze and restarting brought me to the BSOD with mouse (sometimes
 w/o mouse).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get into the advanced options but there is NO STARTUP SETTINGS that allows me to get into SAFE MODE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried System Restore, but I get a "drive locked" error. &nbsp;I have tried Startup Repair, no luck. &nbsp;I have even tried the "go back to the previous build" option, no luck (I forget what error I get on that one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do choose command prompt, I am brought to x: drive. &nbsp;I can switch to c: drive, but searching the internet has brought me no luck in finding any fixes to loading Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am running a Toshiba Satellite with AMD A8-6410 APU &amp; AMD Radeon R5 Graphics. &nbsp;I do not know if it updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I CANNOT log into SAFE MODE to make any changes, only command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is very appreciated!</p>

<p>I clicked the link to read the suggestions for getting into Safe Mode. &nbsp;I can do none of those. &nbsp;I have no installation media and I cannot log into Windows to perform the other two suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into recovery mode, there is NO Startup Settings listed in Advanced Options. &nbsp; INstead, it is an option to get into the bios (which I have done, I did change the screen (??) settings to boot only to the LCD, not automatic or external. &nbsp;I did not
 change the boot order as I have no boot disk or usb for Windows 10). &nbsp;(I read in another post that sometimes a dual video boot occurs and confuses the computer, however, changing this from automatic did not solve the problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither can I get into msconfig from the command prompt. &nbsp;I can get into Regedit, but can't find the video drivers to rollback, no . &nbsp;(assuming it IS the video drivers that are causing this problem.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. &nbsp;I will try to upgrade by buring the ISO file through another computer and reinstalling on the affected computer. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I could not create the ISO file, it did not save to my computer and subsequent tries ended in "There was a problem starting setup". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to save the windows 10 download to a USB, however, and used it to try to repair the Windows 10 installation. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;Tried to reinstall, both upgrade and custom, both ended in error the same error upon restarting: &nbsp;<strong>0xc000021a</strong></p>
<p>On a side note, there are 6 partitions on my hd, at least 3 are labeled Recovery, 1 Main, and 1 as System. &nbsp;(don't recall what the 6th one was labeled, could have been a recovery, also).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, still no luck in repairing the Windows 10 or recovering my Startup Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DID NOT try to format any of the partitions as I am not sure if the Windows 10 install can work by itself or has to be built upon the original Windows environment (8.1). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Event log errors</h2>
                    I came to this site looking for answers from my event log, for device manager. There was a fax machine that was installed on the 16th, and deleted thereafter.&nbsp; so my question is does everyone come here when you click EVENT LOG ONLINE HELP?&nbsp; Or even better
 what is log name-Windows Powershell, Sourse- Powershell&nbsp; id- N/A, EVENT ID 403???&nbsp; I ended up at a page that said " Access Control authorization"&nbsp;So sorry for the Intrution, I recently have incurred issues with Hacks, I can't just do nothing, but I don't know
 what to do from here. Thank you

Thank you for your response. I will do exactly as you said. And hopefully I will understand what is happening with these issues I'm greatly overwhelmed with. Thank you.

            Hi, its me Michelle, as you noticed, I have to many profiles. If I'm reported maybe Microsoft will investigate me. I'm in tears with this frustration. Before I could do anything that you advised, It was to late. They had taken over my computer for the
 second time. Have you ever had a problem that's so hard to believe, that there is no answer in any blog, there are repeated steps, of things that just are a waste of time. . To keep changing , passwords, until you decide to make yet another Email address,
 just to repeat theses steps over and over. The fact is there's no end to my security issue, until all of my device's are properly investigated by ????. I don't even know who, or how to contact the proper professionals to put an end to this harassment. I thank
 everyone who tried to help. This is someone in my home network without any permission what so ever, to have anything to do with my Internet Service. He may not be alone, but he is the intrusion that continues to harass me. I don't even know

            <p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Account Servers Not Reachable&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying the past several hours to log into my Microsoft accounts online, and only got in once.&nbsp; Unfortunately that was via an account I didn't need to change.&nbsp; When I tried to switch to another account, regardless of browser used (on a Windows 10
 PC) I get a timeout - either 503 error or just hung page after the redirect to live.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two questions:&nbsp; Why wouldn't Microsoft post status updates elsewhere online about services being down?&nbsp; What is going on specifically with the Microsoft Account page?</p>

            Sometimes these things will happen. You will just have to wait and keep periodically trying.

            Well, I am able to access the site just fine, so, its not down here and I asked a friend in the US to check and they are able to access their accouns just fine. 
<br />
<br />The following should help determine if its up or down:
<br /><a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />Back end upgrades from time to time, might cause services to be temporarily be down depending on the region.
<br />
<br />Some things you can do include:
<br />
<br /> Press Windows key + X
<br /> Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br /> At the command prompt, enter the following command, the hit Enter
<br /> ipconfig/release
<br /> then
<br /> ipconfig/renew
<br /> then
<br /> ipconfig/flushdns
<br /> exit the command prompt

<p>Thanks, Andre.&nbsp; Yesterday, I was indeed able to use the site via browser.&nbsp; However, while in account settings on my tablet, the family accounts tab indicates at the top that Microsoft accounts isn't reachable, so the info on my tablet isn't current.</p>
<p>The effect of this symptom is that when I try to change from a local account to the associated Microsoft account, the switch app tells me the target account already exists on the device so it cannot complete the change.</p>
<p>I saw a separate post on this issue indicating that you can remove such accounts via a registry key, which I did. No trace of the Microsoft account exists in the registry, yet Windows still thinks that account is on the device.&nbsp; Strangely, that account isn't
 available as a choice to log in to Windows.</p>
<p>I'm at a loss....</p>

            You could try updating your network card driver.
<br />
<br />To do this right click on your Start Menu &lt; click Device drivers&lt; click Network Adapters&lt; Right Click you adapter and click Update drivers&lt; Search Automatically for Updated Drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />You could try rolling back the Creators update for now. 
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings and click on Update &amp; Security. 
<br />
<br />Click the Recovery link on the left and then click on Get started under 'Go back to the previous version of Windows 10.

<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 are the steps that you took to fix this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</span><span><br />
<br />
There are several causes of Code 39 errors:</span></p>

<h2>            Program too big to fit in memory</h2>
                    I have just purchased a brand new laptop with windows 7 preinstalled. I am having problems installing my software. I get a "Program too big to fit in memory" error.<br />
<br />
I have checked the microsoft compatability centre and most of my software has a green tick.<br />
<br />
My laptop is a HP Pavilion DV7 2.67Ghz dual core, with 4gb memory.

            Truthfully, I would not rely on Microsoft for saying how well a third-party program works. Yes, it has a green check - but who knows what hardware they tested it on, how thoroughly they tested it, etc. I use FileMaker Pro Advanced 8.5 in OS X and when
 Leopard came out there were quirks and when Snow Leopard came out, there were more quirks (it runs but supposedly won't print - since I don't print from it, I don't care).<br />
<br />
Database programs are always prima donnas. ;-) I would post in the FileMaker Pro forums and/or check with their tech support.<br />

<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Disconnect all the external devices(Except keyboard and mouse) and see if it helps.

<p>
</p><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently came across a huge issue. I have a WindowsLive account that I used to use for all profiles that I used to create online on various websites. I am currently trying to delete some of those profiles, but I don't remember most of the passwords. And
 I cannot retrieve or change them, since everything goes to that email. I downloaded Windows Essentials so I can login to my account and when I try to recover it, it says: "<span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">Try entering your Microsoft account
 again. We don't recognize this one.</span>" I am 100% sure that account is correct, just that I have not been using it for a while. It would be great if someone could help me out here. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I tried sending an email to that account and I got the Delivery Status Notification saying that delivery has failed. Is it possible that Microsoft deleted my account? If so, is it possible to somehow get to the bottom of this and retrieve the account?&nbsp;</p>

            Define 'personalization settings'?&nbsp; You can save out your current theme in the Theme control panel and then apply that on a second machine.

            Ah.&nbsp; You mentioned Personalization settings, which to me specifically refers to the Personalization settings as found under the Settings application in the Personalization arena.&nbsp; Your questions don't seem to be about that: I'm unaware of how to copy those
 settings back and forth between machines.&nbsp; I'll defer to others here: my specialty is actual Personalization settings. :)

<p>Is there any light coming through when it's plugged into any one of the USB ports on the console? If not, then it sounds like the adapter will have to be replaced.</p>

<h2>            Black screen during Windows 10 upgrade &#40;0xC1900101 - 0x30018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm struggling with Windows 10 installation on a friend's Samsung laptop. She has a fresh install of 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium (activated) on a new SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 upgrade, which I've tried running from both a Windows DVD and the SSD, always crashes at the beginning of the second phase (installing drivers). The screen goes black (turns completely off), and the computer either restarts or stays like this
 until I restart it. After that, it restores Windows 7 and shows the&nbsp;0xC1900101 - 0x30018 error message (FIRST_BOOT, SYSPREP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried upgrading the Nvidia drivers, uninstalling them, disabling all networking, disabling all non-essential hardware devices, installing a bunch of Windows updates, everything. Nothing is plugged into the computer, except the power cord. No antivirus
 software is installed. The setup always fails in the same spot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help much appreciated!</p>
                </div>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; The windows 10 actually removed my samsung solution recovery program too :(&nbsp; My installation freezes on 2nd boot and after hours and turning off and on again I get the message that 10 couldnt install and failed in SAFE_OS boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled and it appears to be a problem with samsung laptops -mine is RV511 Windows 7.&nbsp; One cure is to remove the wireless card and download and then replace but apparently you lose wireless ability!&nbsp; Other one given is to stand ready every time the
 win 10 starts to restart and keep pressing F2, BIOS and then turn off and on again each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems mad to me, surely there is an easy way to do this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please HELP!!!</p>

<p>
