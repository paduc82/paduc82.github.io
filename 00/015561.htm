<h2>            Make It easy to uninstall softwares or apps in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello People,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows for centuries has made it a pain in the **** to uninstall a program or software or whatever you want to call it. Can windows please include a feature where you can press CTRL + the list of programs you would like to install instead having to literally
 wait hours almost verytime if you want to uninstall lets say 4 or 5 programs_. Uninstalling programs on windows pc has been the same since I was born and I would love it if the developers building windows 10 to make uninstalling programs a much easy task to
 carry. Last 2 days ago i downloaded the basic version visual studio which was over 9 gb but then i realised i was a newbie and didn't need it any more so i uninstalled it which took me more than&nbsp; hours to do then after installing it i realised the other components
 of the software hadn't been uninstalled. So I spent like another&nbsp; hours trying to uninstall all the other components like the visual C++ and .Net frameworks. This is counterproductive and has been the same since I started using windows. I personally have 3
 friends who left windows to use&nbsp; the apple's mac os x because they find it easier to use and it does not consume time doing basic stuff like uninstalling programs. If microsoft really wants go to a new direction to with Windows 10 then I will please plead
 with you guys to implement this feature</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>K.Mark</p>

            <p>Windows Apps are easy to uninstall. Right click the tile or hold your finger on it. In Win 10, you have a ... icon at the lower section of the tile. Click into that, and choose uninstall. Boom. The App is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also do this for standard Windows programs, but it's not going to uninstall components.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't think that's what you are asking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what you're saying is you want a way to queue up uninstalls. That I agree with. Coming from a desktop support background, where people would often install a grocery list of stuff they shouldn't, it would have been nice to CTRL-click all the.... stuff.....
 and just walk away. Come back 30 minutes later and done.</p>

<h2>            ByWinners.men</h2>
                    <p>My HP laptop uses windows10 and microsoft edge,&nbsp; 'protected' by widows defender. The malware ByWinners.men has infected my laptop. The malware does not appear on any searches of microsoft support pages or on the list of items on the Microsoft Windows Malicious
 Software Removal Tool Oct 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me remove this malware. I'm dubious about downloading removal tools, how can one check the authenticity or credentials?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first manifestation was a pop-up ad with a two-tone alarm siren suggesting I click on a link to claim a prize I had won. This popped up when I opened a link on the reputable 'autotrader.co.uk' web site. I carried out a Windows Defender Offline Scan,
 which came back with no threats found. The second instance was similar to the first but with a link from a google search. When I hovered the mouse over the pop-up a long link was visible which included 'ByWinners.Men'. I subsequently did a google search, which
 offered up the information that this was malware or a potentially unwanted program or adware. Some of the search results were very badly written which made me dubious about downloading the removal tools that they recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided overnight to carry out a 'system reset-keep my files', then ran the&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool, for my own peace of mind. So far today, this seems to have cleared the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to reply to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>Hi Lilo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you were unable to see your Windows Insider badge on the community page is because of too many temporary internet files in your browser's cache. To better assist you, we need the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using the same Microsoft account which you used to sign up for Windows Insider?</li><li>Have you tried posting on the community page?</li><li>Did you try to log-in and log-out from the Microsoft community page to see if your badge will appear?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, to troubleshoot the issue, we suggest deleting its browsing history by following the steps in this

            At the beginning of the macro (between the Private Sub and the If statement), add this code:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ActiveDocument.ProtectionType &lt;&gt; wdNoProtection Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Unprotect Password:=""<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
If you applied a password to the form protection, insert it between the quote marks.<br />
<br />
At the end of the macro (just before the End Sub statement), insert this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.Protect Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NoReset:=True, Password:=""<br />
<br />
Again, if you use a password, insert it between the quotes.<br />
<br />
The result is that while the macro is making changes in the table, the form will not be protected. At all other times, it will be protected.<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            When sharing a file in PowerPoint 15.35, it loads Mac Mail even though Outlook is set as default.</h2>
                    I've selected Outlook as my default email reader (using the Preferences in mac Mail). &nbsp;When I am in Word or Excel and I select File-&gt;Share-&gt;Send PDF, it opens a new email in Outlook. &nbsp; In Chrome, when I select &nbsp;"Email Page Location, it also creates a new
 email in Outlook. &nbsp;However in PowerPoint, when i do a File-&gt;Share-&gt;Send (Presentation or PDF), it opens mac Mail instead of Outlook. &nbsp;Any idea what I maybe doing wrong? &nbsp;I've rebooted my Mac, reinstalled Office from scratch (after removing all Library files

<p>Hi Phillip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, but this doesn't solve the problem as no browser is utilized during the process of sharing a file. &nbsp;I did set the Default email reader through the Mail.app preferences pane, but that works for all apps except for PowerPoint for some
 reason.</p>

<p>Judging only by what I have read you are looking for</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. omicron with psili and perispomeni</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2. iota with dasia and perispomeni</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that correct?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
(2) has a specific Unicode code at U+1F37, there is an omicron with psili at U+1F40, but there is no code point or "omicron+psili+perispomeni (which suggests to me that it is never needed in Greek).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the appearance of the perispomeni can vary from font to font - e.g. it can be a tilde ~ or the kind of "inverted breve" that your images show. So even in a typeface that has the U+1F37 character, the symbol may not look like the one you have, but
 may have a tilde (or something else) instead of the inverted breve.<br />
<br />
There are also "combining punctuation" marks for psili (U+0313), dasia (U+0314) and perispomeni (U+0342). So in theory,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;a. if your font does not have (1) but supports the combining marks, you may be able to get it by inserting an omicron (U+03BF) then a psili (U+0313) then a perispomeni (U+0342)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;b. similarly if your font does not have (2) but supports the combining marks you may be able to get (2) using an iota (U+03B9) then a dasia (U+0314), then a perispomeni (U+0342)<br />
<br />
If you have to have the shape of perispomeni you know, you might not be able to get it in the font you are using. I do not think there is a good solution in that case - I&nbsp; suppose you could see if there is a combining inverted breve at U+0311 and use that instead,
 but it might be better to find a font that had the shape you want at U+0342 and use that font for that part of the character (even though it probably won't fit properly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your font actually has both the Extended characters and the combining marks and you actually need (1), you may also be able&nbsp;to get it using U+1F40 followed by U+0342, but that does not work very well with the specific font I just tried it with.</p>

    <title>Where to get original copy of Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nethunter321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where to get original copy of Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello, I recently installed Windows 10 TP. My PC originally came with Windows 8.1. I am having problems with my PC and would like Dell to repair it. They won't touch Windows 10, so I need to install Windows 8.1 and return to factory settings. I never burnt
 a copy when I originally set up my PC. Where do I find a version of Windows 8.1 and my Activation Code? I would prefer not to pay for it. Any ideas? Thanks

            Hi Nazeem .s,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description, you configured your email account in Outlook 2016 for Mac as POP3 account and get duplicate emails. In this case, I have found
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_mac/getting-5-10-duplicate-emails-right-at-the-same/6894c1d9-2d30-468d-b3f7-b7d8ec989288">
a similar thread</a> about the duplicate emails in the Outlook 2016 for Mac with POP3 account and POP3 account may download duplicated emails. You can try to go to Accounts &gt; Advanced settings to set â€œdonâ€™t keep emails in serverâ€ to give it a shot. But, it
 should be noted that it might cause data loss and itâ€™s suggested to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/export-items-to-an-archive-file-in-outlook-for-mac-281a62bf-cc42-46b1-9ad5-6bda80ca3106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
back up</a> your data timely. Besides, for you will get a better experience by using IMAP account, if possible, itâ€™s recommended to configure your account as IMAP account.<br />
<br />
If it doesnâ€™t work for you and you really need to use POP3 account in Outlook 2016 for Mac, we suggest you try to contact your mail provider to check if there is a workaround on their side. Meanwhile, you can monitor
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_mac/getting-5-10-duplicate-emails-right-at-the-same/6894c1d9-2d30-468d-b3f7-b7d8ec989288">
this similar thread</a> to get any updates about this issue later.<br />

<h2>            Unable to get back to hotmail.com account after deleting the alias in Microsoft Account</h2>
                    Hello Good People,
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In order to create a new primary alias instead of my existing hotmail.com alias I was forced to first remove my hotmail.com alias as my primary alias, create a new alias and add back my hotmail.com alias as a secondary alias.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But once I removed my hotmail.com alias all my valuable emails and settings were permanently deleted.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Even worse, I am not able to add my hotmail.com alias as a secondary alias.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Microsoft account recovery but it denies existence of any such accounts. Also&nbsp;</span>I also tried creating a new account and it won't let me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have lost my emails and my email id. Please help me recover my emails and hotmail.com alias.</div>

The problem seemed to be some difficulty with Windows, possibly some part of Windows wasnâ€™t installed or configured properly. We finally used the Windows install disk to either repair or reinstall Windows then Windows Update to reinstall Service Pack 1 (for
 Windows 7) and all the patches. This all took some time and multiple passes through Windows Update. Finally we had a reinstalled Windows that was totally up to date. Only then did Click to Run deign to run properly.</p>

<p>Hi Lvan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for the query and we are here to assist you on this.</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my test, we can normally insert chart on our side.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you try safe mode to check the result:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac</a></p>

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the following information?</span></p>
<p><span>1. The screenshot of the bar graph.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Check if all graphs meet the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>3. When did the issue occur? Which operation have you taken before the issue occurred, such as updating Office?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>thanks for you answer.</p>
<p>- what you mean about the "bar graph"? I'm not able to show any graph at this moment ;(</p>
<p>- yes I tried in safe mode and it is exactly the same</p>
<p>- with the first graph in the list nothing happened (I'm not abe to insert them), from the tree graph it crashe when i just try to insert it</p>
<p>- I'm not also able to open files with graphs, it told me that part of the files cannot be opened (also the Excel demo files)</p>
<p>- it is difficult to say when it started. I noticed in power point that opening some presentations it asked me to install some font. Then after a while I had a problem with Word that crashed every time I changed two times the color of some text. SO I re
 installed everything going back to 2016 and no more problem with Word or PowerPoint..but I fond this problem on Excell. Now I have installed Office 2011 that works well and Office 365 only for Word and Powerpoint since in Excel I'm not able to see the graphs</p>

<p>Hi Lvan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>According to your description, I suggest you reinstall Office completely to check the result, please refer to the following article to uninstall Office:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-for-mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall Office for Mac</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still exists, could you please provide the screenshot of the â€œbar graphâ€ icon, I need to confirm how do you insert it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Qing</p>

<p>Hi Ivan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to explain that Excel didnâ€™t meet the issue when you enter Mac as a Guest, so Excel didnâ€™t have issue, it is related to the user profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the situation, weâ€™ll suggest you post a new thread in <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apple forum</a> for proper assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>

<p>Hi Qing,</p>
<p>I apologize for that but.. are you serious??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, you perfectly know that with safe mode no special font or other things are loaded and there is the problem.. only excel has the problem..</p>
<p>you perfectly know that for example you &nbsp;office save data and in the user settings.. (when I re install office he remember the previous account)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>and you tell me to ask to apple??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you mean the cost of "Numbers" ??</p>
<p>

<h2>            Freeform tool not snapping to grid</h2>
                    The freeform tool is not snapping to the grid, even when I have the 'snap to grid' option selected.&nbsp; I've tried also pressing the alt key, but this did not work either.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

<p>Freeforms don't snap to the grid. I don't know if Word has guides that you can turn on or not, sorry. I guess an alternative would be to create your own grid using lines, then the freeform shape should snap to that as you draw.</p>
<p>I know, it's not ideal. Just trying to offer *something* that might help.</p>

    <title>How can I make my current email account the default in Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrmusiccsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make my current email account the default in Outlook 2010&#59; the button to do so is grayed out when the account is highlighted.</h2>
                    I recently switched from my ISP's own mail program (which is essentially gmail) back to Outlook 2010, as I am more familiar with it and also use it at my college.&nbsp; I am receiving mail OK through my present email address, and have (I thought) deleted my
 email address at a previous ISP.&nbsp; However, I seem to have two problems: (1) I can't get rid of the old email address in the Navigation Pane, and I frequently get an error message saying the program can't locate the .pst file associated with the old address
 (I know---I deleted that file).&nbsp; (2) If I try to make my current email address the default, when I highlight the current address in the account settings, the button to make it the default is grayed out (also, the old address is still listed on that screen).&nbsp;
 How can I get rid of the old address once and for all, and make the current one the default?

<h2>            Send Mail via Outlook to gmail MsoNormal Class Issue</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Maâ€™am</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to raw your attention toward my little issue on the email templates send to Gmail on Android via Outlook 2016.
</p>
<p>I did googled for the solution but all my efforts wasted due to Gmail on Android. A paragraph is being added each TD in the table with Class MsoNormal. I also tried to add css mediaqueries and hard code the style in the TD. &nbsp;I did inspected using developer
 tool and I found that the inline style added is being removed from the td.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Original Source: </strong></p>
<p>&lt;tr&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;td align="center" height="15" style="line-height:1; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 1px;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compiled source: </strong></p>
<p>&lt;tr style="height:22.5pt"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;td style="padding:0in 0in 0in 0in;height:22.5pt"&gt;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/td&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;/tr&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compiled CSS in </strong><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">user agent stylesheet</span>
<strong>inspected via developer tool:</strong></p>
<p>p {</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; display: block;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -webkit-margin-before: 1em;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -webkit-margin-after: 1em;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -webkit-margin-start: 0px;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -webkit-margin-end: 0px;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Please help me to get rid of the MsoNormal class added to the email templates sent via outlook 2013 or 2016 by inserting the page as text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward for your valuable solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>For possible resolution regarding <strong>MsoNorma</strong>l concern, you can try adding this style (<strong>&lt;tr style="line-height: 25%"&gt;</strong>) to every TR (table row) where the image is.</p>

 however the images also display as attachments, is there a way to get around this in outlook 2010 I know that in 2013 it doesn't happen because I sent to a outlook 2013 as well. I have read a few articles already and from what I found there is nothing that
 can be done unless I over read something. Can Somebody please help

<h2>            contact group won&#39;t include some people I add</h2>
                    I formed a "group" but when I added a few members, it says on the side "send email, 4 of 5 members". What can I do to have everyone in the group receive the email? I am using hotmail if that matters. Thank you.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer the following question so that we can help you.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>How are you trying to access Outlook.com? Are you using a browser or mail client?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Does the issue occur when you use a different&nbsp;computer or browser?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is the issue specific to a particular group?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do other Microsoft accounts encounter the same issue?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>One of the possible reasons why you are encountering this problem is that there are corrupted cache/cookies/browsing history stored in your browser. As an initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you clear your browser's cache/cookies/browsing
 history.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Letâ€™s try to clear them using the following steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Internet&nbsp;Explorer</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously and click&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Google Chrome</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously and click&nbsp;<strong>Clear Browsing Data</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>For&nbsp;<strong>Firefox</strong>:&nbsp;Press&nbsp;<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+DEL</strong>&nbsp;simultaneously&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>Clear Now.<br />
</strong>(other browsers are similar)</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you are using Internet Explorer (IE), you may need to&nbsp;<strong><span>run it in â€œNo Add-Onsâ€ mode</span></strong>.&nbsp;This will totally eliminate the idea that the performance problems and errors you are experiencing is not due
 to your browser.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To Open Internet Explorer in No- Add- on Mode follow the step below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and then type â€œ<strong>iexplore -extoff</strong>â€ without quotes and press
<strong>ENTER. </strong></span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: There is space after <strong>
iexplore</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if issue persists, if no then add-ons may be causing the error.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may try the steps provided in the article to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</span></span></p>

<h2>            In the Outlook Web App, I repeatedly get a message &#34;Your session has expired&#34;</h2>
                    <p>In the Outlook Web App, I repeatedly get a message "Your session has expired" I'm using Office 365 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. It's not after being inactive or with a specific email address (I use several within OWA.) It often happens several times while I'm working. There's a Sign Out button but if I click that, it doesn't ask
 me to sign in so I have to open Outlook Web App from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have an easy workaround, which is to hit Escape and then it lets me work again, but since it happens so repeatedly, it's very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>

<p>I have done all of the steps and problem is not solved. &nbsp; This became a problem suddenly as I did not have this problem previously with exact same system configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do not have IE on my PC but I still followed the instructions to change default browser to IE and no change in the problem. &nbsp;I use chrome. &nbsp;Where is the MS fix for windows 10 users?</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I had the same problem and it was driving me crazy.</p>
<p>I have outlook 2016 on windows 10.</p>
<p>After uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it.</p>
<p>I had tried everything for the last month no go.</p>
<p>I'd even tried the fix on the link below no go.</p>
<p>but then I read it properly-Method 3- you have to get the registry key from another computer.</p>
<p>This works straight away, I found a computer with office 2013 on it and exported the key from it.</p>
<p>Imported into my computer,&nbsp; changed the .html key to htmlfile and the .htm key to htmfile</p>
<p>and started office 2016 and jumped up yelling.. IT WORKED!!!</p>
<p>Now hyperlinks work in emails and even pdf files view in the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/310049/hyperlinks-are-not-working-in-outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>below is the registry key I imported:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.html]<br />
@="htmlfile"<br />
"Content Type"="text/html"<br />
"PerceivedType"="text"<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\.html\OpenWithProgIds]<br />
