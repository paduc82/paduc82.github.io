<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 Feature Update 1803- &#40;X58 Rampage II Extreme with a Intel Xeon X5650&#41;</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I've tried installing this update all three different ways. First by using Windows Update second using the Windows Upgrade Assistant and even tried using the Media Creation Tool to attempt a clean install. All have been unsuccessful. The first two
 ways the computer will go about business as usual until it ask to restart, which it does but then it will sit at the blue windows logo. no spinning circles, no HDD activity lights, no RAM activity lights or anything. I've left it like this for hours trying
 both ways. Now with the Media Creation Tool windows will load the USB. I can see slight HDD activity and some RAM activity but about 10 minutes in that will stop and it just sits there at the blue windows logo like the above methods indefinitely. I should
 note I am currently on Windows 10 Pro 1709, The system is a X58 Rampage II Extreme with a Intel Xeon X5650 it uses BIOS not UEFI. It's sad i can't even reinstall to force this update. Are any other experiencing this? Any help with this issue would be much
 appreciated.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Error 0x80246008&#58; Cannot Update Windows, Background Intelligent Transfer Service Will Not Start</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, I have tried multiple "solutions" but with no success. I receive Error 0x80246008 after attempting and failing to install Windows Updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out that the BITS (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) isn't running and tried to start that up (manually through services.msc and through command prompt). However, I ended up with another error 2147942402. I checked the Windows Event Logger
 (apparently required for BITS) and it has been up and running. I have also tried disabling BITS and then setting BITS to automatically start up but also with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other attempts at fixing this problem include Troubleshooting Windows Update (ended up with no errors) and using sfc /scannow (had no corrupt files and integrity problems).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried pacmanisback's solution (link below) but did not work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I had upgraded with Norton 360 from Windows 8.1 to Norton Security in Windows 10. It was a corrupt installation of Norton so I uninstalled it (had to use the removal tool as removing it from Programs and Features was bugged). Currently using Eset Smart
 Security 8. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a similar problem to this post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/update-and-bits-service-problems/5a623894-d05e-4360-aacc-bb2d9241948a</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother's computer also has upgraded to Windows 10 (also had Norton and same corrupt problems with Norton). However, he can update his version of Windows 10 without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be nice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: Solved all Windows Update problems by reverting back to Windows 8.1 and then re-upgrading to Windows 10. This time, I uninstalled Norton before upgrading to Windows 10. Windows Update now works after the upgrade and BITS is running! Took a long time
 though... -_-</p>
<p>

            <p>Just the same Problem with the computer of a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was running Windows 8.1 - unfortunately with Norton ( I hate this program since XP - lot of troubles!).</p>
<p>Personally opinion:&nbsp; Norton security gives you the security to run into problems ... :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows 10 installed ok</p>
<p>2. Flickering of CRT after Logon - endless</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; ctr + alt + del&nbsp; --&gt; taskmanager </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Autostart --&gt; disable Norton</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; start explorer.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;--&gt; und Programs(32-Bit) -- rename Norton-directory (e.g. add an x to security)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; restart the computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; you have a working system (w.o. Norton), run the removal tool from Norton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; restart the computer again</p>
<p>3. Your system will still have another Norton-Program (Norton Download-Manager).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable it in Autostart.</p>
<p>4. Now i have problems with Microsoft Update - Error 0x80246008</p>
<p>5. Unfortunately Microsoft Fix-It (for Windows 8.1) does not help. It fixes '<span>service registration missing' but the error still occurs.</span></p>
<p>Do you have any advice?&nbsp; Pls help. Thanks in advance.&nbsp; Stefan</p>

<p>This would be a highly effective method of causing serious and long-term damage to your relationship. What would you have done if your father had opened your letters and snooped in your bedroom to find out what you were up to? Breaking into someone else's
 account is a serious breach of trust.</p>

            There is no way to access the account without either knowing the password or resetting it through your admin account.<br />
<br />
You may want to look into some third party family safety software - try searching for "Family Safety computer software" or "Computer Parental Controls" for a few - although I cannot recommend any particularly.<br />
<br />
It is good to keep an idea on your child's activity absolutely but it is best to go about it open and honestly as Frederik Long has said. Discussing things like online safety will encourage your child to talk with you if they actually run into any problems
 online. From working with children for a long time I know only too well that if they found out someone had been in their account without them knowing it would shut down all lines of communication - meaning worst case scenario they may not want to let you know
 if they really ran into problems...

<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Griefers... Good grief&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was so happy to have the new Minecraft update that made it so you could set it to invite only &amp; not allow friends of friends. It goes a long way to stop griefing in Minecraft. However, since then I've still been griefed twice. Both times, by players I
 never invited into my world...</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The 1st time occurred by a "friend of a friend" who poured lava onto the top of my ski lodge...</p>
<p>The 2nd time occurred by a friend who's account was being used by a friend of his. Most of my town from the pirate ship to the grocery store, supply store, tool shed, home, snow tower, lighthouse, &amp; various friends' homes were all burned to the ground. My
 brother was online at the time &amp; accidentally saved before he knew what was going on... We're in the process of rebuilding now, which is a very arduous task.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The point I'm getting at is how did they get into the game despite the settings &amp; why do people do this? What's the point? Where's the satisfaction? Are they jealous of the great things I build? It just doesn't seem to make sense to me &amp; bothers me greatly
 that someone will go out of their way to destroy all the hard work that people like myself put into this game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Thoughts? Opinions? Comments? Criticisms? Ideas?</p>

<p>Hey everyone. Yeah I'm careful of who I have on my friends list. I'm real nice too. A friend of a friend who is not on my friends list joined the game on the weekend and griefed my world. Good thing my friend came to rescue my buildings which had been set
 on fire with lava. There wasn't too much damage. I'm keeping a closer eye on who is on my map. Only have one active map which I've put a lot of effort into with help from several friends. If you grief in my world or are nasty, you'll get kicked out and an
 unhappy rep rating and muted. I might even attack you wearing iron armour and an iron sword or something with my dogs too. If you want to grief, do so on a blank map not on a world someone has put their heart into.</p>

<p>In the last game update, theres an option to either allow friends of friends or not. Or you can use the invite only but this option could label you anti-social. I know some of my friends set their games to this and I would have to message them to see if
 I could join if I wanted to. I don't use the kicking out feature a lot while on my world. Only use it when someone's bad mean or joins when I don't want them to. I know some people abuse this feature of kicking people out especially in some xbox live parties.
 Yeah maybe they're jealous or aren't really civilized. You don't have to be an adult to be mature.</p>

<p>I personally have a world just for me, which I don't let anyone join, not even close friends. My other world on the other hand is for friends/friends of friends to join and build freely. If they grief then it's no biggie.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest if your inviting people to your game your not sure about, save the game before you invite them and turn auto save off. Allowing you to return to a un-damaged world if required.<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 Rights Database Storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ironicear979  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Rights Database Storage</h2>
                    I got a new Xbox 360, did a license transfer, and redownloaded everything and it went smoothly, but I noticed that the "Rights Database" file was stored under my USB flash drive that was plugged in. If for whatever reason this Xbox breaks down and I buy
 another console, would there be any issues if I did a license transfer while I had my USB flash drive plugged in that other console or would it work fine and just overwrite the file? Would there also be any issues if I did the transfer without the USB flash
 drive in, and then plug the USB flash drive that contained the Right Database file in after?

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as I know the rights are fetched from Xbox Live and your Xbox Live Account itself. So it shouldn't matter if the USB drive is available or not. I assume it will only use the file(s) with the most recent date etc. So it should work just fine</p>

<p>As far as I know (and I might be wrong, since I don't work for Microsoft, and they might have changed stuff around), but the Rights Database is just for Media files with some Digital Rights Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual game licenses are stored in a hidden partition that shouldn't be visible to the normal user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as WPAK already said: In case your console breaks, simply do a license transfer again, and re-download the games, as the license ownership is mainly stored on the Microsoft Xbox Online servers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the game is already stored on your console, the console will only download the small license file and store it in the hidden partition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there IronicEar979, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in Xbox Forums.&nbsp;I understand there is a concern on game licenses. You can use your Xbox profile on different consoles. As long as you know your account credentials (email &amp; password), all purchases will be available once you
 log into the account. Your Microsoft account is the same for both the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One console. Check out the following articles:</p>

<p>
</p><p>HP driver update for HP Laserjet Professional CM1410 Series PCL 6 - Error 0x80240017</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is I've never had one of these printers, and I can't work out how to turn this update off, or block it, or whatever.</p>

            <p>I found a workaround for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After NVIDIA <strong>finally</strong> publicly posted the <strong>same</strong> driver version that Microsoft was apparently trying to load, I downloaded and installed it. As usual, the NVIDIA installation was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THEN</strong>, I deleted all files and folders under <strong>%windir%\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong> and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After logging back in, I opened&nbsp;the dialog for Windows Update,&nbsp;manually ran "Check for updates" and all was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved until another driver update is released.<br />
<br />
It is <strong>STILL</strong> utterly ridiculous that Microsoft has removed the ability to&nbsp;<strong>disable INDIVIDUAL updates</strong>!</p>

    <title>Keyboard shortcut for switching monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteroy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard shortcut for switching monitors</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 monitors connected to my system, one of them is on the desk for when I am sitting down to use the computer and the second monitor is on the wall infront of my bed so I can watch movies and play games while I am in my bed, I never use both of the
 same at the same time, I either use the one on the desk or the one on the wall, never both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish there was a keyboard shortcut that can switch between the monitors quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now in Windows Vista to switch main monitors I have to do this: Go to display settings, select the monitor I want to be primany, and then turn off the monitor I don't want to use, then it gives me 15 seconds to say yes or no about the new display settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could do it quickly with a keyboard shortcut like Windows Key + M or something.</p>

<p>It isn't available in Vista and iI coudl find no 3rd party add-ons that offered that option.&nbsp; Here'a an article on how to create your own keyboard shortcuts in Vista:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/74063-keyboard-shortcut.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/74063-keyboard-shortcut.html</a>.&nbsp; The problem is that I don't know what program is used to switch between the monitors - if we could discover that, we
 could create our own hotkey.&nbsp; I'll keep lookig but I've been searching for a while now and haven't found anything.&nbsp; Try giving it a shot yourself.</p>
<p>Try downloading Process Monitor <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx</a>&nbsp;and see if that helps identify the location of the changes being made and/or the programs being run when you change monitors the ordinary way.&nbsp; Perhap we'll find the controlling program or maybe
 the registry key responsible for this behavior.&nbsp; I don't know if it will help, but it may be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</p><p>Started with Windows-7. Showed as "Genuine" in Control-panel activation window.</p>
<p>Had been showing "Genuine" for over 2 years.</p>
<p>Upgraded to free Windows-10 this week. All went good. And showed as "Genuine" in Settings.</p>
<p>I didn't like Windows-10, selected to revert back to my Windows-7.</p>
<p>Completed, it's back on Windows-7. And now shows "Not Genuine"</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives? Why should I run anything or reply to anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello Microsoft. Can someone speak up here.</p>

            <p>You can reactivate your genuine Windows Vista installation by performing the following:</p>
<p>1. Click on the Start button and in the Start Search box type in:&nbsp; <strong>slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<p>2. Press the Enter key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>3. Select your Country.</p>
<p>4. Follow the instructions for phone activation (no charge).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When you call that number, you will first hear an Automated Voice. If the Automated Voice gives you an option to talk to a<br />
Live Activation Rep, select that option. If not, do not enter any numbers. This should force the Automated Voice to transfer you to<br />
a Live Activation Rep. Trying to activate thru the Automated Voice will not work, in your case, only thru the Live Activation Rep<br />
will your activation be successful.</p>

<p>If it's about another players conduct over Xbox live then I don't believe you can contact them, the best thing to do is file a complaint on the players through the consoles reporting feature and block communications.</p>

            no answer then? Store does not work, keyboard and trackpad intermittently stop working, gestures don't work and I cant update the OS to try and sort it out. Back to a chromebook I think, turn it on, works. Or maybe I'll see if I can get linux up and running
 on this little 2 in 1 thing. &nbsp;What a load of bull this 'fantastic' new windows is. Its just another bloated load of microsoft rubbish.

Are you kidding??? You linked me to "when will I get my free upgrade"1? I have a problem with Win 10 just upgraded, it don't want to restart to finish installation of the UPDATE. Is this understandable? A code of error is&nbsp;0x8024a112. Thanks for further help

            ASWIN_ANAND did you even read the OP's question?? He is having problems with Windows Update (as are we!)... not installing WIN10. &nbsp;Both links you provided are worse than useless... they are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Nothing worse than support that doesn't listen to the original questions and simply replies with canned responses as it wastes everyone's time.<br />
<br />
Your non-working OS tells us to search this code [0x8024a112] as I have windows updates piling up... and this is the run around we get.<br />
<br />
Quite simply Windows Update cannot restart to install updates

<h2>            Skype for W10 - Skype takes time to refresh the conversation when it is not in focus</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning All,</p>
<p>I hope you are well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently switched back to Classic Skype because the new one still has some issues (and totally feels like I'm beta testing it).</p>
<p>So here's another piece of feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second most annoying issue I have with it, is the new notification system in Windows 10: Skype seems to work with push notifications now, so there is a service receiving those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when I click on the notification and Skype opens, it looks like it was sleeping, and takes several seconds to load the messages I just saw on the push notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same seems to happen when I switch virtual desktops: Skype stays frozen until I release CTRL+Win, then it starts refreshing conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I'm asking is to have a user experience that matches Classic Skype or its competitors - Hipchat, Slack, Whatsapp, Telegram, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can a new product, based on a well-working classic, be this worse than its predecessor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Stefano</p>

            <p>Hi Emma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the detailed information about this issue and I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to corruption in the Adobe folder. I would like to know if you have tried to open the application in Safe Mode. If yes, then were you able to open the application or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try re-install Adobe Creative Cloud and check if it works for you. This is to check if the issue is caused due to any Adobe application folder corruption or not.</p>
<p>

            Failure to install an operating system is usually caused by (in order of probability):<br />
<br />
1. Installation media that is the wrong disc for your computer. What version of XP is the computer licensed for and what type of XP installation CD are you using?<br />
<br />
2. Faulty installation media. Check the installation CD/DVD for scratches, smudges. Test in another machine.<br />
<br />
3. You are attempting to install with other devices connected to the computer. Disconnect them before trying to do an installation.<br />
<br />
4. Faulty optical drive. Test with another bootable CD/DVD or swap it out for a known-working one.<br />
<br />
5. Faulty RAM. Test with Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. Burn the file with third-party burning software* - as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made
 (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.<br />
<br />
*It is not necessary to have third-party burning software in Windows 7 since Win7 can natively burn an .iso. Other operating systems require it. A good free choice is ImgBurn from
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.imgburn.com</a> .<br />
<br />
6. Faulty hard drive. Test with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. Burn the file with third-party burning software (unless you have Windows 7, which can burn .isos natively)
 - as an image, not as data. Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.<br />
<br />
7. Other hardware components are faulty.

    <title>Run DLL Error in main.cpl Missing Entry &#40;keyboard related&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Run DLL Error in main.cpl Missing Entry &#40;keyboard related&#41;</h2>
                    For quite a long time now on my 64-bit Vista system, I have been unable to open keyboard properties.&nbsp; Its icon does not show up in the control panel and I cannot run it through Microsoft Keyboard (which came when I installed the Intellitype Drivers)
<br />
<br />
When I try to run main.cpl from the command line, I get only mouse settings. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Main.cpl does the same here, only opens mouse.<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

If needed install or reinstall the Intellitype (and Intellipoint if not latest) Software and Drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

Intellipoint and Intellitype - get both as needed<br />

            <p>If this is your scanner, it appears it isnt compatible - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Canon+CanoScan+D660U+Scanner&amp;v=Canon&amp;uid=0772A002&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=3&amp;pi=9&amp;s=Canon&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
