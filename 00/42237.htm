<h2>            How to  Enable auto popup dialog when device has been plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I use windows 10 on my Acer Aspire E1-572, and I currently have a headset with a microphone. Previously I did not use a microphone, so I told the message that appears when you insert something into a headphone jack not to appear. How do I re-open this message?</p>

<h2>            How can I check in windows 10 if I have an OEM version of windows or a retail version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to upgrade my old computer, and want to change out the motherboard as it is starting to act up and not working correctly anymore (its 6+ years old) and then upgrade the other components. And I noticed in another post(about windows 7) that
 if I wanted to do that I would need a retail version of windows and not an OEM. I noted that it said the product - ID would look like this if it was an OEM in windows 7:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">xxxxx-xxx-xxxxxxx-xxxxx, and the
 group of three would say OEM. How does this apply to windows 10, as my product - ID looks like this: xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx, (the last group containing two letters at the start and the version is Windows 10 Pro, if that helps identifying anything)?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Edit: The old pc had Vista running on it from the start, I do not know if it was an OEM or retail version of Vista, but then upgraded using a windows 8 box that said it was a windows 8 upgrade and required
 a previous version of windows to use, came with a CD, key and some other helpfull information. In that case, does using an upgrade box of windows 8, make an OEM into a retail and therefore transferable to another motherboard?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And if I may be so frank to add a last question, if this is a retail version, and I upgrade the motherboard, can I just plug in my SSD or HDD that holds the windows files, install the drivers for everything,
 and it will boot up or do I have to do a clean install with either the mediatool or the windows 8 upgrade CD?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for reading, and any answers would help as I am quite stuck on the matter and my knowledge regarding it is quite small and new.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Kind regards,</span></p>

            <p>Hi. It will certainly work when clean installing onto a new hard drive/SSD. (I've done that too &amp; I had OEM Win 7) Vista was never part of the free upgrade route so it's all based on your copy of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a thought I'm sure that if you <em>have </em>to use the full route after a new MB right back to Vista then you can use the Windows 8 upgrade disk and it will ask to verify the previous system. At that point you just put the Vista disk in the drive
 (or possibly input the key) and the process will check it and then ask for the upgrade disk again. I've never done it so I'm not absolutely sure but that method has been used for upgrade systems in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

            I had this same exact problem and learned the way to fix it. I found that platform update KB2670838 has issues with AMD drivers at the current time. I found that uninstalling update KB2670838 corrected this issue. After uninstalling, best hide updates
 KB2670838 and IE 10. When installing IE 10, it also installs platform update KB2670838.

<h2>            Three parallel Skype accounts</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I had trouble with password reset and then tried to change my primary email address.<br />
<br />
Now I have three parallel Skype accounts as a result.<br />
<br />
I am frustrated and do not understand what is going wrong.<br />
<br />
I want one account and tied to the one outlook address that I actually use.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help me sort this out?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hi Leo
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Since October 2016, Skype accounts are now linked to Microsoft Accounts just like other Microsoft Services such as OneDrive. Due to this change, it is no longer possible to delete your Skype account without also closing your Microsoft Account. 
<br />
<br />The best thing you can do is no longer sign into that account and use the available options of transferring your contacts and credits to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If you wish to continue:
<br />
<br />Before you close your Microsoft account, let's make sure you aren't leaving anything important relating to Skype behind:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to Skype.  
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />    Follow the steps in this article to verify that: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12412</a>
<br />
<br />        Important information such as files and contacts are saved.
<br />        Your Skype Credit balance has been used. Once your account is closed, you can't get it back. 
<br />        Active subscriptions have been cancelled so you donít continue to get charged. If you have Auto-recharge enabled and cancel your account without first cancelling your subscription, you will continue to be charged until your account has been permanently closed in 60 days. Learn how to disable Auto-recharge.
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/faq/FA633</a>
<br />
<br />You can close your Microsoft account by following these steps:
<br />
<br />    Go to our Microsoft account closure page (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523898</a>). You may be prompted to sign in or verify your password.
<br />    Make sure you are signed in to the Microsoft account you want to close and select Next. 
<br />    In the Select a reason drop-down list, choose the reason you're closing the account. 
<br />    Select Mark account for closure.
<br />    Your Microsoft account will be closed in 60 days. We wait 60 days before permanently deleting accounts in case you change your mind or need to access something before it's gone. You can change your mind any time during the 60 days, just sign in (<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/myaccount</a>) to cancel the closure. 
<br />
<br />Here steps for doing both:
<br />
<br />Transfer contacts:
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12158/how-do-i-transfer-contacts-from-one-skype-account-to-another" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12158/how-do...</a>

<br />
<br />If you still need help:
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:

            Hi  Leo
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should use your Skype ID to login not mail ID. I am assuming that you have three Skype IDs under one Microsoft account.

<h2>            How to remove emails from server &#42;after&#42; downloading to Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I set up a Windows Live Mail account to download old emails from our voicemail server (Allworx). However, I neglected to deselect the option to leave the emails on the server, and now I cannot redownload/delete the 3000+ old emails. Has anyone run into
 this? And how do you fix it? Thanks!

<div>If you don't have access to the server by other means, one way to achieve what you want is to move all the downloaded files to a user-defined folder under storage folders for safe keeping. Then while working offline, remove the account (right-click on
 the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Remove account...</em>). Close down WLMail, wait a few minutes while the program does its housekeeping, then re-launch it. Check that you're still operating offline and add the account back again. This time,
 deselect the option to <em>Leave a copy of messages on the server </em>on the <em>
Advanced </em>tab of the account's <em>Properties </em>sheet. Then <em>Go online</em> and<em>Send/Receive
</em>for the account in question. All the messages should be downloaded again, this time for good. When you're sure it's worked, you can delete one set.</div>

            Hi Bradley
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />If you did not set up that forwarding, someone may have accessed your account. For security, I would recommend that you change your password.

<br />
<br />Regarding the call, may I ask if you have tried blocking those numbers?

<br />
<br />You may also want to check your call forwarding settings and remove that call forwarding:

<h2>            Windows 10 64 Bit Auto Recovery fails to run</h2>
                    My computer was messed up after I installed Fix It Utilities. Since then, Explorer freezes and crashes and prevents other programs from running until it reopens. It almost seems that the processor is over loaded. I use AVG Ultimate and it shows my system
 is free from Viruses. Any idea how I can rebuild Windows 10 64 Bit without destroying my content since the "Automatic " system fails to initiate and run?

            HI PaulB60047 ... try running a repair upgrade.
<br />This will not remove apps or data from your PC.
<br />But do a backup of your data just in case.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do this.

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            No matter what i did or what function i ran, every option to repair, rebuild or restore failed. After trying to restore to an earlier retore point it now says No operating system is found. I guess all I can do at this point is get another hard drive and
 use this one as an extra drive and try to transfer some of its files to the new drive after i get the operating system on the new drive. Unless someone has any other ideas.&nbsp;

    <title>Can I push out Windows10 via Active Directory in a domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billmangot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I push out Windows10 via Active Directory in a domain</h2>
                    <p>I have over 400 PCs over 6 US states. It's not reasonable to have to go to each and every one and logon to do an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I download a single copy of Windows10 and then use Active Directory to push it out to my OEM Windows 7 PCs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conversely, can I download a single copy of Windows10 and then create a bootable thumb drive to do the install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If either of these scenarios is possible, will a unique SID be installed on each PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Clean boot&#47;upgrade fails</h2>
                    I was running Windows 10 for last two years after getting free upgrade from Microsoft. Since my system was corrupted, I tried to reinstall Windows 10 Clean boot. But clean boot refused to accept windows 7 key which was accepted in Windows 7. Upgrade also
 refused. The customer care officer by name Sonali washed her hands. She seems to be inefficient.

<p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft changed the Windows 10 installer disc accept Windows 7 or 8.1 keys. This allowed users to perform a clean install Windows 10 and enter a valid Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 key during installation. Windows 10 would then report that key to Microsoft’s servers,
 and Windows 10’s actiation servers would give your PC a “digital entitlement” (now a “digital license”) to continue using Windows 10 for free, just as if you had upgraded. We found a Forum Article that can help you in resolving you issue. Please check Andre
 Da Costa's resolution on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-install-and-activate-windows-10-using-your/d713f9f9-e91f-4ffe-a3c0-7ef9639a0559">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you

<h2>            Windows 8.1 APPS CLOSE</h2>
                    <p>Why Windows Apps in Windows 8.1 don't close automatically and remain open in Task Manager??<br />
Is that a problem??</p>

            <p>I've noticed this too on my Surface RT tablet. It seems like performance under 8.1 is as good as it used to be prior to the update. Like you, I noticed that when I drag apps from the top to bottom to close them, they still show up in task manager as running.
 That never used to be the case. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is also rather annoying from a usability stand point. Before, when I was done browsing in IE, I'd just drag it to the bottom and close it. Then when I open IE again it would pop up to my homepage because I am starting a new instance again. But, now when
 I drag IE to the bottom to close it, I then go to open it again and because the process never terminated I am right back to my original session instead of my homepage. That's not ideal because there may be instances where I wanted to close IE because I was
 done with that website, or&nbsp;it was acting up on me, etc.</p>

            Thank you for that. That was a bit of a nuisance. Just keep it held at the bottom of the page for about 3 seconds until it flips and release and it fully closes. Awesome!

<h2>            Transcript of Skype Messaging required for pending Court Case</h2>
                    <p>I have been defrauded of 10,000 Br Pnds and my appointed lawyers are now seeking to have the amount refunded plus interest etc.</p>
<p>The centre of the case is likely to be the Skype messaging that occurred between me and the alleged fraudsters and the company they represented.
</p>
<p>These messages were deleted from my machine by my former employer before I could get a copy.</p>
<p>How do I get these messaging files? Can you help please?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Merged second Harddrive with Music Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ckorkows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merged second Harddrive with Music Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am in desperate need of help. &nbsp;I am using Windows 8.1 (the free upgrade from 8) and this is on the typical desktop page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new Asus computer with an SSD as the primary hard drive and a second terabyte hard drive. &nbsp;I was attempting to move my Music, Downloads, and Documents folders (from the This PC location) to the second harddrive, D:. &nbsp;I successfully moved my Documents
 folder by using the location tab under Properties, but when I followed the same steps for my music folder something odd happened. &nbsp;I got a warning message that the two locations would merge and this would be permanent (or something along those lines). &nbsp;I actually
 must admit that I wasn't reading the message very fully and only realized that I shouldn't click the Yes button after I had already clicked it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now my music folder pulls up everything just like my D: drive does - it's like they are now one and the same. &nbsp;But the D: drive itself still exists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to correct this error. &nbsp;I know that the message was one warning that this was a permanent change but I also know that sometimes there are ways to work around that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I cannot remember the exact error message that popped up. &nbsp;I know it mentioned something about if I merged these two folders it would be irreversible. &nbsp;Which is never a good sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually added some more folders to my second hard drive and they are not showing up under my music folder (which is now called Documents?). &nbsp;It was explained to me at work that Libraries cannot be moved from hard drive to hard drive but instead are like
 groups of categorized files from both drives. &nbsp;You can correct me if that is wrong too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem (after using the computer for a little longer) seems to be that both of my libraries: music (which is now also called downloads but has the music icon) and downloads hold my EA folder. &nbsp;If I delete it from one it disappears from the other - and
 then is essentially gone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I essentially want to use the second hard drive for all of my documents, pictures, music, and such. &nbsp;Using my SSD (the C Drive) for the OS and a game that I play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't know if this is a problem or just a pesky mistake that I have to live with.</p>

<p>When I went&nbsp;to move the Pics, Videos, Downloads folders I noticed the Downloads and Desktop had become the same...ie: two Downloads with the same location.</p>

            <p>Thanks Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestion of a new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially it set up OK.</p>
<p>The folders listed under "This PC" were as they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then moved the target for Downloads to my E drive and that worked OK.</p>
<p>When I moved the target for Documents to the E drive, I get 2 'Desktop' folders listed under "This PC"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, one has the desktop icon for the folder and the other has the documents icon but if I click on either, they both act the same and show me the contents of the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a workaround by creating a shortcut link to the real targets and put them under My Favorites so I can quickly access the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still a bit annoying though.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. You may run SFC scan and check if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>See: <span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is it Windows 8 or Windows 8.1?</span></p>
<p />

            <p>Thanks Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the SFC scan, nothing out of the ordinary reported.</p>
<p>The version I am using is 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be a bit polarised after using XP for so many years but I honestly think W7 and W8 are not quite living up to expectation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They have some nifty little features but achieving even some of the most basic tasks is frustrating at best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a bugger of a time trying to get a network connection to my old MAC to stay mapped and I have now had three "blue screens" with complete shutdown and loss of work and the system is only 2 weeks old! Not a promising start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a little bit more time spent on developing a stable platform would have been a far better investment than say the silly home screen or apps etc. Seriously, I don't think I know anyone who uses W7 or W8 who hasn't installed classic shell or similar
 to give them better access and control of what is going on. Surely MS'S own feedback must support this....I would be shocked if it didn't.</p>

            It looks like it is an external USB drive.<br />
<br />
Try starting up the Disk Manager (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "diskmgmt.msc").&nbsp; You should see your disk in the list of devices.&nbsp; If it does not have a drive letter assigned, you can right-click on the device then select "Chang Drive Letter...".<br />

    <title>Unable to Install Sea Of Thieves on Solid State Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshuasmith3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Install Sea Of Thieves on Solid State Drive</h2>
                    <p>I had Sea of Thieves installed on my harddrive, but the load times were slow so I wanted to switch it to my solid state drive. I took the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstalled Sea of Thieves</li><li>Navigated to the microsoft store and selected install</li><li>Selected C: drive (which is my ssd) as the install location</li><li>After completing the download I get the error:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(81, 79, 67, 1)">"Couldn't
 install. We'll retry shortly".</span></li></ol>
<p>I've
 attempted this twice with no luck. It's a large download so it takes a long time to retry, I'm hoping for an easy resolution to get this installed on my C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Josh</p>

            Hi Josh, 
<br />
<br />I will tell you, you are not the only one having issues installing this game. 
<br />
<br />Try to reset the store first. Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Microsoft Store - advanced options then reset. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work, maybe we should try to CCleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/download</a>
<br />
<br />Once you download/install - they have a registry clean up tool. Run that until there are no issues left. It’s possible having it installed before left something behind in the registry. Reboot and try to reinstall. 
<br />
<br />I’ll keep looking for other solutions, but get started with these first. 
<br />
<br />- C
