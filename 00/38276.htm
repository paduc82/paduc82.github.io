<h2>            Get access to VM machine on Hyper-V from login screen of Host PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought W10 pro last week. I've set up some VM's for whom i had some older Windows keys for.
</p>
<p>My question is, i want to use these VM's as a sort of user. Because my real Local user accounts have important software that i want to keep seperate (like one is a home studio, since it will almost never use the internet after set up the risk of it getting
 infected or something is low) . I used W10 home before with 2 users, one pulled in something that clogged up my system and i had to wipe everything.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to use VM's for guests/testing/ect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either force a local user account into a vm machine, or have acces to a VM on Hyper-v from the login screen of the host PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For know i've tried forcing a VM to open on login but i dont have the acces, even with the local account added in the Hyper-V Administration.</p>
<p>But this has limitation: </p>
<p>I have to close the VM and the user can still do things on the local account before closing or logging out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know if this is possible and how this can be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: The Hyper-V VM i've setup is extremely slow compared to other VM platforms (oracle Vbox/ VMware). I'm talking 2-5 seconds just to open a folder.</p>
<p>I get this warning about not being able to use the rescources of my CPU (not behind my home pc atm so can&nbsp; not check).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you in advance.<br />
</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Steven</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Not Picking Up My Mic</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 using the Media Creation tool. Everything worked fine until I went to plug in a audio device. My headset (Plantronics C320-M and Uproar Wireless) are detected and play sound but don't seem to detect any voice
 / mic. This is the case with the built in mic in my Laptop. (Lenovo Thinkpad T420)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, if this doesn't work, I can revert back to Windows 8.1, but I love Windows 10 and I don't want to have to leave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sin<br />

            Hey Sin.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi SinSonic19,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate apps is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter

    <title>Bluetooth speaker constantly disconnected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaybluetoothproblem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth speaker constantly disconnected</h2>
                    I have a Surface 3 and a Pioneer sound bar. When I connect my speaker via Bluetooth, it almost immediately gets disconnected...very frustrating. I go to sound in control panel and under playback it lists speakers realtek, headphones Pioneer, and headphones
 realtek. No matter what I do under properties and configure nothing lasts and my Pioneer is immediately listed as disconnected. I have spent time with Norton support and they have done everything from disabling firewall to remote assistance and nothing works.
 I have a Lenovo yoga(a year and a half old)&nbsp;and I have no connection problems with that. I have downloaded all updates from Microsoft and nothing works. Overall I like the tablet but if I have to listen to those crappy laptop speakers as opposed to a soundbar
 with subwoofer then the surface is being returned! HELP!!!!!!!

            <p>Thanks Zak_T, after a huge amount of trial and mostly error, I tried this and it worked. In the advanced tab of sound, I unchecked the box allow applications to take control of this device and my speaker has not been disconnected since. To answer your question,
 I was using Wifi. Thanks Jay</p>

            When you first got the computer before Windows 7 was installed did you create the factory restore disks?<br />
<br />
If you&nbsp;have these disks&nbsp;boot from the first disk in the set and restore the computer to the factory setup. Note that this will erase everything on the computer so make sure you have any important data backed up.<br />
<br />
If you don't have these disks you will have to contact Acer directly to see if you can purchase them.<br />

    <title>Cannot disable integrated laptop webcam in Windows 7 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot disable integrated laptop webcam in Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to disable the integrated webcam in my laptop , when i disable the webcam or remove the driver from the device manager it is automatically re-enabled or driver re-installed by windows , I am running windows 7 pro .<br />
<br />
The device manager shows two driver files for the webcam ksthunk.sys &amp; usbvideo.sys . Can i safely delete both these files to disable the webcam?

            I agree that there's little to be gained by disabling it. &nbsp;But if you really want to, go to control panel and select
<i>Device Manager</i>. &nbsp;Expand the item called <i>Imaging Devices</i>&nbsp;and right click on the camera. &nbsp;On the pop-up menu select
<i>Disable</i>.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm having a similar problem. My surface pro 3 goes black. It's in a dock, and the external monitor still works, but the tablet itself is black no matter what I do. I've done a reboot, reset, 2 button reset, etc. If I put my fingers on the screen, it moves
 my mouse on the external monitor connected through the dock. If I take it out of the dock the screen is black, but if I touch the windows button, the surface vibrates, so it's clearly still powered on.

            This answer is really of no help because the issue isn't during boot up but when it goes into sleep mode. I also have the same issue now and the only solution is to reboot the computer. What is causing it seems to be the lockapp.exe program.

    <title>Blue Snowball won&#39;t work since major upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Snowball won&#39;t work since major upgrade</h2>
                    So I recently replaced my motherboard, CPU and RAM and now my blue snowball mic won't work. When I did the upgrade I re-installed windows and that's where the trouble started. It doesn't recognise the device at all. It doesn't show up in device manager
 even when I click on 'show hidden devices', unplugging and re-plugging doesn't help, the USB port is good as it works with other USB devices and I have switched around multiple devices to no success. The mic is getting power as the red light is on and the
 mic is fully working as it works fine on my other computer which is a mac. I suspect that this is some driver related issue and I have heard of a lot of people having issues with this specific mic as it comes with no driver software and instead uses what comes
 with windows. I bought it 4 years ago, used it on windows 8 which I then upgraded to windows 10 and it worked fine, the trouble only started now. I have made sure all the motherboard drivers are installed and have re-installed the

            Hello. The issue is most likely that you have conflicting audio managers. 
<br />
<br />Go into Device manager &gt; audio input devices &gt; disable all of them then reboot. Only enable the one you want to use that works for the blue snowball. 
<br />
<br />If that does not help try these 2 links:

<p>Hello Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game launches on march4th 2019, with pre-order you will be able to play it 3 days early. The in game items you will most likely receive on release date. Make sure to go to my games and apps, highlight black desert, hit start/menu button. Then go to manage
 game they should show in ready to install there. Most pre-order items come at the day of release, some however have come before that. Especially if pre-ordering from other retailers. From the webpage itself.</p>
<p><span>The Black Desert Ultimate Edition digital bundle includes the full Black Desert game**** 3000 Pearls to use in game,
<strong>and 72-hour early access</strong>. <strong>IMPORTANT: The item packages included in the bundles will only be sent to the server that corresponds to the region where the product is purchased.</strong> So most likely wil lget when game releases and you
 sign into the server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps clarify a few things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Need help with restoring contacts from a lost account. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need help with restoring contacts from a lost account.</h2>
                    <p>So recently the update that Skype made that made me not able to sign into my old account with facebook is ridiculous. Atleast they could have gave us atleast a chance to backup our contacts or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently lost almost ALL my contacts thanks to the update, and I need to somehow restore my old contacts from the account. I cannot sign into it because it keeps loading and loading over and over, however I still have access to the facebook account
 associated with the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no longer an option to recover the contacts added on your Facebook login account. Please be informed that the end of Facebook login account have been announced within a month before the it was completely deprecated. Transferring or backing up of
 contacts should be done prior to the deprecation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no longer an option to sign in to Facebook login account, we strongly suggest that you manually add your contacts to your new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!<br />

    <title>The Same Problems when the Favorites are Hidden - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ishaan awasthi  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Same Problems when the Favorites are Hidden</h2>
                    <p>Two months ago I reported <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/a-problem-with-the-favourites-hiding/130a3f07-6a09-4739-8b0e-c8f88e9a4e48">
a problems with individual chats disappearing when the Favourite group chats are hidden</a>. Several hours again the problem appeared again and it is resolved (after each Skype restart) in the same way: by scrolling down to the bottom of the "hidden" favorites
 group chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guys, Skype has become too buggy and too unstable. Please resolve this issue properly. The re-appearing bugs are quite annoying...</p>

            After more than a month and a half (and almost four month since the first report) looks like nobody is going to fix nothing... Dear new Skype team, You're making our (ex-)favourite soft really disgusting and non-usable. Please start fixing bugs and making
 it more stable otherwise You'll lose all user Skype still has...

            <p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to run ch</span></span><span><span>eck disk and see if that help, the following are the steps to run check disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
a. Open Computer by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button , and then clicking
<strong>Computer</strong>. <br />
b. Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click <strong>Properties.</strong><br />
c. Click the <strong>Tools</strong> tab, and then, under <strong>Error-checking</strong>, click
<strong>Check now</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select
<strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong>. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To perform a thorough check, select <strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.</strong> This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both <strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong> and
<strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
4.Click <strong>Start</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may refer to: </span></span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check a drive for errors</a></strong></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span><span>If the above steps fail, I would suggest you to try the following steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
a. Click Start, and then Run. <br />
b.<span>&nbsp;</span>In Open, type cmd, and then press ENTER. <br />
c.<span>&nbsp;</span>Use one of the following procedures: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To run Chkdsk in read-only mode, at the command prompt, type chkdsk, and then press ENTER. o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To repair errors without scanning the volume for bad sectors, at the command prompt, type chkdsk volume:/f, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
To repair errors, locate bad sectors, and recover readable information, at the command prompt, type chkdsk volume:/r, and then press ENTER</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
once you complete the above steps, I would suggest you to disable all security software and then try back up again.<br />
I would also suggest you to make sure that you have full permission given to the drive for which you want to back up the files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span><span><span>1. Click Start, click My Computer, and then locate the file or folder where you want to set special permissions.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>2. Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>3. Click Advanced, and then use one of the following steps: </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. To set special permissions for an additional group or user, click Add, and then in Name box, type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. To view or change special permissions for an existing group or user, click the name of the group or user, and then click Edit.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. To remove an existing group or user and the special permissions, click the name of the group or user, and then click Remove. If the Remove button is unavailable, click to clear the Inherit from parent the permission entries
 that apply to child objects. Include these with entries explicitly defined here check box, click Remove, and then skip steps 4 and 5.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>4. In the Permissions box, click to select or click to clear the appropriate Allow or Deny check box.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>5. In the Apply onto box, click the folders or subfolders where you want these permissions applied.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>6. To configure security so that the subfolders and files do not inherit these permissions, click to clear the Apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container only check box.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><span>7. Click OK two times, and then click OK in the Advanced Security Settings for Folder Name box, where Folder Name is the folder name.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1</span></p>
<p><span>First, you have to stop the Print Spooler Service for this.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Go
 to Start, type in “services.msc” without the quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Scroll
 down to the Print Spooler service, right-click on it and choose Stop<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 you have to delete all files under C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you’ve restarted the Spooler Service, you might have to press F5 in the print queue applet to make the hanging print job disappear.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Cancel
 the job (it then hangs at the ‘Deleting – Printing’ stage)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>At
 the command prompt, enter: net stop spooler</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 enter: net start spooler</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press
 F5 to refresh the status of the print queue.</span></p>

    <title>Changes to on screen keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericamoss1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changes to on screen keyboard</h2>
                    <p>After the big update that was pushed a couple weeks back several unpleasant changes have occurred with the on demand keyboard that gets invoked when you enter a text field.&nbsp; That keyboard has been my main interface when using my tablet&nbsp; (Not in "tablet mode".&nbsp;
 I don't use tablet mode because I find it inhibiting)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, that keyboard had a button next to the close button that allowed it to unlock and float.&nbsp; That button seems to have disappeared after the update.&nbsp; It's quite frustrating because the docked keyboard takes up half the screen real estate and frequently
 the field I'm trying to type in is actually under the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's still possible to go into settings and invoke the "other" on screen keyboard (which floats) but it's just not as good of an interface.&nbsp; It's noticeably slower, the key repeat doesn't seem
 to work, and the keys are more cramped which leads to loss of accuracy.&nbsp; Also there is no shortcut way to invoke that keyboard so it's a multi-step process to have to keep going into settings to turn it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, not all applications automatically trigger the keyboard to pop up.&nbsp; This is particularly true for any non MS apps.&nbsp; There was a keyboard icon in the system tray that could be poked to quickly pop up the keyboard on demand.&nbsp; After the update that
 tray icon is gone and I can't find any setting to reinstate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, after the update a new bug seems to have crept in that causes the keys to light up and stay lit.&nbsp; Previously that only happened with keys like shift or alt (combination keys).&nbsp; It's now happening intermittently with all the letter keys.&nbsp; As I'm typing
 this half the letters are lit up in a bizarre fashion.&nbsp; They still work normally but it's really odd looking and distracting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any of you fine folks at MS look into these issues and try and resolve them?&nbsp; It's really undermined my ability to use this system as I'm accustomed to using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>how to get the system tray icon back? &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click in the Taskbar and check&nbsp; Show touch keyboard button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW whether it docks the full width of the screen seems to depend on the layout.&nbsp; E.g. it seems impossible with the mini layout.&nbsp; So your worst case should be having to switch to it from one of the other layouts and undocking more reliably that way.&nbsp; FWIW
 I would agree that the switch between docked and undocked is quirky but think that by the time we have mastered those quirks they will probably change it to do something else.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />

<br />
<br />Tell me how you are doing and let me know if the information has been helpful in solving your query.

<p>Hello JohnSnyder6,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my computer a few weeks ago. Ran SFC and Windows Memory Diagnostic. Installed the latest BIOS, even tested the hard disk with SeaTools. I didn't pick up any errors. Recently, I managed to fix the haunted DCOM errors (hopefully permanent fix) after
 days of Googling but this "wntpport service" I know nothing about. A Google search didn't help either.</p>

<h2>            Changing Integrity Level of root</h2>
                    I have a few apps that need to write to root of C: in Windows 8.1. I have set the permissions for a user group to have change access, but still&nbsp;only admins can write to root. It seems the integrity level is causing the issue. I tried running icacls c:\
 /setinegritylevel M, but I get an access denied running in admin console logged in as admin. Any other solutions?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error code alongwith this error message?<br />
2. Which CD burning software is installed on your computer?<br />
3. What type of CD are you using to burn?<br />
4. What is the status of CD-DVD drive in device manager?</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>.<br />
Let us first check the status of the optical drive in the device manager. Check if there is any error code or yellow mark is listed.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Explanation of error codes generated by Device Manager in Windows XP Professional<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>If the issue exists start the computer in clean boot state and check if&nbsp;you are able to accomplish this task.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353/en-us</a><br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps as explained in the article to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

 say that the video card would have problems running Aero. I am not running Aero and each time the laptop crashes it is the exact same error. Is is the video card? Is it an update? The computer does a system restore until it get the error again</p>
