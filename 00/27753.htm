            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have simulated your concern and determine that you need to turn off your keyboard shortcut settings&nbsp;to prevent this issue from happening. Please do the following&nbsp;to&nbsp;adjust the keyboard shortcuts settings of your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click the <strong>gear icon</strong> located in the upper right corner of your Outlook homepage.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>More mail settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Under <strong>Custimizing Outlook</strong> click <strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong>.</p>
<p>4. On the current page choose <strong>Turn off keyboard shortcuts</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Save</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Making a Subform Invisible Conditionally</h2>
                    <p>While reviewing the help, for a previous post (last week), I have this quest today:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging tracks for each CD, and their respective data per track, when I am done logging the tracks, I wish to make the data entry subform become invisible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a textbox in the parent form, whose control source is a field in which the total tracks resides, named
<strong>txt_md_rcdg_tks_</strong>. &nbsp;I've a hidden textbox in the footer of the continuous child form, which counts the tracks that are currently logged. &nbsp;I am frequently "pulled away" from my inventory of my CD collection, and do not finish logging tracks,
 sometimes...for days. &nbsp;Often, half the tracks are logged, and I don't get to finish the logging process for weeks! &nbsp;I need to compare the expected total to the count of what I've done so far. &nbsp;If these two figures match, I wish the data entry subform (for
 each new track) to become disabled or invisible. &nbsp;This will prevent any typing into the data entry form, for additional tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data entry subform will not become invisible, even when the parent form's <strong>
txt_md_rcdg_tks_ </strong>and the child form's count (<strong>md_rcdg_tk_nbr_</strong>) are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Count([fsub_md_rcdg_invty_tk_lst_ve]![md_rcdg_tk_nbr_]) = Me.[txt_count_lggd_tk] Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forms![fsub_md_rcdg_invty_cd_tk_nw].Visible = False<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Else: Forms![fsub_md_rcdg_invty_cd_tk_nw].Visible = True<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm counting the tracks logged, using the track number, but could just as easily count the names of the tracks, right?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I would think that code like this in the main form's Current event (not Open event) should do the trick:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Form_Current()</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.fsub_md_rcdg_invty_cd_tk_nw.Visible = _</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I'm not sure if the text box containining the expected number of tracks is named "txt_count_lggd_tk", as you used in your code sample, or "txt_md_rcdg_tks_", as you stated in your description,</p>

</p><p class="contentCodeblock">End Sub</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It would help to know what the error message was.&nbsp; Most likely the name of the field is incorrect, as I suggested might be the case in my post.&nbsp; If that is the problem, *maybe* the other name you mentioned, "txt_count_lggd_tk", would work instead; try that.&nbsp;
 But you haven't given me enough information to suggest anything else.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I am , here to help you.
<br />
<br />To recover the account you must follow the following 3 ways to recover your account as I show them, in case you do not succeed you should contact the support team. In the following link is all explained.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/microsoft-account-get-back-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/...</a>
<br />
<br />Through trusted team: You can easily reset the password at any time from a trusted team. If you use a computer to access your account frequently, the IP of this team will be registered as a trusted team if you can not enter by other means.
<br />
<br />
<br />2. By means of a security question and answer to your account. The answer to the question you have chosen, along with your location, will not help to verify your identity, so you can reset the password if you forget it.
<br />
<br />
<br />3. If you have not been able to recover your account by any of these means, then you must reset it by means of form validation. This form is a way for our users to validate the information found in their account and thus be able to demonstrate that they are the owners of the account. All this process occurs when the user has not placed security information, within their account when creating it. We recommend doing it to avoid the inconvenience of not being able to access your account.
<br />
<br />
<br />Then I gave him the link to contact technical support.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<h2>            Browsers in build 17035.</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to build 17035, with no install problems, but the Mozilla browsers Firefox and Nightly wouldn't open. I uninstalled the browsers and downloaded the installation packages for them but the installation files won't open or activate the installers.
 I also tried to update chrome Canary which wouldn't update. When I tried to do a reinstall of Canary it wouldn't run nor would the file open. Other installers seem to be working fine so far though.</p>

<p>There are no error messages, the installers simply don't start. I can't even open the files at all. I did try running as Administrator but all I got was the UAC announcement to accept or decline running the program. When I clicked yes nothing else happened.
 I just tried it again with the same results. Checking in Task Manager I can't see any processes running associated with the Firefox installation files I just tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oops, for some reason the Firefox installer just opened, so I'll see if ir will install and work.</p>

<p>Well, now all browsers are installing and working correctly. Nothing I did though! I did file this as feedback in the Feedback Hub, but I don't know if that would be related to the sudden change in response of these items or if a program glitch self corrected.
 Whatever occured, all now works as it should.</p>

    <title>Dark image in Lumia Camera - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfredourquiza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark image in Lumia Camera</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have tried to find this same issue in other posts but so far I got no one like it: Sometimes (at random) when I use the camera button to load up the app I got a very dark image. To be clear, this is not a black screen, I still can see that the camera is
 getting something if I point at a bright spot in the room, and I can even take a picture (which i of course very dark).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to turn off the phone and turn it on again (not a soft or hard reset) but as you can imagine, I lost the chance to get the picture when I need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is a Lumia 920 and I have the Cyan update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any comment about this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>AlfurX</p>

            <p>When did this start happening?&nbsp; Has it just started recently?&nbsp; Was it after you installed some update or an application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;How long does the sleep on/off &nbsp;'fix' last?&nbsp; Maybe next try a soft reset/power cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Barring that, the next step would be a hard reset, to see if that fixes the problem.&nbsp; If it comes back after that (which my gut tells me, it very well might), it could be that your camera's sensor (or the processor associated with it) is faulty and may need
 to be replaced.</p>

<p>I think there has been too much going on this week to hazard a guess, but I'll play the game and go for 17057.1001 on Tuesday.&nbsp; There's no indication that 17056 fared any better than the other two builds on Tuesday.&nbsp; By now, 17057, 17058, and 17059 have
 been compiled.&nbsp; But the question is, did <em>any </em>build pass muster for a flight?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know this is the killer build.&nbsp; Reportedly, it has Timeline, Sets, and eSim.&nbsp; No surprise that this one is taking an exceptional number of tries to get a build that is free of blocking bugs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to possible build issues, I think that we may get some type of flighting test next instead of a build because of the updating of the Ring infrastructure that Dona commented about.&nbsp; My guess is that the branch merger has happened as promised by
 Jason more than a month ago and that changes to the infrastructure were needed in order to set up the control and test groups for Sets evaluation.&nbsp; Surely that needs a dry run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back just before Thanksgiving Dona commented that December was going to be a very busy month.</p>

<p>I suspect that out of more than ten million Insiders the vast majority are passive, casual users.&nbsp; Millions are probably lookie-loos who opted in just to see the New Thing.&nbsp; Their telemetry is valuable but their participation is minimal.&nbsp; Just my guess.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With more than 200,000 servers in the Microsoft Cloud, each with thousands of connections, I doubt that anything strains the system.&nbsp; Even flighting new versions of Windows 10 to the public is not as demanding as one might think.&nbsp; The major restraint on
 how many devices are updated at a time is the staging based on device "readiness" for the update.&nbsp; I don't think it has to do much with the raw numbers. &nbsp;</p>

            I agree Colin. More of a jest than a fact. BUT there are a significant number of earnest/serious participants just the same anxiously waiting to apply what might be the last update until the new year. But I would rather wait for quality than rush for something
 less...

            <p>OK, I re-tuned cleartype and that seems to have helped to some degree, but it's still looking like Microsoft crippled anti-aliasing in some way. I&nbsp;<em>really
</em>wish Microsoft wouldn't go out of their way to break things for mysterious reasons, such as recently destroying the functionality of the family controls in the name of "simplifying things". I bet this is a case of some designer deciding anti-aliasing is
 evil for high-pixel-density screens, therefore, they need to ruin things for everyone else that doesn't have high-resolution screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*sigh* </em>why do I install upgrades from Microsoft when it's always worse, at least until they figure out that the lone guy who was trying to tell the committee that their decisions were awful was actually correct from the beginning.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping with this. Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-Accessing through Mozilla Firefox browser. My computer is on older imac and I started having problems with Google Chrome so I switched to Firefox while waiting for a google fix for Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-I have not "knowingly" made any changes to my hotmail other than accessing through Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3-Yes I am referring to emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop the Hotmail 2016 view as threads&#63; I want to see messages individually, not grouped&#33;</h2>
                    How do I change the new Outlook 2016 settings for conversations? I do not want me emails displayed as threads. I want them as individual messages. They get lost and I can't quickly find what I am looking for. This is so annoying!

            <p>Sorry Sagnik, bit there is no File. There is a Settings cog, which has Options on that. It also has Mail as an option, but no Replies and forwards.</p>
<p>Therefore, what you have suggested - unless I am reading it incorrectly, this doesn't follow the options available.</p>

This doesn't work. &nbsp;There appears to be no way to turn Conversations off and it's driving me nuts. &nbsp;I don't want conversation view. &nbsp;Under Options &gt; Mail &gt; Conversations there is no way to turn it off. I clicked through all other options and still no way to

I fully agree with you, this new hotmail setting grouping all conversations is the most inconvenience, who ever created that needs some more good ideas. there is NO way to change this, I have even asked my IT colleagues at work and this version does not seem
 to allow, so either love it or leave it. <br />

            Is there any one in microsoft that can resolve this matter? I am having a lot of trouble with work emails, if you group conversations and you want to reply to a particular person then once you reply they can see the WHOLE email chain, not very smart. Please
 advise as i have been trying for the past week. Thanks.<br />

    <title>Y partition&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grantonstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Y partition&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've just got a Nokia N95 8GB and have been installing some applications. One thing I noticed is I now have a Y partition and not only C and E. I'm sure it wasn't there before but maybe I missed it. I think it may have occurred while installing Resco News.<br />
<br />
Is a Y partition standard? Any ideas on how to remove it or how I can find out how much space is allocated to it and reallocate it to my E partition?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

            Mmm, I'm not 100% sure but someone mentioned to me that this Y partition is used by the S60 software to store files so that they don't get deleted with the *#7370# reset method.<br />
<br />
But since I don't have an N95 8GB I can't confirm.<br />
<br />
What did you use to see this partition?

I've had this Y: drive since I got the phone, inside there's a folder called 'Private' which you can't get into. So what's Y: for?<br />

What program you used to see that Y partition? Did you try using two different file explorer to check if both of them are showing the Y ?

            Those partitions are hidden and for use of the phone's software/hardware system. I recommend not messing with them in any way. Looks like you used X-plore to view them, by turning on the option for "Hidden/System" folders. =)<br />

            I have made no recent changes with my iPhone or windows 8.1 PC. I only started to use outlook.com email as of the other day. Contacts not syncing over EAS or through the "outlook" button on the iPhone mail set up. It is definitely an account issue.&nbsp;

            I've not tried that but I am guessing that there must be a place on the screen you can tap to "continue".&nbsp; Did you check a variety of places to tap?

<h2>            Office 2010 started to crash with Sharepoint after 15&#47;10&#47;2015 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a huge problem with Word 2010 and Sharepoint Server 2010. Essentially I am used to work on Sharepoint by opening the document and then select "Open in Word" for editing it inside Office. This was fine up to 14/10/2015. On 15/10/2015 this started not
 to work anymore. Everytime I try to open the document, during the start of the download I got an error:</p>
<p>"The exception unknown software exception (0xe0000002) occurred in the application at location 0x76dfc42d."</p>
<p>Word stops and if I open it again it suggests to go in safe mode. The document is then locked and I have to wait until it automatically unlocks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only event I can trace is the installation of a big set of updates performed automatically on 15/10/2015, regarding among others Office 2010, Sharepoint 2010, and all Office suite applications. I tried to uninstall the ones belonging to Sharepoint and
 Word without any useful result, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could uninstall all the updates but it is rather annoying (they are around 30 and this must be done one by one) and I am wondering if anyone had this regression issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nicola</p>

            <p>Hi Nicola,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered the same issue with a number of machines running Office 2010, and accessing either Sharepoint 2010 or Office 365 Sharepoint. &nbsp;The symptoms were the same with both. &nbsp;I just started uninstalling updates, and rebooting. &nbsp;Things started working
 fine after removing Office 2010 SP2, but I don't think that's the root cause as it was released so long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The helpful people in the Spiceworks forum have apparently narrowed it down to two different updates, with one being the most common suspect: &nbsp;https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1236093-kb3055034-breaks-opening-office-files-directly-from-sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, uninstalling&nbsp;KB3055034 &nbsp;seems to fix it for most folks, and&nbsp;KB3054886 also is related to difficulties saving to a WebDAV mapped drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

</p><p>It states that this is a known issue due to rolling the feature fix into the security update. &nbsp;I can't uninstall this patch since it is security related, but I don't see any workaround. &nbsp;Does anyone know if there is an incoming fix from Microsoft?</p>

    <title>Outlook custom task view no longer applying filters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonperrone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook custom task view no longer applying filters</h2>
                    <p>Starting two days ago, a view of my tasks that I have been using for a decade through all versions of Outlook, suddenly stopped filtering. I have one filter in my view... on the Advanced Tab of the view's settings, I have a filter of Status not equal to
 Completed. All of a sudden, that filter is simply not being applied. Every task I've ever had is now appearing in that view, all the way to November 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did the latest updates break task view filtering?</p>

            There were some Office related issues reported after the newest update.<br />The solution will come most probably with the next one. This is why the fastest solution would be to recreate it.

            Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)

            It's most likely related to the filter issue.  (FWIW, when i use that filter here, it is working.)
<br />
<br />Try using flag completed date does not exist. (For the to-do list,  add Date completed does not exist)

                    <p>Good Afternoon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for any creative solutions to a recent problem. Today, all of a sudden my microphone stopped working with Skype. It clearly works with applications similar to Skype such as Blue Jeans and Zoom, but for Skype it does not seem to be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled drivers, made sure Skype was allowed to use the microphone, restarted windows audio service, and uninstalled and reinstalled Skype. So far, I have had no success with the issue. I'm currently running Skype 12.1809.217.0.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/dae6c730-d9ac-437d-8cb8-de1ce40fd2d9" title="JacobPowell1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you reset the Skype app for Windows 10 since reinstalling Skype will retain the settings.</p>
<p>Here are the steps on how to reset the Skype app to default:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign out from the Skype app and then end the application from the task manager<br />
2. <strong>Restart </strong>your computer<br />
3. Open the Start menu and click <strong>Settings</strong><br />
4. Click <strong>Apps</strong><br />
5. Locate and click on the Skype icon from the Applications list<br />
6. Click<strong> Advanced Option</strong><br />
7. Select <strong>Reset</strong><br />
8. Re-launch Skype and login using your Skype account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what the outcome is.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Large Message stuck in Outbox continuously crashing Outlook Express</h2>
                    I have a message stuck in my Outlook Outbox which won't send as the attachments are too big (multiple photos). It's too large to send but I can't find a way to delete it and Outlook crashes every time I click on the Outbox folder.
<br />
<br />
Any ideas/suggestions please?

<h2>            Tabs not working the way they used to, how do I edit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to be able to double click on a tab in the ruler and it would pop up the tab dialog. Now I try and it's the page layout popup. The help question mark no longer works in Word, and I've submitted another question on that, so I can't query in the software.
 I've wandered through the ribbons and can't find tabs.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your post we see that you aren't able to edit tabs in Microsoft Word. To edit tabs, kindly click on
<strong>View</strong> and select <strong>Ruler</strong>.You can also check this <strong>

            Nope, based on your misreading of the post, that's what happened. The post is about why help won't work. The ruler is showing and tabs don't work they way they used to do. I did a search and found a solution on a non-Microsoft site for the tab issue. Help
 is the problem on this thread.<br />

<p>There are several factors why the Help button is not working in Word. Some are caused by plug-ins that is installed in your Word or Office. We suggest that you perform some troubleshooting steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Open Word in Safe mode:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hold <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>
R</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Copy and paste, or type the following command in the
<strong>Open</strong> box, and then press Enter:</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong><span>WinWord /safe</span></strong></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong><span><em>Note</em></span></strong><span><em>: There is space between
<strong>WinWord</strong> and</em><strong><em>/</em></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the Help button is working in safe mode, try to disable the add-ins associated with respective program and then check the result:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>· Click on File menu, Options and then Add-ins.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>· Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>· Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>· Click OK.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>· Open Word, check if the issue occurs.</span></span></span></li></ol>

<p>If you're looking at Word 2016 in Office 365, there is no question mark icon on the title bar; that was last seen in Word 2013. It's been replaced by the "Tell me what you want to do" text box.

<p>
</p><p>However, the F1 key (the default for the help shortcut in almost every Windows program) does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the other part of your original post, double-clicking on the bottom half of the ruler opens the Tabs dialog, while double-clicking on the top half opens the Page Setup dialog. This is how the ruler has worked at least as far back as Word 2000 (the
 oldest version I have available). You can also get to the Tabs dialog by opening the Paragraph dialog and clicking the Tabs button there.</p>

<h2>            IMAP Subfolders keep reappearing after being deleted</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook 2013 on Windows 7. &nbsp;I recently configured my Gmail &amp; Yahoo Mail on my MS Outlook 2013 using IMAP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Gmail works fine, I'm facing a lot of issues with syncing my Yahoo Mail. The most bothersome one is that empty sub-folders that I delete keep coming back soon after syncing. I also see a copy of those folders in the Trash Folder. As I keep trying
 to delete them, the copies in Trash continue to increase with the suffix (2), (3) etc.&nbsp;The folders when deleted online on Yahoo Mail, stay permanently deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, emails sent from Outlook reach the recepient, but do not show up in the sent items in either outlook or online (Yahoo Mail). Emails sent from Yahoo Mail on the web, show up in the sent folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart Outlook </li><li>Reboot the entire system</li><li>Create a fresh sub-folder and attempting to delete it</li><li>Create a new profile &amp; sync the mailbox (using a new .ost)</li><li>Checking and unchecking 'When displaying heirarchy in outlook, show only subscribed folders'</li><li>Checking and uncheking 'Purge when switching folders while online'</li><li>Going to Advanced settings and keying in 'INBOX' in the Root Folder Path field - This removes all folders except the 'Inbox' irrespective of whether 'Show only subscibed folders' is checked or unchecked.</li><li>I do not have&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(35, 35, 35, 1)">KB2837618 or KB2837643 installed.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>I've already spent quite some time trying to find a solution to this. Would really appreciate some help.&nbsp;</p>
