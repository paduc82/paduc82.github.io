    <title>How do I disable Cortana in Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shifty geezer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable Cortana in Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today, Cortana has suddenly started making suggestions in my conversations in Skype. It is disabled in preferences and I've never used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34775/how-can-i-use-cortana-in-a-chat-with-skype)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Bot in the contacts for me to select - there is no reference to Cortana anywhere that I can see other than settings. This is on Windows 7, and I have never used Cortana on any of my devices for Windows Live to think I've enabled it as a personalisation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's incredible intrusive and unwelcome. I've wasted plenty of time searching for a solution, following the official instructions which don't work, and I'm sick of modern Skype making it worse constantly. If it weren't for the fact I'd have to get all my
 contacts to migrate to a new platform, I'd do it in a heart-beat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I have just tried toggling Personalization on/off. As I say, it was set to off and had never been set to on. I pressed it and it added a Cortana chat bot, but the toggle switch stayed in the off position. I deleted the Cortana chat conversation and
 the toggle remains in the off position but Cortana remains active in conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have added a spybot to my conversations without my consent and won't allow me to deactivate it!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about your experience with Skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You've mentioned that the settings to disable Cortana are not retained. To troubleshoot this, reset your Skype application by uninstalling and reinstalling it. After reinstalling Skype, turn off Cortana again and all suggestions from Cortana from the settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this doesn't help and I'll provide more details to sort this out.</p>

            I have a better idea. You can take your cortana and every other spybot/ spyware you have ever created and incorporated into Windows, Skype and everything Microsoft have messed with and leave people alone!<br />

            I've read the various queries about how to block/delete Cortana and the replies, and I have two questions. First, I would like to know why deleting Cortana is not possible? Skype functioned before it was introduced, and it seems unlikely that it has been
 incorporated so deeply into the new design that Skype would be incapable of running without it, so why is its removal not a user option? I might not have been so angry, or uncomfortable, about it being rolled out as an optional setting if it hadn't suddenly
 appeared, trying to simulate a conversation with me in my contacts. Had I instead received an email from Skype informing me that this was now an option I could switch on if and when I wanted to, I might simply have taken that on board and ignored it. As it
 is, however, I feel intruded upon, and very much want Cortana gone form my Skype environment, and resent deeply being told, without apology, that this is not possible, simply because Microsoft has chosen not to make it possible. My second

            You have mistaken Microsoft for a corporation that really cares about anything other than spying on it's users, stashing away our data for use either in sale with other companies or to hand over the the US Government so they can monitor the people of the
 world better.<br />

            The thing I find most offensive is that Skype is not just passing my messages to my contacts, it is also passing them to Microsoft.&nbsp; Messages should just be passed through - preferably in cypher.&nbsp; If I have disabled Cortana as much as is possible, is Microsoft
 still recording my private and sometimes quite personal messages and selling them to spammers?

            I agree totally with you Mary Davey,&nbsp; I find it offensive and intrusive that Microsoft can just add Cortana in to Skype - I have done the same - disabled it as much as possible but its still in my contacts list, which i don't want. --- As you point out
 - It is very alarming that Microsoft may be recording our private and personal messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Field in Footer disappears when selecting Print from the File menu &#40;MS Word 2013&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a document with a <strong>Footer </strong>that has two lines, and six fields.&nbsp; Two fields are
<strong>StyleRef</strong> fields; one field is a <strong>Page Number </strong>field; one field (which may just be a placeholder) contains manually entered content; and two fields are
<strong>Ref Bookmark</strong> fields.&nbsp;The two fields that reference <strong>Bookmarks
</strong>were created in the exact same way, but behave differently when I select
<strong>Print </strong>from the <strong>File </strong>menu; one remains, and one disappears from the
<strong>Footer </strong>entirely.&nbsp; Sometimes, along with the disappearing field, the line spacing and arrangement of the remaining fields in the
<strong>Footer </strong>changes. &nbsp;I tried using <strong>Cross-References </strong>
instead of <strong>Bookmarks</strong>, which made no difference.&nbsp; I'm not sure if&nbsp;the problem is&nbsp;with&nbsp;the
<strong>Footer</strong>, or some wonky setting in <strong>Word Options</strong>.&nbsp;Does anyone know why these two fields in my
<strong>Footer </strong>would behave differently, and/or how to keep the one that disappears on Print to remain?</p>

            When you print, fields are updated. So anything that changes when you select a field and manually update it is going to happen when you print. You need to investigate why the fields are behaving the way they do. For example, the manual line break and tab,
 if they appear as part of a REF field, are reflecting the text that is enclosed by the bookmark, you may need to reinsert the bookmark to enclose just the desired text.

<p><br />
I'm not quite sure what you mean. Word 2003 is a newer version than Word 97, so how did it "revert back"?</p>
<p>Perhaps the people who fixed your computer installed a trial&nbsp;of a newer&nbsp;Office version&nbsp;(though it would make more sense to install a trial of, say, Office 2010)? But you should ask them what they did.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In keyboard settings there is an option to prompt text when typing. So I disabled it, because the keyboard covers too much of screen and I don't see what I typed well, not mentioning previous messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Then, what I see? Whole bar, on which prompts were displayed, is <em>still there</em> just for one icon on left: paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Is there any way to disable this option or get rid of the icon another way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;From what I found, when I'm typing, when I open keyboard settings from menu on keyboard, and then exit it, 'paste' icon disappears and whole bar along with it. Somehow weird. But what to do to
<em>permamently</em> shorten the keyboard of this bar?</p>

    <title>9300 Calendar format &#47; Sync with something non-Outlook&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thattallguy---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            9300 Calendar format &#47; Sync with something non-Outlook&#63;</h2>
                    I have a 9300 and I have been using Lightning (Sunbird, Mozilla's calendar program, called Lightning when it is used as a Thunderbird plugin) and I'd like to get this information to my 9300's calendar app. Unfortunately I can't get the 9300 to recognize
 any of the standard formats. And when I export the calendar data from the 9300 it's in some strange binary format.<br />
<br />
After quite some time searching I've not found any 3rd-party tools that seem appropriate either.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Or am I doomed to synclessness forever?

            Sorry, Lotus is not going to do it for me.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be a real "sync" process even. If the Calendar would just export and import data in a format I could recognize, such as vCal or even CSV, I can write an adapter to do the translation. But I need something other than a proprietary binary.

<p>if try hard reset your phone, turn off your phone then try this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>press and hold Green key (call) + Star (*) key + num 3 key, while pressing those keys turn on your phone. Release those three keys when phone shows "Nokia" logo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>P.S. Hard reset will erase all data on your phone memory. Please backup your important data.

<p>Hi BVM6,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this issue. Based on your error message, this happens when OneNote needs to refresh but canâ€™t do automatically. This is typically a temporary issue and should resolve itself the next time a full sync occurs. So, we
 suggest you sync this notebook manually:</div>
<div>1.<span> </span>Pressing Shift + Command + S while OneNote for Mac is running.</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Go to OneNote Online and click Open in OneNote to sync these notebooks.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, we want to collect related information to investigate further:</p>
<div>1.<span> </span>The screenshot about version of your OneNote. OneNote-&gt; About OneNote.</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Where did these notebook store?</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>The screenshot about this error message.</div>

<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this issue. Based on your error message, this happens when OneNote needs to refresh but canâ€™t do automatically. This is typically a temporary issue and should resolve itself the next time a full sync occurs. So, we
 suggest you sync this notebook manually:</div>
<div>1.<span> </span>Pressing Shift + Command + S while OneNote for Mac is running.</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Go to OneNote Online and click Open in OneNote to sync these notebooks.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we want to collect related information to investigate further:</p>
<div>1.<span> </span>The screenshot about version of your OneNote. OneNote-&gt; About OneNote.</div>
<div>2.<span> </span>Where did these notebook store?</div>
<div>3.<span> </span>The screenshot about this error message.</div>

            5220 is nice, but 5320 is better (however may be a bit complicated for your mothers needs as it is Series60 not Series40). if in doubt, consult reviews on many mobile-phone-dedicated websites on the internet, weigh these reviews against your wants/needs.

    <title>Printer duplex problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brucedh1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer duplex problem</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a printer duplexing problem with brother hl-l6200dw.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At first use the duplex did work; after doing some envelops and reset it to duplex the duplex function does not work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I just brought the hl-l6200dw a few days ago.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had a brother hl-1650 that broke a week ago and the duplex on this printer worked without any issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is a 15 year old printer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I try to copy a few pages on Microsoft edge; the page to copy shows up with all the pages; the duplex area has the following settings:<span>&nbsp;
</span>print on one side, short edge (automatic), short edge (manual), long edge (automatic), and long edge (manual). It is set at long edge (manual) and I click the long edge (automatic) and the software doesnâ€™t allow it, it goes back to long edge (manual).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can set the manuals but not the automatic duplex printing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do have Microsoft Works XP Professional (2002) and duplex automatic doesnâ€™t work with this application also.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It did work without issue with the old duplex printer hl-1650.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Where is the problem at, with software from Brothers or Microsoft?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have Windows 10 which was updated from Windows 8 several years ago when Windows 10 was free to download.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How to fix it?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can it be fixed?<span>&nbsp; </span>Where to get it fixed?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Or is the printer broke?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The printer hl-l6200dw works fine but duplex is not working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I wait for your reply, thanks for your time and service regarding this issue and I appreciate your response.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            It's almost certainly a problem with the driver for the printer.&nbsp; You might check the Brother website to make sure that you have the latest driver for that model printer, or just download the one from that site as the one you have may have an issue that
 it causing the problem.

<p>I got the driver from brothers website; I have to get it there because the included software driver is not for windows 10; so I downloaded the driver from brothers website.&nbsp; The software works but it doesn't work for the duplex.&nbsp; I went to properties and
 set it to two sided, nothing is working.&nbsp; If I use website using Microsoft edge it allows me to print but it will not allow duplexing.&nbsp; I guess brothers needs to work to improve their drivers for duplexing.</p>

<p>All this information I am ok with - none of this stuff is the problem.&nbsp; I believe it is a software problem on brother side.&nbsp; I will have to go without the duplex until brother if ever will fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got this printer.&nbsp; I like the printer and it will be cheap to use even if I don't have duplex; I want duplex but I will have to get ahold of brother and try to explain to them the driver doesn't work right for duplex.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this task for a few days now without any luck.&nbsp; So I will have to decide to keep the printer even if this duplex function is not working properly.&nbsp; It is a nice printer even without duplex but duplex would be nice to have.&nbsp; I don't
 get it; my old printer which is a brother works fine for duplexing and this new printer doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to find a fix for it; doesn't seem like many other people are having problems with their duplex function; I will continue to try to fix it next by trying to contact brother and hopefully find a solution to this problem.&nbsp; I don't think will
 be workable; I am starting to doubt that there is a fix to it; the software needs improvements for duplex to function properly until the problem is fix I will have to decide to keep the printer or use it without duplexing; haven't decided yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not buy another brother printer yet perhaps in the future because of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time you put into this issue to try to give me hope and find a solution; I appreciate your willingness to be helpful - once again thank you - if you have any other possible solutions I would appreciate your input.</p>

<h2>            HTC Touch shows sync, but PC does not show sync</h2>
                    
<p>Originally after loading the "Just getting started " Disc in my ASUS Laptop (Vista installed) I had no problems. Now the laptop tries to sync but does not and shows an error message momentarily.&nbsp; I tried both the
 cable and bluetooth. I followed the instructions in troubleshooting sync problems but nothing works. I rebooted both the HTC Touch and the laptop but nothing works so far. This PC phone is model number ELF0100 and Platform is PocketPC. It has Windows Mobile
 6 Professional installed, CE OS 5.21620 (Build 18125.0.4.2). Something changed and I dont know what it is. The phone shows it is in sync, but the laptop does not. The laptop does recognize that I am plugging a cable into the USB port, and like I said it trys
 to sync but the Windows Mobil Sync Manager shows it is not connected.</p>

<p>Hi Roy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First open WMDC and go to the connection settings and make sure you have the USB and Bluetooth connections allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is all ok you can try the following procedure:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goto Start-Settings-Connections and tap in USB to PC, then untick the option that says "Enable advanced network functionality".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to sync again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Nuno</p>

            Depends whether your Office version was associated with an MS Account when it was first installed/activated. If it wasn't you need the Office Key<br />

<p>

    <title>accessing shared calendar in outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p_s_92  say:</h3>
<h2>            accessing shared calendar in outlook 2007</h2>
                    Person A has shared his calendar with person B(with B as an editor) so<br />
&nbsp;that B can accept meeting requests, change location/time for a meeting<br />
&nbsp;which will be attended by A. Person B could do that on his computer and<br />
&nbsp;view A's calendar, make changes using Outlook 2007. Person B got a new<br />
&nbsp;computer so outlook 2007 was configured on the new machine so that B<br />
&nbsp;could access his emails, calendars and contacts as well as A's calendar.<br />
&nbsp;On the new computer B can view his calendar, emails, but cannot<br />
&nbsp;even view A's calendar which he was able to do on his old computer. A<br />
&nbsp;is out of town so he cannot send a sharing invitation message(as per<br />
&nbsp;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc743438.aspx) to B again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;We are using Exchange 2007<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1. What can B do to access A's calendar on the new computer?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;2. When calendars are shared using Outlook 2007, aren't the permissions<br />
&nbsp;stored on the server like B can view his calendar on the new computer.<br />
&nbsp;So, why he cannot view A's calendar for which he has permission?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Any suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
B's old computer was running Windows XP(32 bit) and new one is running Windows 7(64 bit) if it matters. Office 2007 is used on both so both have Outlook 2007 Saw the link&nbsp;http://www.helpdesk.ilstu.edu/kb/index.phtml?kbid=1251 but B doesn't see the<span>&nbsp;<em>Open
 a Shared Calendar...</em> </span>&nbsp; option when he opens his email or calendar using outlook<br />
<br />
P.S. I posted this on microsoft.public.outlook newsgroup before two days, but did not receive a response so am posting here and at http://www.eggheadcafe.com/community/aspnet/97/10217367/accessing-shared-calendar-in-outlook-2007.aspx since I heard microsoft
 is no longer supporting the newsgroups or something along those lines.

<p>FWIW, microsoft.public.outlook&nbsp; is dead. Microsoft replaced the newsgroups with the answer forums some time ago and removed their newsgroup server but thanks to the wonders of the internet, the newsgroups live on, on other servers worldwide.</p>
<p>What type of account did you confirgure in Outlook? Sharing only works with Exchange accounts - you won't see the sharing option with other account types.</p>

                    <p>Does anyone know if MS plans on fixing the persistent problem with section breaks -- it changes them in my document without my input (from an "odd page" break to a "next page" break, sometimes from "odd page" to "new column" break, sometimes it put in section
 breaks all by itself! In the middle of sentences!!!). It's incredibly annoying and I have to carefully go through and find all of these changes that the program just throws in there. This is has been going on for years and I'd really like MS to fix this!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a "new column" Section break. Perhaps you meant "new page"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In over 20 years of extensive Word usage, I have never known it to insert a break of any kind of its own accord. Maybe you have a rogue third-party addin that's responsible for this aberrant behaviour.</p>

            <p>I have never personally seen Word spontaneously insert breaks, but for a column break, just bear in mind that a column break in the last column acts as a page break (which may be an odd or even page break. So for example if you have a column break in column
 2 of a 3-column section, and you insert text before the break, pushing the break into column three, you will end up with an extra page break as well.<br />
<br />
If the "spontaneous inserts" happen often enough that you only have to wait a few seconds or a few minutes for a problem to occur, it may be worth starting Word in Safe Mode and seeing if the problem disappears.</p>

            <p>Here is a screen shot of the "nonexistant" column break:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn't have column breaks nor columns... didn't want them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word changed my "Odd Page" section breaks to "New Column" breaks and added one on it's own. Truly, I'm not making this up and it annoys the **** out of me!</p>

            Without wanting to place too fine a point on it, that's not a Section break; it's a page&nbsp;layout option. For
<em>Section </em>breaks, see: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Insert-a-column-break-FA34916A-D6CE-4C99-8646-0461A6030451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Insert-a-column-break-FA34916A-D6CE-4C99-8646-0461A6030451</a>. Evidently, you have encountered a conflict between your page layout definition and Section break assignments.

            <p>But it is a section break because it's under "section start" in the layout menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Frequently--not all the time, but frequently--when I put in an odd section break (I honestly don't remember if it was from the break menu or this section start menu) it changes it to this New Column section start or sometime to a New Page break (it will
 randomly change Odd page breaks to New page breaks and vice versa).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So maybe when I put in the section start, Odd Page it changes it to New Column and when I put in the Odd section break (from the section break menu) it changes it to a New Page break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whichever it is, the program is changing my breaks On Its Own! This clearly is a glitch and it's been happening for years, so why don't they fix it? Do they not know about it?</p>

<p>Argue all you like, but it's NOT a Section break. It is a page layout option and, quite plainly, is not a Section break option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also confident MS is aware that<em> Section breaks </em>sometimes change from one type to another. This is a long-standing, well-documented behaviour. See, for example:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/291184/description-of-section-breaks-in-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/291184/description-of-section-breaks-in-word</a>. The page layout tools merely provide a means of changing an
<em>existing </em>Section break from one type to another; not a means of inserting a new one.</p>

            <p>As Paul/macropod pointed out, if the <strong>type of section</strong> changes (in the Page Setup dialog box) that is not the same as Word adding a new section break.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type of section may change in conjunction with the printer driver (for example, some printers do not support printing portrait and landscape on the same sheet of paper which may result in an Odd Page section as opposed to a Next Page one). In such a
 situation, you can check for yourself that the number of sections in the document hasn't changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Word will add a new section for you as you change the page layout (for example, the margins or the number of newspaper columns) for a selected text range.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I assume you want to hide your VB project from view. Even if we greyed out the option to view code on the sheet tab viewing your code would still be as simple as ALT+F11 to open Vb editor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why don't you lock the VB project for viewing?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In VB editor click Tools | VBAProject Properties | Protection tab and check 'Lock Project for viewing and apply a password.</p>

            <p>Yes. You can add data to the blank lines below the filtered list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, data&nbsp;will not be filtered until the filter is reapplied. Do this by selecting the Data ribbon and in the Sort &amp; Filter block towards the middle of the ribbon click on the Reapply icon.</p>

            <p>Just to add to OssieMac's great answer, you can also add data by inserting rows (or cells) within the existing filter range.&nbsp; Same as what OssieMac stated, you need to reapply the filter by either of the methods he described to get the updated filter display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to insert rows between two visible rows separated by some hidden rows,&nbsp; the insertion will be above the selected row.&nbsp; If this is not exactly where you want it, then you might need to reorder your data when you remove the filter.&nbsp;</p>
