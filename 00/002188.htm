<h2>            Speakers not detected after latest windows 10 tech preview update</h2>
                    I have been using the win 10 tech preview for a couple of months now. After the latest update, my Bose Companion 2 speakers are no longer detected by the OS. I have a dell desktop and have the speaker input connected to the desktop itself. I also tried
 connecting it to the back of my monitor and only the left speaker works. Is anyone else having a similar issue. Any tips for fixing this? Thanks.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are facing might be a hardware/driver compatibility issue or due to hardware related issues. I would like to know some information about this issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Are you using the latest build (10049) on your computer?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to hear at least the system sounds? (Sounds like while starting and shutting down the computer.)</p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first step, I suggest you to check if the speakers are working fine on a different computer. This is to check if it is a hardware related issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the speaker is working fine on a different computer and if you are using the latest build (10049), then I suggest you to try installing the latest audio drivers and check if it works for you.
</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to update the audio drivers:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows </strong>+ <strong>X </strong>keys and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Expand the <strong>
Sound, Video and game controllers</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on the
<strong>Sound card</strong> and click on <strong>Update driver software</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer and check.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I am not sure how to check which build I am on. I could not find this information in the system information folder. How can I get the latest build on my computer (if I'm not already on it)?</p>
<p>2. I don't hear any system sounds.</p>
<p>3. No changes have been made to the computer prior to issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed that the speakers work on a different computer. I updated the driver software and it said it is up to date. However, the speakers still do not work.</p>

            <p>I am on Build 10041.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Logitech H330 USB Headset has stopped working today. It was working as recently as yesterday. I have tried the Headset on a Windows 7 machine and it works fine. It is not working on the Win 10 machine or on the Server Tech Preview build 9841. Honestly
 I don't know if it ever has as I never tried it there until it stopped working on the Win 10 machine. I went to the Logitech site to see if there might be any drivers or software support for this headset but there is not as the drivers are built into the device.
 I believe it might have something to do with the update that was pushed last night.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine does see the Headset but does not allow it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also plugged in just a regular set of head phone in the jack and the computer see's it but does not let that work either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internal speaker is also not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Dell OptiPlex 755</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Dell Support website and downloaded and installed the sound card driver and resolved the issue.</p>

            <p>To be more specific my system was built in the Windows XP era and came with XP Pro on it Dell also deployed it with Windows Vista in both the 32 bit and 64 bit versions. Dell does not have a Windows 7 or higher driver for the sound card on this machine.
 Since Win 10 is upgradeable from Windows Vista, I installed the Vista 64 bit driver.</p>

            Yes the Vista 64 bit driver worked. &nbsp;The Frame work for Windows 7 was Windows Vista. You can upgrade to Win 10 from any OS from Vista on, directly without any need for migration tools such as when you were migrating from XP to Windows 7 with out going
 through Vista. My sound card was developed for XP and Vista so a Vista driver works for it. I have also used Vista Drivers in Windows 7 for older systems that are pre Windows 7 but meet all the requirements for running Windows 7.&nbsp;

            I am in the same boat as GJ. It does not detect my speakers. It says they are unplugged. I am sure my drivers are up to date and the system works because I get a BIG "Clunk" out of the speakers when I restarted my computer after making sure Real Tech driver
 was up to date (it was but I went ahead and did a restart).

I've had exactly the same problem as caff-n-ated and followed the advice in your link in that I downloaded the Outlook app to my Android. I still can't validate my account even though I am putting in the correct Hotmail address and password. I keep getting
 a message saying 'Authentication failed.'
<div><br />
<div>It's absolutely infuriating when the so-called upgrade was forced upon me in the first place. If it's not sorted in the next day or so, I'm off to gmail for good.</div>

<p>If you're getting "battery check" you probably need to look in the manual for your computer to find out how to switch between the normal key&nbsp;action and the special action (usually printed in blue on the keytops). This usually involves holding down another
 key labelled Fn in blue. If you're not holding this key down it may have stuck down accidentally or have been toggled on by some mechanism peculiar to your particular model. You should only have to hold the blue Fn key down if you want the blue action on the
 other key you press.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 cannot connect to exchange server</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Windows phone and can connect to my work e-mail easily.&nbsp; However, when I try to connect to it using Outlook 2013 with Windows 8 I keep getting "The action cannot be completed. The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be
 online or connected to complete this action."&nbsp; The windows phone has a domain option that seems to be lacking in the Office 2013 setup.&nbsp; I have this e-mail connected to&nbsp;Outlook 2007 install perfectly fine.&nbsp; The Outlook 2007 setup has a different server name
 than what I have in my Windows Phone.&nbsp; I have tried both servers and get the same error message either way.&nbsp; I have occasionally received&nbsp;a slightly different error message that starts with&nbsp;"the name cannot be resolved". &nbsp;Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />Once you bring up the dial pad (Control + D) and choose Germany from the list box, you don't need to dial + 1, just enter the rest of the number you are dialing.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb17932b-7530-4341-a472-02008054be4e?upload=true" />

<br />No 1 is not needed. When you call up a phone number, simply select the country code from drop down and then give the number.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0121c4c-c4cd-443e-8730-dc4d394caa4f?upload=true" />

<h3> jens_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office files stored on network share appear as tmp files with hexdecimal number as filename</h2>
                    We have a Network Attached Storage (NAS) where we store Office documents, where some of them appear as tmp files (for example 4C73F7A6.tmp) for all others accespt the person that created the file. We have tried to work with access rights and even set different
 owner for those files but have not found any way to make them correctly visual for other users. The files are&nbsp;NOT corrupted, they can be opend by any user by Open with... (and selecting Excel or Powerpoint for instance).<br />
<br />
So the files appear as temp (tmp) file with an eight (8) digit hexadecimal numer&nbsp;as file name instead of the correct execl, word or powerpoint flenames.<br />
<br />
We are running Windows Vista Pro and Office2007. The NAS device is a Cisco NSS3000 and we connect using CIFS or via FTP (same problem appear when viewing via FTP). We are also using Windows Vista Offline Folders.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?<br />

                    Using my brother's i-phone I signed into my Skype account but now his account and mine are sync-ed.&nbsp; Can they be un-sync-ed - i.e separate accounts as before?&nbsp; Or, do I have to delete my account (and presumably his too) and set up new one(s)?

            I'm afraid you will just have to manually delete it out each of those contacts.

    <title>Outlook, This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> argonautetm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook, This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.</h2>
                    <p>I run Outlook 2013 on my Windows 10 Tablet/PC, the default browser is Chrome. I never experienced any problem with my Outlook 2013 before. Suddenly any mail I receive and has a hyperlink that I need to click on I get the message “This operation has been
 cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.” . I checked the Outlook security settings and nothing seem wrong. I even went as far as to change the default browser to Explorer still the same problem. Unable
 to proceed I started forwarding my messages from Outlook to my Gmail and found that the link works, this indicate that there is nothing wrong with my computer and that the problem still lie with Outlook. I searched the internet for solution and Microsoft under
 “Hyperlinks are not working in Outlook” provide 3 solutions 1. an easy fix that does not work on Win 10, 2. reset Internet explorer settings for which I don’t know how to do it, 3. export and import the registry which I won’t touch. Can anyone please assist?
 Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Word for Surface Pro 3 error message</h2>
                    I installed Microsoft Office onto my surface pro 3. Every program works except word. It was working and now it tells me that it an error has occurred that prevents it from working properly and that it will need to close because of it. Three options are
 available on the pop-up the first is to repair now, help, and close for the last one. If I hit repair now it stays open for a little bit then closes. If I hit help it brings me here. If I hit close it just closes right then. I've tried restarting the program
 and my computer. Nothing is working. What do I do?

            <p>I'd suggest you repost the question specifying Outlook as the program. You specified Access, which is Microsoft's desktop database application program - it would just be by coincidence that someone who freequents the Access forum would be able to help. Good
 luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My guess is that you had a typo - where you have "imap.alo.com" I suspect you should have "imap.aol.com" in the Outlook Tools... EMail Accounts... Change menu.</p>

                    I have the most current version of Windows 7.&nbsp; I need to delete a specific entry from a table of contents.&nbsp; Right clicking on the table entry and selecting "Delete", deletes the text from the underlying document.&nbsp; Going to the document and trying to "remove
 the heading style" from the text either clears all formatting from the text or deletes the text entirely.&nbsp; The entry remains after updating the table of contents.&nbsp; Do I have to delete the table of contents entirely and build it again?&nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of work wasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Ctrl-click on the text in your TOC that you want to remove to go to that text in the document. Change the style of that text from one that is used for TOC reference. (i.e. you do not want a Heading style.) You can have the formatting look the same if you want,
 but the style must be different. <br />
<br />
Here is more on Tables of Contents in Word: <br />

<p>As Charles suggested, you will have to apply a non-heading style to the paragraph that you want to omit from the table of contents. For example, you can click in the paragraph and press Ctrl+Shift+N to (re-)apply Normal style. When you are done, update the
 TOC.</p>

    <title>designating correct custom dictionary in Word for Mac 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesliekeros  say:</h3>
<h2>            designating correct custom dictionary in Word for Mac 2016</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of custom dictionaries in the Custom Dictionary dialog box, like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca9a388b-56a6-4826-a959-5aeb7c52d746?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca9a388b-56a6-4826-a959-5aeb7c52d746?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first file is the built-in custom dictionary, and the second one is a custom dictionary I created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During spell check, Word will consult both dictionaries but will add spellings only to the built-in "Custom Dictionary" file. If I want Word to add spellings to the "Custom Dictionary for Smith" file instead, I have to uncheck the box next to "Custom Dictionary."
 But if I do that, Word will no longer consult that dictionary during spell check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word for Windows gets around this problem by allowing the user to designate the default dictionary while still consulting all the dictionaries in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I accomplish the same thing in Word for Mac, i.e., consult all dictionaries in the box but add only to a default that I designate?</p>

<p>Please disregard the misinformation from Tisky Zheng. Unchecking a Custom Dictionary prevents it from being used, which is not what I understand you to prefer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave <em>all</em> checked that are intended to be active. On the main pane of
<strong>Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Spelling &amp; Grammar</strong> select the custom dictionary to be the primary... doing so does not deactivate [uncheck] any of the others. All that are checked will continue to be used but any words added will be saved to the one designated
 as the primary.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your feedbacks.</p>

            <p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>I suggest you to try clearing the cookies and check if that helps. Here is the steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Click on the&nbsp;<strong>three dots&nbsp;</strong>on the top right corner of the browser and you can see the&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>&nbsp;option.&nbsp;</span>
<br />
 the&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">clear</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">browser</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">data</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;option.</span>
<br />
<p>Also, you may try in "in-Private" mode and check. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may open in-private by Clicking on <strong>Tools</strong> icon&gt; Click on
<strong>New InPrivate Windows.</strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p>Refer to the following FAQ for further reference: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/edge-privacy-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>With reference to "touch-screen keyboard", if you're referring to onscreen keyboard, then I would suggest you to perform SFC and check.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>System File Checker</strong> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You can follow the steps in the following article:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a><span>
