<h2>            Entering Text in an Access Memo Field Causes Deletion of Record and Relationships</h2>
                    <p>I have a couple of rich text memo fields in my database.&nbsp; On several occasions, when users are typing in one of the memo fields, the entire record suddenly shows #DELETE in all the fields in that record (in tbl_02).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp;tbl_01 has a one-to-many to tbl_02 which has&nbsp;a one-to-many to tbl_03.&nbsp; tbl_02 is where the record gets deleted for no reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a compact and repair it:</p>
<p>- replaces the&nbsp;#DELETE record with a bunch of ####### signs in all the fields of that record&nbsp;and leaves the primary key empty (which it cannot be)</p>
<p>- because the missing primary key exist, it removes my relationships between Table 1 and Table 2 and between Table 2 and Table 3&nbsp;&nbsp; (relationships have&nbsp;referential integrity checked).</p>
<p>- I receive this error list:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a83f540-a590-424b-a131-14c9bf06305d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a83f540-a590-424b-a131-14c9bf06305d" /></a></p>
<p>I have seen where there are bugs with the memo field but it was on a previous service pak than I have loaded so I am not sure why I am still getting errors but wasn't sure if anyone knew what this was and how I can avoid it in the future as it continues
 to happen and it takes my some time each time to bring back all the records that everyone was working in during the crash and then they all have to go update with the information they were currently entering that did not save.&nbsp; Real pain!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance, for any help.</p>

            One more question: Is the database "Split" into a backend with the tables, with each user using their own copy of the frontend, with links to the tables, and with forms, queries, reports, and code? Or are they all logging in to the same single database?
 Splitting is ABSOLUTELY essential, and the failure to do so can cause this kind of corruption!

            <p>Debra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with such behavior has been corruption.&nbsp; Mine was network related and when you say they may connect through VPN (usually extremely slow) this raises alarm bells for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your database needs to be split:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back-End (BE) contains your tables and is place on a central server or shared folder</li><li>Front-End (FE) contains the GUI (queries, forms, reports, macros, VBA, ...) and is given out to each user.&nbsp; You do not share a common copy between the user.&nbsp; Each user should have their own copy which ideally is on their PC.</li></ul>

Suppose A1 contains your goal (30), A2 contains the number sold "to date" (20), and A3 contains the current date (that is, the date associated with A2), perhaps =TODAY().<br />
<br />
Then the estimated number of sales for the month is (in A4):<br />
=ROUND(DAY(EOMONTH(A3,0))*A2/DAY(A3),0)<br />
<br />
And the percentage of your goal is:<br />
=A4/A1<br />
or<br />
=ROUND(DAY(EOMONTH(A3,0))*A2/DAY(A3),0)/A1<br />

<br />
AWESOME... this worked perfectly.. what would I change if I wanted the same results&nbsp;for Year to Date instead of month to date.
</blockquote>
<br />
I am not sure what you want to compute:&nbsp; the estimate and %progress for the month-end as before, or the estimate and %progress for the year-end.<br />
<br />
Both are computable.&nbsp; But as a practical matter, I think it dubious to compute end-of-month estimates based on year-to-date sales because it ignores seasonal or other recent variations.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
If A1 is the year-end goal, A2 is the year-to-date sales, and A3 is the "current" date associated with A2, the year-end estimate is (in A5):<br />
<br />
=ROUND((DATE(YEAR(A3),12,32)-DATE(YEAR(A3),1,0))*A2/(A3-DATE(YEAR(A3),1,0)),0)<br />
<br />
And the percentage of your year-end goal is:<br />
<br />
=A5/A1<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage.<br />
<br />
DATE(YEAR(A3),12,32) is the date following Dec 31, i.e. Jan 1 of the next year.&nbsp; DATE(YEAR(A3),1,0) is the date preceding Jan 1, i.e. Dec 31 of the previous year.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
If A4 is the goal for the month (30 as before, not the year-to-end-of-month goal) and A2:A3 are as above, the estimate for the month is (in A6):<br />
<br />
=ROUND(DAY(EOMONTH(A3,0))*A2/(A3-DATE(YEAR(A3),1,0)),0)<br />
<br />
And the percentage of your month-end goal is:<br />
<br />
=A6/A4<br />
<br />
formatted as Percentage.<br />
<br />
Note that A2 is the year-to-date sales, not the month-to-date sales as before.<br />

<h2>            Bing and MSN in wrong language.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Bing and MSN both keep coming up in German for me. I am in the United States and would prefer to use both sites in English, but every single day it defaults to German. It's very frustrating because even a simple search that should take just a couple of seconds
 becomes a much longer process because I have to go in and change the language every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this? Can someone from Microsoft please look into the issue? I prefer Bing, but I'm honestly going to go back to Google if I can't get search results in my native language by default.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blocking Consumer Version of O365 while on-prem</h2>
                    <p>We are in the initial stages of migrating to Office 365. &nbsp;Our company has a policy to prevent access to all Web based email platforms (yahoo, google, etc) while on the corporate network (for DLP purposes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are required to open up the firewall for O365 services - but noticed that doing so will allow users to access O365 Consumer based products (email, OneDrive, etc) if they have their own personal accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are struggling with finding a method to block access to the consumer versions of O365 while opening up the network to our O365 tenant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have ADFS deployed, with Azure AD connect synced to the tenant. Access control policies only work on ADFS if the client checks in for auth (which would not happen if the client is using a different tenant)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions on this? &nbsp;We can't be the only one with this problem...right?</p>

            Hi MT,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your explanation.<br />
<br />
I have read all posts. If anyone in your company also purchase Office 365 Business plan by himself and you need to open the network for your company, it is not feasible to block the Office 365 web platform. Because they use the same Office 365 Business plan
 URL and IPs. <br />
<br />
I noticed that you have firewall in your company, generally, you can directly block Yahoo or Google web email URLs.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Erick<br />

<h2>            What&#39;s wrong with this website&#63;</h2>
                    In this website which is quite famous in China where you can play online computer games, share what is happening around you and upload your pictures to share with others and some other functions, where there should be a picture, now there is nothing except
 a small thing appearing on the&nbsp;top&nbsp;left &nbsp;corner &nbsp;that I cannot tell what it is. However, strangely, when I see the window under the 100%&nbsp;model, the pictures can appear correctly, but when I see the windows under the 146% model, there are no pictures. I want
 the experts to tell me what to do to change the situation. It seems that several days ago, it was all right. Only recently it has changed. I will post some pictures to show what is exactly happening. It seems that the technological people in China cannot slove
 the problem, so I am now asking the experts in the United States to help me solve the problem.

<p>Yep... the second screen shot shows image place&nbsp; holders in a horizontal line...right click on the missing images and select 'Properties' missing images will have a 0kb size... nothing wrong with the browser... its a programming error by the website programmers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sorry the screen shots are not sufficient...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide the web page address for us to have a look at the web page and to debug the page programming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>copy and paste the link from the address bar of your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a guess it looks like you may be on a page that is using a java applet that has its own scaling function...(size model)... are you using the View&gt;Zoom menu from IE....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realy the only way for us to answer your question is for you to provide the address of the web page you are having problems with....</p>

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for posting those clarifications. The saved emails and contacts within your Outlook Express folders are not going to be lost. These are kept in storage files on your computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>... &nbsp;I am changing Internet Providers to Comcast and cancelling Earthlink.&nbsp; I plan to use gmail which I have already set up.&nbsp; Will those 10 emails above still be in my Outlook Express after I cancel Earthlink?</p>
</blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>Yes. You can delete the email accounts that are associated with EarthLink and setup new ones for gmail (or whoever) and the contacts and saved emails will still be on your computer. The emails will be stored within one or more data files with an MBX file
 extension. These reside within a subfolder of your profile directory. If you created a folder call
<i>Keep</i>, then they will be in a file named <i>Keep.mbx</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>And...will all the emails addresses of friends and businesses still be in Outlook when I cancel Earthlink?</p>
</blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>Yes. Your contacts are held in a data file with a .WAB file extension. It typically resides within one of the subfolders of your profile.</div>

            <p>Hi FredMudge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your post, your phone will not connect to any WiFi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Settings &gt; WiFi Networking, does your phone see the WiFi networks in range? If you try to connect to a network, do you get an error message/code? Are you able to connect to your mobile data connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please perform a soft reset by holding the Volume Down + Power button together for 10 seconds until the phone vibrates and restarts. Then go to Settings &gt; WiFi networking. Tap and hold on your home network and select Delete. Then re-add your WiFi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I would suggest a hard reset. Please create a backup of your phone first (Settings &gt; Backup):</p>

    <title>Conference Add-in is loaded, but no UI elements are visible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skippu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Conference Add-in is loaded, but no UI elements are visible</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to use the Conferencing Add-in features to schedule voice and LiveMeeting calls on my company's Office Communications Server. My problem is the user interface components for the add-in never appear. There is no conferencing menu on the Outlook
 ribbon, there are no conference or LiveMeeting options in a meeting request.</p>
<p>I'm running Office Pro 32-bit on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit</p>
<p>I have version 8.0.6362.187 of the Conferencing Add-in installed. In the Add-Ins screen in Outlook, it shows as an active add-in. The first time it ran on this profile, it asked permission to load the add-in, but after that it has not asked for permission.
 I've created new Outlook profiles, and the first time I run them they will ask permission. But the UI elements never appear.</p>
<p>I found a KB article that indicates this key controls the load behavior of the add-in:<br />
HKLM/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Office/Outlook/Addins/Microsoft.LiveMeeting.Addins<br />
LoadBehavior = 3<br />
I have confirmed this key exists with the correct value.</p>
<p>I've uninstalled/reinstalled Office and the Conferencing Add-in, but to no success.</p>
<p>Anything else that I should check?</p>

<p>Thank you to the pointer to that thread. It gave me some new&nbsp;information that I have not seen before. Unfortunately, none of the proposed fixes have an effect.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;thread you referenced assumes Outlook 2003 or 2007, but I am running Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>There is a "Community Clips" hyperlink but that content has apparently been pulled down.</p>
<p>The KB article referenced gives three different options to correct this problem. I was able to delete the .DLL file and reinstall the Add-in, to no new effect. I deleted the one MANIFEST file in the referenced folder and reinstalled, to no effect.</p>
<p>The RegEdit entries are interesting. The KB article suggest creating a .REG file, but RegEdit would not accept that script. I tried to create those keys/values manually. You cannot create a new Key under HKEY_Users. I tried creating the remaining keys under
 the one USER key that is in my registry - again to no new effect.</p>
<p>I am still seeking the cure to this problem, and would welcome other suggestions.</p>
<p>Also, is there a way to completely remove all traces of files and settings for the LM Add-in pack?</p>

<p>Hi Surya.</p>
<p>I did as you suggested and succeded in adding the registry keys.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>I made some more investigation trying to add manually on the Outlook 2010 ribbon the missing buttons. When I did it and pressed the buttons I got&nbsp;this generic error message: "An error occurred while executing this command. If this error persists, please
 contact your Live Meeting administrator"</p>
<p>So I suspect that the buttons don't&nbsp;show up because there is something missing&nbsp;that does not allow the corresponding commands to be correctly executed.</p>

<h2>            Cortana doesn&#39;t understand my language in build 10149</h2>
                    <p><span>I received the latest update in build 10149&nbsp;on my Lumia 1520 phone last night (06/07/2015). I tried to use Cortana but was informed I couldn't
 be understood.</span></p>

<p><span>I selected to download the English package - was notified there was an error and the download couldn't be completed.</span></p>

<p><span>I believe this problem is connected to the language problem I had with this update. After the update was completed the lock screen was in Chinese.
 After entering my pin I understood the Chinese language was chosen in this update instead of English for my phone.</span></p>

<p><span>The Lumia 1520 I have is an international version. When I set it up the first time I had to select American English and associated region instead
 of the Chinese version. This update reverted the language back to Chinese. I had to download the English package and select it. Everything looked good until I tried to use the keyboard which still had Chinese characters.</span></p>

<p><span>There is still language disconnects in this update for my Lumia 1520 phone - Keyboard and Cortana.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: When I was fixing sign-in problems with my Outlook email accounts - the keyboard had English characters.</span></p>

            <p>I found a simple fix on another&nbsp; post: go to settings/ease of access/more/text size and set the size to its smallest level.&nbsp; This will cause Cortanta to show the entire starting setup and you can accept from there.&nbsp; I am using a 635 and build 10149.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>The text level was already set at the lowest level.&nbsp; I moved the level to different&nbsp;sizes and back&nbsp;without success.</p>
<p>I thought because the Chinese language was first in available languages on my phone, since it was an international version, that uninstalling it and leaving only the English language package&nbsp;would solve this - no luck.
</p>
<p>I even reset the phone after removing the Chinese language.&nbsp; I no longer had the Chinese characters on my keyboard but I still couldn't be understood by Cortana.</p>
<p>There is an option in Cortana settings to install a different language. I selected American English but can't download it.&nbsp; I tried this before resetting the phone and got an error message for the download.&nbsp; After resetting the phone I tried again and I'm
 getting the message "Downloading" - but it doesn't complete the download.</p>
<p>I'll keep trying.&nbsp; I'm glad this fix worked for you.</p>

How do I add the telephone number from call history to an existing contact ?<br />

It only seems to give me the option to "Create" a new contact.<br />

<p>Or, from a different perspective, differently = MUCH BETTER!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you go to HISTORY and press on a number that is in the list, you should get a popup where the first item in the list is Save to Contacts.&nbsp; Press that and the list of contacts will appear.&nbsp; Pick the name you want to add this number to
 and the Number Type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is all there is to it ... it is pretty easy!&nbsp; You might have to change the call type if you are adding it to an existing contact.</p>

<p>Hi coldwell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its actually not being able to resize rhe editor instance. Its either full screen or immediate drop back to the taskbar. They also start minimized and i have to rightclick and select maximize. All else fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly the meeting editor shows no issues and can be resized without problems.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mauricevan,</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your confirmation. Based on your description and my research, this issue is related to the Outlook desktop client. I suggest that repair your Office 365 first to see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Open Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Click on Uninstall programs.</span></li><li><span>Select Office and click Change.</span></li><li><span>Start repair process. Please select Quick repair option.</span></li></ul>
<p>

    <title>Error code 8000ffff on app downloads after restore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code 8000ffff on app downloads after restore</h2>
                    I had to restore my Lumia 920 because of text message app constantly crashing, now my phone is having trouble restoring my apps. The won't download and on the download list they all say "Attention required. Tap here." When I tap on the download, it gives
 me an Error code:: 8000ffff and tells me to try again later, but this error never goes away and it won't let me delete the download and try to download the apps manually myself. What can I do???

            <p>I had a similar issue, except I had three stalled downloads, each indicating "Attention required. Tap here." with an error code of 8000ffff.&nbsp; Also, the application icon was blank -- i.e., dark grey.&nbsp; Tapping on any one of the three downloading progress messages
 took me to a screen offering a choice of "Retry" or "Close."&nbsp; Close simply&nbsp;returned to the previous screen.&nbsp; Retry also&nbsp;returned to the previous screen, but the status message momentarily changed to "Pending", then back to "Attention required. Tap here."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting a soft reset accomplishes nothing except causing the Store app to display the number "3" on its live tile.&nbsp; However, after playing around a bit, I discovered that if you hold your finger on the "Downloading application" progress message instead
 of tapping it, a pop-up dialog will appear offering a "Retry" or "Cancel download" option.&nbsp; Tapping Cancel successfully canceled the corresponding download.</p>

<h2>            Workgroup templates on Sharepoint not opening correctly</h2>
                    <p>Our workgroup templates are located in Sharepoint and so the Word options/Advanced/File Locations... is a directory full of URL shortcuts. This has been working for us successfully for years....until Word 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2013, when I click on New, then Custom, then the template folder, then the template itself, rather than opening a new document based on the template as it has done in the past, it opens a new document with some code, and the url of the template -
 as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[{000214A0-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]<br />
Prop3=19,2<br />
[InternetShortcut]<br />
URL=http://company/sites/Docs/Documents/COMPANY%20Memo.dot<br />
IDList=<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've compared all of the settings in the options between Word 2013 and 2010 and can't find any differences. Is there somewhere else I need to change a setting? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>...yes...but only by Word 2013. I would have thought the location of the documents wasn't entirely relevant since it's not an issue with earlier versions of Word...therefore Word 2013 is at the crux of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Problems installing office 2013 after system restore.</h2>
                    I have recently downloaded the Microsoft office 2013 suite. Because of recent computer problems I was forced to system restore. The restore point I chose uninstalled the suite. I attempted to re-download it but when I ran the install file it says "something
 is wrong". How do I recover my office 2013?

            I finally got MS Office 2013 loaded and running.&nbsp; My problem began when the initial install was interrupted, after which I did a restore for Office 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; Later I came back to do the process again.&nbsp; Office 2007 would not un-install.&nbsp; I used one of the
 MS "fixit" programs, followed by a manual delete per Microsoft instructions.&nbsp; <br />
Then, Office 2013 would not do the initial download, maybe because of remnants from the first interrupted install.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used one of the MS "fixit programs, and it still would not do the initial download.&nbsp; Sooo, I did the manual delete, again per Microsoft instructions.&nbsp;
<br />
Success!<br />

<h2>            Outlook not connecting to Exchange online account</h2>
                    <p>I started receiving the following error yesterday: </p>
<p>
</p><p>0x8004010F "The operation failed. An object cannot be found." </p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect outlook to my exchange online account. I'm using Win10 and have the latest version of Outlook (2016).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has worked perfectly until this. I did some searching and learned that I may have a corrupt data file. I followed the steps to create a new profile, but it times out and gives the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>Something went wrong and Outlook couldn't setup your account. Please try again. If the problem persists, contact your email administrator.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm feeling like I might be stuck here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I'm able to log in and use the web interface of my exchange account without any issues. So it appears the issue is on the Outlook side.

</p><p>I saw this before and really did not pay it any attention then.&nbsp; But how SAFE should this make anyone feel?</p>
<p>
</p><p>what if the computer that my computer decides is a good place to get&nbsp;the update from has a virus?&nbsp; can it infect my pc?? Or will my pc go back to Microsoft with a SHA or some other means for verification that yes this is the file put out by&nbsp;Microsoft and
 it has not been tampered with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I should slide the switch off...</p>

            <p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern but this feature will let you choose to download updates for the operating system from other PCs on your own internal network or from PCs either on your network or over the Internet, giving the update process a peer-to-peer capability.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be specifically helpful when Microsoft's site is too slow or inaccessible for some reason, you'll have an alternative avenue for making sure your PC can get the latest security patches, bug fixes and other updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned there would be&nbsp;security concerns over the validity of OS updates but Microsoft has built in methods to prevent tampering and a means to verify update packages before they’re applied to Windows 10 systems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query. We really appreciate your feedback. I request you to kindly provide your valuable feedback on the feedback app which is installed with Windows 10 Technical preview.</p>

<h2>            I changed my hotmail to an outlook alias now I can&#39;t recieve emails from anyone. What am I to do&#63;</h2>
                    So last month I somehow changed my Microsoft account which was under my Hotmail account to an alias under an outlook account. However, I am not receiving any emails from anyone/anything now. Emails are apparently being sent to my original Hotmail account
 however I can't access it because when I do it says this email doesn't exist. So, when I attempt to recover this email it says it's part of a reserved domain??? Anyways, I would just like to know what the hell is going on as my current alias account isn't
 receiving any emails at all from my Hotmail account. Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi James,
<br />No one here has access to your account (this is a peer-to-peer forum, staffed with volunteers and others who don't work for Microsoft). 
<br />
<br />It sounds like you deleted the Hotmail address from the microsoft account at <a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/names/Manage</a>  instead of just adding the alias to it.  The only aliases that can be added there are outlook.com. 
<br />
<br />You may be able to recover the address 30 days after you deleted it by making a new account. Try creating a new account with that address.  If it has been less than 30 days, try going through  Help (?) in outlook.com - type in a question then click Still need help. 
<br />
<br />Do not call the spammer who posted a phone number as a response.

            <span>Dear Dianne that I you so much for clarifying what was wrong with my email as I had actually deleted it and I was unaware of this. It was only because the new alias held all the previous emails sent to my hotmail account up until it was
 deleted when i thought I had changed its name. Anyways now I have another problem. If you don’t mind using your expertise to help me I would like to ask as to why accounts from websites that used my original hotmail account won’t work with my new hotmail account
 under the same name. And is there a way to fix this issue? I’m thankful for any and all support you give, thank you!!!</span>

            &gt;&gt; why accounts from websites that used my original hotmail account won’t work with my new hotmail account &lt;&lt;<br />Are you trying to sign in with the new alias? The sign in is linked to the address. <br /><br />If you made a new account using the address you deleted, the signin is linked to the underlying Microsoft account - the new alias should work in this case.
