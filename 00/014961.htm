<h2>            I can&#39;t save attachments in the MSN outlook to the onedrive personal email attachments</h2>
                    <p>This is a sudden problem. &nbsp;As of Jan 27, 2017 I had no difficulty with saving attachments to cloud outlook to the onedrive-personal email attachment folder. &nbsp;As of Jan 30, when I try to save an attachment to onedrive, the outlook says that it is saving the
 file. But the file does not show up in the onedrive email attachment folder. These are all Office 365 programs. We are trying to use the cloud as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as I was looking at the problem, it seems that the computer cannot find the outlook address for the file. &nbsp;Wait enough time on a "view" or "download" attempt, and I get a long message that it cannot find the page - with long link.<br />
<br />
I can forward the email with the attachment over to my comcast address, which uses an earlier version of outlook that is NOT part of Office 365, and which doesn't use onedrive. &nbsp;Here I can download the file normally to my computer. &nbsp;So the file is not corrupt.</p>
<p>So far as I know or can tell,I have not changed any settings with respect to privacy or security. &nbsp;There is plenty of space on the onedrive for the files- some are pdf, some are microsoft word.</p>
<p>I have not had trouble with attachments before today Jan 30.</p>
<p>I do not think that there have been any updates. I have not installed 1607- as there is a problem somewhere in that update. Latest update was Jan 10, 2017 for malicious software removal.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>I'm having exactly the same problem too - started suddenly in the last few days, around Jan 30 2017. Before then, ever since I started using Outlook.com a few years ago, the "save to OneDrive" feature for attachments in email messages worked just fine. It
 used to save my attachments to the 'Email Attachments' folder in my personal OneDrive. Then. at the end of January 2017 it suddenly stopped working: instead of showing a green tick (check) when the attachment was saved to OneDrive, it shows a red cross and
 displays an error message saying "The file couldn't be saved to OneDrive". And when I click on the the "download" link - it comes up with an error 404 page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See picture below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please help! I have to use a different email program to save/view my attachments, which is a real pain.</p>

            <p>Yes I've noticed that when there are multiple attachments in one email, the download as a zip file works fine, but individual downloads don't work (Error 404) and save to OneDrive doesn't work - either individually or all.</p>

            <p>No even the zip download doesn't work. &nbsp;All of a sudden, the options for view, downods, zip under the file didn't work, and within the file (the three little vertical dots) didn't work. &nbsp;The outlook 365 can find the outlook.live.com page fore the attachment
 can't be found. &nbsp;Sometimes it "seems" to save the file to email addathments, but they don't show up there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I am forwarding the emails to an address which I do NOT pick up with outlook365. &nbsp;A much olderversion which is not on the cloud, so that I can go get them one-by-one.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint stopped working--but only on certain files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgrose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint stopped working--but only on certain files</h2>
                    <p>Very peculiar problem. Just today, several of my powerpoint 2013 files wouldn't open without error message "Powerpoint has stopped working," and then it closes the program. This happens whether I open with powerpoint 2013 or powerpoint 2010. But to add to
 the mystery, it only happens with powerpoint files on my Dell Desktop (Windows 10), not my two Thinkpad laptops (which are both running Windows 7). And it's not just recently saved files. It happens with older files as well. All files have extension .pptx
 but this error message appears only on some (maybe 20%) of files.</p>
<p>I tried the Office 2013 repair program on the control panel, and I tried opening up in SAFE mode but error message still appeared.</p>
<p>Even tried SYSTEM RESTORE which seemed to work--for about an hour! Then the problem on select files returned.</p>
<p>I really don't think this is a matter of removing and re-installing the program because it is happening with both 2010 and 2013 version of POWERPOINT. And only POWERPOINT, not WORD or EXCEL.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any help or suggestions? Thanks</p>

            <p>Actually, I joined Microsoft's support service and after a few minutes, their technician figured out the problem. A recent update to Windows 10 came from Adobe for my Adobe Flash. This was responsible for the problem. He uninstalled Flash from the computer--and
 instantly the problem disappeared.</p>
<p>I guess Steve Jobs was right--Flash is a horrible program!</p>

<h2>            Outlook.com Limits of Email addresses for contacts</h2>
                    Are there any plans to&nbsp;increase&nbsp;the number of email addresses a contact can have? Currently it's maxed at three but I have many friends (myself included) who have more than 3 email addresses. Plus, that they can only be placed as "Personal", "Work" and
 "Other" is a bit much. Please tell me there's plans to increase this limit. I want to move entirely to outlook.com but this limit seems just downright arbitrary.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We currently don't have the option to add additional email address per contact other than three email
 address. I will forward the suggestion over to our product team as consideration for a future release.</span></p>

            <p>What is the point of increasing the number of email addresses for a contact ?</p>
<p>Outlook.com will recognize a contact's address in this manner :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. It always uses the address entered in the Personal box.</p>
<p>2. If Personal box is blank, then it goes to Work box.</p>
<p>3. If Work box is also blank then it goes to Other.</p>
<p>4. If all boxes are entered, outlook.com will use the one in Personal and ignore the rest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you see, there is no point of having more boxes for more addresses. Outlook.com will still work the way mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless I am missing what you are trying to say.</p>

<p><br />
If you must have more than 3 addresses for some of your contacts, why don't you make multiple entries for those contacts.</p>
<p>Example, make multiple entries for John Smith.</p>
<p>entry 1 ; John Smith&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>entry 2 : John Smith *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>entry 3 : John Smith *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>etc .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not how you prefer, but it's a workaround for the time being.</p>

    <title>finding numbers in text string - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amyseery  say:</h3>
<h2>            finding numbers in text string</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a list of cells containing short text strings. Some contain numbers eg:</p>
<p>"there&nbsp;are 4 lights out in the store"</p>
<p>"16 light bulbs need replacing"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>some do not contain numbers:</p>
<p>"light broken in ladies toilets"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I pick out the cells containing numbers, bearing in mind the number could be anywhere in the cell?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An added bonus would be for it to also pick out cells containing number written in text form eg "nine". For numbers up to "fifty" say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated, I am fairly experienced in Excel but lack the know-how required for this problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Amy</p>

            <p>Amy,</p>
<p>I can suggest one way to do this with a couple of named ranges and conditional formatting.</p>
<p>Put the digits 0 to 9 in say A1:J1 and name the range <em>digits</em></p>
<p>Put the number texts zero to fifty in say A2:AY2 and name the range <em>nums</em></p>
<p>The apply this conditional formatting formula to your text strings (assuming starting in A3):</p>
<p>=OR(SUM(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(digits,A3))),SUM(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(nums,A3))))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** EDIT ***</p>
<p>Come to think of it, you wouldn't need the whole of zero to fifty number texts since there are many part repeats; just zero, one ... twenty, thirty, forty, fifty. So these would go A2:X2</p>

            If there is a text string in A1 that <u>might</u> contain numerals, then this array formula:
<div><br />
<div>=COUNT(1*MID(A1,ROW($1:$9),1))&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
will count them. So if =COUNT(1*MID(A1,ROW($1:$9),1))=0 then there are no numerals in A1
<div><br />
<div>Remember the formula must be entered with CNTRL-SHFT-ENTER, not just the ENTER key</div>

            The numbers are easy enough but we may need an Excel expert to help with a better way of checking number texts. In the meantime the following should help and is fairly fast given the amount of data that has to be checked individually by this method. The
 macro assumes that the texts are in column A starting at row 1 and it formats the text colour of matching cells to red.<br />

<p>Just tried this is works really well for the purposes of the report I am doing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One small&nbsp;problem however is that there are a lot of partial matches on the word "one" eg:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>" All the lights have g<strong>one</strong> out" etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know an easy way to get past this? It not then no worries, I doubt there will be many entries for one anyway, I am prepared to lose that , will just delete "one" from the raange</p>

<p>You could try inserting a space before (and after, if necessary)&nbsp;the o of one - so that in the cell you would type space followed by one (followed by another space).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To extract numerals from an alphanumeric string, try this array formula <strong>
<u>(Ctrl+Shift+Enter)</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IF(B2="","",IFERROR(LOOKUP(9.9E+307,--LEFT(MID(B2,MIN(FIND({0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},B2&amp;"0123456789")),99),ROW(1:99))),""))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have assumed that the first alphanumeric string is in cell B2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>

            Have you gone to the MyPhone webpage and tried to log in to make sure your account is ready and in-place?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if the site is down for maintenance (like it is at the time of this writing) that would prevent you from accessing the site.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myphone.microsoft.com</a> <br />
<br />
Once you confirm that you can log-in and that it is not down for maintenance, let us know and we'll pick-up our troubleshooting there...

<p>Allow me to elaborate.&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;may be able to&nbsp;log in to the website using your phone, but the website is meant for PC access for the most part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the MyPhone app on your phone cannot connect to the MyPhone service, then that is an indication that your username and password might be typed incorrectly, or your internet connection is questionable.<br />
<br />
In that case, please log in to the website via your PC (as you already did rathalosrocker), and confirm that the username and password work correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; If they do, then I would consider the following steps:<br />
<br />
1.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the application from your device via Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Remove Programs<br />
2.) Perform a soft reset of your device (consult your documentation on how to accomplish this for your specific device)<br />
3.) Log in to the Microsoft Application Store and re-download/install&nbsp;the MyPhone App.<br />
4.) Try inputting your username/password again to see if you can login.</p>
<p>Let us know what happens!</p>

<p>I don't think its advisable at this point to re-install the App as MS indicated on their Status page they were experiencing Live Login issues.</p>
<p>The problem is now solved and I'm able&nbsp; to sign-in. If you still can't sign-in in the next 30 mins or so, i would then re-install the App</p>

<p>Greetings Micron15!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As I pointed out above the steps 1-4, if the user tried logging-in to the website to confirm their username &amp; password were working correctly, then they would know if the site or service was down for maintenance, as it is currently:<br />
<br />
"The Microsoft<span>Â®</span> My Phone service is temporarily unavailable due to system maintenance."</p>
<p>Hope you have a great weekend!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Constantly Crashing</h2>
                    <p>I am&nbsp;using Windows 8.1&nbsp;Pro x64 with Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium. I'm fully up to date with all Windows updates. I have been using Outlook for one month without incident with two mail accounts: one POP account, and on IMAP account. Today, I added a&nbsp;Microsoft
 Exchange mail account. Now, when launching Outlook 2013 it crashes within a few seconds and I receive a message stating "Microsoft Outlook has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify
 you if a solution is available." Following is the event log entry for the latest crash.</p>

<p>I have a query in your data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the Discount Table, when will the 5% discount be applicable ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it be for zero cost ?&nbsp;&nbsp; (in that case this first column discount percentages will never be applicable</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in your sample data)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will it for those cases where the Total Cost is between 0 and 5000 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel it should be the second way. What is your response ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming this second logic, I have built a HLOOKUP formula.</p>
<p>Pls have a look at the screen shot shown below (and read the explanation below that).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e77577dc-302b-4674-ab18-c8c263b7353a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e77577dc-302b-4674-ab18-c8c263b7353a?upload=true" height="376" width="621" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The formulas used are shown in respective rows of Column-J</p>
<p>2. The formulas are applied in column-F</p>
<p>3. The Column-G "Final Total" ( cell G12 ) has a formula&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =C12-F12&nbsp;&nbsp; (Total cost minus Delivery Discount)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; The formula in column-J shows one character in RED color.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the row-index number for corresponding Discount type.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (You would have learnt this in your class)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example : -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take 2080&nbsp; in cell F15 - it works out as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have used the formula&nbsp;&nbsp; =HLOOKUP(C15,$A$24:$D$27,<strong>4</strong>,1)*C15&nbsp;&nbsp; for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HLOOKUP function tries to search the value of cell C15</p>
<p>in the range $A$24:$D$24</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our first column range for Total Cost in Discount Table is from 0 to 4999</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;second column range for Total Cost in Discount Table is from 5000 to 9999</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;third column range for Total Cost in Discount Table is from&nbsp;10000 and above</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the value in cell C15 is 10400 which is higher than 10000</p>
<p>and since we are using 1 (1 is for TRUE) as the last parameter in our HLOOKUP,</p>
<p>excel will pickup the last column for fetching the percentage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, the second last parameter in&nbsp;this HLOOKUP formula is a 4.</p>
<p>Counting the line numbers in the Discount Table, starting from the row number 24 (see our formula),</p>
<p>the fourth row is for Discount 3.</p>
<p>Hence the formula picks up 20% as the discount for row number 15 computation.</p>
<p>20% of 10400 will be 2080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains the working.</p>

</p><p>The title says it all. &nbsp;I am simply looking for how to change the background color for the control box dropdown list setup using the developer tab. &nbsp;Please I know I can do this using data validation but I am trying to make an internal professional form where
 I have a desire for all the input cells to have a blue background. &nbsp;Data validation doesn't always include the drop down arrow which can make things confusing for people who might not be comfortable with it. &nbsp;Any type of Control box or Active X Box with a
 dropdown will work. &nbsp;Please describe in detail the options. &nbsp;I greatly appreciate the time and consideration into this idea. &nbsp;Have a great day!</p>

<h2>            Karah &#91;Skype&#93; Requested Full List of Skype V8.34.0.78 Issues</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Karah posted: â€œWe are still listening, so please keep your feedback coming on specific problems you may encounter, or start a new thread with your suggestions and discussions.â€ So, after being forced to work with V8.34.0.78 for several days now,
 here it is, and I am posting this to MS Answers and Feedback. Further, I am ABSOLUTELY LIVID, but I will keep it civil.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Improvements</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>One issue that bugged me with the Classic version is when watching online video full screen on the middle monitor, the one with the taskbar (I donâ€™t show the taskbar on the left and right monitors because I need the viewing real estate), I would
 miss calls and messages. Now with V8 a notification pops up during the full screen video.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Yea! At least one good improvement.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />
</span></p>
<span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Everything I am listing below was available and working in Classic Skype, and I am discussing a production desktop, not a mobile device.</span></span></strong></span>
<span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Everything I am listing below was available and working in Classic Skype, and I am discussing a production desktop, not a mobile device.</span></span></strong></span>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />
</span></p>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Critical</span></span>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Headset issue and no Split Window Functionality are killing me!</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Headset Issue:</strong> I have been using various models of a Plantronics wireless headset, a Plantronics wireless dongle, and software with Skype for over a decade. The system works perfectly with Classic Skype, but now it does not because
 you have not turned on a feature that allows the software to be set to Active Only During a Call. Now when I press the headset button to answer a call, it does not. I have to press the headset button and wait for the dongle led to start blinking before I click
 on the Skype icon to answer the call. Then when the call disconnects, the headset should disconnect, but of course it does not, so I forget about it and the battery runs down. Further, if I am away from my desk, I used to be able to hear a call coming in and
 press the headset button to answer it, but now I have to go back to my desk to click on an icon. So because you have not enabled that particular function, I am constantly having to deal with this nightmare of answering, ending, and the battery running down.
 I have invested in the Plantronics system, and I pay for my Skype calling subscription and two online numbers, and now this service has horribly downgraded. This is the most critical function that I need to see fixed immediately.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Additional Headset Issue:</strong> When I make a call, the dialing sounds route to the computer system speakers that I usually donâ€™t have turned on during the day instead of my headset, but when the call connects, it routes to my headset.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Split Window:</strong> This one is harder to explain all the issues of not having the Split Window function like in Classic Skype, but not having it is a complete nightmare and also needs to be fixed immediately.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Split Window Issues:<span><br />
</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No Split Window function has led to my calling or chatting the wrong person.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Canâ€™t clear the right pane after a chat or call, which means the information is there for all to see. That can be a security issue. Adding Split Window function would mean I can simply close the call window.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Skype V8 as currently constructed takes up way too much real estate on my monitors. No Split Window means I canâ€™t separate the Contact list from the right pane, which would allow me to have only the Contacts open in a narrow window,
 which leaves room on that monitor for other work. When I edit I have all three monitors full of windows, so having only the narrow Contacts only list helps tremendously. Please see the accompanying screenshots.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Left Monitor - Note number of visible contacts.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7681f2b4-352f-48da-a3bd-a93f49d992fb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7681f2b4-352f-48da-a3bd-a93f49d992fb?upload=true" /></a></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Three Monitor Editing Layout</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e52c423-2546-40e5-8490-0b7484892d56?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e52c423-2546-40e5-8490-0b7484892d56?upload=true" /></a></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When on a call or chat and another call or chat comes in, I can open that second window to reply that I am on a call, or to chat back, but I lose the first window. The whole thing is so clunky and almost totally unworkable. Again, it
 is hard to explain all of the ramifications, but all of these issues would go away if you implemented the Split Window function like in Classic Skype.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Unworkable<span><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Typing in the message area shows possible misspelled words, but there is no dictionary to add words to.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I see the flag on the icons indicating that there is/are an unread something(s), but finding it/them is a nightmare. Again, how about simple Contacts and Recent lists.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It only downloads files to Downloads or another selected file in Settings. There is no option to use the Save As dialogue. This makes a ton of extra work having to then go to Downloads and move the files to their proper locations. Remember,
 this is a production machine, and I was brought up learning files, folders, and paths.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Call Forwarding and Voicemail now opens in Settings\Calling instead of a Browser, Yea! However, it still does not remember the forwarding country and phone number. This clunky operation makes me not forward calls to my mobile phone
 when I am out.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I do a lot of tech support type calling, so I need not just the start time and duration, but also the end time, because I have spreadsheets for each client that shows date, start time, and stop time, which then calculates the duration,
 cost, and lists what the call was about. Not having the end time on the call/chat page again makes it unworkable.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Lists Issues:<span><br />
</span></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Canâ€™t change the order of the Favorites to get them arranged like I want them, and then the order keeps changing with the most recent popping to the top, which makes it difficult to find the contact in my Favorites.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Suggested section makes no sense, useless, and takes up vertical space in the list.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Canâ€™t compact the lists and do away to with the images to get more contacts to show on the on the lists.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Chat list, Calls list, and Contacts list instead of simply Contacts and Recent makes no sense for a desktop environment, but I do see that implementation on mobile devices. Why you would then think that is a good idea for a desktop
 environment is beyond me.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Classic I had in Contacts, Favorites first in the order I wanted them, followed by Active Skype contacts, and then inactive Skype and Phone Only contacts. This was very workable. What you have now is not workable.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Nuisances<span><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><del>When on a video call, there is a nuisance second small video only window that appears on top of other windows every time the focus goes away from the Skype calling pane, even though the Skype window still shows the same video.
 Interesting idea, but the implementation needs work, for example, it should appear if the Skype window closes, minimizes, or is covered by another window.</del>&nbsp; Settings&gt;Calling&gt;Show call window when Skype is in the background. However, if we want the call
 window, then it should only appear when Skype is closed to the System tray instead of a focus change.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Every time I start the computer, I have to relocate the Skype window to the left of my three monitors and extend the size all the way down. I then close the window, and it reopens to that location, but I have to extend the size again.
 I then close it and open it, and it then stays where and how I want it.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Conclusion<span><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>A production desktop is a working environment, not a mobile, social media device. The best approach is to have a stand-alone desktop version and a mobile version, where the desktop version interface is more like Classic Skype. Line, Viber, Signal,
 and WhatsApp have desktop versions, and others are working theirs.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Further, the two critical issues need to be fixed immediately!&nbsp; And while you are fixing it, let us use Classic Skype for Desktop again.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

            Extremely well said, the addition of pictures makes it more than helpful. Skype Classic should remain as it was for desktop users while mobile moves to Skype 8. All features you listed were available in Classic and the time it would take to wait for them
 to be implemented is not time any of us can particularly afford.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your well worded response to what they asked of us, my suggestion as someone who has been trying to get them to listen for the past week is to vote on this item on the uservoice forum&nbsp;https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welcome-to-skype-ideas/suggestions/36538813-update-the-back-end-of-skype-7-to-make-it-compatib<br />
<br />
It is, as of now, the primary reason we have been told Skype Classic is not available.<br />

<p>Thank you for the detailed write-down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, I might have missed it... Just in case, I would like to add the command line switches, like e.g /Secondary which allows to run a second instance of Skype for Desktop (Classic aka v7) using a different account. This is quite essential to me to have
 both - personal and business - accounts open at the same time. I do not want to have business contacts in my private account and vice versa.</p>

            anyone ben able to paste a conference call PIN into the dialpad in a call in Skype 8? I've had that not work in so many versions of Skype 8 that I've stayed on 7 but last week Skype force upgraded - cutting me off in the *middle of a call* which is the
 most appallingly bad experience I've ever had for a product I *pay for* to make calls with - so I get to find how badly broken this is now. I had one build of Skype 8 where you couldn't even type in a conference PIN by hand because the 0 key didn't work once
 in a call!!!!

                    How do you copy a formula and paste it to a column without the formula ascending?&nbsp; E.G. F8*G6+F8.&nbsp; I want F8 to ascend but G6 to always stay as G6 as I copy and paste down a column.&nbsp; Right now I am manually having to change G6 because as I paste the formula
 into the ascending column the formula changes to F9*G7+F9, F10*G8+F10, etc.

            I do not see how that formula will calculate G6. Once you paste the formula into anorther worksheet you may have to edit it to refer to the correct cell in the new worksheet before you fill it down.
<br />
<br />
If this is not clear you need to explain where the formula is copied from in the first work sheet and where it is copied to in the second. Then explain which cells you are filling it to and what you want to happen. Please read the discussion in Excel help about
 relative and absolute references.<br />

<h2>            Word &#40;Mac&#41; Zoom in&#47;out issues</h2>
                    <p>For some strange reasons, whenever I try to zoom in or out of a particular page on Word (so I can see more or less content of
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that</span>&nbsp;page), Word screen jumps to a random page of the document. Say for example I try to zone into page 36, it jumps to page 94.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure that my cursor is still on the right page (i.e. I didn't accidentally click on the random page when I zoom), because when I type something it appears on the original page.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;If using a Might mouse it could be the Mouse. Even though I just bought a new OLED F-Key MacBook Pro with&nbsp;over-sized Track Pad. I prefer using a Mouse. However, I may have to quit&nbsp;using the Mouse. Because&nbsp;it is so sensitive, what&nbsp;I am viewing constantly
 bouncing up or down or side to side if&nbsp;I just lay my hand on it. So it is possible then you may be jumping pages not knowing you are. If someone else has heard of your issue, I hope they will post.</p>

            The data warning can not be disabled. You can't even use a macro to disable or click the warning message for you because the warning displays before VBA code runs.
<div><br />
<div>What's needed is an additional option to always trust the data source. Please take a moment to suggest to Microsoft that they include such an option in a future release of Excel. To display the suggestion form go to Excel's Help menu and choose Send Feedback.&nbsp;</div>

            In a nutshell: Yes. Simply connect one device at a time and your data will sync. Both device will have the same data.

<h2>            Code from 2010 doesn&#39;t run in 2007</h2>
                    <p>I know this is a common topic, so let me start by saying that I've removed a missing reference to Outlook14 and replaced it with the corresponding reference to Outlook12. I've also reviewed lists of 2010 vs 2007 differences such as:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee836187.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee836187.aspx</a>
</p>


<p>I have a program that has two userforms, pulls data from Outlook messages, and allows the end user to manage a set of data. I have 2010 on my machine, so I don't have the option to develop on 2007 and migrate upward, I am stuck developing in 2010 and troubleshooting
 when necessary.</p>

<p>The current symptom is that when the workbook is opened and macros are enabled, I immediately get a
<em>System error &amp;H80004005 (-2147467259) Unspecified error</em>. The error only occurs once macros are enabled, and happens immediately when macros are enabled (before any code is triggered). There is no workbook_open code. The VBA code is triggered by an
 active X button on the visible sheet.</p>

<p>When the activeX button is clicked, it gives a <em>Microsoft Visual Basic Automation Error Unspecified Error</em> message. When I try to walk the code, as soon as I hit F8 I get the same error. Same thing happens if I go directly to the Userform_initialize
 sub and try to start there. So, I'm unable to find a line of code where it crashes, in order to start troubleshooting there.</p>

<p>I don't believe I have added any sprites to my userform (per <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230888</a>) and I'm not getting an out of memory error.</p>

<p>The only active add-ins are analysis toolpak and analysis toolpak for VBA</p>

<p>This is the first 'complicated' userform I've created since being migrated to Excel 2010; it includes 2 userforms, multipage controls, a monthview control, and I had some DTP controls that have since been removed. Lots of listboxes (including multicolumn),
 textboxes, checkboxes, commandbuttons, etc. I have yet to find any documentation that suggests something in 2010 was not available in 2007 and would cause errors.</p>

<p>The actual list of VBA references on my 2010 machine is:</p>
<p>Visual Basic for Applications</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel 14.0 Object Library</p>
<p>OLE automation</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 14.0 Object Library</p>
<p>Microsoft forms 2.0 Object Library</p>
<p>Ref Edit Control</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Common Controls-2 6.0 (SP3)</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0 (SP3)</p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook 14.0 Object Library</p>

<p>on the 2007 machine, it defaults on opening to:</p>
<p>Visual Basic for Applications</p>
<p>Microsoft Excel <strong>12.0</strong> Object Library</p>
<p>OLE automation</p>
<p>Microsoft Office <strong>12.0</strong> Object Library</p>
<p>Microsoft forms 2.0 Object Library</p>
<p>Ref Edit Control</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Common Controls-2 6.0 (SP3)</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0 (SP3)</p>
<p><strong>MISSING:</strong> Microsoft Outlook 14.0 Object Library</p>

<p>I replace the Outlook 14.0 reference with the corresponding Outlook 12.0 reference, but I'm still getting the error and am unable to run the code.</p>

<p>The code is quite long, so it seems unwise to post it all here, and the workbook contains some confidential company data so I can't post it on the web for others to peruse... so at this point I'm really just looking for ideas of other things I can check.</p>

<p>For example, if one of those other references (such as common controls 6.0) weren't installed or registered on the target machine, I'm assuming it would also show as missing, and not just fail when the code is run?</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Keith</p>

Correct. And the solution for Outlook is not to use early binding, use late binding always at runtime. Use early binding only during development.
<br />
<br />
Note: You can set the conditional define in the project properties.<br />
<br />
Remove the reference to Outlook, change any declaration that refers to an Outlook object and add some Const declaration for missing Outlook constants.<br />

            <p>Andreas- I hadn't even been sure it was Outlook related, but after reading your response I commented out all the Outlook code and removed the reference, and that did get rid of my error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only used late binding once, on a project many years ago. I'll work with your code sample, but if you (or anyone) has
<strong>any suggestions for good references</strong> on how to convert existing early binding code to late binding, I could use a refresher just so I can see more examples of the pre- and post- conversion code and how that relates to the object model. For example,
 I wasn't sure what <em>set the conditional define in the project properties </em>
meant; I found the conditional compilation argument line (which I've never used) but I'm not sure what goes in there, this is new territory for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll post back shortly as to whether I can get your snippet working in my file!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Since I have this narrowed down to outlook anyway, that is a small enough chunk of code I think it is worth posting to get feedback. I have two modules here, one looks at the active/selected email to pull data, and the other creates emails to send out.</p>

            <blockquote>For example, I wasn't sure what <em>set the conditional define in the project properties
</em>meant; I found the conditional compilation argument line (which I've never used) but I'm not sure what goes in there, this is new territory for me.</blockquote>
At first I have to say that the line "On Error GoTo 0" is missing in my example, I've forgotten to enable the error handler after the connection to Outlook is established. I've changed the code above.<br />
<br />
You can set a conditional define in a code module with the #CONST statement, but that affects only this code module.<br />
<br />
For example if you copy the sub Test from above into a regular module in a new file and you compile the code, you get no errors, because the conditional define if not in affect, means the line<br />
&nbsp; Dim olApp As Object<br />
is compiled.<br />
<br />
If you add the line<br />
&nbsp; #Const Develop = 1<br />
at the top of the module and compile the code again, you'll get an error, because the line<br />
&nbsp; Dim olApp As Outlook.Application<br />
is used from the compiler.<br />
<br />
There is no difference until this point between the conditional define in the code module or the conditional define in the project properties.<br />
<br />
But now add another regular module and move the line<br />
&nbsp; #Const Develop = 1<br />
to that module. If you try to compile the project, you'll get no error.<br />
<br />
And now open the project properties and add the line<br />
&nbsp; Develop = 1<br />
into the field "Conditional Compilation Arguments". Click Ok and try to compile the project.
<br />
<br />
As you see you get an error; because that define is valid for the whole project.<br />
<br />
BTW, you should use the same GetObject/CreateObject part to access Outlook in sub EMail_Alert.<br />

            <p>Hey Charlie</p>
<p>Sure is easy with the Windows version. Unfortunately, the Mac Outlook does not have this feature. I'd recommend you provide feedback to Microsoft using the Help menu in the app or just using the link below.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just changed the memory in use for messages(in message settings)&nbsp;from C: to E: (memory card). I am now unable to see my old messages which were in my inbox, sent items, my folders and the emails set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone tell me where I can find the messages on the memory card once the settings are changed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your advice and help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the above or this workaround..</p>
<p>select Phone Memory for messages.</p>
<p>connect to PC thru'&nbsp;OVI Suite and sync messages...</p>
<p>Disconnect from PC...</p>
<p>Now change the destination to Memory Card and connect the phone again.</p>
<p>Click on the Phone Icon at the Bottom Left.. Drag and Drop the messages from OVI suite to the Phone Messaging folders...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never done this but you may try..</p>

            When u swap back memory it should show under that memory selection or you can transfer them as suggested
