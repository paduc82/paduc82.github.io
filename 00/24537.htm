    <title>Un-bolding the subject of Unread Emails&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Un-bolding the subject of Unread Emails&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2010 bolded the Sender in unread message list.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 for some reason bolds the subject for me.&nbsp; This makes it extremely difficult readability-wise.&nbsp; Terribly cluttered looking inbox now, and my eye/brain feels dissheveled by the visual mess.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out how to bold and unbold the sender name:&nbsp; Views &gt; Change View &gt; Modify &gt; Conditional Formatting &gt; Font &gt; Bold<br />
<br />
How do I unbold the subject?<br />

<p>As the saying goes - "Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a more serious note - whether the subject line is bolded or not depends on how the folder is organized. As a for instance, if you have the &lt;Inbox&gt; set to be shown &lt;By Account&gt; and then &lt;By Sender&gt; - then the "Sender" will be bolded as long as there are
 unread messages from that Sender. How the subject line appears depends on how much room there is (how much room a right-most reading pane takes up and&nbsp;how big the screen size is&nbsp;etc etc. There are any number of different ways that messages in the Inbox can
 get shown with different layouts on different screen sizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't have time to check all the variations ranging from an 8" Win tablet thru to 24" monitors but bottomline - there is always going to be a way (or more possibly better stated -&nbsp; "the need") to distinguish "unread" messages one way or the other which you
 will not be able to over-ride as Brian has correctly noted. Personally, would never want to see an option to make it impossible to distinguish an &lt;Unread&gt; message from a &lt;Read&gt; message - would drive me absolutely nuts (just as a counter viewpoint to the &lt;how
 good or bad something looks&gt; but to each their own).</p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, in Office 2010, the subject goes from unbold black to unbold gray when you read the email.&nbsp; You can see the font color change in my screen cap above.</p>

<p>I already described how to bold the sender.&nbsp; Step by step instructions above. What I want is to unbold the subject.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"How the subject line appears depends on how much room there is"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are describing the completely revamped layout when you expand the particular frame extremely wide.&nbsp; It completely changes everything.&nbsp; That is not what I am talking about.&nbsp; Im talking about taking the existing view, and unbolding the subject.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else familiar with customizing views and can give some help on unbolding the subject?</p>

<p>
</p><p>One of the joys and benefits of spending time here in the forum is learning from the vastly more educated. To that end, perhaps you can educate me and whomever else doesn't understand - what exactly was incorrect in reference to Brian's response ("Unread
 messages have always had bolded subjects.&nbsp; That's how you tell they're unread.&nbsp; As far as I know, there's no setting to modify that.) along with where the article pointed to by KR22 differs from that? (Subject lines not bolded are ones that have been read
 - look <strong>&lt;REAL CLOSE&gt;</strong> at the icons and the only one that has not been dealt with (replied/forwarded) etc is the top one which is
<strong>BOLDED</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both '2010 and '2013 the Sender remains bolded if there are unread messages under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That hasn't changed in O'2013 &lt;except&gt; as noted - depends on the space available - hence 2 screenshots of the identical items - first screenshot shows unbolded subject lines with a blue stripe beside unread messages and second&nbsp;shows bolded subject lines
 for all &lt;unread&gt; messages.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>So please do correct what I may have misunderstood and perhaps elaborate on what you mean by
</p>
<p>"I don't like it and it drives me crazy" since it sounds like&nbsp;essentially what you want is having all&nbsp;subject lines to be unbolded whether read or not (along with no other indicator) so that there would be absolutely no way to identify an undread&nbsp;message?
 &nbsp;Your basis for this being a productivity improvement is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference between O'2010 and O'2013 is that the subject line always remains bolded in '2010 regardless of how space is available as opposed to '2013's blue stripe indicator</p>

            Does anyone have a solution to this? I have spent hours trying to unbold the subject line. I've gone through all the settings, i recently upgraded to 2016 Microsoft 365 and am so upset that they would change this and have no way for my inbox to look the
 way it used to, why change what isnt broken?

</p><p>Windows used to have one that worked for that but it was deprecated several versions ago.&nbsp; It is still in Windows for legacy work (images two or more years old) but anything made more recently won't restore anymore.&nbsp; It will soon be removed.&nbsp; Don't use it
 for making new images. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not a Windows 7 image backup.&nbsp; It is a Windows 10 image backup on a page misnamed "Windows 7."&nbsp; It will restore from a Windows 7 backup to a Windows 10 system.&nbsp; The image creation tool on that page does NOT work anymore for new images.&nbsp; Once and for
 all, MSFT deprecated this tool two years ago.&nbsp; It was heavily discussed in this forum at the time and pleas to MSFT via the Feedback Hub to update and maintain it failed.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to all of the previously mentioned suggestions, I would advise using an imaging program that you run with bootable media to both create the image, and to restore it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bootable media is required to restore the image regardless...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some imaging programs require that you install them to create the bootable media... Some make the bootable ISO available separately, and some come in a retail version already on bootable media... (Acronis in particular)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I suggest this is that it will prevent the accumulation of a bunch stuff on your machine that runs in the background, and simply clutters things up...</p>

<h2>            Bing Product Ratings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone have an idea on how to add product ratings for Bing Shopping? Google has xml feed upload options, even for small sellers upon approval. Curious if there's a way to do this in Bing, too.<br />

            Hi Rich,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you can't open emails.&nbsp; In most cases, this happens if you're using an Outlook app on your computer or have an issue setting up your account. We need to identify what's causing your emails to flash in your mailbox. Do you access
 your account online through Outlook.com or do you use an outlook app? Also, does it happen if you access your account on another device?

            The trial version of Office for Mac 2011 includes all applications, however, when the trial is expired then you need to purchase an Office for Mac 2011 license.
<div><br />
<div>If you purchase the Home &amp; Student version then Outlook is not included. You must either purchase the Home &amp; Business version to get Outlook or upgrade your Home &amp; Student version to Home &amp; Business.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to map metropolitan statistical areas (MSA's) in 3D maps. They MSA's are not recognized by Bing. Does anyone know how to find any custom regions that map out MSA's for Excel 3D maps? I.E. any premade files.</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the following steps based on my test to import a Metropolitan Statistical Areas Dataset (which is a .csv file):</p>
<p>1. Open your workbook &gt; <strong>Data</strong> &gt; in the <strong>Get &amp; Transform Data</strong> group, click
<strong>From Txt/CSV</strong>;</p>
<p>2. Browse to the dataset file &gt; Open &gt; Import &gt; select <strong>Based on entire dataset</strong> &gt; Load;</p>
<p>3. Open 3D Map and now you can add data in the dataset to your 3D Map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any further concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a .csv file that contains data of different cities. But I'm afraid we cannot share the file. You may check if your file has the same file extension. If yours is also a .csv file, you my try my steps, and if you have any further questions during these
 steps, please feel free to post back and let us further assist you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your file isn't a .csv file, I'd appreciate if you could tell us more details about the file so that we could test it for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to help you with your issue in allowing your domain admin to reset passwords and allowing you to register your email account name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made some adjustments on your domain account. Your admins may now reset the password of your domain&nbsp;users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For&nbsp;the meantime, the system won't allow you to register your desired email address because it contains blocked word. I will escalate this issue to our product experts for further evaluation and review. We will give you updates at the earliest possible time
 through this thread. Your patience is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> billbosto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Sync Band2 via android phone or windows 10 sync app</h2>
                    <p>My band2 stopped syncing via my galaxy s6 edge+ phone or the windows 10 sync app on my laptop on 12/18/2015.&nbsp; I get the following error on both.</p>
<p><strong>Something went wrong. Please check your network connection and try again.</strong></p>
<p>There isn't anything wrong with my network - since I am streaming music and sending and receiving email etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have tried the obligatory uninstall and reinstall of the phone and windows sync apps etc...</p>
<p>Any idea what this error really means?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bluetooth is fine...since I make changes on the phone and they show up on the band.</p>
<p>The band seems fine...since it is still showing sleep, steps, runs, notifications etc...</p>
<p>It seems that the data on the web dashboard is corrupt and can't be updated with new data from the band via the phone app?</p>
<p>At this point I would be willing to start over completely, since I only have about a month of data, but I don't see any way to "reboot" the web dashboard.</p>
<p>The only thing that has changed since I started using the band in November - I&nbsp;changed phones....from a windows to a galaxy phone in early December...but the&nbsp;sync via the galaxy phone worked for about a week before it stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any insights are appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble syncing data from your Microsoft Band 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you attempted syncing from a different computer or phone?</p>
<p>I understand you have uninstalled and reinstalled the Health and Desktop apps, please do a complete process uninstall and reinstall:</p>
<p>Unregister your Band from the Health app <br />
Unpair your Band from your phone<br />
Delete the Health app from the phone and the Sync app from PC<br />
Restart phone and PC<br />
Reset your Microsoft Band<br />
Install the Health app and Sync app for PC from the Store<br />
Proceed with setting up Band again</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting purposes, consider creating a new Microsoft account, resetting and associating&nbsp;Band,&nbsp;then syncing through the Desktop sync app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of your results.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick response...but as usual...you try and find a solution for hours...finally give up and post a question...and then after posting, do a little more digging and stumble across a solution! At least in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a section in the help that referred to reconnecting you band that I didn't think was relevant to my case because the app on the phone was paired and working with the band - except for syncing...but reading the details it referred to "rebooting" the
 band and in the process you select your phones operating system - duh!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I completed the reconnecting the band to the phone process and bingo</strong>!....all is right in the world of band syncing via my phone and the windows 10&nbsp;sync app!&nbsp;&nbsp; I did loose all data&nbsp;in the band - but so it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a consumer and not an&nbsp;engineer or programmer etc...so it would have been nice to have&nbsp;received an error message that was a little more specific to the actual issue or at least in the help support section some reference to the steps you should take when
 changing phones....especially phones with different operating systems.</p>
<p>It all makes sense now...but to a consumer, if you download the app and pair up the band&nbsp;then everything is good to go&nbsp;in your mind.&nbsp; Hopefully, this will help someone in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, <strong>if you change your phone, especially with a different operating system, then complete the reconnecting your band process in the&nbsp;help/support section and you should be able to sync your data.
</strong>&nbsp;</p>

            My Band 2 is connected to my Android Phone (Version 6.0.1). As soon as I go away (without my phone) the bluetooth connection is lost (correct!). But when I return to the phone the Band doesn't get a bluetooth connection to the phone anymore. Also after
 restart of band and phone, turning bluetooth on and off at band and phone, uninstall and reinstall of the Microsoft Health app... My boyfriend doesn't has this problem. The problem is solved after a total reset of the Band, but this can't be a solution week
 after week... I would be very happy about a helpful solution. Thank you.

            I have a Windows 10 phone and it cannot sync after I sleep at night. I lose my sleep data. Why can't it connect to my desktop and sync my data? Why will it only sync the data over blue tooth and it always fails after I have a sleep session?

            Have either of you emailed shazam and asked them when they plan to release a version for S^3?<br />

They are the only people that can tell you, not Nokia.<br />

Also rumour has it that the S60v5 version works on the N8 but you will have to google to find the unofficial download.

<p>Download the free Revo Uninstaller: <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp;(download the trial and then you will have a choice between the free version and the trial version and choose the free version) and install it and run it.&nbsp; It should show InstallIQ Updater
 and possible InstallIQ as well.&nbsp; Click on it/them and choose to remove it/them (one at at time if applicable)&nbsp;using Advanced Mode.&nbsp; That should take care of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, contact InstallIQ Updater support at: <a href="http://www.w3i.com/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I'm so sorry, I guess I'm just frustrated. AVG allowed InstallIQ Updater to download. I was using the free version, have for many years. This was 9/9/11. I tried updating AVG and couldn't. Let it go for awhile. Then tried to download an update for Java and
 couldn't, didn't have time to explore the problem. Several weeks went by and all I would use my computer for was to check e-mails so forgot about the problem and ignored the update requests for Java and Adobe. I finally called AVG support and the tech had
 me uninstall AVG then reinstall, which failed. Then I started searching on the internet about InstallIQ and that finally led me to here. Sorry I do not have MSE installed, I doubt IU would let it be installed. I have downloaded Revo, it's taken hours for the
 program to create a system restore point which failed. It is just now (10:30 pm pst) trying to uninstall IU. I have also e-mailed W3i support, have not heard from them as of yet, but they did say it would be within 48 hrs. I asked my question around 9 am pst.
 The preparing to remove window has been up for more than an hour now.&nbsp; Yes I did try to uninstall in safe mode. I thougt it removed but when I returned to normal it was still there. I have been out of a regular job and cannot afford to take my computer to
 a repairman, so I'm trying everything I can on my own. I do plan on installing MSE, now that I know about it when this is cleaned up. Thank you so much for your time &amp; help.</p>

            <p>HI Teel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's great - I was sure Revo would work (but as you say, it can sometimes take time especially with something like this).&nbsp; I'm a bit concerned you couldn't create a restore point - I hope that doesn't mean you are infected - but we'll get there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make sure you install MSE correctly and with the proper preparation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE. This means not only current ones but any EVER
 (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<b>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a
 scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</b></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></b></a><span> Note: hold off on your one last primary and in-use
 real time protection AV program until after you have downloaded MSE so you will be protected during the download, then remove it as described above, and then you can install MSE. That will be covered more later.&nbsp; This is especially true for AVG which was probably
 uninstalled but not properly removed using the tool: <a href="http://www.avg.com/ww-en/utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.avg.com/ww-en/utilities</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the PC and
 like any battery can eventually run down).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Then, restart your PC if any changes were made.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you previously tried to install MSE but it didn't work, then it's best to first make sure anything remaining from that attempt is completely removed as well before starting.

 - but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product. You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time. Note: hold off on your one last
 primary and in-use real time protection AV program until after you have downloaded MSE so you will be protected during the download, then remove it as described above, and then you can install MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span> and click on more languages and versions and then
 choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. Do NOT choose the button for the Beta. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, close anything using the internet and uninstall and fully
 remove your one remaining AV program as described above, then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is
 as safe as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine
 and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining
 the infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help or the scan found infections, then there's a good chance you may be infected by more malware. Please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:
</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current
 AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this
 and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you
 can ignore the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Every time I click outlook the page loads then a few seconds later it loads the same page again. This effectively doubles my bandwidth usage. I only have a limited amount of bandwidth per month so this is a major concern. This does not happen when I load

<p>Should I go back to an earlier version of IE?</p>

<h2>            VBA Exporting worksheet to another workbook as values</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have put together a macro that exports a worksheet to another workbook. &nbsp;My problem is that I need to transfer over as values. &nbsp;The code I'm using is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub SaveAs()<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim FName &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim FPath &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As String<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim NewBook &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Workbook<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; FPath = "E:\Payroll"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; FName = "Payroll_" &amp; Range("JOBID") &amp; "_" &amp; Format(Date, "mmddyy") &amp; ".xlsx"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Set NewBook = Workbooks.Add<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ThisWorkbook.Sheets("PayrollExport").Copy Before:=NewBook.Sheets(1)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If Dir(FPath &amp; "\" &amp; FName) &lt;&gt; "" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MsgBox "File " &amp; FPath &amp; "\" &amp; FName &amp; " already exists"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NewBook.SaveAs Filename:=FPath &amp; "\" &amp; FName<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how I could change the syntex to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I would also like the new workbook to automatically save and close. &nbsp;Right now the new one stays open.</p>

<h2>            SP time zone settings, access denied&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm trying to change the time zone settings for our Sharepoint Online. I go to regional settings and change it to UTC+01:00 from UTC-08:00, I click OK and I get a page that says "Access denied"... I am the owner of the Sharepoint Online site and main Admin
 of Office365. I can click "request access" and if I do that my request will come up in "Access requests and invitations", I can then accept myself and give me full access, but still I can't change the regional settings.</p>
<p>What is up with this? I need to change the regional settings because we are 9 hours a head and our staff is a bit confused right now.</p>

                </div>

<p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>From the error message you got, it seems that you didn't enable custom script which is needed when we do some site settings. Given this situation, please refer to this article
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f?ui=en-US&amp;=amp&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Turn scripting capabilities on or off</a>&nbsp;to select <strong>Allow users to run custom script on personal sites</strong> and
<strong>Allow users to run custom script on self-service created sites</strong> to check the outcome.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: it may take up to 24 hours for the change to take effect.</p>
<p>If you still can’t do regional settings after 24 hours, please post back and we'll further investigate it.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Sky</p>

<h2>            Word VBA - How to copy sentence in Word document to 2nd column of a table</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm trying to stop having to repeatedly copy action items in our meeting minutes and paste them to the Action Items table located near the end of the minutes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDITED ORIGINAL QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to see if there is a Word macro that will copy a sentence (the action item)&nbsp;</span>if I select it and then have the code to paste the sentence to a cell in the 2nd column of the table? And so one, with each sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a little code I've pieced together. It works by me selecting my sentence/action item, then running the code, but I don't think the If statement is correct. I'm asking if the cell in the table is blank then paste the sentence, but the code never
 shows that the cell is blank using</span>&nbsp;If Len(.Cell(r, 2).Range.Text) = 0 so it skips to Exit Sub.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to see if anyone can make the code below to accomplish what I need, but also would like to know why Len(.Cell(r, 2).Range.Text) = 0 doesn't show that a cell in the table is empty when the cell *is* empty?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If anyone knows of a more automated way to have the code to copy any sentence that contains '(see Action Item)' at the end to the cells in the 2nd column of the table, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Word does some strange things "behind the curtain". Although the end-of-cell symbol appears as a single "character", internally it consists of two characters: a paragraph mark (ASCII 13) and a BEL character (ASCII 7). I think that's because the end-of-cell
 can also function as the paragraph mark of the last paragraph in the cell, and Word needs the internal data structure to store its paragraph properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also applies to the end-of-row symbol that appears to the right of the last cell in each row.</p>

<h2>            Why does OneNote 2010 keep changing my formatting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a template set up in OneNote 2010 for tchnical case management notes. I noticed not long ago that I was leaning in to read my notes and that was hurting my neck. I highlighted everything on my template, changed the font size fropm 11 to 14 pt., and
 re-saved the template. I noticed that some things were pasting in at the smaller font size and went in to the options under the File tab and changed the default font to 14 pt.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;some bullet lists in the template, including my main notes section. The first line is fine as&nbsp;14 pt. but once I hit return and start typing, it reverts to the 11 pt. Why is it doing this? How do I fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>In onenote 2010, the only style you can modify is "Normal'. </p>
<p>Did you have a blank templete or did the template have any default data. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any pre existing data in template which was created when normal style template was using font size 11, then that editing area will continue with the same font size.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To change it, you need to highlight the entire text&gt; click on the drop down for styles&gt; select normal.

            <p>Using Office Mobile App, since June of 2013, A package with Excel, word, and powerpoint with majority of functionality and formulas has been compatible with iphone and iPad both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That WAS true for IOS7. However, IOS 8 Apple software is NOT compatible with Excel. This is extremely disappointing and I am hoping an update comes out to fix this. Cannot express how devastated I am about this loss of functionality. Apple will not allow
 me to restore to IOS 7 and Microsoft hasn't fixed this bug and May have no plans to.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook&#39;s Junk Email Settings blocks attachments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sbi1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook&#39;s Junk Email Settings blocks attachments</h2>
                    I am receiving an email on a regular basis from a specific sender. The sender's address and the sender's domain are both in the Safe Sender List. In addition, the box "<i>Also trust email from my contacts</i>" under
<b>Junk Mail Options</b>&nbsp;is checked, and this email address (of the sender) is in my contacts.
<div>Yet, all attachments from this sender are blocked. As soon as click (again...)
<i>Add Sender to safe senders list</i>&nbsp;the attachment shows up in the body of the email. If I close Outlook and re-open it the attachment will appear in the normal place where attachments usually are.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is really annoying. It's not my anti virus, it is clearly controlled by the Junk Email filter built into Outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone knows why is it and how to fix it once and for all?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook 2007</div>

<div>Not sure what you mean by "embedded", but whoever sends the email attach either pictures, or PP files, or even .pdf files to the email. Attachments from this specific sender refuse to show unless I click

<div>There was another sender with the same problem but I think that I 'fixed' his problem.</div>

<div>Trust Center - <i>Don't download pictures automatically</i>, however I also have the box underneath checked (<i>Permit downloads in messages from senders in safe list</i>).</div>

            <p>Embedded: you don't have to open&nbsp;an image&nbsp;attachment to view it. If the attachments aren't images, then&nbsp;this doesn't apply, but even so, you are permitting safe senders,&nbsp;so images should display.

<p>Attachments in the message body = RTF formatted message. Is only this sender affected? There might be something their mail server does that causes problems for outlook.

            It can't be their mail server because I am getting their email on another computer perfectly fine. It is definitely something within this specific Outlook and it's Junk Mail settings.

            Unfortunately, there is no generic update to WM6.1.&nbsp; OS Updates are generally provided by the OEMs and are not directly distributed to end-users.&nbsp; Have you tried a factory reset to see if this resolves the problem.
