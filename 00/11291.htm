            This can happen if you have your antivirus program configured to scan mail, particularly the outgoing mail. &nbsp;Disable all mail scanning. &nbsp;You don't need it.

<h3> muddblues  say:</h3>
<h2>            System tray, date and time missing from Tasksbar in Windows 10, SOLUTION</h2>
                    <p>I had this problem after updating in windows 10 - my time and date were missing and nothing I tried helped, even after trying several ideas on this forum that helped some but not others (strangely).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I experimented myself and did the following which helped me- hopefully it will help others as it is a SUPER EASY fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Right click the system tray at the bottom of your screen where your time and date are missing.<br />
RESULT: The settings menu opens.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>2) Select Taskbar Settings from the menu (on my settings menu it was the very last option).<br />
</p>
<p>3) Navigate to the field titled: Taskbar location on Screen. (On my settings screen it was the first field beneath all the ON/OFF button options somewhere in the middle of the screen - I had to scroll down just a bit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Click the drop-down arrow to the right of the Taskbar Location on screen box and change the taskbar location from Bottom (or wherever you currently have it located- most people have it on the bottom) to Left.&nbsp; (Note: You can change it to anything other
 than what you currently have -&nbsp; If you currently have it on the Left, change it to something else).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Result: The system tray appears on your screen in the location that you selected. (Note: When I did this, I could see my time and date again on the left side of the screen and was thrilled it was still there.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp; Change it back to Bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Result: The time and date should now appear on the bottom of your screen in the system tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this works for others as it did for me because it was so easy. I've never posted a new discussion here but I know others are struggling with this issue and there were all these complicated procedures suggested by others in good faith to fix it and
 for me, none of those worked so I wanted to help others with this quick fix. I really hope it works for you all!</p>

<h2>            Full C mem in N97 with hardly any in it which I installed</h2>
                    
<p>I have not yet solved the full memory problem in C memory. Today was really bad. I cannot even send any smses. I have only Quickoffice as an application. It does not work if it is transferred to Ememory.</p>
<p>Is phone memory only 72.9mB in Nokia 97? Or is it just my phone memory that is saying so? E memory and SD memory are almost empty.Images and downloaded apps such as timer, flash light etc are in E memory.</p>

<p>Crippled phone memory is the fate of N97, there are numerous articles on the web as how to handle and maintain phone memory, particularly, on N97.&nbsp;&nbsp;I gues the available phone memory for the end user is only 55mb on the N97.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete unwanted text messages from the phone and clear cache in the web browser, check whether the camera is not using phone memory to store images. If nothing works, I'm afraid, soft reset is the way to go *#7370#.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I have just learnt how to use PC suite and do backups....it seems taht C memory has only 0.13mb of the 72 mb ...which is really my stuff such as QuickOffice - no messages, no inmages&nbsp; etc. I'll probably take it to Nokia care /agent for reset. I do not want
 to do it myself as I am afraid I'll not be able to reinstall Quickoffice &amp; adobe properly.</p>

<p>If you bought quick office and Adobe, you should have received an activation code, or registered your phone so would be able to reinstall and re-activate. Taking to a care point will not stop a reset removing software from C phone memory !!</p>
<p>The safest and most successful way to reset your phone is to backup Contacts, Calendar and Notes ONLY with Ovi suite or your Ovi Account , then as suggested , dial *#7370# followed by 12345 and then set up your phone manually. Install anything you can on
 E and don't install anything you don't really need on C.</p>
<p>The reset will give the maximum available memory on C, and as long as you have over 20meg left the N97 will work fine&nbsp;:smileywink:</p>
<p>I would also suggest installing a file manager like X-Plore Symbian and trying RamBlow to help with memory management.</p>
<p>A reset will take a couple of hours start to finish, nothing on E will be affected, and if you go to a cre centre the phone could be away for a few days/weeks and you would still have to reinstall your apps.</p>
<p>The reason for not doing a full backup and restore is that your current setup may be causing a problem and re-installing it would also re-install the problem !</p>
<p>Bite the bullet and give it a go, it won't kill the phone, would also re-install the firmware whilst you're at it as it can't do any harm. I've had an N97 for nearly 2yrs and have reset it on multiple occasions, including for every software update and to
 regain memory .</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Attachments opening on wrong monitor</h2>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm encountering something that is more of an annoyance than a real problem. I have a Windows X Optiplex 980 with two monitors attached via DVI and a Wall mounted TV screen attached via HDMI behind my desk that I use to give presentations in my office.
 Whenever I open an Outlook 2010 attachment, it opens on the TV screen rather then my primary monitor. Is there some way to control on which monitor attachments open? I tried the trick where you maximize and window the attachment and drag it over to where you
 want it to open, then maximize, window, and close again and it works great- but only for that attachment. Other, new attachments still open on the screen behind me. Any ideas of what I can do to solve this?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance!</strong></p>

            Yes - the screen settings are per application, so any that open on the wrong screen will need fixed. Make sure when you close the application its on the desired screen.

            Hi, that happens because you have two pivot tables one on top of other i.e. one PV is from row 1 to 4 and the next one from row 6 to 10, now if you turn off the filter of the first one it will expand to contain for example 10 rows. it will not let do that
 because you have another PV in row 6, the solution put the 2nd pivot table beside the first one or you can insert more rows but you need to know how many

<br />
The call barring code is set by your network as it is a network feature... Try giving them a call.<br />

            thanks for your reply<br />
<br />
i have tried to contact the service provider, they says this code is to be obtained from the hand set manufacturer and we are not providing "call barring services" for our network in delhi (india0<br />
<br />
secondly, i have another hand set of motrolla make model "L6" there i am able to activate call barring service by entering the default password mentioned in the user's manual (for the same no. which i am now using in the new nokia 6300) that proves it is not
 a network feature, it is a hand set feature.<br />
what is your openion ?????<br />
<br />
thanks

Try taking it in there and having one of the Nokia docs look at it.

            hi,<br />
<br />
according to my knowledge there is no barring available in india, and it is provided by service provider.<br />
<br />
we can bar outgoing calls in nokia, by selecting the "sending the caller id " as "no".<br />
<br />
this is available under call settings.<br />
<br />
expecting more replys :)

            On a serious note.<br />
If you have forgotten the code then you need to take it to a Nokia Care Point where they are able to remove it for you.<br />
They will also remove all personal data stored on the phone at the same time as it needs completely erasing.<br />
You will usually need a proof of purchase to prove the phone isnt stolen and you are trying to access it, and they will probably charge you for it as its not a warranty fault.<br />

<h2>            Realtek High Definition Audio system</h2>
                    <p>Can't find Drivers for Realtek High Definition Audio system on my ACER Aspire 5536. The system was working fine when Windows 7 was my OS, prior to installing Windows Technical Preview Build 9926. Any suggestions welcomed... The only Audio system showing
 in the 'Sound &gt; Playback' Tab is Realtek HDMI Output, but no 'normal' internal sound device, as was seen in Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I note that there are many reports related to this problem, in the Audio,Sound, and Volume section of the 'Windows Feedback'pages.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Will,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview 2 is still under developing stage there might be chances that the Acer may or may not provided the drivers. The audio drivers available by Acer or Realtek might
 not be compatible. There is only Windows 7 drivers available for your model from Acer support.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Uninstall the sound drivers and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</li><li>
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>
Look for the Sound, video and game controller, expand it, right click on the sound device and select Uninstall.</li><li>
Reboot the computer.</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: You can try installing the Windows 7 audio drivers in compatibility mode and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Windows 7 drivers from this link:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Refer this article to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1 (Also applies for Windows 10 Technical Preview 2)</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue persist, then you probably have to wait for working sound drivers with the final release. For additional information, you may refer to section “<strong>What does it work with?”.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-faq#faq=tab0</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>

 the security code. Its saying that someone maybe using the account. I believe thats because of how many time we tried to sign in.When i fill out the security form majority of the questions does not apply to her use of the account so there's not sufficient
 information for a security code to be emailed. ad its not giving me the option of having the code sent via text message.</p>

<p>Thanks for the question! We can help you with this issue, but I’m going to need a little more information first.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which browser is in use while accessing Excel Web apps?</p>
<p>Were the Excel functions in English language prior to the issue?</p>
<p>If you are using Internet explorer then try to reset and check if it helps;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></p>
<p>Disclaimer: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend
 that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check if the issue persists when you use a diffrent browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check regional and language settings are set correctly.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have couple of questions for you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the issue occurs with other web apps as well?</p>
<p>How are you logging into web app, is it through skydive desktop application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you upload a file to SkyDrive which was created using Excel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you login with different Windows live id<span>&nbsp;
</span>to SkyDrive on same computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provide more information on the same, so that we could assist you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Your regional settings are derived from the "Account Settings" section of your Microsoft Account. &nbsp;From SkyDrive, you can click your name in the top right, then click Account Settings. &nbsp;Clicking "Edit Personal Info" takes you to a page that lists your
 Country/Region.
<div><br />
<div>If you want different regional settings today, you must change this Country/Region setting for your Microsoft account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For most people in most scenarios, this setting does provide the locale information they expect based on their country or region in which they live. &nbsp;However, there are scenarios such as these where more granular control is desired. &nbsp;In this case all data
 is rendered according to your regional settings, and UI/menus are rendered according to your language settings. &nbsp;Formulas happen to be part of the data, and so they are rendering according to your regional settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>While we can't comment on future features, Microsoft appreciates and is interested in your feedback. &nbsp;Does changing your Country/Region work for you? &nbsp;Do you expect another configuration option to manage your regional settings? &nbsp;Or would more formatting
 options in the web app solve your problem?</div>

            <p>Request to separate Location/Region from language. I wish to edit Excel in English (with English formula names), even if i do not live in USA/UK,... In the desktop version, this works perfectly; in the WebApp version, MS infers language from location. This
 is poor practice.</p>

            Hello David,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for clearing up this issue for other users. A similar issue came up for me with Turkish menus, and I found my way to this thread and your answer via search engine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I work at a market where we manage lots of bilingual Turkish and English documents, which I have recently had to edit using the Excel Web App. It's quite a pain to switch my region back and forth from Turkey/Turkish to US/English when going between documents,
 and it would be very useful to be able to customize this setting in each document. If you could add this functionality, it would make my life a lot easier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Deniz MacLeod</div>

            Somehow related to this subject, formulas are in Dutch when the location &nbsp;is 'Belgium' and the only way to change this is to change the country. A shame when about 40% of Belgians are French-speaking ! So yes, please link the language used for formulas
 to the language setting, not the location ! Moreover, I don't see why someone would like to have the UI in one language and the formulas in another one.

            When I switch Skydrive language to US English, the Excel web app turns to English allright.
<div><br />
<div>But ... For some reason, the functions are still in Dutch, which happens to be the region I am in. I want the functions to be in English as well, like I have been doing for years. Please correct this.</div>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
If your computer is running on Windows 10, you will have to select your USB headphone from the volume control settings located on the Taskbar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Click on the Speaker icon and click on the arrowhead pointing down. This will allow you to select which device is going to be used for audio output.
<strong>Select</strong> your USB headphone and you should be able to hear the sound come out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back if you have other questions.

            I have Nokia 5300 phone and it's call log does not display the calls in order by time. It displays the call entries in random style. Every time I make a call or receive a call - ... all the log entries are again shuffled.<br />
<br />
Also when I try to select names from this crazy call log - sometimes a message appears "Contact not Ready" and then I have to go to phonebook and select name from there to make calls.<br />
<br />
Please help me with this problem,<br />

Thanks in advance.<br />

<h2>            Lumia 1520 8.1, updated, Wifi can not connect or access internet</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi, my Lumina 1520 has been updated but any way i cannot connect to internet via wifi. In particularly, it showed limited or no internet access. I tried many times to reset moderm wifi, reset my phone, set static IP and so on, however it could not run appropriately.
 Incidentally, i connected to wifi and used internet for a week. But now, it repeated this error, the wifi status show high while internet was not accessed. P/S: other devices: laptop, android phone work normally.</p>
<p>Iam very happy to hear the answers from you. That issue lead me headache and waste of time.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

</p><p>From information you have provided&nbsp; I understand that you are trying to connect to home IWIF.</p>
<p>Do you have same issue connecting to other networks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget your WiFi network ( tap and hold -&gt;&nbsp;delete) &nbsp;and try to connect again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to change your router settings as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if that will help or not.</p>

            <p>Thanks Maria for your answer. I have not any problem when connecting to other networks. I also deleted my wifi network, reset moderm wifi and modified some parameters in router but still unsuccessful. My Lumina 535 has the same issue with 1520 it means i
 can not use wifi regularly. It reported to the local supporter however did not solve. They suggest that windowsphone may have any confilict with moderm wifi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do apologize for the inconvenience this issue has caused you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you like to use Google Chrome to access your account. It is possible that there is a problem with your Google Chrome since you mention that it works fine when you access your account in Internet Explorer. I &nbsp;recommend that you optimize
 your Google Chrome, clear browser's cache and temporary internet files to make sure that your browser’s setting is not contributing to your issue.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also suggest that you upgrade or download the latest version of your internet browser to ensure its compatibility with the new interface. Refer to the link below to know more about
 it:<br />

                    I was going to buy a sony eric but decided on a nokia 6233.<br />
WHAT A BIG BIG MISTAKE.I have used progams for digital video, creative music players, palm organisers etc. etc and this PC suite and 6233 is the pits. I have wasted £30 from nokia accesories as well on a usb connection cable which does not connect my phone
 or when it does it just keeps crashing or 'losing the phone'. The pc suit itself is the worst designed format I have ever seen. HOW TO MAKE SIMPLE TASKS AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE. Do not buy shares in nokia and spread the word. The PITS

            Here's a bit of information for you....to share of course.<br />
The way the nokia PC suite is set up is at best poor but I think if you got a true reflection from users on these forums I suspect there will be people tearing there hair out and extremly disappointed at the performance of this flaky software ! OK then you
 patronising old sage, lets use the suite to view and edit the contacts I have on my sim now in my 6233... Won't read them...ok then lets move them over on my phone manually...one at a time of course... THIS IS THE PITS

by the way have a horrible day

<h2>            Attaching to Small Business Server 2011 domain causes the task bar not to work</h2>
                    I just installed build 9926 as a VMware virtual machine and everything seemed fine and I was able to click start and search for items in the task bar. &nbsp;After I attached to my Small Business Server and log in with my domain account the start button highlights
 when click but does nothing. &nbsp;I can right click it and the pop up menu shows but a left click does nothing. &nbsp;I can click in the search bar but it does not accept keyboard inputs. &nbsp;I think it has something to do with the GPO. &nbsp;I log on as the local user and
 everything is back to normal. &nbsp;It is only affected by my domain account.&nbsp;

<p>I tried working in safe mode, but unfortunately the screen was flickering like crazy whenever I swipe between screens/documents or scroll up/down the page.&nbsp; In normal mode, Word freezes/crashes intermittently (sometimes it's fine for an hour or two) ...
 in safe mode, the poor graphics/flickering is too disruptive - there's no way I can work on my paper for an hour without getting a headache!!!&nbsp;</p>
