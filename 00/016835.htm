<h2>            Powerpoint Error codes -108 and -43</h2>
                    Hi, I have mountain lion and while using power point (office 2011) I rename a file and now when I try to open it it keeps giving me the error code -108. If I try to erase the file I get: The operation can‚Äôt be completed because one or more required items
 can‚Äôt be found. (Error code -43). What do I do?

<h2>            Samsung Focus, Mac Connector not recognizing or syncing&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Samsung Focus and mac connector is not working at all. Below are the symptoms.
<br />
<br />
Samsung Focus AT&amp;T SGH-i917<br />
<br />
OS: 7.0.7004.0<br />
Firmware: 2103.10.10.1<br />
Hardware: 3.1.0.7<br />
<br />
Mac OS X 10.6.8 <br />
<br />
Mac Connector 1.1 (110314)<br />
<br />
I plug the device into my iMac with the Samsung cable as well as 3 other cables and the "A connected device could not be accessed" error comes up every time.<br />
<br />
I have done a Master Reset (Reformat) twice. <br />
<br />
I did also delete the keychain information. <br />
<br />
What should i do? <br />
<br />
It looks like the last communication was March and it seems like no resolution was found.<br />

    <title>Not getting texts or calls until I make a call or send a text - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not getting texts or calls until I make a call or send a text</h2>
                    <p>This issue is quite annoying, sometimes for no reason at all, my phone will stop receiving text messages and calls.&nbsp; Calls go straight to voicemail and text messages queue up.&nbsp; I will not get visual voicemail notifications either. Then when I either make
 a call or send a text, all messages and voicemail will then get sent to my phone.&nbsp; For example, I can call my phone from my home phone and will go straight to voicemail. If I then make a call or send a text from my phone, I can then try to call it again and
 it will work fine.&nbsp; This happens on 3G or 4G and no matter what my signal strength (3-5 bars).&nbsp; Data does seem to continue to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amazing thing is this happened first with an HTC 8x.&nbsp; I was told by my carrier that &nbsp;the issue was with the phone and I needed to wait for a firmware fix. Two months later with no fix in sight, I gave up and sold the 8x and got a Lumia 920.&nbsp; The issue
 STILL happens.&nbsp; Is this a problem with Windows Phone 8?&nbsp; I never had this type of issue with my Samsung Focus or Dell Venue Pro on 7.0 or 7.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen numerous reports of the same issue on different phones, which leads me to believe this is a MSFT issue.&nbsp;
 I've been a huge proponent of Windows Phone and this is the first real issue I've had.....but this is a BIG issue.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated greatly!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Devices with issue:</p>
<p>HTC 8x - 8.0 Pre-Portico</p>
<p>HTC 8x - 8.0 Portico</p>
<p>Lumia 920 -8.0 Portico</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current solution is to toggle airplane mode at times during the day, or to switch to 2G only on your data connection.&nbsp; Neither solution is optimal and is frustrating.&nbsp; The fact that it happens with multiple phones lead me to believe the issue is with
 the OS software.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just weird.&nbsp; One thing to note is that I don't think it impacts data as I'll get email during the time that my phone is dead to incoming sms and calls.&nbsp; When I contacted Tmo about the issue, they were aware of the issue, but said it was an HTC problem
 (this was when I had the 8x).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted HTC and they had no idea what I was talking about.&nbsp; Looks like others are getting the same run-around.&nbsp; But my experience and the fact I've seen the issues with other carriers/models leaves me with little hope of a fix without Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I was told they (HTC) was working on a fix in December by Tmo. When I finally got frustrated enough, I called HTC and asked about the issue. HTC said they had no idea what I was talking about (after escalating me three levels). They said it sounded like
 a phone problem or a carrier issue. I got my phone replaced to another 8x and the issue continued. Then got a 920 and, of course it continued again. So Tmo says it is a manufacturer issue, HTC said it was a carrier issue, and now I think it's a MSFT issue.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fixes do work, as well as a reboot. But you can't tell when the issue happens. There is no indication until someone says they are having trouble getting ahold of me. Its disconcerting as I have family members with medical issues and they have had issues
 contacting me during emergencies. The airplane fix is temporary, and the 2G fix is not optimal. It would be okay if there was really some indication a fix was really forthcoming. But I really can't get a firm answer from anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks again&nbsp;</p>

            You are not alone. I live in Australia with a 920, and have had this issue since beginning. I don't there are any permanent solution yet, and i'm very sure it is WP8 problem.
<div><br />
<div>Either you wait for a fix (which i'm unsure when will MS even look at this, or if they even care) or switch to iOS or Android.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry to say this, i'm a long time WP user and am getting very tired and frustrated. I will be switching soon.</div>

            <p>I'm not sure if it helped, but I did get an updated SIM card just to see if it would help (it was free, so what the heck).&nbsp; And since I swapped it, things have been much better.&nbsp; I haven't noticed the issue (it's been two weeks), when I was having the issue
 weekly.&nbsp; I did switch SIM cards previously and the issue continued, but I'd have the issue once or twice a week prior to swapping this second one out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not convinced it's gone away for good, I'm going to give it some more time.....&nbsp; Maybe it will help you.</p>

                    Where are you all putting phone extension numbers for your contacts? &nbsp;There is a field for blood type but not for a phone extension?! &nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;please tell me how to input this if it&nbsp;exists&nbsp;or&nbsp;add this feature if it does not.

            Under Personal click on the +. You can add a custom field. The new contact interface is certainly not user friendly. So much is hidden it could be there and I'm not seeing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook‚Äôs Help menu)<br />
<br />
The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list.<br />

</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Would you be able to back up your files? </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest downloading the Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT) to revert all of the previous settings on your phone. This procedure however, would remove all files on your phone, hence the need to create a back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download WDRT, go to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12379/windows-10-mobile-device-recovery-tool-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>            merging accounts lost my contact list</h2>
                    <p>I merged my old skype account with the microsoft one. Mostly it worked. My old contacts are all gone now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conversation history is there, so I can contact people from that list. I just can't add them to my contacts. Skype can't even find them when I do a search, even though I have their user name right there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to add people to contacts from their profile or from conversation history? I don't have an older version of skype to revert to. This is a new PC. I don't have another skype account any more, because they've been merged. So I can't import my
 old contact list from anywhere.</p>

<p>Can't copy paste from the About page, which is awful but probably not a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get an error message. The people I search for just don't come up. User name doesn't bring them up, nor does display name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have them in my conversation history. I can access their profiles from there. It would be convenient to add those contacts to my contact list directly. I'm not trying to send my contacts anywhere. I'm trying to add people to my contacts.</p>

    <title>Word Split View Feature Change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word Split View Feature Change</h2>
                    
<p>I use the split view feature in Word a lot so I can see 2 different sections of my document in the same window view. With 365, when users &nbsp;split the screen view, the "2nd screen" that shows up is on some random page number within the document. Previously
 it split on the SAME screen, so users knew where they were in the document and whether they needed to scroll up or down to find what they were looking for in the other split view. &nbsp;Please change this back in your next update release, or let me know of a setting
 where I can customize this feature myself. Thank you.</p>

                    When I Quick Print an email in Outlook 2010 and its attachments&nbsp;(usually Word docs), the docs will open in Word and are spell checked before printing.&nbsp; Can this feature, where ever it is, be disabled?&nbsp; I don't want attachments spell checked -- just printed;
 it would also be helpful if the attachments didn't open before being printed.&nbsp;

            <p>All attachments need to open in their default&nbsp;application&nbsp;to print - that's a requirement in any windows program. (Only prn files, created when you 'priunt to file' can be sent directly to the printer.)
</p>
<p>The option to spell check is set in word - although I'm not sure which option as i don't see one for specifically "before printing".&nbsp; It may be a general automatic spell check setting - that usually occurs when a document is opened - but its a global setting
 and will affect all documents, not just email attachments. </p>

<h2>            Blank horizontal scrolling table for data entry</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have had trouble finding out how to do this so I thought someone here might have answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to create a table that scrolls horizontally that is blank and you can add data to each cell. Like for grading where there are too many assignments that fit on the screen. The students names can remain static on the left and the assignment
 header and grade area scrolls and values can be assigned as the year goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any info!</p>

<p>Are you using activesync&nbsp; (or WMDC if you have Vista)?&nbsp; If you connect your device to your PC&nbsp;you can&nbsp;navigate your device by clicking on the Computer icon on your desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will open a folder showing hard disk drives, removable storage, Other and if your device is connected, you will see an icon&nbsp;under Portable Devices showing your device.</p>
<p>Click on your device and you will see two icons: your device main memory and your storage card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should easily figure out how to navigate from here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use File Explorer to navigate to your stored MP3s on your storage card.&nbsp; Clicking on a song will give an option to set as a ringtone.&nbsp; It will copy the file to your ringtone directory so be careful on file sizes ... it will "eat
 up" main memory of your device.</p>

            Hello, this is a really hard decision to make since you doo not know who the sender is, and if he really has access to your contacts. If I were you, I would ignore and block the contact, and change the passwords for all of your accounts as soon as possible. Hope this helps!

<br />
<br />Delete the email - it's a scam similar to messages rec'd by many other people (including me - 3 times).

<p>Thanks for the advice. He sent me an email showing one of my passwords so that worried me a bit. I already changed all my passwords but i'm just worried that he may have installed a malware that can read whatever i change.</p>
<p>Anyway, he's given me 24 hours to make the payment but paying for me is not an option. I guess i'll just have to wait and see what happens next.</p>

            Hello cheeri0 
<br />
<br />In addition to what my fellow advisors have said, I'd suggest you to enable a two step verification , just for peace of mind, at least for a while.
<br />You can do it in here: <a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/additional?mkt=en-US&amp;refd=account.microsoft.com&amp;refp=security&amp;uaid=347ae19dc32144ca8cd5a55032b9b9f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/proofs/manage/addition...</a>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Edit Documents and Can&#39;t Delete Specific File in Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    <p>I created a test folder in our Sharepoint Online document library to check versioning settings. After I changed the versioning settings to require the file to be checked out before editing, I started having issues. I tried changing the settings back to say
 not require checking out to edit file, but no luck. The test folder I created has a word document I added, again for testing purposes. The file is not checked out, but anytime I try to delete the file, I keep getting error messages saying that it is being
 edited or checked out. I've tried the many suggestions online and none of them have worked thus far. I checked the manage checked out files, and it says all files are checked in. I've tried to move the folder into a different folder and delete the new folder,
 but the old test folder stays in its original location even after selecting "move."</p>

<p><span>Hi Big,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your description, it seems that the issue only happens in the specific file in the folder. If yes, I‚Äôd like you to check and try the following to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Check if you open the file in the Word 2016 application. If yes, close the application and then do a test to see the result.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Sign out of your account, clear IE cache via Tools&gt;Safety&gt;deleting browser history and&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(85, 26, 139, 1)">reset
 IE</span></a>&nbsp;(do the similar steps in other browsers), close all browsers, wait 10 minutes and navigate to the folder with your account to check the outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, I‚Äôd like to know if the newly created file can be deleted in the folder if you add a new file in the folder.</span></p>

            I cannot open the file in Word 2016 directly from the browser. If I tell it to open the desktop Word application, nothing happens. However, I can download the file and open it in Word just fine. Resetting the browser settings did not change anything. I
 also created another file in a completely different folder with a different user account and am running into the same issue. I opened a Word doc in the browser that had to be converted to be able to edit in the browser. I converted it, which created a new
 Word document that I could edit in the browser. After closing the new document, I tried to delete it and again I'm hit with the "file is currently checked out or locked."

            I asked another user to create a Word document in Sharepoint and he had the same issue trying to delete it. He create a Word doc in Sharepoint, closed out of it, waited a minute or so and then tried to delete the file he created. He too got the error message
 that it was checked out or locked. It's like the files are getting checked out as soon as they are created, but they do not show they are checked out.

<p><span>From your description, it seems that the format of</span> the affected files you uploaded is Word 97-2003 Document (.doc) and then you convert their format into the .docx format in Word Online.
 Then you can edit them and you can‚Äôt delete them. If yes, I‚Äòd like you to confirm whether you disable the Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited setting in Library Settings. If yes, wait 10 minutes to remove the files to see and let
 us know the result.</p>

<h2>            Running Office 2003 in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi--We have upgraded from Windows XP-Pro (32-bit) to Windows 7 (64-bit). I installed our trusty Office 2003 (from a disk). Word opens fine and works well, and we seem to be able to open any file from within the program. HOWEVER, if i try to open a file from
 MY DOCUMENTS. or from an email attachment, I get an error message: "There was a problem sending the command to the program". This happens whether or not I run it in compatibility mode (for HP Service Pack 3).</p>
<p>What can we do to fix it?</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>

<h2>            How do you disable hyperlink warning message in Excel 2010, Windows 7 Professional 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
I receive a warning box "Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your computer" when trying to open a hyperlink in Excel. &nbsp;In my particular case, the hyperlink is being opened from a SharePoint site. &nbsp;I have referred to multiple help forums,
 include all of the following "Related Topics" suggestions:</p>

<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
None of these have fixed the issue. &nbsp;I have also followed the steps of this article:</p>
<p>
"How to enable or to disable hyperlink warning messages in 2007 Office programs and in Office 2010 programs", Article ID: 925757</p>
<p>
I cannot find a key associated with the file type ".xlsm" to edit, which is the file type associated with my hyperlinks. &nbsp;I have disabled all of the security settings in Excel so it appears to be a Windows issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Could 32bit vs 64bit be an issue? &nbsp;What other steps can I try?</p>

            <p>I had a similar problem with Excel 2010. In one of my spreadsheets I have multiple hyperlinks to other folders. One in particular which opens the parent folder that contains ALL the other folders that the other hyperlinks point to was giving me a security
 warning so I had to click OK on the warning before the parent folder would open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried every fix in the book including registry changes but nothing worked. I had a sudden brainwave and decided to delete the problem hyperlink. I then recreated the link to the same parent folder and now it opens the folder without having to deal with
 the security warning each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same security message when opening SOME hyperlinked pictures in Access 2010, but not all of them. So I am going to delete and re-create the hyperlinks for the problem children there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish me luck.</p>

<h2>            Catch-All for my Domain&#63;</h2>
                    I was trying to move my domain from a godaddy hosted email plan to windows live domains. &nbsp;However, when I set up my account I did not see any settings for a catch-all account? &nbsp;Does WLD not have this feature? &nbsp;Sadly, this is a definite deal breaker for
 me. &nbsp;I love the new outlook app but I can't use it if I can't catch all my emails. &nbsp;I've had this domain for many years and have tons of different addresses coming to it. &nbsp;Is this something that will be added in the future? &nbsp;As soon as it's added, I'll be
 moving over. &nbsp;Thanks, larry

I will also move over to Outlook.com if I can have a catch all for my own domain - can someone please confirm this isn't possible?

 easy to implement too.&nbsp; I guess Google is better.&nbsp; I never thought I'd say that.</p>

            I too have just moved my domain across from Google Apps to WLD, and looked for the catch all email address option in vain. It really is essential.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've had my domain for 12 years and have collected a number of variations. I cannot create a new Live account for each one and manage all these account separately. I can see I'm going to have some really significant disruption over the next few weeks.</div>

            +1 this really is a show stopper to me aswell. By now I must have generated 100's of single use or purpose tailored e-mail addresses over the last few years; many I could do without but quite a few I can't live without.

            <p>This fixed it for me</p>
<p>Open internet explorer then Tools</p>
<p>Then go to Manage Ad-ons</p>
<p>on the left hand side, go to Tracking Protection</p>
<p>Then find Get a Tracking Protection List online</p>
<p>When in this, change the top (Mine says Australia(English) to United States(English)</p>
<p>Go down this list to find Stop Google Tracking and Add it.</p>
<p>You can go back to Manage Ad ons to find this in the list.</p>
<p>After doing this I could watch You Tube videos again</p>

<h2>            How to Change &#34;Simple Markup&#34; Default to &#34;All Markup&#34; in Reviewing&#47;Track Changes</h2>
                    <p>I need help. I'm using Word 2016 and I am frustrated to no end that I cannot set "All Markup" as my default in my review pane when I use track changes. Until about a week ago, I was always able to use "All Markup" and now Word is ALWAYS setting
 the default as "Simple Markup." I have no idea how to install/write macros so this option is not a consideration for me. My work as an editor is being severely affected: when I set to "All Markup" and save, and then email it, it reverts back to "Simple Markup"
 for the person on the receiving end of my email, which means they are inadvertently missing edits because they are viewing "Simple Markup." This is crippling. Thank you for any help!</p>

            <p>Key question: When <em>you</em> open a document containing tracked changes, what is the
<strong>Display Mode</strong> set to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Display Mode is controlled by the installation of Word that is opening the document, it isn't a document property. In all versions of Word for Mac the default is
<strong>All Markup</strong> (or <strong>Final Showing Markup</strong>, depending on version). There is no Preference or Setting that will change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Traditionally, Word for Windows has been the same way for a number of reasons including the one you mentioned. However, that changed in Word 2013. It now defaults to Simple Markup, ostensibly to make the document appear 'cleaner'. That has persisted into
 Word 2016 for Windows, as well. Please see this Microsoft hype on it:&nbsp; <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Track-Changes-in-Word-F019F28A-DC7D-41F7-B19D-5AF988C3CF8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Track changes in Word - Word">
Track changes in <strong>Word</strong> - <strong>Word</strong></a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you're exchanging documents with PC users. There is no way for you to control this on their systems... They need to be better informed about the new behavior of the software they're using.</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working for years with documents from the same people, all of whom are using MACs. The default has always been "All Markup." I updated to Word 2016 in May, and since then have continued to download Word documents from Dropbox and also open Word
 documents attached in emails, always getting "All Markup" as the default, until about a week or two ago when suddenly everything has switched to a "Simple Markup" default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an editor, I have clients who know nothing of track changes and they just need to receive the document with the markup in full view. I myself am missing edits because I have never had to scan the margins for red marks to see where edits are. When someone
 needs to see the edits, they need to see <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
all</span> of the edits. The "Simple" default doesn't make sense. But at the very least, I should have control to make the default whatever I need to function at my job. And to do my job I need "All Markup." Is there anyway i can override that "Simple Markup"
 default and make it "All Markup"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help! Cheers.</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>If so, it may be that this is a new behavior in Mac Word resulting from Microsoft's campaign to make it more like the PC version. If that's the case, I'm afraid it's most likely a hard-coded setting - I don't believe there is any option in PC Word, either.
 Regardless, you cannot control how documents open on computers other than your own. Even if there is an option to change the default I'm certain it would be local to the computer, not document-specific.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using MS Word 365 for MAC and have the same problem. The file jumps randomly to "Simple Markups." I have not tested it with other (MAC) users in the company because it JUST started this behavior.</p>
<p>Could not find any way to set it, so it will alway default to "All Markups."</p>
<p>As was said before - it is very detrimental to back and forth to edit process.</p>

            <p>It's really important for those trying to help you to know exactly which version of Word and even which update you have. The current update is version 15.28 (or later depending on when you last updated and which update options you have chosen). To find out
 exactly which update you have, go to the Word menu and choose About Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 15.25 is completely obsolete, so if that is what you have, please follow these updating instructions, and then use the new version and see if Word's behavior has changed. Please let us know the results.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>I initially started this post and then let it drop after a couple of weeks when suddenly the "All Markup" came back as my default. Now again this past week, all of the documents I receive are defaulting to "Simple Markup" again. I have Word 365 and have
 the 15.30 version. I'm not running any spelling or grammar tools.</p>
<p>Any insights? Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Sad to report that I have the exact same situation. After some time without the unwanted simple markups default - it came back for no spparent reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I change it to full markups, save, close and reopen and we are back to simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not an issue of a few more clicks - the problem is recipidnts of these files MISS THE EDITS. they may not be aware of the two level markups display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please address it and fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Yes. This is my exact issue. My clients are missing my edits. Having to explain how to display the markup is ridiculous and time-consuming since many of them can't grasp Track Changes in the simplest sense.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also work for a magazine where my edits were missed in more than one story by an editor who is in fact well versed in using Track Changes. He just assumed I didn't have any edits in the document. Luckily we caught the error in layouts. This is truly a
 serious issue.</p>
<p>
