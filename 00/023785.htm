                    Each &amp; everytime I attempt to review my saved passwords when clicking "Manage My Credentials" after clicking "User Accounts", Internet Explorer crashes &amp; gives me the option to restart. I then proceed to click restart, only for this cycle to repeat itself.
 What can I do to stop this from happening &amp; &nbsp;reach my destination sucessfully? Thanx in advance

    <title>Sending Emails BCC to Larger Groups - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardrichardsoro22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending Emails BCC to Larger Groups</h2>
                    For years I have been sending out Neighbourhood Watch Email Alerts to a group of about 190 people as and when necessary, using MS Outlook.&nbsp; I have set up 5 groups of no more than 40 addresses and send out bcc.&nbsp; The frequency can be two or three times in
 a week or once a month.&nbsp; I am having to change my email service provider and when I sent the first alert using my new email address (gmail) this morning, all 190 emails were returned.&nbsp; Should I use an old hotmail address I have had for years to attempt to
 send out these emails?&nbsp; Are there any good suggestions as I wish to continue to manage this group using Outlook on my PC.&nbsp; Google suggested I set up a Google group but this seems like overkill and everyone would have to be invited to sign up.

            I'm using Outlook 2016.&nbsp; I have one hotmail account and one 'live' account.&nbsp; Only the latter is set up in Outlook, but it is easy enough to set up the former which I have had for nearly 5 years now.&nbsp; Both accounts are little used as my main account has
 been an 'fsnet' account.&nbsp; No real problems sending using 'fsnet' and Outlook for group sends.

            Issue is unresolved.&nbsp; Surely there must be a way to send bcc emails directly from Outlook 2016 to larger groups using either gmail or hotmail accounts?&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; I keep getting any attempts at sending returned due to Spam filters operating!!

            Where can I find out what limits apply?&nbsp; And does it help to send bcc in separate batches of no more than say 40 recipients.&nbsp; Last week, I could not send to 34 people 'bcc' using Outlook 2016 and my Hotmail account.&nbsp; I got around it by using my 'fsnet'
 address which works perfectly.&nbsp; Only problem is that the provider is closing all fsnet/Freeserve/Wanadoo email addresses at the end of May.

<h3> ryantrunten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 RTM - what happens when I click &#34;stop insider builds&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a "Windows Insider" or (whatever it's called now) since early March this year.</p>
<p>I built myself a new PC and decided to start on Windows 10 with build 9926.</p>
<p>I had stayed on the "slow ring" and had successful upgrades to each new build including 10240 RTM.</p>
<p>I'd like to opt out from the "insider builds" now that Windows 10 has reached RTM status with build 10240.</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure I fully understand or know what happens after clicking that button in what used to be Windows Update.</p>
<p>I do have a copy of Windows 8.1 full version with a key... but would that work if I entered if I have to re-activate?</p>
<p>I'm unfortunately not able to use my optical drives to do any sort of reformat and clean install of Windows.</p>
<p>If possible, I'd like to continue using what's currently installed on my PC due to already having it all setup and running.</p>
<p>I'm willing to buy a new Windows 10 key if it's really absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>I'm just hoping someone can fully explain what happens when you click that button.</p>

            <p>I don't think it will work if you did a clean install of Win 10 TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason you can't just make a bootable Win 8.1 USB, install from it, activate it with your key, then update to WIndows 10?&nbsp; It beats having to purchase a new key.</p>

            <p>Because this is a system I have built and been regularly using daily since March.</p>
<p>Everything's already installed and setup and running fine.</p>
<p>It would be too much of an inconvenience to start all over again.</p>
<p>So I was curious what exactly happens if I opt out of insider builds now that 10 is done.</p>
<p>Don't want to reformat and clean install anything if I don't really have to.</p>
<p>Will buy a new 10 key if I absolutely have to unless it'll take my "8.1 full" key.</p>
<p>For clarity I'm on build 10240 which is RTM... it was a technical preview (9926) I started on in March.</p>
<p>At first I wasn't sure what I wanted to run on it and just started with 10 with Insider Previews.</p>
<p>However, I did go out and buy Windows 8.1 full to have a legit key just in case.</p>
<p>Got used to Windows 10 and started taking a liking to it and I'm fine staying with it.</p>
<p>Just think it'd be a good idea to opt out of that insider program now.</p>
<p>"Free upgrade" seems to be for those already on 7 or 8... but I started clean on 10 but do own an 8.1 key.</p>
<p>Optical drives are having some technical difficulties I haven't had time or money to resolve yet.</p>
<p>USB ports were limited and in use so I don't think I can do any boot-able options from those.</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply anyway.</p>

            It won't accept the Win 8 key. So you may as well click that button.&nbsp; It's most likely going to tell you that you are not eligible for the free upgrade, and you will need to buy a Win 10 key.

the iso</a> if you don't already have one you have made yourself&nbsp;for 10240 and just leave the insiders..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably ask for key then... if not you can reinstall by double clicking the iso and running its setup and certainly then it should ask for a key.. you'll keep mostly all the installed programs and personal files with a re-install over top of itself&nbsp; &amp; maybe
 fix something too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but if youre activated now on the 10240 and have the kb3074683 update installed... you probably have a free copy of 10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no key needed....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can look in account.microsoft.com&nbsp;&nbsp; Devices... if build is Windows 10 Professional (10.0.10240.16405)&nbsp;&nbsp; run advanced command prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slmgr /xpr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if it says permanently activated...&nbsp;you don't need a key&nbsp;!</p>

<p><em>Successfully installed on July 27, 2015</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the command it does indeed say it's permanently activated.</p>
<p>I kind of figured that after the watermark disappeared after upgrading to 10240.</p>
<p>But I have not clicked that button yet. </p>

                    <p><span>I am using IE9 and running Windows 7, UK. I noticed recently that spell check has disappeared from the tool bat in outlook.com. I am sure it used to be there. I recently changed my email address in a hundred places from Yahoo to Outlook because I thought
 it would be better, only to realise that hasn't got something as basic as spell check. I am really annoyed by that.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have also created and then deleted&nbsp;4 aliases but it won't now allow me to create any new ones saying I reached my limit. But I have already deleted the&nbsp;4 I created! Get these sorted out soon. They are such fundamental errors and omissions</span>.

            <p>Hi DenisTsaika,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 is considered&nbsp;to be "modern" browser. Hence, the spell check button will not appear at the top of the compose page in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All modern browsers have their own (built-in) spell check tool installed already.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Please feel free to post back if you have other questions or clarifications.</font></p>

<h2>            cannot see old emails in OWA Inbox</h2>
                    <p>When reading emails using OWA, my Inbox only displays emails I received over the past five days. My filter setting is&nbsp; "All" and "Show as Messages" and "Sort by date with newest on top".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change to "Sort by date with oldest on top", then all messages are displayed with the oldest on top and the newest on the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I change back to "Sort by date with newest on top", then only the most recent emails are displayed with a whole bunch of blank white space where the older messages should be.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should be getting the "Do you want to run or save this file?" window first, then you'll get the option to choose where to save the file.<br />
<br />
I would first suggest noting the name of the file before you download it, then search for the file name to find where the files are being saved.<br />
<br />
Sometimes media files will give the progress and try to play in the browser. Are these sound or video file by any chance?<br />
<br />
I also suggest trying the download by right clicking on the file link and clicking "Save target as", then selecting the save location as a test.<br />
<br />

<h2>            My Outlook 2010 is continually sending messages to isp&#39;s without my instructions.  How do I stop this&#63;</h2>
                    This started about two months ago.&nbsp; I searched for the reason for weeks and finally figured out that I was not hacked but my very own computer was the malefactor.&nbsp; To stop the sending I have to watch for the 'sending mail' message and try to stop it or
 just turn off Outlook.

<h2>            Labels in Access 2010</h2>
                    In Microsoft Access 2010 I create a labels report.&nbsp; It is using an Avery labels template with 3 labels across the page.&nbsp; I create the report and view it and it looks OK.&nbsp; I save it and when I come back to it the labels are now only one across on the page.&nbsp;
 What gives???

            Make sure you are viewing the report in page preview mode, not layout mode or design mode. If you used the wizard then the page setup should be correct. Also try printing to a regular page to see how it prints.

    <title>Windows 10 update. Bios issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update. Bios issues.</h2>
                    <p>Last night my windows 10.1 updated (I believe.) This morning it was working fine, a little slow at first but it didn't take long until it was back to normal. I went out, did some chores and now I am back home and have ran into some huge issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I powered on my desktop, it booted up like normal, or so I thought. At first I was left with a message ending with 'Exiting PXE ROM.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to contact Microsoft, maybe someone might help me out. No help there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it doesn't even make it to that. After the MSI logo, it now either goes black or takes me to the following option:<br />
<br />
Please select the boot device:<br />
<br />
CD/DVD &nbsp; : &nbsp;HL-DT-ST DVDRAM &nbsp; GH24NSBO</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am assuming I will have to find a windows 8 boot up media disk. But I am not sure. I tried adjusting some BIOS options which I can still get to, but nothing. It's as if windows was never installed!<br />
<br />
Should I just go ahead an order a windows 8 disc and re-install windows?<br />
<br />
Or is there something I am missing?<br />
<br />
Cheers. John.</p>

<p>Last night my windows 10.1 updated (I believe.) This morning it was working fine, a little slow at first but it didn't take long until it was back to normal. I went out, did some chores and now I am back home and have ran into some huge issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I powered on my desktop, it booted up like normal, or so I thought. At first I was left with a message ending with 'Exiting PXE ROM.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that it is configured to boot off the network.</p>

            I am like 99% sure this is the same issue I am running into.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now when I go into boot sequence in my bios settings.. there used to be 5.. now there are only 3 devices.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It's only letting me boot from my CD/DVD drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't think it will let me boot from USB as I think that device has gone!<br />

I think I am in the right direction. I got a message starting with:<br />

<br />
I followed the last step and typed HDAT2_50.EXE /W<br />

It replied with d command or filename - "HDAT2_50.EXE".</p>

<h2>            Looping Through All the Tables in an Access Database, to Change AllowZeroLength Back to Yes</h2>
                    <p>Looping Through All the Tables in an Access Database, to Change <strong>AllowZeroLength</strong> Back to
<strong>Yes</strong> is important to me, because it allows me to demonstrate this VBA to a person who will be taking over my programming for my businesses. &nbsp;He is learning VBA, and will soon have his own profile on this forum. &nbsp;For now, I learn from the forum
 results, and share the new knowledge with him. &nbsp;This is a temporary step, and hopefully will not last beyond 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is an addendum of a post on May 3rd, by me, which was answered. &nbsp;And again...thank you very much for the answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I teach him, from the answers I get here, from you awesome folks.</p>
<p>If I demonstrate this VBA operation to two or three of my potential employees (and/or students), I'd like to be able to return the Allow Zero Length value to "Yes" after the demonstration.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Powerpoint 2016 on Mac - table cell text wrapping causes cursor to jump to end of text.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced this bug on different MacBook Pros (have not tested on Mac mini yet). When working in a table cell in PPT with multiple lines of text, if I go back to edit text in the cell and the text wraps at the end of the line, the cursor jumps to
 the bottom of the text in the cell and sometimes jumps out of the table altogether and starts typing in a new text block.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating and there are several other forums and discussions that put the blame on sensitive trackpad/settings but I don't buy it.</p>

<p>I've finally narrowed down the cause of this issue on my Mac. The culprit(s) appears to be window-management software that allows Windows-style window "snapping", where dragging the window to the left or right side serves as a shortcut for making the window
 fill that half (and dragging to the top maximizes). Are you running any software that offers that feature or otherwise affects window management?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, the app Cinch by Irradiated Software triggers the issue whenever it is open; quitting the app AND restarting Powerpoint fixes the issue. (Another window-management app from the same developer, SizeUp, does not trigger the issue; that app changes
 window sizing and positioning using keyboard shortcuts, not dragging.) I also experience the issue through the app BetterTouchTool whenever its equivalent window-snapping feature is enabled, but the app does not cause the issue when that feature is disabled.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Considering "a very slow internet connect", please check whether the Office folder has been download successfully. Normally, the Office folder you have downloaded is about 1.10GB. If not, you may need to download it again to the local path on your PC and
 paste it to the shared folder on the server. And then let the users run the command to install it. To do that:<br />
1. Download Office 2016 Deployment Tool on your PC: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117</a> <br />
<br />
2. Double-click OfficeDeploymentTool.exe, and then extract the following files to the local path on your PC(e.g.
<strong>C:\ODT</strong> ).<br />
&nbsp;•Setup.exe<br />
&nbsp;•Configuration.xml<br />
<br />
3. Open the Configuration file with Notepad, and then paste the following text to the Configuration file.<br />
&nbsp;<strong><em>&lt;Configuration&gt;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Add SourcePath="C:\ODT" OfficeClientEdition="32" &gt;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Product ID="O365BusinessRetail"&gt;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Language ID="en-us" /&gt;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Product&gt;</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/Add&gt;&nbsp; </em></strong><br />
<strong><em>&nbsp;&lt;/Configuration&gt;</em></strong><br />
<br />
4. Open a command prompt as an administrator on your PC and input the following command. To do this:
<br />
&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>&gt;In the Start Search box, type cmd&gt; Right-click the <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>&gt;Input <em><strong>cd c:\ODT</strong></em> and press Enter&gt; Input
<em><strong>setup /download</strong></em>&nbsp;to download the Office package.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. After it is downloaded, check whether it is about 1.10GB. If so, paste it to the shared folder on the server. And then let the users run the following command and check the outcome.<br />
<strong><em>\\server\share\setup.exe /configure \\server\share\Configuration.xml</em><br />
</strong><br />
Thanks, <br />
Felix</p>

<h3> muguesdp social  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com calendar duplicating events - problem with sharing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My calendar duplicates all events every so often.&nbsp; By color code, I see that these&nbsp;duplicates are all in one category.&nbsp; I can't edit or delete the duplicates (I can edit the originals), which is a problem in case an event changing.&nbsp; I did set up a sharing
 link (deleted it once while trying to fix the problem; have since created a new link) - sharing is the reason for the account, so I can't lose that ability.&nbsp; I deleted some original events over a week ago and the duplicates lingered, but the good news is&nbsp;I
 no longer see the duplicates now.&nbsp; Not sure if that's due to the passing of time or closing the shared calendar&nbsp;link.&nbsp; Perhaps this is a benign bug after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on with these duplicate events? Will they be seen by people accessing the shared calendar link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I (and others) have accessed the calendar only from PCs, so far as I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe the account is linked to anything else.&nbsp; I'm seeing the same problem with IE8, IE11, and Opera on computers running Win7.</p>

            Microsoft has prompted me to reply because I'm still seeing duplicated events in my calendar while logged in to Outlook.com.&nbsp; The shared calendar (accessed from another browser, not logged in)&nbsp;shows only one instance of each event so that's good.&nbsp; It doesn't
 instantly reflect changes or deletions made - that's a problem if there's a significant lag in updating the shared calendar.&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically, I'm seeing an event (correctly)&nbsp;disappear after a few minutes&nbsp;when viewing the calendar while logged out, but it's
 lingering when I look at the calendar while logged in.&nbsp; What's the update frequency?

    <title>Can I increase font size of a workbook all at one time instead of one - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I increase font size of a workbook all at one time instead of one page at a time&#63;</h2>
                    I have just imported a few workbooks into Excel in my new iMac. &nbsp;When I view all the data contained in it, the font is so small. &nbsp;Is there a way to make the font larger for the whole workbook at once, rather than having to change the font on each page
 in the workbook (30 or so). &nbsp;I have a few workbooks that are all like this. &nbsp;If I change the "view" to 150% on the top bar, it only changes it for the one page which would not help a lot. &nbsp;Please help, thanks. &nbsp;

            Click the Tab of the first sheet, then hold Shift while you click the Tab of the last sheet. Once you've selected all sheets click the Select Sheet button, then change the font size.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, though, that doing so may very well cause chaos in the readability &amp; layout of the sheets... Any rows or columns whose height/width have been manually set will not automatically adjust to accommodate the new font size. As a result, text content
 may not fully display or may extend further than expected &amp; values will appear as #### until you repair all the sheets. Printing will also be problematic since the enlarged content will require more space.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest staying with the Zoom - you can change it for all sheets at once by selecting all sheets as described above.I haven't tested, but you may be able to record a macro to automate the process so you don't have to repeat it manually in each workbook.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Outlook 2016 only showing email addresses, not contact names</h2>
                    <p>When receiving emails, some show the actual name, others only show the email address even though they are in my 'people' contact list. &nbsp;Senders who are not in my contact shows their actual name (not email address). &nbsp;For those already in my contacts (Outlook
 People list), sometimes it resolves to their contact name, and other times only their email address, even if I have sent them the email first with their actual name. &nbsp;Tried deleting and recreating but no change. &nbsp;Any idea what is wrong?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I have tried deleting the 'autocomplete', at first individually using the 'x' when filling in their name, and then the total cache of names. &nbsp;Doesn't help.</p>

            Did that and no, it didn't help. &nbsp;I stopped using Outlook and went back to Airmail 2, and it has the same problem, so I don't think it is Outlook after all. &nbsp;Mac Mail doesn't have the problem.

<p>You can try to do basic troubleshooting to isolate the case:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Try rebooting the phone</p>
<p>2. If no progress, you can restore factory settings. This will revert the phone to its default. No personal data will be deleted:</p>
