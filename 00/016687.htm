<h2>            cross reference in word 365 2016 on different HW</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've following issue:</p>
<p>Sometimes I'm using my PC and sometimes my laptop in order to edit my document.</p>
<p>My office is in English UI, while I need that the document and labels would be on other language. So, I've created labels for figures and tables on my own language.</p>
<p>After adding a caption to the table, I'd like to reference to it during the text.
</p>
<p>When I'm working with my laptop, I can see those tables in the cross reference.</p>
<p>When I'm working with my PC, i can't see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be glad to have some suggestions on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<p>Note that the user interface language doesn't control the language of the built-in caption labels. The crucial part is setting the proofing language correctly. In the process, you may have to rename the Normal template and have Word create a new one for
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In know this from experience; I'm running Word 2016 with a US English display language but the default proofing language is set to Swedish which means that I see "Figur" and "Tabell" rather than "Figure" and "Table" as the built-in caption labels.</p>

    <title>Kaspersky Problem with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregkhughes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kaspersky Problem with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I too have been using Kaspersky PURE happily &nbsp;for several years and just renewed my 2-year subscription. I accepted the Microsoft free offer, downloaded and installed Windows 10 successfully, but found out is wasn't quite free. First, it wiped out all my
 Recovery points from Windows 7, and then it killed my Kaspersky. I downloaded Kaspersky 2015 (and 2016) and tried installing them but got blocked by Error Message 2016 - when I followed the string to solve that, Microsoft sent me to the Fixit application,
 but I learned that Fixit doesn't yet work with Windows 2010, so all of Microsoft's hype about thorough testing, yada, yada, yada wasn't correct. I&nbsp; removed Windows 10 and went back to Windows 7 and Kaspersky. I've sent this information to my friends at Tulane's
 (local college) law center for some friends to tell me if I have any basis for nuisance suit against Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else found a way to run Kaspersky with Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Hello Ladybreo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>What are JBL speakers please?</p>
<p>Here is the link thaqt explains how to pair a device with your phone in the case that you don't do the proper manipulation :</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/start/pair-my-phone-with-a-bluetooth-accessory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/How-to/wp8/start/pair-my-phone-with-a-bluetooth-accessory</a></p>
<p><u>Here are the compatible products :</u></p>
<p>Windows Phone 8 supports Bluetooth 3.1. This is an improved version of Bluetooth that automates the pairing process between Windows Phone 8 and Bluetooth devices, such as phone headsets, car audio systems, speaker docks, and NFC pairing.
</p>
<p>Here are the Bluetooth user profiles that Windows Phone 8 supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP 1.2) </li><li>Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP 1.4)</li><li>Hands Free Profile (HFP 1.5)</li><li>Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP 1.1)</li><li>Object Push Profile (OPP 1.1)</li><li>Out of Band (OOB) and Near Field Communications (NFC)</li></ul>
<p>For a Bluetooth device or accessory to work with your phone, the device needs to use one of the supported profiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

    <title>How to delete all contacts from Outlook.com&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raimondoeggink  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete all contacts from Outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Old Title: syncing MS Outlook - outlook.com - Windows Phone 8.1 </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very disappointed by the fact that Microsoft forces me to use the cloud in order to sync my calendar and contacts between my PC (MS Outlook) and Nokia Lumia phone (Windows Mobile 8.1). In the past I used bluetooth or a usb cable and did not depend on
 an internet connection or any cloud services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have a Microsoft account and sadly enough it doesn't work the way it should. The calendar is fine more or less, ignoring the fact that I now get double reminders on my PC. Syncing my contacts is a disaster. The current status is that some entries have
 synced into outlook.com, but not all and I cannot get the process to complete. The worst thing is that this makes my Nokia Lumia phone useless as it starts syncing automatically when I switch the phone on and it never stops, creating a huge battery drain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to use gmail for syncing contacts and this works fine (though it's not convenient). Unfortunately, I cannot delete my contacts in outlook.com. I would expect this to solve the problem with syncing my phone. However when I press delete on my
 browser, after a second or so the deleted contact comes back. Note that this is not a facebook or Skype contact, in fact my Microsoft Account is not linked with anything, I have only synced contacts from Outlook on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know, how can I delete all contacts from outlook.com?</p>

            <p>Hello Carissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried deleting all contacts in Microsoft Outlook and then syncing. Consequently the contacts folder in Outlook is empty, but outlook.com is a mess and the sync process produces errors. I've tried deleting (some or all contacts) on the People page
 in outlook.com, but after half a second everything comes back. I've tried linking duplicates and unlinking, no change. I've tried deleting on my Windows Phone 8.1 and syncing, but the sync process never ends, there's no change in outlook.com and I can only
 do this for one contact at a time when there are almost 5000.</li><li>I created my Microsoft Account, connected it with Microsoft Outlook via the Hotmail Connector and then copied all my (almost 5000) contacts into the new contacts folder and synced. Then I did the same on Windows Mobile 8.1. These processes never completed
 properly. Subsequently I decided not to use the Microsoft Account for syncing contacts between PC and phone and use gmail instead. Gmail synced properly both ways, but I could not clean the People page on outlook.com. The Skype app on the phone may have been
 a factor too, so I unlinked the accounts and uninstalled the app.</li><li>The issue happens with all contacts I've tried to delete.</li></ul>
<p>My guess is that the root cause of this problem is overkill; Microsoft/Nokia replaced a simple PC-phone syncing process by a very complicated PC-cloud-phone process, which is not robust. I would like to stop using Microsoft Account for syncing contacts,
 but the phone does not give me this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking into this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I delete contacts on the People page by clicking the contact and then "delete" and confirming again "delete". I've also tried selecting multiple or even all contacts and then delete. Each time the result is the same: the deleted contact(s) reappear(s) after
 a fraction of a second.</p>

            <p>I just did a little test. I entered manually a new contact in Outlook 2010, in the contacts folder of my outlook.com account (linked via the Hotmail Connector). I then synced and this contact appeared on the People page of outlook.com. Subsequently I tried
 deleting it on the People page but could not do so - it reappeared. Then I deleted it from Outlook 2010, which now has an empty contacts folder. Syncing produced the following error:</p>

            not super sure on this but i think that may be because it is copy protected music, that you can only play it back on one device at a time with the license that you have.

            Possibly something such as an add-in unassigned the Ctrl+L shortcut or reassigned it to something else. You can just recreate the original assignment. Instructions for doing this in Word 2003 or earlier are at
<a href="http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/AsgnCmdOrMacroToHotkey.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.word.mvps.org/FAQs/Customization/AsgnCmdOrMacroToHotkey.htm</a>. If you have Word 2007 or 2010 (the versions with the ribbon instead of menus, the first step is different.<br />
<br />
In Word 2007:<br />
<ul>
<li>Click the Office button, and click Word Options at the bottom of the menu.</li><li>Click the Customize tab on the left.</li><li>Click the Customize button at the bottom of the dialog.</li></ul>
<p>In Word 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the File tab, and click Options in the list on the left.</li><li>Click the Customize Ribbon tab on the left.</li><li>Click the Customize button at the bottom of the dialog.</li></ul>
<p>In either case, after choosing the All Commands category, go to the command list and choose LeftPara, then assign the Ctrl+L shortcut to it by following the rest of the steps in the article.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Forms responses not updating in Sharepoint Excel Doc</h2>
                    The responses from Microsoft Forms are collected in an Excel spreadsheet that is stored on sharepoint, but today, the spreadsheet was not updating and the responses that were received today are not appearing in the spreadsheet. I can see the response details
 when I click into the 'Responses' tab when I am in the editing view of the Microsoft Forms I have created, but they are not in the spreadsheet.

<p><span>Hi Jpei,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not sure how did you store the Excel worksheet to SharePoint, regarding your requirement, we’d suggest you use the way mentioned in this article:</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/check-your-form-results-02859424-341d-406f-b32a-9a0fbaf357af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check your form results</a><br />
</span></span>The best practice is to save to OneDrive for business to keep a live data connection to the Form.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1)Go to portal.office.com and sign in with your work or school account.</span></p>
<p><span>2)Select OneDrive to access the OneDrive for business.</span></p>
<p><span>3)Create the New button which in the upper right corner and choose Forms for Excel to create Form. Then type a name to naming it.</span></p>
<p><span>4)Back to Microsoft Form by choose the App Launcher in the upper right corner.</span></p>
<p><span>5)Then the Form you created at Step3 will appear. When you share it and collect response, the Excel spreadsheet will keep updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please check if the above steps work for you.</span></p>

            I created the Form through OneDrive initially so the Excel worksheet has a live data connection to the Form which is why i expected it to update automatically when the responses were submitted yesterday. I just check the Excel worksheet this morning and
 the responses are now there, but they are repeated several times, so now i have hundreds of rows of the same responses even though i am only supposed to have 40 rows. Not sure why this is happening. I've attached a screenshot for reference.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/606d535e-9dc8-4465-b47f-2405b9028ff1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/606d535e-9dc8-4465-b47f-2405b9028ff1?upload=true" /></a>

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Jpei,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Generally, when go to Microsoft Form and open the Form which created through OneDrive for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>The response collected in Excel spreadsheet won’t repeatedly several time.</span></p>
<p><span>Given your situation, the issue may be related to temporary syncing. I suggest you try filtering repeated row and deleted the repeated one by the below steps, and monitor whether the issue will
 happen again or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)Go to OneDrive for Business and select the Excel spreadsheet which contains response.
</span></p>
<p><span>2)Then click Edit Wordbook and choose Edit in Excel. Remove duplicate values refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Filter-for-unique-values-or-remove-duplicate-values-ccf664b0-81d6-449b-bbe1-8daaec1e83c2?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>3)Back to OneDrive for Business and make sure the Excel spreadsheet online also updated the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information to better assist you:</span></p>
<p><span>1)Does the issue occur if you go to Microsoft Form and open the Form from OneDrive for Business&gt;click Response tab&gt;Open in Excel?</span></p>
<p><span>1)Confirm if the issue occurs if you create a new Form from the OneDrive for Business.</span></p>
<p><span>2)If you edit other files(Such as Word document/PowerPoint presentation) which stored on OneDrive for Business at local computer, please check if the “repeated issue” occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            I'd skip Forms which is nothing more than an Excel extension and use SP lists (preferably classic style which are less buggy).

<p>You have two options</p>
<p><strong>First Option -&nbsp;Find and Replace</strong></p>
<p>In the advance features of Find and replace you can select fomating (including bold) and use the wildcard "*" to find all bold text.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you can not find all regular text; So what you need to do if find a replace all text that is bold and replace with a unique identifier (ie ZZZZZ [space]) and use your sort function, delete all other text, then find a replace again to remove
 the unique identifier from the cells.</p>
<p>This is the hard way</p>
<p><strong>Second Option (Best option) - Create a macro</strong></p>
<p>I will try and think of one for you</p>

            Ok, now we have something to work with.<br />
If you go into the text message settings and look for your message centre number.<br />
<br />
On o2 pre pay it should be set to +447802092035<br />
<br />
Is it set to that?<br />
If not change it and that should do the job.

    <title>Items received do not appear in Inbox until Outlook 2007 is restarted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffintampa&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Items received do not appear in Inbox until Outlook 2007 is restarted</h2>
                    
<p>I've found that Outlook 2007 sometimes does not show all e-mails received in the Inbox until I&nbsp;exit and restart Outlook. For example, I might see seven e-mails in Mailwasher, but after hitting Send/Receive in Outlook, only 5 appear in the Inbox. If I close
 and restart Outlook, the "missing" e-mails&nbsp;will appear, though sometimes not&nbsp;until some time (&gt;15sec.) after the Inbox is initially populated.</p>
<p>This behavior usually doesn't appear until Outlook has been open for an hour or so. It is also consistent whether Norton's e-mail features are on or off.</p>
<p>Other factors:&nbsp;My Inbox view is set to Mesages with AutoPreview. I typically get approximately 200 e-mails daily, and about 75% will be deleted upon viewing the subject line or reading&nbsp;the e-mail.&nbsp;Most mail items not deleted are moved manually to client-
 or project-specific folders; any remaining mail items not moved as described above are moved to "chron" folders at the end of each month (which are&nbsp;in turn&nbsp;archived quarterly).</p>
<p>The PST&nbsp;associated with Personal Folders frequently exceeds 1G; I usually also have several archival PSTs attached, and some of these exceed 1G as well.</p>
<p>Config:&nbsp;Outlook 2007 under Vista Business&nbsp;SP2; primary e-mail account is&nbsp;POP3 via RoadRunner; Norton Internet Security and MailwasherPro are installed.</p>
<p>Possibly related: Calender items appearing in the Reminders pop-up dialog that are opened, edited and saved with a new Start Time (later in the same day or even the next day)&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;appear in the reminders pop-up dialog even though they should not (based
 on the new start time). If Outlook is restarted, these rescheduled reminders will only apprear when the reminder interval for the new start time is reached (as expected). I plan to open a separate question on this problem, but since it, too, only happens after
 Outlook has been open for a while I suspect they are related.</p>

<p>The first think I'd try would be to reset all views by starting Outlook once with the /cleanviews command switch.&nbsp; Press WinKey+R and in the Open field, enter</p>
<p>outlook.exe /cleanviews</p>
<p>being sure to include the space, then press Enter.</p>

<p>OK, I did that. It will take at least a day of keeping Outlook up to see if it corrects the problem.</p>
<p>However, I wish you would have pointed out the&nbsp;impact - it resets all folders to the default ("Messages") view format. I had over 200 folders&nbsp; that I'd customized&nbsp;to use "Messages with Auto Preview", then deleted the "categories" column, added the "To" column,&nbsp;and
 resized them the way I&nbsp;wanted them.</p>
<p>I guess&nbsp;what I have to do&nbsp;is to customize the "Messages" view format and rerun with the /cleanviews switch again. However, that will only fix the fields that are shown - I'll still have to visit&nbsp;each folder and resize the fields manually, since it won't
 let you change the widths&nbsp;for any&nbsp;fields&nbsp;in the "Messages" view format (why?).</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> this morning, after Outlook had been open for a day and a half, the problem recurred. There were four messages visible in Mailwasher, but after hitting Send/Receive in Outlook only two appeared initially. The other two showed up
 after I closed and restarted Outlook, and showed up about&nbsp;ten seconds after the Inbox was first loaded.</p>
<p>It's as if Outlook&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;new messages&nbsp;in a separate holding area while it tries to decide whether they are spam or not (these two messages&nbsp;are definitely not spam). I'd bet a paycheck&nbsp;that&nbsp;Outlook spawns a separate thread to evaluate each new incoming message,
 and&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;any one&nbsp;of these threads would leave its associated message un-handled while other messages are handled normally. And presumably one of Outlook's start-up tasks would be to process any un-handled messages it finds in the holding area.</p>
<p>So the question is, what causes the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;some&nbsp;(but not all) of these threads? Clearly it is some transient condition, because the same messages are always successfully handled after&nbsp;a restart.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>Please see the update above.</p>
<p>I also want to revisit the question of making permanent changes to the default "Messages" view format.</p>
<p>First, when I edit the Messages view format, it lets me add, remove and move fields, but&nbsp;the formatting attributes for all fields (including any that I added) are disabled. Presumably, Outlook is trying to protect me (or other accounts that might share my
 laptop) from making the default (or current??) view format unusable.</p>
<p>So if I can't set the formatting attributes via the GUI, perhaps I can edit them wherever they're persisted. Where exactly are&nbsp;the attributes&nbsp;such as width stored? I couldn't find anything in the registry,&nbsp;so I assume it's in one of the many XML files in
 the Office12 folder, or possibly in a user-specific copy (though the fact they're disabled suggests the former). Can you point me in the right direction?</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Laptop camera that freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I am using Skype I can receive other persons video and they can see me. After a little while my video picture freezes, while the other person's video is fine. Sometimes if I switch laptop camera from pointing to the front so that it points to the back
 and then reverse it again my video then kicks in again. But a few minutes later it will freeze again.</p>
<p>Is this a mechanical fault with my laptop camera or something I can adjust from within Skype?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            access 2003 run a make table query on form load</h2>
                    <p>I have the following code in the "on load" event of a form. The form is based on the table(tblCompletedDesigns) made by this make table query:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoCmd.SetWarnings False<br />
CurrentDb.Execute "qryDesignBracketMT", dbFailOnError<br />
DoCmd.SetWarnings True</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I open the form, I get a popup error:</p>
<p>Run time error 3010</p>
<p>table"tblCompletedDesigns" already exists</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if&nbsp;I select "end", the form opens with all the records.(This would be fine if I could eliminate the popup.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried adding the following code to the "on close" event of the form</p>
<p>CurrentDb.Execute "Delete * FROM tblCompletedDesigns", dbFailOnError</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but when I&nbsp;open the form, there are no records to display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not appear that the "on open" code actually runs the make table query. I have to go to the query and run it before I open the form to get the table populated.

            <p>I think you misunderstand the error message. It says that tableX already exists. No kidding, in Execute1 you were able to delete THE RECORDS from tableX, so obviously the table existed. A delete statement does not delete the table itself (a table is a container
 of records).</p>
<p>Then on he next line I presume the maketable query is trying to make a new table by that same name, and the table already exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A much better idea would be to change the MakeTable query to an Append query. This type of query adds (appends) records to an existing table.</p>

            <p>I understand what you are saying about the append query and I think you are correct. I would like to make sure I have all the recent completed designs added to my tblCompletedDesigns when I open this form. I removed the delete table statment and changed
 the query to an append query but when I open the form, the number of records doubled when I did not add any "new" completed designs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do so that only&nbsp;new completed designs are added to the table when the append query is run?</p>

            Great!. One more point for the Primary Key. Make sure you have one in every table. It's one of the pillars of good database design.<br />

            Whoa!&nbsp; You did not have a delete table query, you had a delete the records in the table query.&nbsp; Deleting the records leaves the table intact, but empty and ready for the append (not make table) query to add&nbsp;a new set of records.&nbsp; Put the Delete query back
 and you will not have duplicated record problems and&nbsp;will not have to do anything about the&nbsp;primary keys.

<h3> jakovs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 crashes all the time on formula input</h2>
                    <p>1. Yosemite 10.10.5</p>
<p>2. Excel 15.13.1</p>
<p>3. System language is English (US)</p>
<p>4. Default keyboard layout is Russian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several Excel documents which make Excel hang or crash and I can reproduce it in 100% of attempts.</p>
<p>Documents have complex pivot tables, a lot of formulas etc. (I can't share them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to reproduce the case.</p>
<p>1. Open document</p>
<p>2. Focus on a cell with a number in it.</p>
<p>3. Press =</p>
<p>4. Type IF using default keyboard layout (Russian) and get ША instead of IF</p>
<p>5. Delete ША using backspace</p>
<p>6. Switch to English layout using CMD+SPACE</p>
<p>7. Boom! Excel hangs with all opened documents. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can do next is to kill the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is also a crash dump:&nbsp;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/138987/excel_crash_dump.txt</p>

            <p>As a test if you can do so. Is there another similar language you can Speak Setup System Language and Region for that Language. Set up Excel (if there is a Setting for such in Excel).</p>
<ul>
<li>Try on a new spreadsheet Try using that format and Formula. <br />

</p><p>Added German. Found out that there is no matter what language is chosen. It crashes just right after deleting IF inside the cell even when English is used. The issue 100% is somehow connected with content of file because in new Spreadsheet IF formula works
 OK.</p>

            I haven't heard anything. But wouldn't be surprised. All you can do is&nbsp;what you did, posted report. They are constantly working on Bug fixes new features so it might be addressed. But that depends upon how many other are&nbsp;having same issue. At least they
 are aware of it and by affecting something that should normally work. Then it more likely to get a look/see.&nbsp;

                    <p>I am trying to create a report based on a query that will return totals of events by the day of the week.&nbsp; I have a table that has records of visitors every day.&nbsp; Each visitor is recorded with its own record.&nbsp; That record has a unique field (PK_Visitor)
 that is an autoNumber.&nbsp; Another field is the date that the visitor visited.&nbsp; That field (Visit_Date) is a date/time field.&nbsp; I am trying to create a query that finds all of the visitors between a set of dates (Usually something like "between #7/1/2012# and
 #7/31/2012#) and Group them by the days of the week.&nbsp; I want to be able to see how many visitors we had on Mondays, and how many we had on Fridays.&nbsp; I&nbsp; "count" the unique field and try to group it on the date field that is formatted as "dddd".&nbsp; I understand
 that I may see the "dddd" format as the day of the week, but Access sees it as a unique date.&nbsp; Is there a way around this?</p>
<p>Any Help Would be Appreciated,</p>

</p><p>This is so counter-intuitive. If i had to mark every junk email as junk, then what on earth are the junk filters doing?&nbsp;</p>

            Dear AmmarSalman ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. You can also use the option at the bottom <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junkEmail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/junk...</a> to receive only trust email from addresses in my Safe senders and domains list and Safe mailing lists
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!
