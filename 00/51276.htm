    <title>How to restore permissions on external hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to restore permissions on external hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. I have purchased a Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade (I used to use Vista) in a BestBuy Store in Boston. I live in Brazil and activated the product properly. Everything was fine until I stupidly make changes to users permissions in some files and folders
 that I have in a backup extra HD I have installed, with lots of documents and personal files<br />
<br />
Since then I have been trying with no success to restore the original permissions structure for that files and I have been denied to access them again - almost all files in that directory. Re-installing W7 did not help me. Could you please provide me a solution?&nbsp;
 Unfortunately I changed permissions manually without reading the advice on the help menu. Please I need to restore the original permissions in a mass process.
<br />
<br />
Thank a lot in advance. <br />
Ricardo

            OK, thanks for the reply!<br />
<br />
I have 2 different HDs. Windows 7 is installed in one of them and the other one is used to store all my document files. It has many folders and subfolders.<br />
I have entered the security tab in many of those folders, files and subfolders and manually changed permissions. I was not careful enough to read that I was not suposed to do so without knowing what exactly I was doing.<br />
I think I have created multiple prmission conflicts since I also chenged permission settings to the HD root and the main folder inside of which all the subfolders are located.<br />
Since then I am not able to read, copy, erase or anything with 99% of the files and folders of that HD.<br />
Curiously if I login as a guest I am able to read the files but still cannot erase or copy them to other external HD, which would be a solution that could allow me to create a new partition on the "damaged" HD.<br />
After sharing some of those folders (probablu using wrong setting choices) and blocking users from viewing some of the folders (including the main one) I think all the subfolders inherited the permissions wrong choices I have made. Not satisfied I tried to
 chage sharing settings, even knowing I was not able to do so in a proper way.<br />
Now I have stablhished which seems to be a chaotic permission hierarquy, not understood by the system and well far from understandable by myself. the thing is I cannot access almos any folder or file in that HD.<br />
Trying to reconstruct the original permission settings manually seems to be impossible because there are thounsnds of files that I would have to check for security tab and make changes I really do not know how to do and actually I gave up trying to understand.<br />
Anyway I truied to fix some files and it granted me acces to double click them as if they would really open, successfuly getting rid of the denied access pop-ups but the files still do not open.<br />
I think a solution that could prevent me from losing my backup will páss through a mass permissions original setting restoring process. Is it possible?<br />
Thank you very much<br />
Ricardo<br />

            Yesterday I tried to solve this issue by using ICLACS but all I got was "Access denied" for 3300 files on that directory. I was able to manually fix a couple of files by taking the ownership of the folders/files and then entering the Sacurity menu tab
 to grant permission to myself as an administrator but again this is not the solution since there are too many files to fix.<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            <p>First, a <u>project</u> file isn't actually a <u>movie</u>.&nbsp; It is like the blueprint or the recipe for making a movie.&nbsp; Internally the
<u>project</u> lists the files <em>names </em>of the source files (video, photos, music) and the order they belong, the
<em>names</em> of transitions applied, etc.&nbsp; But it does not actually contain any video, photos or music itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in order to open a <u>project</u> file on another PC, in addition to the <u>
project</u> file, you would need all the same <u>source</u> files too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next wrinkle is that a project file is intended to open in the same version in which it was created.&nbsp; Windows XP came with Windows Movie Maker 2.1.&nbsp; But the latest version of Movie Maker is Movie Maker 2012.&nbsp; It cannot open the .mswmm project file from
 WMM 2.1 (XP) because it is too many versions earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a possible workaround; you could <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>.&nbsp; This is the Vista version of the classic Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp; It can open up a project file from WMM 2.x.&nbsp; I would give that a try.&nbsp; Be sure you have the original source files too (video, music, photos) and it should then
 open in WMM 6.0.&nbsp; If it doesn't fully (you see Red Xs instead of video, photos or music) it means it isn't finding the source files in the same location.&nbsp; This can happen if the drive letters or folder names are different.&nbsp; If this is true, then double-click
 on a Red X and navigate to where the source file resides on the new PC.&nbsp; It should fix all source files in that folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have the project opened and working, I would do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would save a new copy of the project file, but with a different name.&nbsp; Use the
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save&nbsp;project as</strong>&nbsp;option to do this.&nbsp; This will be a .mswmm in WMM 6.0 format.&nbsp; If you later want to open this in the newer Movie Maker 2012, you can.</li><li>Save/Publish as a movie.&nbsp; This is the step that could have helped on the XP machine.&nbsp; As I stated before, a project file has no actual content within it that is viewable.&nbsp; Like a blueprint, it isn't a house.&nbsp; And like a recipe, it isn't edible.&nbsp; It's not
 until you build using the blueprint, or bake using the recipe that you get something tangible.&nbsp; To do that, you need to publish the movie.&nbsp; In WMM 6.0, you choose
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Publish Movie</strong>.&nbsp; The resulting .wmv file should be playable on another PC, even one without Movie Maker.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> One additional caveat that I should mention.&nbsp; Each version handles certain transitions and effects differently.&nbsp; Even in going from WMM 2.x to WMM 6.0, you may notice differences in the way certain things are previewed.&nbsp; Certain
 title animations may behave slightly differently, for example.&nbsp; If you have custom transitions/effects/titles that you used in WMM 2.1 (XP), they won't be there in WMM 6.0.&nbsp; (There's a whole different set of
<a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">custom add-ons for WMM 6.0</a>.)&nbsp; The differences between WMM 6.0 and the later Movie Maker versions are even greater. If you are still able to open the projects on your older XP machine, you may just want to finish
 any edits there and save the <u>movie</u> (File &gt; Save Movie) and only bring the
<u>movie</u> forward to the Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; The same applies to WMM 6.0, that if you are able to edit there, publish the
<u>movie</u> and bring that forward, rather than the <u>project</u>.</em></p>

            <p>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; Yes, I understand the project file is a blueprint or roadmap to the source files.&nbsp; I just needed a little direction to get to converting this older format to a newer version.&nbsp; This is very helpful and I do appreciate the short, concise,
 and clear instructions.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does not, then perhaps it was not installed by default (although I find that a little odd). To install it, click Start and type
<strong><em>"Windows Features"</em></strong> in the search, then choose Turn Windows Features on and off from the resulting list (this can also be found by going to control panel--programs); expand the Media Features and make certain Windows Media Player is
 checked. If not, check it and choose OK, this will install the feature.</p>

<h2>            Surface won&#39;t turn on</h2>
                    My surface pro 3 worked for 30 minutes then turned off. After charging it, it still wouldn't turn on. The keyboard lights up when plugged in but nothing is displayed on the surface. When plugged into the charger that key board won't light up. I have tried
 different boot methods and nothing has been successful. Is it dead or am I missing something?&nbsp;

<h2>            How do I remove a fixed cursor on the screen on a Surface tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>This one of several issues we've had since installing an upgrade to Windows 10 build 1607 on our devices.&nbsp; This particular one relates to my wife's Surface tablet.</p>
<p>Now every time she signs on, a standard mouse pointer cursor appears but with an 'active' blue circle next to it.&nbsp; The location can be anywhere but stays fixed until she closes down.&nbsp; This is despite no mouse installation anywhere near the tablet.&nbsp; Changing
 any of the settings relating to mouse or pointer devices has&nbsp;no effect.</p>
<p>How do I remove this rather annoying problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you with the issue with the mouse pointer that you're seeing on your Surface device, we'd like to ask the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the mouse pointer appear randomly on the screen at any given time or only during signing in?</li><li>What are you doing to make the pointer disappear on the screen?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've tried so far to help resolve the issue?</li><li>We'd also like to ask for a screenshot of the mouse pointer issue to further check the best troubleshooting steps to provide you.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Hi Guia</p>
<p>This is like calling the breakdown man when your car stops working only for it to start as soon as he arrives!</p>
<p>For the last 4 days the cursor has not reappeared at all so something I did must have worked, or more likely it corrected itself.&nbsp; It was in a random position but static from first logging on.&nbsp; I tried adjusting all the settings for mouse pointer to change
 it from its initial appearance (which had no effect) and then reset them all back to default.&nbsp; When I rebooted then it still appeared, hence my post but since then it has behaved itself.</p>
<p>If the problem recurs I'll post again but thanks for the contact.</p>
<p>Chris.</p>

            If you are seeing things like this:<br />
<br />
You do not have sufficient security privileges to restore your system.<br />
The System Restore tab is missing from My Computer Properties.<br />
The System Restore tab is available, but the Turn off System Restore (disabled by Group Policy) box is greyed out.<br />
Task Manager has been disabled by your System Administrator.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by your System Administrator.<br />
Task Manager has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
The command prompt has been disabled by your administrator.&nbsp; Press any key to continue...<br />
<br />
<br />
The usual advice is something along the lines of "something has been disabled in Group Policy...", and that is probably true that something has been disabled, but you need to know what that something is and what to do about it.<br />
<br />
If you are using XP Home, you will not get far with advice to use the Group Policy Editor since there is no Group Policy Editor in XP Home and that really doesn't tell you where to look in the Group Policies even if you could run Group Policy Editor.<br />
<br />
You need a comprehensive solution that will work for all versions of XP and do not require hunting around in the Group Policy Editor or the registry to find where things are that might have been disabled.<br />
<br />
Unless you disabled these things on purpose, the chances are good that your system has a malicious software infection.&nbsp; The malware knows what tools you are going to use to try and find and remove it, so the malware disables the things you are most likely to
 use and keeps them from running so you can't find the malicious software and remove it.<br />
<br />
If your system has this kind of affliction, whatever malicious software tools you are currently using or have been using have failed to protect your system so you may want to expand your malicious software prevention and detection horizons to prevent these
 kinds of afflictions in the first place.<br />
<br />
The malicious software will be happiest to fool you into thinking you need to so something drastic to fix your system - like a Repair Install, System Restore point, or a total reinstallation of XP.&nbsp; That is what it would like you to do, but such measures are
 not required.<br />
<br />
You need to fix the immediate problem of the tools not working, then scan your system for malicious software when you are done.
<br />
<br />
No matter what kind of malicious software scanning tools you have already used, they are unlikely to fix this problem because they cannot tell if the changes to your system were on purpose (you or an Administrator made them) or some malicious software changed
 them, so the scanning tools will leave these things alone (this is usually a good thing).<br />
<br />
If your system is afflicted in this manner, there are probably other things that also don't work - like Registry Editor, System Restore and Command Prompt, so fix them all at once even if you haven't found out they are broken yet.<br />
<br />
These registry commands will remove the registry entries that are stopping the programs from opening.&nbsp; Even if the registry entries are not there, these commands are safe to run and will work for all versions of XP.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a new notepad file.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of text into the new notepad file.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or someplace you can remember with a name you can remember, something like:
<br />
<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the enableit.reg file on your desktop and double click it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the enableit.reg file, choose Open With... and select the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... Are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
You can remove the enableit.reg file when you are done.<br />
<br />
If the Registry Editor has also been disabled, we will have to fix that first (not a problem).

<p>Hello ZackSvensson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the Microsoft Forums. You can only change your privacy settings if you have an adult account. If you have a kids account, you will have to ask a parent who managed your Xbox to change these settings for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;the case that your&nbsp;account is an adult account, to change your privacy settings, open the settings app on your Xbox One. From there, make sure that account is selected from the side menu, and then select '<strong>Privacy &amp; online safety</strong>.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in there, select '<strong>Xbox Live Privacy</strong>' and change the settings accordingly to your personal preferences. There is even an option to customize privacy settings that suit your needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to add your friend, select '<strong>View details &amp; customize</strong>' and select '<strong>Friends &amp; Clubs</strong>'. From there, there will be options allowing you to add your friends, allowing others to see your friends&nbsp;list just to name
 a new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you find the option that you would like to change, make sure&nbsp;<strong>'Allow'
</strong>is checked. From then, you should be able to add your friend on Xbox Live. For any additional information, you can check out the
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox privacy</a> article.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>If you are on a child/teen xbox account you can not change this feature and must get an adult to add you to a family group and then change this privacy setting for you.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12417/microsoft-account-add-members-to-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12417/microsoft-account-add-members-to-family</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Xbox account age can not be changed as it is permanently connected to the first date of birth entered when creating your Microsoft account. This can't be changed even by Xbox support. Your account will be promoted to an adult account when that original birth
 date reaches 18 (19 in Korea). You can change your Microsoft account age but that doesn't change your Xbox account age.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your adult account go here <a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/Settings</a> and click on the child's account and allow the option on the first page called "Share stuff people make (Xbox 360: Member Content)" to everyone (must be everyone). Also, on the first page, "Others can communicate with voice,
 text, or invites" to Friends or Everybody. And on the Xbox one/windows 10 tab the second option down, "Join multiplayer games", enable that. Enable other settings you want, also. And then log out and in on the account in question on the console/device and
 that account can play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Microsoft account is an adult account you may be able to access that page but any changes will not take effect for real if your Xbox account is a child account.<br />
<br />
If both are a child/teen account that page will take you to a page about adding a child account to a family.<br />

<p>Hello&nbsp;again Zack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 10 app, navigate to your profile on the top left (should be one of the first icons below the three lines). From there, look for a '<strong>More</strong>' button and select it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once selected, it should give you an option for privacy settings in which a web browser will pop up allowing you to change your settings online. It will ask you to login with your corresponding Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case your browser doesn't open, I have will link the online, website privacy changer
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Settings?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=main%3aprivacytab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here once logged in (assuming&nbsp;you are an Adult account), select the tab '<strong>Xbox One/Windows 10 Safety</strong>' and scroll down to '<strong>Add Friends</strong>'. Select 'A<strong>llow</strong>' and then make sure you hit the green '<strong>submit</strong>'
 button. From here, you should be all set!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel that I helped you resolve your concern, it would mean a lot to me if you could select 'Yes' next to 'Did this solve your problem.'</p>

<h2>            Cannot fix&#47;reset&#47;update&#47;reinstall Calendar App</h2>
                    <p>Couple weeks ago the Calendar app started crashing whenever I opened it. Mail worked fine but Calendar would show for about 3 seconds then crash. There was some kind of App Event (below)&nbsp;in event logs. After trying a few things I'm in a really horked state
 where App Store thinks the app is installed, but in Settings the app doesn't exist. I cannot reinstall the app because store won't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to&nbsp;Reset app&nbsp;it in Settings but when I selected the app, it would just spin "Loading ..." forever, so I never got the opportunity to Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried wsreset.exe to see if resetting the store cache would help ... nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to remove the app using PowerShell command ...</p>
<p>Remove-AppxPackage -Package microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_17.8004.42017.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>... but that command hung forever. When I killed the command I found I was in this horked state:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No Mail or Calendar app shows up on main window/desktop</li><li>No Mail or Calendar app shows up in Settings -&gt; Apps &amp; Features</li><li>The Mail app shows up as Installed in the Store</li></ul>
<p>I cannot (re)install the app because Store thinks its already installed. I cannot uninstall/reset the app&nbsp;it because Settings cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Help ME!!!</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are number of reasons why Calendar app is not working its supposed to. The first thing that you should take to resolve the issue is to run the
<strong>Windows Apps Troubleshooter</strong>. But since the app is already uninstalled and cannot be installed back, we suggest that you run the
<strong>SFC </strong><strong>scan </strong>and <strong>DISM </strong>on your computer. Kindly follow the steps provided in this
<strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">link</a></strong>.

            <p>I ran the SFC and DISM tools, couple times, and now the Mail and Calendar app is back! Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that just got me back to where I was: Calendar crashes about 1-2 seconds after it starts. Error is below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that the app was updated since I first reported. I would have hoped the new version fixed whatever bug is causing the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas??</p>
<p>

<p>Just to let everybody know, the Kinect features we're exploring with Halo: Anniversary are optional and won't affect your core gameplay experience. Our mission, from day one, has been to deliver a faithful recreation of the original game, and we remain dedicated
 to seeing that through to completion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question I have is: "What ever happened to scanning an item and using it with Kinect?" &nbsp;I remember seeing some early Kinect videos that had shown a skateboard being scanned and then used. &nbsp;I could see that being useful especially if a gun, sword, shield,
 etc was made to be used with certain games. &nbsp;Viewing the target shooting with GR:FS during E3 it is apparent that the player needs something in hand, say a made for Kinect rifle, that has an actual working trigger and maybe other parts. &nbsp;Then, instead of looking
 weird and funny playing Kinect you can actually look like you are playing something and feel more involved. &nbsp;I just do not feel involved when I am just waving my arms around with empty hands. &nbsp;And it would be more immersive to actually have a sword and shield
 in a game such as skyrim. &nbsp;I probably would not use it but many would. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No. What's the big problem with it supporting Kinect anyway? If you can use a controller, just use it as if it doesn't have Kinect features.</p>
<p>I don't own a Kinect, but still.</p>

<h3> aadarshashutosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t disable&#47;remove PIN for logging into Windows 10 v1903</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It's been quite sometime and I've tried many ways to disable the PIN but I can't.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. I removed the logging in password, and now my PC log in screen shows two log in methods, [password and PIN] clicking on password automatically logs me into the windows while clicking on PIN asks for PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. For a time, There was option to change the PIN, however, the option to remove it was grayed out, and i tried to remove it by leaving the new PIN field empty but I couldn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The option to change or remove it has disappeared, instead, "Sorry this PIN isn't working for your organisation resources. Tap or click here to fix it" message appears. I want to point out that, it's a personal PC, I have my institutes office365
 account signed in, nothing more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly help....</p>

<p>Happened the first time turning my pc back on after resetting it, as an update had given me a memory leak. It wouldn't let me in without creating a pin which i did not want to do, now it says "Sorry this PIN isn't working for your organisation resources.
 Tap or click here to fix it"</p>
<p>I am not using Windows hello or cortana or anything, as i find it annoying and inconvenient.</p>
<p>When you click to fix it it tells me to sign into my account, then it wont let me sign in as it is a personal not a work account
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix it.</p>

The gpedit.msc does not work.&nbsp; Says it can't find that location.&nbsp; This is very annoying that I can't prevent it asking for a PIN every time I log in.&nbsp;

            Same problem here. I used gpedit.msc and it shows that pin is not setup, yet on each restart there it is. Trying to lock down a unit from outside use and can't change the login info. This is a real security issue. I expect more from Microsoft and Windows.
 Unacceptable.&nbsp;

            Start by installing the latest updates for Windows 10 Mobile if any is available.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, backup your files the reset your phone to its original factory settings.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Photos app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            My recommendation is, if the drive is working fine, do not update it. Sometimes these driver updates can make things worst. 
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings
<br />Click Restart
<br />Press (4) to Enable Safe Mode
<br />Wait while Windows 10 starts in safe mode.
<br />Log in
<br />
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available

            Hi Kenneth, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Kenneth, actually having read your question again . . .
<br />
<br />I think the issue is that the driver you were installing is incompatible with your system. If that did not complete installing, you should be OK
<br />
<br />If you are getting Blue Screens still ,then please upload those Mini Dump file(s)
<br />
<br />One your chosen Cloud Service (OneDrive, DropBox . ..  etc.) choose to share that file then get a link and copy the link into your next post . . ..       
        </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; RE: DaveM118,&nbsp;</p>
<p>acquired a HP 870-244 Omen 16GBs RAM 1tb HDD personal 1 TB HDD Windows/programs Geforce GTX Graphics 1070 card So Nvidia graphics and surround sound I've been thrilled with all aspects of the machine so far (since 1/3/18)I'm an old 20 yr XP fan so going
 to a knew unit with win 10 was a whole knew universe to me. The error occurred when I went to install driver updates for Nvidia sound and graphics, I also have any time updates for win 10 and it was installing at the time I started the driver updates, it was
 35% into it I had no idea till I looked at security updates by chance, shortly thereafter a blue screen came up saying sorry YOUR computer has encountered a problem and needs to shut down If you want more info so to https://www.windows.com/stopcode, If you
 talk to a tech tell him UNEXPECTED KERNAL MODE TRAP &nbsp;&nbsp; mfdhidk.sys failed &nbsp; Right now it's working perfectly But if I try and install an update LOOK OUT things don't work right sluggish, so I shut it down for a couple three hours and everything's normal, It's
 still under warranty so I got ahold of an HP Rep tech and we put it through diagnostics and it passed with flying colors. So I'm sending it out the 11th to the shop and let them handle it. I've got three other computers to choose from but this is my baby,
 gaming, VR ready, Bluetoothe, WiFi, Infrared along with a 27" curve screen makes for great inclusion, totally expandable to 64 RAM 32 recommended, I still have room for another HDD and the MOBO is M.2 ready, I love this machine I hope they can remedy the situation.
 Thanks for your answer I went to the event viewer just couldn't save to one drive or cloud because I got rid of it. Thanks again&nbsp;</p>
