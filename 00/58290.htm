*Start Button<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t change my default audio settings.</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem regarding my audio settings. When I am in my sound panel I have 2 options of playback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: Communication headphones with IDT HD Audio CODEC (no problem identified)</p>
<p>2: Digital Output (S/PDIF) IDT HD Audio CODEC (no problems identified)</p>
<p>
</p><p>De default is option nr: 2</p>
<p>But I need it to be my Headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try to select the headphones as default, nothing happens. In the lower right corner of my screen I have the speaker icon, when I Left click I can choose between the 2 options, but when I pick my headphones it doesnt work, it just chooses the 2 option
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has all come to surface after I had to reinstall windows. I have already tried to unistall drivers and deaktivate option 2.</p>
<p>When I deaktivate option 2 my speaker icon in lower right gets a red X symbol, as if no sound options are available. But yet I still have my headphones aktivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I test my headphones the sounds are plying like they should do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple in/out-put possibllities in my tower cabinet, but uses the HP beats audio panel from the front of the tower. Before I had to do the reinstall of windows 10 it worked perfectly.</p>

            The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions.

    <title>Syncing appointments between Windows computer Calendar App &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Syncing appointments between Windows computer Calendar App &#38; Android Phone Calendar</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have been using the Calendar App &amp; Android Phone together now successfully for over a year. Only recently an issue has begun occurring where some (not all) appointments I add to the Calendar app on my computer appear on my phone, and some do not despite
 many "refreshes" or "sync" on both devices. &nbsp;Even signing out/in and turning device off and on does not make the appointments appear over a number of days. &nbsp;The same issue occurs in reverse, some appointments added on my phone do not (and some do) appear on
 the calendar app on my computer. &nbsp;Again refreshing within the app or via "accounts" in the settings menu on my phone doesnt seem to help at all.</p>
<p>Because I have used my Live account for many years I did not want to set up a new "google" account for email and calendar appointments when I purchased the android phone, thus setting up my Live account as a "Microsoft Exchange" account because I need to
 access this email/calendar on a range of different devices. &nbsp;As I said it worked fine this way for a long time, only recently having this frustrating issue and missing appointments as I cannot rely on either calendar to be fully up to date. &nbsp;Any suggestions
 provided would be very helpful as I have run out of ideas to try and fix and had no luck searching for solutions online.</p>

            <p>Hi Jayant,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. &nbsp;I will try and answer your questions as best I can, although I am not very tech brained!</p>
<p>1. No i dont believe any changes were made to the computer or phone immediately before I began having these problems, unless there was an auto update or similar I wasnt aware of.</p>
<p>2. On my android phone, the microsoft account is configured as an "exchange activesync" account which is same as my work email account- I am currently having no issues with this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my windows 8 PC- I login with my live account then all the mail, calendar etc apps just display the information from the live account. I dont recall having to set these up separately on my PC.</p>
<p>3. When this issue began one of my attempts to fix was to install outlook app to my android and see if that helped. &nbsp;It was better but still not 100%, however I dont like the display of the calendar and would like to keep email and calendar in separate apps
 so this wasnt suitable for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have auto updates set on both my android phone &amp; windows 8 PC, running current versions on all and windows update is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your suggestions-</p>
<p>When I log into Live calendar, not all the entries are there suggesting there is a problem sending calendar entries from both my PC app and phone app. &nbsp;Today I had an error message on my windows 8 PC within the calendar app (when trying to sync) saying "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
 is unavailable"</p>
<p>Even if I remove the account and reinstall on my phone, can I expect to still have the same issues with my PC? I dont want to remove the live account from my PC as that is what I set it up originally with, and I am not confident on playing with those settings!</p>

Means that you were trying to use an HTTPS protocol prefix on an (undisclosed)&nbsp;host name.&nbsp; Why did you think that would be appropriate?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many hosts do not support HTTPS, so doing whatever it is that you were doing with the one that you were doing it with would
 have&nbsp;caused the same symptom&nbsp;with them too.</p>

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is "possible"<br />
that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory and cables (on<br />
both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure the system has adequate<br />
ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully inspect the motherboard and other<br />
cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>fatal hardware error</strong>&nbsp;implication.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<h2>            Frequently get disconnected. Please help.</h2>
                    I get disconnected VERY frequently. So frustrating. I still have a connection whenever i get disconnected, it just kicks me off all the time. I've tried going through the troubleshooting steps for getting randomly disconnected. I dont know what the problem
 is. And i dont think i could identify the problem either. I know nothing about setting up modems and routers, i just know how to reset them. This isn't a temporary problem, it's been happening since i've had this setup. Please help.

Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you are using an external display adapter, you may take it out from the PCI slot of the computer &amp; put it back. Thereafter, check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you are not comfortable doing it, please contact your manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Yes I did check the two suggestions. The second I did and there is no update available.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the first method, I don't believe I have an external display adaptor. I have nothing outside of the computer and the only thing plugged into it is the monitor.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Taskbar disappear behind maximized windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nanaae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar disappear behind maximized windows</h2>
                    Earlier today, I noticed that when I maximize my windows (any window or application) the taskbar disappears behind it. At first I thought that I had the Auto-Hide optioned enabled but that's not the case, the option is
<i>disabled</i>. The only way I can once again see the taskbar is to minimize my windows or make the window smaller.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on how to fix this?</div>

            You are probably super-maximizing the window into full-screen mode. &nbsp;Try pressing F11 or Alt-Enter (depending on the program) to get it into regular maximized mode where the Taskbar stays visible.

<p>UGH!!!! People these days. Come on guys its pretty much common sence to know not to put water on electronics. It will fry them and break them because water and electricty dont mix. If you do mix them it can shock the (......) out of you or short out stuff.
 People should really think about what they see on the internet before acting on the idea.
</p>
<p>Also, Self repairs are NOT ALLOWED and will void your warrenty and/or the ability to get a repair from microsoft.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPv4 Address . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.0.207<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Router . . . . . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.0.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>shows that your iPad is getting an IP address in the 192.168.0.* range and that the router address is most likely 192.168.0.1 so I do not understand why you are setting manually to 192.168.137.13.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. brand and model of router?</p>
<p>2. besides the iPad, what else is connected? </p>
<p>3. can you shut down all other computers and turn off the ipad and any cell phones (for testing).</p>
<p>&nbsp; a. on your Surface, set it back to DHCP and not static. shut down your Surface</p>
<p>&nbsp; c.&nbsp; power cycle the router, wait two minutes</p>
<p>&nbsp; b. power ON your Surface - what IP address does it get?</p>

<p>That is DHCP who is giving dynamically 192.168.137.13 and after Network reset it gives dynamically 169.254.3.58. so all &nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>So as stated:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"Only solution is giving it a Static IP address (EX: 192.168.0.12).</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm travelling and this happens when I'm connecting to my or any phone or an internet cafe or Public library.</p>
<p>Not all the time but&nbsp;90 %.</p>

<p>So nothing to do with&nbsp;the router.</p>

<p>My phones hotspot is called LumiaCarl and the IP address (static) is 192.168.137.13.</p>
<p>However in another location Dynamic IP given was 10.0.0.12 while the static address I had to give was 192.168.182.12</p>

<p>As you requested I've done the following in a Cafe with Wifi</p>
<p>1/ "Forget" the connection.</p>
<p>2/ reconnect again using DHCP </p>
<p>3/ no internet (look at the dns it's given me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4/ removed my Lumia Hotspot from the known networks and did steps 1,2,3 again</p>
<p>&nbsp;Result: No luck&nbsp; same result as picture above.</p>
<p>5/ Forget" the connection and rebooted.</p>
<p>6/ connected again using DHCP and this time it gives me what it should be (right dns)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is coincidence, will have to try again in another internet cafe, but looks like it has something to do with my Lumia's hotspot.</p>
<p>That doesn't explain though why I can connect to the hotspot and Cafe WIFI with my IPad without any problems.</p>

                    <p>Here's the problem. When I powered on my laptop, Everything worked fine for the first 30-45 minutes. After that, I cannot connect to my wireless internet. When I troubleshooted the problem, it showed:</p>
<p>problem with wireless adapter or access point (not fixed)</p>
<p>A network cable is not properly plugged in or maybe broken (not fixed)<br />
I tried many many ways to fix it: reset router, using commands, uninstall or disable enable the driver but none of them worked for me.</p>
<p>And then, I tried to reboot the laptop. after that, the connection became normal, but after 30-45 minutes, the problem happened again! and it showed the same problems when I troubleshooted it.</p>
<p>thanks for your help<br />

As per the description of the issue, your wireless adapter is having issues. There has already been an old post with the same issue. Here's the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/problem-with-wireless-adapter-and-access-point-in/f2a00568-41db-479d-a222-6eb1573e0632">

Hope this information was helpful.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with this concern, you may try to use the Network Reset to reinstall network devices. This can also help fix connection problems you might have after upgrading from a previous version of Windows to Windows&nbsp;10, as well as&nbsp; solve problems where
 you can connect to the Internet but not to shared network drives. It removes any network adapters you have installed and the settings for them. After your PC restarts, any network adapters are reinstalled, and the settings for them are set to the defaults.
 Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp; button, then select <strong>Settings </strong>
&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Status</strong> &gt; <strong>Network reset</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Network reset</strong> screen, select <strong>Reset now</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong> to confirm.
<p>Wait for your PC to restart and see if that fixes the problem.<br />
</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note</strong></span>: To use network reset, your PC must be running Windows&nbsp;10 Version 1607 or later. To see which version of Windows&nbsp;10 your device is currently running, select the
<strong>Start</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt;
<strong>About</strong>. Also, Network reset might set each one of your known network connections to a public network mode. In a public network mode, your PC is not discoverable to other PCs and devices on the network, which can help make your PC more secure.
 However, if your PC is part of a homegroup or used for file or printer sharing, you’ll need to make your PC discoverable again. To do this, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Wi-Fi&nbsp;</strong>. On the
<strong>Wi-Fi</strong> screen, select <strong>Manage known networks</strong> &gt; the network connection you want to change &gt;
<strong>Properties</strong>, and then turn on the switch under <strong>Make this PC discoverable</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p />

    <title>Media Player Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exploitedzebra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player Crashing</h2>
                    
<p>When I use my xbox one purely as a music player, and open Media Player to play music from my Transcend USB drive, it regularly crashes. This always happens when I simply hit "Play All" once I've browsed to my music folder of several 10's GB of my mp3s. After
 a few songs, it will always crash at some point, sometimes in the missle of a song. When it does, it gives me a "Playback error" message with an option to report the problem - but even that has crashed so I can do nothing but exit to the home screen and start
 again. If I play a single album, it is generally fine, but even then it often freezes in the middle of a song for several seconds.</p>
<p>Why is this, and why is it that a state of the art console can't even play music easily, which my 360 does no problem?</p>

<p>Actually, EZ I'm seeing this when watching movies and looking at photos through Media Player. &nbsp; My experience is it either crashes or hangs but the end result is I have to kill the Media Player app to get it to work again. &nbsp;I've tried removing and reinstalling
 that app (perhaps the app never patched) a number of times, but other that that there not much to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>I stream from a DLNA player which has made my support experience with Microsoft incredibly frustrating. &nbsp;The same video or images steamed to a 360, phones, tablets, a media appliance, or PC in the house works all day long.</p>
<p>I ran across this post in another desperate hope that Microsoft took ownership and fixed their app.</p>
<p>I debated switcginbg my current DNLA server with Plex since there is support for it on the XB1, but I'm about ready to just change hardware solutions. &nbsp;If my X360 can do it...and a $50 WD Live can do it...but a $500 flagship cant there really isn't an excuse.</p>
<p>The only thing that's kept my XB1 off Craigslist is the Master Chief.</p>

<p>Please tell me exactly what I was supposed to "come back" to? My own comment? </p>
<p>Do you honestly think this is a good experience for Xbox Customers:</p>
<p>1) Post a problem</p>
<p>2) get ignored by MS for over 1 month</p>
<p>3) Other users respond with a similar problem</p>
<p>4) MS respond to the new posted, while still ignoring the OP</p>
<p>5) MS close your post as you have not responded despite the fact there is nothing to respond to.</p>
<p>Seriously? </p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;ExploitedZebra!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about any frustrations this may have caused. The reason that we lock threads is to ensure that the person who bumps the thread can receive individual support specifically tailored to them. Also, if time has passed since the original poster has replied, it is possible that they may no longer be experiencing the issue.</p>
<p>If you are continuing to experience issues with the Media Player app, I recommend trying the steps that Mister Beep has suggested in your other thread&nbsp;here. Trying a different hard drive or reformatting your current hard drive would definitely help us narrow down if the issues lies with the hard drive or the console. Another suggestion would be trying your hard drive with a different console if possible. I definitely understand that this may not be an ideal step to try but it will definitely help us find out specifically where the issue is coming from.&nbsp;<br /><br />Give the suggested steps a try and be sure to let us know the results. Thanks!</p>

            Sorry, my mistake. From my intensive research on this subject, I came to the conclusion that you cannot prevent your child from downloading free applications. You can set limits on what your child purchases with money but not for free if it is an appropriate game.

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager &gt; View (on top) &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Now, try to find them
<br />
<br />Q. Is there any updated driver for Microsoft AC adapter?
<br />A. You need to locate this in Device Manager &gt; Right click &gt; Update driver. If there is any updated driver, this will get updated.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Read-Only Access</h2>
                    In windows 7, I was an administrator,&nbsp;after I upgraded to windows 10 all my files are read-only and I do not have the rights to save a file in my user directories.&nbsp; In the security tab under properties&nbsp;of user\my directory is my login user name is there
 but it is not available in the sub-directories. I have tried using the add button in the advanced security menu but that's not working for me either.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

<p>It appears that there is an intermittent Kinect driver issue, which turns it on, off and calibrates it. Yesterday I found there was a problem of Kinect sign in, giving me a code 0x80a40008, but also noticed there was an issue of the Kinect working properly.
 I did a hard reset, and factory reset, but when I did a factory reset, the Kinect refused to calibrate before I entered my sign in information (it should calibrate the Kinect before the sign in info is entered, not after). I redid the factory reset which then
 it calibrated the Kinect before I entered my sign in info. </p>
<p>With the Kinect drivers, it turns it on through software (not hardware switching) as well as overall function of it. Persistent cashe might be part of the problem, where the cashe is overloading the driver function, but I think the driver in the Kinect might
 be the sole source of the problem, where the drivers in the console and in the Kinect don't communicate well. Might need a revision of the driver software in both the Kinect and console to resolve the problem.</p>

                    <p>I've recently had the hard drive for my computer replaced, so the game I have from the Windows 10 store isn't installed. I've checked the page where you buy the game and it says I already own it, but when I look for it in the Store to download it again,
 I get an error. The game I'm trying to get back is Cuphead. I can't seem to find it in the app, only in the browser. (If there's an Install button right there and I'm just being stupid let me know)</p>

<p>Hi Akiko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively assist you with the error code 0X00000005 when trying to download, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and version of Windows are you running on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>To check, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> &gt; type <strong>winver </strong>
&gt; hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried downloading other games from Windows Store aside from Cuphead? If yes, what was the result?<br />
</li></ul>

<p>I'm using the OS Build 10586.04 and Version 1511. From the information it must be a bit outdated. I'll try updating and see what happens.</p>
<p>Cuphead is the only game I've gotten from the Microsoft Store since I get all my other games from other places. I've received a code as a gift, which is why I used the Microsoft Store.</p>

 the game i downloaded it with the app.

Thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
Yes, you need to install all available Windows updates to avoid any issues. Since installing the updates didn't resolve the issue with the Cuphead application, we suggest contacting
