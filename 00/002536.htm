<h2>            The file name is too long</h2>
                    I have a word document that was created in 2014 with Word 2010. I recently upgraded to Word 2016 and i'm not able to open the document because the file name is too long. Does anyone have a fix for this?

<h2>            Excel ribbon disappears</h2>
                    <p>When I open certain files, my Excel 2013&nbsp;ribbon disappears.&nbsp; Only shows blank area.&nbsp; File menu, minimize/maximize/close....all blank.&nbsp; The only way I can close excel then is to go to the task bar and right click on excel.</p>
<p>If I open the file from Windows Explorer, it opens fine.&nbsp; If I open Excel first, then open the file, the ribbon goes blank.&nbsp; If I grab a side of Excel and manually resize it very small, then drag it back to be bigger, it re-appears.&nbsp; Only happens on certain
 files.&nbsp; Size doesn't appear the issue, files of 150m open fine, but 2 of the files I'm having issue with are 10m and 18m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions</p>

I understand your concern and will assist you with this issue.<br />

1) What is the extension of the file in which the Excel ribbon doesn't appear? Is it *.xls or *.xlsx?<br />
<br />
2) Where is the problem files saved? Is it in local drive or network location?<br />

            <p>1.&nbsp; One of the files creating the issue is a .xls file.&nbsp; The other is a .xlsm.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Both files saved on network location.&nbsp; However, I just copied both files to my hard drive, and when I open them from the hard drive, they open OK.&nbsp; I've gone back and forth several times now.&nbsp; Hard drive still opens fine, network location does not.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I believe its pretty well every time.&nbsp; These files aren't used much, really only about twice a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did start Excel in safe mode.&nbsp; there were 3 add-ins listed, but none were checked.&nbsp; I ran both repairs per the link you supplied.&nbsp; Restarted computer.&nbsp; Both files continued to act as they did before.&nbsp; They will open fine from hard drive, but not network
 location.</p>
<p>Taking this a step further.&nbsp; One of the files will open fine from network when I'm using Ethernet, but not when I'm wireless.&nbsp; The other file will not work either plugged or wireless (I'm usually wireless).</p>

            <p>I just had this problem with office 2013.</p>
<p>in my case, I am using wireless and I suspect it has to do with "Power Query" Sign-in/Sign-Out Organization feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>so I did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. open excel new, empty workbook.</p>
<p>2. I see ribbon now</p>
<p>3. go to "Power Query" menu and "Sign Out" of Organization.</p>
<p>4. then I use excel empty file to open the existing workbook that I had problem with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it works fine.</p>
<p>5. I then close every thing (all excel) and point to my original excel file that has PowerPivot data in it that I had problem with before and now it opens up with the ribbon and no more issues.</p>

            <p>Hello Glen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever found a solution?</p>
<p>We are expiriencing the same problem with our Excel and SAP add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we run a external Query on the SAP DB with the Excel Business Explorer add-in, &nbsp;the data communication between Excel and SAP takes to long and when Excel is maximized We get the same blank UI as show in you're picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use :</p>
<p>- Windows 64x bit OS</p>
<p>- Office 32bits</p>
<p>- SAP 7.3</p>
<p>- Bex 7</p>
<p>- WIFI &nbsp;801.x</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we open up Excel and run it in a window (not maximized) then every thing works fine, also when we ALT-TAB between excel and a other program during the data communication excel builds up the UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a timemings issue with somee large network data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we do the same steps with a network cable (100MB full) everything works fine and excel builds the UI also in FULL screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a windows/excel bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

            <p>No, have not found a solution other than plugging in a network cable.&nbsp; Fortunately for me it is only happening on 2 files that I don't use very often, so it's just a minor inconvenience.&nbsp; Using Alt-Tab does not work for me though.&nbsp; One file with have the
 UI, one won't.</p>
<p>Seems like&nbsp;the Excel/SAP combination is the culprit, because I can use files 5 times larger that have no connection to SAP and they open fine.</p>
<p>Side note, our company has experienced major headaches with Excel 2013 and SAP Bex 7 (GUI 7.3).&nbsp; The computer experts here say it's something related to Excel replacing some VB infrastructure with .net and then limiting the amount of memory Excel will allow.&nbsp;
 Bex is crashing constantly on larger files or when having too many files open (I use the term 'too many' loosely, because it doesn't take much).&nbsp; Our users have had to go back to Excel 2010 to get their job done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You would think two large companies like Microsoft and SAP would learn to play together better.</p>

<h2>            Delete Office 365 group orphaned site collection</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem to the one described here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_o365admin-mso_manage/remove-orphaned-site-from-i-think-deleted-office/017f4671-ef75-4603-84c5-f02def90d2aa</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted an Office 365 group but the associated site collection is still there and I am unable to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I delete the site collection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible another clarification:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- How do I create a new team in Microsoft Teams without creating a new Office 365 group? My goal would be to create a new team but associate it with an existing Office 365 group. I saw a post at https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Teams/How-to-connect-a-quot-Team-quot-to-a-quot-Group-quot/m-p/27881#M706&nbsp;but
 my Microsoft Teams doesn't have the option to create a team associated with an existing Office 365 group which should already be possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
Good to know that the issue has been resolved. Here I’d like to write a summary:<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot delete the site created from an Office 365 Groups after the group was deleted.<br />
<br />
<br />
The deletion progress hung and we have fixed it from backend.<br />
<br />
=================<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions, please feel free to post a new thread, and we will continue to assist you from there.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Outlook Stopped Working&#34;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just want to ask about this problem of mine regarding with MS Outlook 2007. As what I have noticed that every time I open MS Outlook after a minute it will display "Microsoft Outlook Stop Working". I have seen the process every time I tried to open my
 Outlook. It is by default automatically send\receive email, then I tried to disable the scheduled send\receive email and it did not display "Microsoft Outlook Stop Working" anymore. But I cannot receive mails anymore because I have disabled it, unless I will
 click the Send\Receive button at the toolbar. But then when I clicked it will show again the 'Microsoft Outlook Stop Working".

            <p>Please have a look at these older forum threads, the issue is very similar, involving Outlook 2007, with the same error in the same module.&nbsp; There is a god chance you have a miss-behaving add-in.</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any update with this issue? Is this caused by an Update with Windows? This was the scenario (Today it happens to user 1 and after 3 days it happens again to user 2) I just cant remember when it happened to user 3. By now only user 1 escaped from the issue
 because I upgraded it to Outlook2013 and two of the others are temporarily accessing their mails thru (gmail).</p>
<p>I'm hoping that this issue will be solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>

            Have the OL 2007 users start OL using the safe switch (Hold the Ctrl Key when Starting OL) is the problem then replicated, if not then its an add-in causing the problem<br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know exactly how long it was set for automatic send/receive but I already "touched" it during my troubleshooting. I even set it to 2 minutes just to confirm that the problem is in send/receive process. Then I was able to conclude that it's really
 in receiving that makes Outlook stopped working as seen in the screen shot I attached above. For now I have already disabled the automatic send/receive.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what you are seeing different than I, but both screens show build 15063...</p>
<p>One is showing 15063.332 which is the newest build update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular build is both a Insider Preview and a Public Release, so the watermark on the lower right was removed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will likely need to rejoin the Insider Program to receive more insider builds...</p>
<p>Your activity in the program is usually suspended when a Insider Preview and a Public Release are the same build... Just verify you want to continue with the program...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more info on your build version, you can right click on the Start Icon and select RUN, then enter "winver"...</p>

            The failure to install build 16199 is a known issue and has affected many Insiders. If you read through this forum and see what other Insiders have tried to resolve the issue, you may find a solution. If not, it would be best to wait for the next build
 sometime next week after the USA Memorial Day Holiday.

<p>Some have been able to update by downloading the latest ISO build 16193 from </p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced</a></p>
<p>and manually installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it is downloaded you can Open it with File Explorer and run the setup.exe to Install or if you read all of the help on how to create a install USB key it can be Installed that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is running on UEFI you might have to turn off secure boot when using the USB key.
</p>
<p>If you can get Build 16193 Installed it might have a better chance of updating to Build 16199.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 16199 successfully Installed on My Desktop System I have had very good Reliability Reports the Best it has ever been for me in the Insider Fast Ring image below.</p>

    <title>Using CustomDocumentProperties with VBA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> la lawyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using CustomDocumentProperties with VBA</h2>
                    I have been trying to use VBA to determine whether a CustomDocumentProperty exists so that I could either give it data or name it and give it data. &nbsp;I have a function which mandates a string parameter of&nbsp;NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty. &nbsp;(It requires a string
 variable of NewText, but that is not a problem, yet!)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have various code such as (for now, this fails whether or not the property exists):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Error GoTo ItsEmpty</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not IsEmpty(.CustomDocumentProperties(NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty.Value)) Then</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>and</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>On Error GoTo ItsEmpty</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not IsNull(.CustomDocumentProperties(NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty.Value)) Then</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On Error GoTo ItsEmpty</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not IsEmpty(.CustomDocumentProperties(NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty)) Then</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>and</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>On Error GoTo ItsEmpty</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Not IsNull(.CustomDocumentProperties(NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty)) Then</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>On Error GoTo ItsEmpty</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If .CustomDocumentProperties(NameOfCustomOrBuiltInProperty).Value ="" Then</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>NONE of these (and similar others) have worked, nor is the error trapped. &nbsp;Instead, I get Error Code 5 (Invalid Procedure Call or Argument) which is not trapped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I determine if the Custom Property Exists? &nbsp;if the Custom Property has any value?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help! &nbsp;And TIA.</div>

            The folks who design and maintain VBA aren't always consistent. In this case you might think that trying to access the value of a nonexistent custom property might raise runtime error 5825, "Object has been deleted", which is what you get if you try the
 same thing with a document variable. But no, you get Error 5.<br />
<br />
The way around this is to iterate through the list of existing custom properties until either you find the one you want or you run out of properties to test. Try it this way in a new blank document:<br />
<br />
Function CustomPropExist(WhichDoc As Document, NameOfProp As String) As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim prop As DocumentProperty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ret As Boolean<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Each prop In WhichDoc.CustomDocumentProperties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If LCase(prop.Name) = LCase(NameOfProp) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ret = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit For<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CustomPropExist = ret<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
Sub test()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim PropName As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PropName = "Foo"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CustomPropExist(ActiveDocument, PropName) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Value of " &amp; PropName &amp; " is '" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.CustomDocumentProperties(PropName).Value &amp; "'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Custom property " &amp; PropName &amp; " does not exist... adding now."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.CustomDocumentProperties.Add Name:="foo", Value:="bar", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LinkToContent:=False, Type:=msoPropertyTypeString<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CustomPropExist(ActiveDocument, PropName) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Value of " &amp; PropName &amp; " is '" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ActiveDocument.CustomDocumentProperties(PropName).Value &amp; "'"<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Health app login is broken.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Now that the Band is available in the UK under European Law it's really available throughout Europe. The companion app for the phone is quite picky about the login though and seems to only work if you have your language set to English UK which is somewhat
 weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possibly a bug but it should be worked out since the Band ships from the UK store throughout Europe and the app should really work anywhere. I guess it's a bug but still..</p>

            <p>Sorry, I should be more clear!</p>
<p>I am on WP8 and there's no FB app installed. It is just&nbsp;FB feed&nbsp;built into people hub!</p>
<p>Everything else works just fine and it even shows a glance of notes just fine, but when I tap on a note to see the rest of it, it opens IE and navigates to FB mobile website with a URL which includes an ID (that I assume to be the note ID) but FB says that
 the requested page is not valid. To be even more clear, if I tap on a note in people's hub/what's new the URL will be like: m.facebook.com/notes/my-fb-name/notename/noteid?_rdr while if I go to the same note on FB on my phone's IE&nbsp;the URL is like: m.facebook.com/#!/note.php?note_id=noteid&amp;__user=userid</p>
<p>Hope this help to get this fixed faster :)</p>

            <p>A lot of people are trying to replicate what they knew on the Windows side and want a "portable" identity (they did it with an online PST).</p>
<p>They place the identity on servers, flash drives etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that even when you make sure the identity can be indexed, the index is typically not up to date when they connect the identity to a new computer and they can't understand why searches and smart mailboxes fail (plus, this type of setup are
 typically prone to all sorts of nasty corruptions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, aliases are usually fine. I'm not using them myself, but there are multiple reports indicating it works just OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know, an alternative for people with limited space on the boot drive is to relocate the User folder to a secondary drive (I'm currently running on that sort of setup). You can specify the location of the user account in the advanced preferences
 in the Users prefpane and Outlook just follows the path (relative links are just fine, and for the few apps using hard paths, I created a symlink in /Users).</p>

            In addition to what DIane said, if your intend is to migrate entirely to a new computer, you can also simply copy the Identity folder to the same location on the new Mac.

<p>As much as we would like to assist you with the issue about your tablet not detecting your SIM card, this is beyond our scope of support. You can still work on isolating the cause of the problem by inserting your SIM card in another device. If it works,
 then it's a device issue. You can contact the manufacturer of the tablet to get more help.<br />

    <title>Emails deleted at random - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzanned.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails deleted at random</h2>
                    <p>Good day all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recent ASUS laptop with Windows 8.1 and Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In April 2015, when looking for an email that was supposed to be in my deleted folder, I was unable to find it. It had totally disappeared. &nbsp;I then noticed that several of the emails that were supposed to be in the deleted folder had disappeared, inexplicably.
 They were random emails, disappearing at random times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep finding some to this day, once in a while. Some have also disappeared from a &nbsp;sub-folder that I created to put them in. The folder was empty when I went back to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first time today, the 10 or 12 emails that were in my inbox last night had totally disappeared this morning. All emails I had lost in the past were in the deleted folder, sent folder, or sub-folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I noticed that those same emails had also disappeared from my iPhone and from Videotron server where they were supposed to be stored. As if they were all synchronized to do the same actions at the same time. &nbsp;Only my Kindle keeps all emails
 (Thank God!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all questions/answers about disappearing emails that were posted in this community, but none seem to offer the solution that I need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Elsewhere, I read something about de-activating all add-ons in order to solve that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can offer an explanation and, possibly, a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Since it's IMAP, I believe you're seeing sync issues. If this were happening to me, I'd remove the account and re-add it. Care must be taken, however, if you have any folders with "This computer only" after their names. If they contain anything (like Contacts),
 you must save them to a local data file before deleting the account or you will lose the contents of those folders.</p>

<p>On affected sites, Compatibility View may be the culprit.</p>
<p>Compatibility View tells websites that you're running an earlier version of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Internet Explorer&gt; Tools (on the Menu Bar)&nbsp;(or Alt + t)&gt; Compatibility View Settings, verify that the site is not in the list, that "Use Microsoft compatibility lists" is unchecked and that "Display Intranet Sites in Compatibility View" is unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Compatibility View is not the cause of this message, websites are starting to drop support for IE11. The solution&nbsp;is to use Chrome, Firefox, Opera or another browser on these sites.</p>

<h2>            Windows mobile Media player &#40;10&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, i am new to the windows mobile software, but finding it a reasonable package after symbian 60. However...i am finding the media player (and subsequent third party ones) a bit of a pain. I like the windows version, but miss being able to add a file to
 a playlist from the now playing screen. Is there a plugin, or some software that does this 'out of the box' I have looked at playlist creators, but they are fiddly at best.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <span>What mobile device do you have?&nbsp; What OS version is on it?<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player on WM5.0 and earlier windows mobile OS devices do not provide a way to create playlists on the fly, but if you have a more recent windows mobile device that is running WM6 or WM6.1, there is an option that lets you save playlists on the
 fly.&nbsp; On a WM6 or WM6.1 device, queue up the songs you want to include on the playlist, go to the "Now Playing" window, check to make sure the songs are in the order you want, then tap Menu &gt; Save Playlist.<br />
<br />
If you have an older device, you can use 3rd party software to create playlists within Windows Media Player like
<a href="http://www.mskpocketsoftware.com/mplaylistmanager.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MPLayList Manager</a> or <a href="http://mobile-sg.com/software/?p=PlaylistMgr&amp;platform=ppc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PlayList Manager</a><br />
<br />
Of course, you can also use an alternative medial player on the device, such as <a href="http://picard.exceed.hu/tcpmp/test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TCPMP</a> or <a href="http://www.coreplayer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Set up catch all email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aakash shah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Set up catch all email address</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp; Does Outlook.com currently support, or will it ever support, the ability to set up a catch all email address, i.e. set it up so that everything sent to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is forwarded to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I currently use a catch all email address to
 help create a unique email address for each business that I work with.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I realize that not many people may have this type of setup, but this feature is very important for me and while I would like to switch to Outlook.com, I cannot with the catch all feature.<br />
<br />
A catch all email address helps me in a few ways:<br />
<ol>
<li>If an vendor starting spamming me, or if their database is hacked, I can easily isolate these emails (since they are sent to a unique email address), and filter them.<br />
</li><li>It helps add another layer of confirmation that the email that I have received is from the vendor since if they have not used the unique email address to email me, then the email is very likely a phishing mechanism.</li></ol>
Thanks!<br />

            Hello Ron!&nbsp; Thank you for replying!&nbsp; Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that I can only set up explicit aliases, i.e. I can only set up *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, etc.&nbsp; What I would to do is say *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, so that any email
 sent to any email address @mydomain.com arrives in my mailbox.&nbsp; Does the Outlook.com add alias feature currently support this?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to redirect all incoming emails&nbsp;to another email address when you receive them from a specific domain, making an alias could probably work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: If you made an alias which is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;there will be a prompt asking you if&nbsp;you want this alias to have a specific folder or all messages that it will receive will&nbsp;go&nbsp;directly to your main&nbsp;inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When&nbsp;you&nbsp;register or&nbsp;you subscribe&nbsp;to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;using your alias, all messages that
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;will receive&nbsp;is going to be&nbsp;redirected to (specific folder or&nbsp;main inbox)&nbsp;depending on how you set up your alias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to return t

            Hi Ice!
<br />
<br />As you know, this is a firewall fortgate blocking issue. The only way to allow Skype to open is by giving the program/computer access via the fortgate software.

I've tried too many ways to configure the skype in fortigate, and the only way is opening the firewall for all, so then, it can make the conection to the server of skype, so I've concluded that there's some kind of port/IP/dns/url&nbsp; that I can unblock using
 the fortigate application.

                    <p>Win 10 Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The All Apps list has a bunch of apps that I've never heard of and don't use. Clicking on some of them results in a message that the app cannot be opened. Right clicking some of them offer to uninstall but that doesn't seem to do anything. Others don't give
 an uninstall option.</p>

            <p>I have found a way to get them to not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to remove the ModernUI shortcuts from the All Apps section of your Start Menu you can</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>STEP 1:&nbsp; Remove any unwanted shortcuts by removing folders located in this folder:</p>
<p>"C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Application Shortcuts\"</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp; The folder names are cryptic but easy to figure out.&nbsp; Rather than remove them you can build a backup folder and move them there so if you want them in the future you have them. See Caution below.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>STEP 2: Followed by removing shortcuts in:</p>
<p>"C:\Programdata\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>STEP 3: And finally there's some remaining in:</p>
<p>"C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\System Tools"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once all ModernUI shortcuts have been removed there will be no trace of ModernUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>CAUTION: These shortcuts should be backed up, especially ones like MS Store in the event you need them. There is no restore option for this.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>IF YOU ONLY WANT TO REMOVE ModernUI SHORTCUTS THAT HAVE (install) IN THE APPS LIST, YOU ONLY NEED TO REMOVE THE FOLDER IN STEP 1.</p>
<p>

ZIp files are compressed and need to be "expanded" before you can do anything with them.&nbsp; Win 8 has a built in app to de-compress them,&nbsp; in other OS you need an application like winzip, or winrar.<br />

    <title>outlook 2010 not saving appointments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fitzybaby04  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2010 not saving appointments</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div>I'm using Outlook on Microsoft Office 2010 (Exchange). When I save a single appointment, there is absolutely no problem at all. Everything saves to the time and date I want as well as saving the title of the appointment and location and the body of the
 appointment. The problem with it is when I try a reoccuring appointment. When I save a reoccuring appointment, I get nothing at all indicating that it failed to save. The only thing is that the appointment doesn't show up on my calendar. When I save a single
 appointment, it works but when I edit it to a reoccuring appointment, the appointment completely disappears off my calendar. No matter what reoccurance options I try, nothing saves. The only success in saving an apointment is when it is on a single day at
 a single time.</div>

<h2>            How to keep non-internet computer files from showing in Internet Explorer 8 history. </h2>
                    
<p>Documents such as Word Documents, Pictures, and Excel Documents show up in a folder called "Computer" in my Internet History folder. These are not Web Documents. These reside on my hard drive, however, if I access any of them, they are added to my Internet
 Explorer Browsing History. Unlike internet browsing, their is no safety feature to make your recently accessed computer files from appearing in your history like InPrivate Browsing. This is extremely frustrating considering that I write for a living and I
 share this computer with my 9 year old son and 13 year old daughter. If they were to stumble upon one of these files in the Internet history, access it, and change it unknowingly, I could find myself in trouble.</p>
<p>I have looked at another thread in this forum, the advice was useless to the other user with this similar issue and it was useless to me. It seems there should be some easy way to keep my Documents off of Internet Explorer, I would be pleased if someone
 pointed it out to me.</p>

Then make sure that they have seperate Windows Users and that they are NOT administrators (and neither are you) and that&nbsp;<strong>YOUR</strong> user account has a strong&nbsp;password.</p>
<p>Then they won't be able to see anything in your User.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype update on Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a Nokia Lumia user. I would like to know whether the upcoming features in Skype on WP8 such as treating Skype call as a real call wil be provided to the existing Lumia users as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Microsoft has ditched so hard just by giving us a hardware excuse, I strongly believe that features that are not related to hardware should be given to us. Moreover, Skype is an app launched by MS, so we must have that as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Hi Todd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be due to the message sending limits of your Email account. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the email message that you're trying to send contain attachments.</li><li>The number of recipients posted on the email message. </li><li>The last activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we'd like to request for a screenshot of your concern with Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>Nope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the problem I have to cut and paste the body of the email... put it into a new email-- then resend it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as it doesn't go to drafts -- it sends fine. Only once it's saved into drafts does it get stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to keep it from automatically saving to drafts??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to make a video for your so you can see it happen across various browsers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROB #2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speaking of which -- please try this for yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Save an email into drafts. Now try and EDIT it further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how this is possible. Save to Drafts is a hugely buggy problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL of this is outlook.com. Web based.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We've tried to replicate your concern by going through the details that you've posted under PROB #2, we're able to edit the messages that were saved in Drafts and was able to send it without issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better isolate your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operating system that you're using on your device. If you're using Windows, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li><li>If you've already tried checking with another device.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend opening a new window when composing a new message. This will prevent the messages from being saved in Drafts automatically. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Outlook.com, click on New.</li><li>Click on the Edit in a separate window button.</li></ol>
