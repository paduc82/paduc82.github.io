<h2>            Hasbro Family Fun Pack&#58; Scrabble crashes &#126;10 seconds into it. Help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried reinstalling it, resetting Xbox, resetting internet. I can't get it to work. Right now I am reinstalling the entire bundle to see if that helps, but I've tried everything else. If you leave the game at the main menu it'll work, but once you hit
 "a" and it automatically links your Ubisoft account, it just freezes for a while, and hard resets the game. I've never had this problem, just wanna know if anyone else has had this particular problem. If so, what did you do to fix it?</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 loses display calibration upon rotation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 loses display calibration upon rotation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>having upgraded my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10 I noticed a severe bug. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the display is calibrated and a profile is stored the device loses the calibration once the device is rotated either from landscape to portrait or vice versa.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some facts: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is no difference if you let Windows load the LUT or the 3rd party tool does it #</li><li>There is no differnce if you store the profile on system level or user level </li><li>There is no difference if the profile is created by the windows internal color calibration tool or via a 3rd party tool
</li><li>When the device loses the calibration, you can get it back by sending the device to sleep (power button) and wake it up again (of course on next rotation change, the calibration is lost again
</li></ul>
<p>This is quite annoying as I have got a terrible Surface Pro 3 with a significant greenish tint and therefore I need to rely on the calibration and cannot switch off/on every time I rotate the device during picture editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the latest device drivers, firmware etc. Everything else seems to run smoothly, except this bug.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known bug with hope for remedy ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Philipp </p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>touchscreen calibration did not help - tried that before. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers used are the latest ones that were installed automatically: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Graphics Drivers:&nbsp;<strong>10.18.15.4248</strong> dated <strong>29/06/2015</strong></li><li>Surface embedded Controller Firmware: <strong>38.07.50.0 </strong>dated <strong>
18.09.2014</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>Surface Pro Touch Controller Firmware: <strong>426.27.66.0</strong> dated <strong>
15.05.2014</strong></li></ul>
<p>There is a video of this behaviour that can be found under:&nbsp;https://youtu.be/NaZEIqtXuqw&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This video was taken under following conditions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My Surface Pro 3 (who has a strong greenish tint on the screen)&nbsp;</li><li>Used the manual eye-sight calibration and cranked up the tint to be a strong purple, so one can spot the difference easily if the profile is loaded correctly&nbsp;</li><li>If auto rotate is on and the surface is rotated - the profile is lost immediately when rotatet and it won't reload until you send the device to sleep and wake it up again - then the profile is again loaded until it's rotated for the next time</li><li>If you have disabled auto-rotation and you are setting the orientation of the screen manually, the profile unloads, but it reloads immediately when the screen has rotated. So this works perfectly&nbsp;</li><li>This behaviour can be seen with the built in "eye-sight" calibration method, as well as with profiles created with i1Display or Spyder 4 Elite. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>This behaviour was there when I upgraded directly from 8.1 to Win10, but I cannot say if it was there with Windows 8.1 -&gt; as I waited with the purchase until Win10 was out and immediately upgraded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also confirm, that it is there with a clean install, which I had to do as after upgrade (like for many others) the live tiles were not working correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I can say, that we tried on another Surface (with the same issue) the latest drivers (HD 4400) from the Intel Page, which are dated 10/08/2015, but with the same result - the profile is not loaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am therefore not sure any longer if it's a graphic driver bug or maybe some glitch in the operating system ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking in, and pls. let me know if you need additional information. Also video is not perfect, and I can redo if necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx, Philipp&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Update:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've received today (<strong>17/08/2015</strong>) an System Firmware Update via Windows Update which was dated
<strong>23/07/2015</strong>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Graphics Drivers: <strong>unchanged&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Surface embedded Controller Firmware: <strong>unchanged&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Surface Pro Touch Controller Firmware: <strong>unchanged<br />
<br />
</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>But the update broke the setting "rotation lock" which cannot be selected right now.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I can only turn the screen now manually via the settings and not automatically when rotation the device. For me not a dealbreaker, but it is strange, that this setting is now locked out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is indeed a dealbreaker with the latest update is, that the color profile is not interpreted correctly when the surface is going to suspend !! It loses contrast and shows wrong colors ! When the Surface is going to sleep and it's woken up -
 the colors are OFF ! You have send it manually into suspend once again and wake up - then everything is fine !!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on here ? This is getting worse and worse :-(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a quick feedback !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>br, Philipp&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. as you can see below: rotation lock settings are greyed out since this update today .... (sorry - german Windows Version, but I think you can get the point)

            <p>Update (19/08/2015):&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>After couple of reboots, the broken screen rotation became available again. (usually, when the keyboard is attached, this is greyed out as it was for mine after the update also when the keyboard was not attached).<br />
</li><li>Today, display driver update came in (<strong>10.18.15.4256</strong> / <strong>
dated 17/07./2015</strong>)<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Did not change anything</strong> - <strong>LUT is still not loaded correctly when the surface rotates the screen automatically !<br />
</strong></li><li><strong>ALSO: since the firmware Update from couple days ago - the LUT is still not loaded correctly sometimes when the surface is woken up from standby .. (color saturation is off and contrast is basically not existing) - this was not there before the
 firmware update&nbsp;</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Can you please urgently look into this ? For me (and everyone else who is using the tool as a creativity tool) this is really a dealbreaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks !&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Same issue here&nbsp;with all latest drivers and patches on Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10. Don't know whether there is such issue back in Windows 8.1 as I just calibrated my SP3 for the first time today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one that heavily relies on the accuracy of screen color, this is a big trouble. I temporarily disabled the screen rotation to maintain the calibrated effect... Hope this can be solved ASAP.</p>

            Me too. And to tell the truth my Surface Pro 3 seems to be a little slower (boot, login, and Photoshop launch) after upgrading to Windows 10. I'm seriously considering getting back to Windows 8.1 now.

            It likely is corrupt. I experienced this issue with a cheap 16 GB thumbdrive I had. I just had throw it away and purchase a new one. Avoid the cheap brands. I had bad experience with Maxell.

            <p>Tried that ,too.&nbsp; Didn't work.&nbsp; I gave up on Windows 10 and went back to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Too many aggrevations and quirts on Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional is much easier and more reliable to use.&nbsp; The problem with the jump drives exists only on the
 Toshiba 64 gig&nbsp;jump drives&nbsp;formatted exFAT.&nbsp; All the other jump drives are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>not</strong></span> formatted exFat and work fine.&nbsp; I think going to Windows 10 has caused a major problem with the jump drives and messed them up somehow.&nbsp; I'm not going back to Windows 10.&nbsp; It also affected my backup drive, which is a 2tb Western
 Digital and corrupted files there.&nbsp; These drives have always worked fine, until I tried Windows 10.&nbsp; I think the program has not been perfected enough to release it to the public and Microsoft should be ashamed to release it at that point.&nbsp; I'd rather pay
 for something than have a mess like this.&nbsp; Years of work on genealogical work and five books that I have worked on for years.&nbsp; I thought backing them up would be sufficient, but apparently not.&nbsp; Windows XP and Windows 7 were great, but as far as I am concerned,
 Windows 10 is the worst operating system Microsoft has put out since Vista.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Jackpot &#40;Game in the Windows Store&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim everett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Jackpot &#40;Game in the Windows Store&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For several weeks I have fought with trying to find out who supports the game "Microsoft Jackpot" in the windows store. From billing support, Surface Support, Xbox support, Window's Store support&nbsp;and Windows App Support. No one could find who supported or
 who had control of the app game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the issue I had was with coins not being credited to the account or scores not being synced with Xbox. Also from time to&nbsp;time I would get crashes and told there was an Internet connection issue with sync among other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE FIX:</p>
<p>I added Microsoft "Gold Membership" to my Xbox account and poof all the sync, crashes, coin counts and purchase of coins and the being added to my system were all fix.
</p>
<p>Now no were on the app page does it say you need a Microsoft Gold Membership for the game to install, run or even work correctly. But something a tech said to me as he was transferring the call I had with him. Sparked the thought.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me this fixed the issue on my two systems and I passed it on to a few others who now are problem free. Only took over 6 hours of transfers and the phrase of "What game?" from Microsoft staff, still never got my credit for coins I paid for.&nbsp;</p>

            Didn't work for me. &nbsp;I have an xbox live gold account and have had it for 11 years. &nbsp;I cannot even sign into MSFT Jackpot. &nbsp;So i've lost all my coins, bonus and achievement abilities. &nbsp;This is the ONLY game that cannot sign in. &nbsp;I have sent a tweet to
 Microsoft Studios but have not heard back. &nbsp;And why would they require a $60.00 Gold account to pay a free game? &nbsp;

            The simple fact of the matter is that Microsoft doesn't give a damn. I've just gone through an instance where the coin total of over 3.4 million reset itself to the 2500 base default. Tech said they had no authority or ability to do anything...essentially
 refused to take action or refer matter to anyone who would or could. And they wonder why their reputation is so poor.

<p>the fact is we as players are being ripped&nbsp; off&nbsp; by&nbsp; Microsoft ,,,they expect us to put money in to play&nbsp; their games ,,but no&nbsp; coins arrive&nbsp; instead the moneys are taken&nbsp; why..??? without&nbsp; coins how do Microsoft&nbsp; expect us to play????&nbsp; the amount u win&nbsp;
 on these games are ludicriissly&nbsp; low &nbsp;....looks like&nbsp; will have to give these games the boot&nbsp; as they are now owing &nbsp;me over&nbsp; $100.00 n z d</p>

            Hi Vastery.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Pentium 4 is a little old.  See these reports by those who tried:
<br /><a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-I-install-Windows-10-in-Intel-Pentium-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.quora.com/Can-I-install-Windows-10-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.aacomputersandtechnology.com/how-well-will-windows-10-run-on-a-pentium-4-processor-if-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.aacomputersandtechnology.com/how-we...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to try it without losing what you've got, then what I'd do is create the bootable media, shrink your present install in Disk management, boot the media to do the Clean Install I will give you which should create a Dual Boot menu so you can try out Windows 10, move your stuff over if you want and then buy a license.  It might even activate if you have Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 on the PC now or with one of those keys as some are reporting still.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Tip:  If the Task manager shows RAM used much  higher than CPU, you can run Crucial System Scanner to consider upgrading your RAM some.  But a lot will depend on how old that Pentium 4 is.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi VasteryMaster
<br />
<br />Your graphics is supported on earlier versions of Windows 10, but not the last 3 versions (1809, 1803)
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager, expand the Processors section, is there any more information on that Pentium 4 processor, like a number?

            Hi,
<br />First, you need to check whether your hardware have drivers for Windows 10. AFAIR your Pentium should be compatible with Windows 10.
<br />But I do not recommend to spend money for license for such old PC.

<p>We have a P4 3GHz 2GB in our test lab as the lowest spec machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GeForce 210 will not work. We had to upgrade it to a 400 series card back in March. We have deliberately chosen a low spec card, so you should be aware that it is only a matter of time before this one will become unsupported.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you factor in the cost of a retail copy of Windows 10, it's not sensible to update your machine.</p>

<h3> idrivefast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Core2Duo to Quad core only shows 2 cores in task manager</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Vista64 Ultimate from an E8600 CPU to a Q9550 CPU.<br />
<br />
In the task manager, it only shows 2 cores.<br />
<br />
Device Manager shows all 4 CPU's.<br />
Bios shows all 4 CPU's.<br />
My Computer Properties shows Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9550 @ 2.83 GHz 2.83 Ghz<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to correct this?<br />
<br />
Reinstalling the OS is not an answer it's an excuse for not solving the issue.<br />

</span>Hi IDriveFast,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the device manage shows all the four CPU’S</span></p>
<p><span>You can the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On task manager click on the Performance tab later click on the view,click on CPU history and then on
 one graph all CPU’s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the issue remains, I would recommend you run the
<strong>System File Checker</strong> to scan your system for corrupt system files. Windows will scan and replace any missing or corrupt system files.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Click <strong>Continue</strong> or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>In the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window type the following, and press
<strong>Enter</strong>:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>You should see the following on-screen messages:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><em><span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></em></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><em><span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em><span>Verification % complete.</span></em></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>…found no integrity violations</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>…<em>found corruption but repaired it</em></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>…<em>found corruption that it could not repair</em></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please reply with the completion message that you received.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All the best!</span></p>

<p>Hello Halima,<br />
<br />
I ran sfc.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6002]<br />
Copyright (c) 2006 Microsoft Corporation.&nbsp; All rights reserved.</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</p>
<p>Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.</p>
<p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
<br />
By making it just one graph for all cpu's, am I just hidding the fact that is not seeing all 4 processors?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h2>            Win Live Mail&#58; How can I see bcc addressees later on&#63; Used to see them in Properties in Mail</h2>
                    After an email is sent with bcc addressees and filed, in Mail I could see these addressees by going to the Properties - Details box. Live Mail doesn't show them.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What version of Windows Live Mail are you using? I suggest that you upgrade your Window Live Mail to the latest version so you can see the BCC&nbsp;recipients on the sent items. They are displayed on the address field if you have used them. This featrue is available
 for both <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail 2011 and 2012</a>. <span>In some cases you may need to uninstall
</span><span>Windows Live Mail</span><span> or Essentials before you are able to install the latest version(s). You may refer to this link:&nbsp;<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-uninstall-ui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall one or more Essentials
 Programs</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;for instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, it doesn't help. I can USE the bcc box when composing an email. The problem arises if I want to check a few days later to whom I had bcc'd that email. On the old&nbsp; Mail I could go to Properties and in the Details find
 all the names. Can't do this now, even though I downloaded Live Mail 2012 (I had the 2011 version earlier). &nbsp;

            Sorry, my fault. I didn't make clear in my last email that I was talking about emails that I had SENT, not those I received with bcc addressees.<br />
<br />
If I send an email with bcc addressees, sometimes I want to check later whether I had included a particular addressee. Currently, there seems to be no way to do that. With my old WMail, I could look up Details in the Properties of the old msg, and find all
 the bcc addressees listed there.<br />
<br />
It is not a big deal, but certainly a convenience I miss. It is a bit surprising that MS dropped this useful feature.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue while opening apps and getting error message "'please login with administrator privileges and try again". The issue could be if either you are not logged in as administrator or you don't have the admin permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would suggest you to enable default administrator and see if issue persists, in this account. If everything works fine in this default admin account then try to create new user profile with administrator permission and see if it helps you to fix the
 issue.</p>

            <p>I too am having the same problem. I have a game that I have played for years without trouble. After today's security updates I click on the icon and get an access denied message saying to login with administrator privileges. But I was already logged in as
 an admin. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I do all the standard fixes, I go to advanced settings and click "run as admin" and I go to properties and from there click "run as admin", I even right click the icon and select "run as admin" and the game now simply doesn't load at all. I ran spyware
 and virus checks adn nothing came up. I turned of UAC and still nothing. What happened today in the security updates that made my pc (running windows 7)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. In short i clicked my game, got access denied saying to login as admin. But I am an admin. All i've done is get rid of that message but the game still doesn't load.</p>

            <p>I too uninstalled the game and reinstalled and was right back to the access denied message. THere were 25 updates too. I have no idea which one caused the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a lap top recently and the guy at the store told me that soon all pc's will not even have a cdrom. I asked about games and he said "steam". awesome. Now they get a complete monopoly on the games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, that shouldn't mean that my currrent systems should be unable to play cdrom games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the compatibility check, the game still wouldn't work, so i selected the option to send microsoft the error report and then my pc tells me the problem is an "incompatible .exe". wat?!?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think they screwed up big on the last security&nbsp; updates and i hope it gets fixed. I don't want to use steam just to play a 8 year old game and I am not repurchasing it!. I hate steam.

            I managed to get the game running by going back to version before the latest update (return point?). After that I got an error message saying, it (the return) couldn't be done because there was some error in fx00000... or something like that. Anyway, everything's
 been working better now than what it was after the "update".

            Same here! In my case it's Far Cry (1). It's installed on my PC and requires the CD to be present to run. I played it last night but this morning after completing the latest Windows 7 updates I got the same message. I'm the only person on this PC and I'm
 the administrator. After reading these posts I went into Control Panel, View Installed Updates and uninstalled all the new updates listed under Microsoft Windows (about 10 or 12 or so), rebooted and now Far Cry is working! Hopefully the next update will have
 this issue fixed.

            ok. but i installed 25 updates. Not all of them security updates. If I only knew which one to uninstall. I am unsure exactly what security updates do. I feel it will difficult to simply ignore those and all future security updates. I am confused why this
 is even an issue though. I am hoping there is a fix soon.&nbsp; I called microsoft but there was a 2 hour wait.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If you used generic product key (VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T) to upgrade to Pro edition, you would need to activate upgraded edition with your genuine product key.
<br />

<h2>            How do I get my contact list to come up when I click on &#8220;To&#8230;&#8221;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Okay it should be real simple.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All I want to do is have my contact list come up when I click on “To…” <span>
&nbsp;</span>while I’m crating a new email.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have been using “Outlook” for contact and calendar management for many years.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I recently got a new computer and transferred all my files from a “Windows XP” formatted computer to the new computer with “Windows Vista.”
<span>&nbsp;</span>I also downloaded a trail version of “Office” that is described as “Microsoft Office Standard 2007 Trial.” I’m at a loss as to whether this is an issue with “Vista,” “Office” or the fact that it is a “Trial” version.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>I also downloaded a trail version of “Office” that is described as “Microsoft Office Standard 2007 Trial.” I’m at a loss as to whether this is an issue with “Vista,” “Office” or the fact that it is a “Trial” version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here’s my problem:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have three contact files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would like to make one of the three my default address book.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Per the instructions I “right click” on the contact list. I then click on the heading “Outlook Address Book.”
<span>&nbsp;</span>There I find a box next to a sentence that reads, “Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book” with a box next to it to be checked.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>There I find a box next to a sentence that reads, “Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book” with a box next to it to be checked.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately when I attempt to check this box it does not respond.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have run a “Microsoft Office Diagnostics” and everything came up as “No problem found.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>After extensive page after page web searching I find a page that tells me”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Personal Address Book</span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The Personal Address Book is no longer supported. This address book was replaced by Contacts in Microsoft Outlook 97. Personal Address Book entries are stored in a file that has a .pab extension. All of the contacts in the Personal Address Book are migrated
 to the default Outlook Contacts folder. You can choose to move these to a separate folder, or to cancel the migration and import the .pab file at a later time. The .pab file continues to exist in the file system, but the Personal Address Book is removed from
 Outlook. The .pab file does not support Unicode, and it cannot roam to multiple computers that you might use.</span></p>
<p><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>So as I started this message, all I want to do is have my contact list come up when I click on “To…”
<span>&nbsp;</span>while I’m crating a new email.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any suggestions?</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Startup Repair and Registry Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamsilverfox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Startup Repair and Registry Issues</h2>
                    <p>My latest Windows 10 startup repair situation: - critical system driver missing or contains errors file \windows\ 0xc000000d. It looks bad, it's a system issue because no other startup options work. StrTrail.txt log file reveals no issues, you do the usual
 BCD stuff and any other startup options - disabling early launch AV, driver signature, safe mode, disabling &nbsp;auto start on failure, etc. &nbsp;and they all go back to startup repair diagnosis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just at the point where you've had enough and decide that it's a re-install you remember a line from Windows XP - registry file is missing or corrupt, any one of the five registry hives..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sure enough in RegBack we have 5 very recent hives. Backup up the current ones, copy back the ones in from RegBack and the bastard computer boots and it's a huge sigh of relief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the questions arise:-</p>
<p>1) why can't the startup repair detect registry problems and indicate them..</p>
<p>2. What is the frequency of registry backup. if it is regular then why can't startup repair rely on restoring a backed up set of registry hives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the registry is an integral necessary part of any Windows you would think - or at least I would think - better write some code to take care of that situation. OK it may be there but if it was it wasn't very evident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to see a better Windows 10 Startup Repair system. I also want the ability to do a refresh similar to a repair re-install we could do in Windows XP. It's no fun dealing with this stuff. on a regular basis, it doesn't seem to get any better, it should
 be possible to refine this process of system failure and recovery a bit more.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t &#39;Run as Administrator&#39; even though I am the only Administrator.</h2>
                    <p>Good morning.</p>
<p>I recently 'sidegraded' to Windows 10 and I have had many problems. Fortunately, I fixed most of them by performing a reset of the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of that I naturally needed to reinstall all of my software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I am the only Administrator on my PC the UAC still stops me from installing certain software because 'An Administrator' is preventing me. I get the "This app has been blocked for your protection" message.<br />
<br />
This even happened if I run the .exe 'as administrator'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even checked that I am the only administrator account in the CMD prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;net localgroup administrators<br />
Alias name &nbsp; &nbsp; administrators<br />
Comment &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain<br />
<br />
Members<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Administrator<br />
Andrew<br />
The command completed successfully.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I activated the hidden 'inactive' 'elevated' administrator account I found that I could install whatever the heck I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is deeply frustrating to me that I cannot install software on my own bloody machine even though I have Administrator privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how I can 'elevate' my administrator account or fix this in some other way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tl:dr I have an Administrator account but UAC still stops me from installing things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Rajeshwari, thank you for the response.<br />
<br />
1. Yes I am logged in as Administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact according to 'User Accounts' my account is the only account on this PC.<br />
</p>
<p>Although under "Group or user names" it has 3 entries:<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Andrew V (with my email address)<br />
Administrators (AndrewVPC\Administrators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried sfc scannow and it ran correctly but it didn't find any errors.<br />
<br />
3. I followed your Method 2 and each step was concluded successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But sadly it hasn't solved the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot install certain software (I have verified that the software is legitimate and not a virus or other malware).</p>

<h2>            Xbox one intermittent snowy screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi, suddenly today, I've experienced the snowy static screen flashing on and off. This is the first time I've ever seen this after having the Xbox for over 3 years.&nbsp;</p><p>I did receive the latest software update earlier this week, and I suspect that may have something to do with it.&nbsp;</p><p>I am however aware that there was a previous software issue that caused this around 2014 / 2015, as they are the only similar issues I can find on this forum.&nbsp;</p><p>I have tried all the fixes suggested from that time, includ doing a hard reset, unplugging the power supply, clearing the disc caches etc.&nbsp;All the cables have been checked. There is nothing wrong, but as soon as I launch an app or game, the issue returns.&nbsp;</p><p>How can I fix this? It is so frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I got the same thing yesterday on xbox one x.&nbsp; Only way I find to fix it is to unplug the hdmi cable on the back of the unit and once I plug it back in its ok.&nbsp; I do believe its got something to do with the update.&nbsp; Seems to be happening to a lot of people.&nbsp; </p><p>From what I read none of the solutions people are doing seems to stop the issue. &nbsp;</p><p>Unplugging it is a quick fix but not a solution.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft fixes is soon.</p>

            I just got my xbox one x (Sept 30th 2018). After doing the initial updates once booted everything seemed fine that day. Now I'm getting the snowy screen that flashes on and off. The console will probably work for about an hour. I have to unplug HDMI and
 re-plug in order to get screen back. Why hasn't Microsoft responded to this post?????&nbsp;

<p>Hi, TerminusV</p>

<p>
</p><p>It looks like the videos you've watched in the video sharing website, YouTube, are using the classic version of Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Skype version (8.13) does not support third-party camera applications. The app mainly uses what's available on your device's settings and is most likely the reason why ManyCam is not detected by the client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use ManyCam with Skype, you can still download the classic version of Skype for Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>

            Streets and Trips 2011 is unfortunately not compatible with Windows 10. You will need to find an alternative or consider other options such as installing on a compatible version of Windows in a virtual machine software.
<br />
<br />You can try compatibility mode first:

            I already had a recovery disk that came with my computer, but when I put it in and clicked any key to make it load, it said 'windows is loading files' then goes back to "starting windows" and gets stuck there. It does that even when I put in the windows
 7 disc to try and re-install to see if that did anything. But alas, no.&nbsp;

            <p>In you other thread, Bill Smithers, one of the contributors shared a link to all the troubleshooting tips for dell computers experiencing this issue and frankly speaking your response to him was a bit perplexing. Did you try the steps in that link?</p>
