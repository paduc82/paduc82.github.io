<h2>            Office 365 Home and Exchange Online Plan 1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question that already appeared in some of the previous threads, but with conflicting answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Office 365 Home subscription that we share among several users. We also use a custom domain and custom emails, currently with IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to be able, while using our custom emails, to (1) be able to view our calendars across our devices and (2) share our calendars with each other, which cannot be done via IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Exchange Online is a product targeted at businesses, but we are still interested in using its functionalities as they seem to meet our needs of sharing calendars etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. The question is, if we buy Exchange Online Plan 1 subscriptions, can we use our custom email addresses (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** etc.) with the Outlook client that is part of our Office 365 Home subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does the subscription need to be bought through a different Microsoft account (professional rather than personal)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>

            &gt;&gt;
<br /> It is also my understanding that to have a custom domain we need to move our emails to GoDaddy, which I doesn't look optimal to me (more expensive than Exchange Online, plus I don't like the idea of having a third party selling me an Office 365 solution).
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />To use outlook.com custom domain, you need to have the domain dns at godaddy., which means they need to be the registrar But it can be with any registrar for the business accounts. 
<br />
<br />There are definite advantages to having business accounts - you have more control over spam filters and can  quarantine questionable messages for review. 
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Does it mean that the Microsoft account used for purchasing Exchange Online needs to have an Office 365 suite linked to it? Or can I just create a separate "empty" account for the sole purpose of buying Exchange Online and then set up our emails?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />No, you don't need an office suite, but it will be a new log in. When you click Buy in this link - <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exchange-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/exch...</a> - it will guide you through creating the "empty shell" and choose a tenant name - your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com - then add your domain and create the mailboxes.

            Hi Anastasia, 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />1. The question is, if we buy Exchange Online Plan 1 subscriptions, can we use our custom email addresses (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** etc.) with the Outlook client that is part of our Office 365 Home subscription?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yes. You can.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />2. Does the subscription need to be bought through a different Microsoft account (professional rather than personal)?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yes, you need an office 365 tenant. 
<br />
<br />
<br />How many mailboxes do you need?  Office 365 Home supports custom domains for up to 6 users.  You'll have a better sharing experience with the Exchange online plan but the custom domain in outlook.com may suffice. 
<br />
<br />With the business account, you can open and edit the shared calendars with the right permissions, from outlook desktop. You can share contacts. You can add multiple address to a mailbox, which is handy if people misspell your alias.

<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update Version 1703</h2>
                    Greetings. When Windows 10 offered the free upgrade, I installed it from my purchased Windows 7. After a couple of weeks, I was using my computer in Windows 10, when it suddenly reverted back to my original Windows 7. I don't know how or why this happened,
 but it really did this. I'm not a computer savvy person even after having my HP Desktop since July of 1012. I even contacted this forum for assistance and after trying to get help from at least two of the forum people, could never get Windows 10 to do what
 it was supposed to do. Mind you, this was still when the free upgrade was available. I had to go back to my Windows 7. A year ago, I downloaded Windows 10 Version 1703 again and it seemed fine for awhile. Then it began to BSOD, except it did it with a green
 screen and with no error code. It just said it ran into a problem and had to restart. I don't understand what my problems come from. I use only free versions of Malwarebytes, CCleaner and Superantispyware programs, and the regula

<p>I got the GSOD just like I did when I have ever got a BSOD. It completely filled the screen monitor and restarted my computer. I have never had a problem with CCleaner. And, I don't trust avast either. And, it did this two days ago around four or five times.
 That's when I got my Windows 7 Recovery Discs out and used them. Also, I don't know if any of the forum help on this site can look back at my passed problems, but if so, it shows the times I tried to get help here on the site.</p>

<p>There has never been an error message other than the Windows Green screen and telling me that an error occurred and windows has to restart. If there was an error message, I would have checked it thoroughly. There was none.</p>

    <title>surface pro 3 pen screen shot always opening new page - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            surface pro 3 pen screen shot always opening new page</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>i purchased a surface pro 3 two days ago and i'm having an issue with the double click feature (screenshot) of the pen. at first, when i double clicked, it took a screenshot but did not paste&nbsp;it anywhere. i had to click somewhere and click paste. This was
 great. I could continue on one page of one note and add screenshots continously.
</p>
<p>for some reason, this has changed. i suspect an update but now when i double click it asks me to choose where i want to capture. this is fine but it automatically pastes the section to a NEW page on one note. I have to copy and move that over to the original
 page then delete the new page. this is very inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way to change the setting so the newly captured screenshot does not get automatically pasted to a new page? it's great if it can be copied and i can choose where it gets pasted on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As neither of the OneNote versions that run on the Surface offer this feature yet, I would like to suggest that you check the Uservoice forum and submit your vote for this feature suggestion there. You can find the forum at http://onenote.uservoice.com&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you then post the URL of your request in a reply to this thread, other people who are looking up your report will be able to easily add their votes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, there are strong signs that launch is pending of a Surface Pro 3 pen control panel app. See this post http://bit.ly/surfacepro3-pen-controlpanel-surfaceproartist - I'm not sure though if the functionality you are seeking will be included in this
 app. The person to nudge about it directly would be Markus @Weickenmeier from the Surface team.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop not showing</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Ive downloaded and booted up now 3 times Windows 10 and it would appear to be a sucsesful download and boot up but all I am seeing is the "File explorer" window and nothing else . If I click on the X to close it I just get a black blank screen , I then do
 Ctrl,Alt,Del and go thro Task manager and it is showing no programs active . I then reboot and it gives me 2 options "Continue with boot up" or "Roll back option" , to my previous version of windows , Ive tried both and in normal bootup again just the File
 explorer window ,When i choose the roll back option &nbsp;it &nbsp;takes me back to my Windows 7 version . So the question is</p>
<p>"Why do I only get the File explorer window and nothing else"</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>Windows 10 App language and keyboard layout. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> varasith prichavudhi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 App language and keyboard layout.</h2>
                    <p>I want to know how to set Store, Calculator, Weather, Etc. to English without add English keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I need this setting is because when I'm using Windows 7, I'm using 2 keyboard layout but 3 input language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Korean keyboard layout (which can type both Korean and English).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Thai keyboard layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem when I'm using Windows 10 and I'm setting just 2 keyboard layout (Korean and Thai), I have to set Korean language as default, then the Windows App will display as Korean language which I prefer English but I can't because I don't have English
 in Language Preference setting.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi, my Display Language is Override to English already, but in Language Preference, Korean still be my Default because I don't want English keyboard there, and when that happen, some App will change to Korean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see attached picture in this link&nbsp;http://imgur.com/a/NNSJH</p>
<p>
</p><p>First pic is when I setting English to be Default, which the Apps on Start panel display as English, which is OK for me, but I can't do this because I want to remove English later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second pic is when I setting Korean to be Default, which some Apps on Start panel display as Korean, also you can see on the right panel that English is still Override.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarify you more and thank you for your reply.</p>

<h3> codadiluna---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N78 wants to connect to the Internet for Bluetooth data</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody!<br />
I'm synchronizing&nbsp; my N78 phone with my PC using PC Suite (version 7.1.30.9). I already updated the&nbsp;PC Suite support on my phone successfully.</p>
<p>I can connect my phone to my PC and synchronize with Outlook via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>However the connection sometimes gets stuck and PC Suite doesn't connect to the phone anymore.</p>
<p>And, above all, my phone tries to connect to the Internet several times a day (the screen for AP selection is displayed). I think it tries to connect to the Internet to exchange bluetooth data, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Why does it behave this way? What settings shall I change in order to stop the phone from trying to connect to the Internet?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Excel save errors &#34;object reference not set to an instance of an object&#34; &#38; &#34;object passed must be a Word.Document object&#34; etc</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>I have an encrypted Excel file saved onto a USB&nbsp;that I use at work and at home and have no problems at home but when I open it at work it often opens it in protected view, then when I save it, it has started to&nbsp;give me one of&nbsp;two errors "object reference
 not set to an instance of an object"&nbsp;or "object passed must be a Word.Document object" and won't save the&nbsp;document. I then have to get&nbsp;the file off a backup. How do I get rid of these errors? How do I find whatever the object is that is in this document that
 is causing these errors? The file has a couple of screen shots in it but nothing that I know of that is different from other files I have that don't give me these errors.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 and Office Home and Student 2013 at home but 8.1 and Office 365 ProPlus at work, although this shouldn't make a difference.
</p>
<p>The file is a Excel 97-2003 worksheet .xls and I've tried to save it as a workbook to see if that solves the problem, but it won't let me as it says "the following features can't be saved in&nbsp;a macro-free workbook: VB project". I have tried to find out what
 that is but can't. If I try to continue saving or try and save as&nbsp;a macro-enabled workbook, it then says I have to first remove Excel 4.0 and 5.0 macros&nbsp;to be able to keep the password. I also tried to find out what those macros are to be able to remove them
 and can't. The file just has total formulas that I know of.</p>
<p>Please help! Thanks Donna </p>

<div>Hi Donna,</div>
<div><br />
<div>If only this file has this issues, we suggest you open it in protect view and copy the content into a new blank workbook created in Office 365, then save the new workbook instead.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>.xls is an old format from Excel 97-2003, it might cause some issues when processing it in the newer version of Excel. If you would like to use the original workbook, you could try converting it to .xlsx first:&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15e2dbb7-f915-43de-94e6-c5198c908238?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15e2dbb7-f915-43de-94e6-c5198c908238?upload=true" /></a><br />
<div>About the macros in the excel file, if you think you could use the workbook without them, you could just save it as .xlsx although it will pop up an error to remind you that the macros will not be kept in the workbook.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you still cannot save the workbook, could you share us a copy of it for further troubleshooting? To protect your privacy, please send it via private message:

<div><br />
<div>There are macros in the workbook. The macros created in 2004. I think that the reason for those errors. Excel 2007 doesn't permit macros in protected workbooks. I have saved it as .xlsm and .xlsx file. You could test them both and reply if they still have
 issues.</div>

            There isn't and won't be a way to sync your phone to Skydrive.&nbsp; If your contacts have been migrated to SkyDrive as part of the My Phone shutdown, you can download the Contacts file to your computer.&nbsp; Then you can import the file into Outlook on your computer
 and sync the data to your phone OR you can import the file into Windows Live Contacts and sync the phone to your Windows Live account OR you can import the file into Google and sync the phone to your Google Contacts.<br />
<br />
If you've figured out how you plan to sync your contacts in the future, let me know and I'll post more specific information about how you can do this.<br />

<h3> blue pencil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sway headings</h2>
                    Hi, I've created a Sway by importing an existing document (a PDF).&nbsp; The PDF had level 1 headings (primary headings) and level 2 headings (a secondary heading subordinate to a primary heading).&nbsp; Sway imported the headings correctly with different styles
 and labeled them as such (heading 1 or heading 2).&nbsp; However, when I start a new Sway from scratch, I cannot find a way to create a level 2 heading.&nbsp; Is there a secret key combination or a way to copy and paste the level 2 heading from one Sway to another?&nbsp;
 Thank you

                    <p>Hi Office 2016 support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the current Preview version 16.0.4027.1008 of MS Word 2016.</p>
<p>I am using Word in COM automation in a Windows service.</p>
<p>This worked OK in the last years without issues with any Word version up to now.</p>
<p>I see this error when opening a document:</p>
<p>Unknown error 0x800A13F8 (HRESULT Code:5112)</p>
<p>Could you please help / fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and&nbsp;best regards,</p>

            <p>This forum looked to me if it dealt with Office 2016 Preview Programming issues.</p>
<p>So I reported this bug. Since it looks like&nbsp;a bug to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It used to work perfectly since Word 97. Also COM automation in Word 2016 works OK, but not in service mode, what is essential for my application, so I wanted to report this as a bug as early as possible.</p>
<p>But I will do like you suggested and report it using the frown button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delayed response. From what I understand you're getting the error "You don't have appropriate permission to perform this operation" when deleting emails from Outlook in your Windows 8 computer. We would like to ask a few questions to
 better understand the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What "Outlook" are you pertaining to that you're using when you encountered this issue? Is it the Outlook mail app, the Office Outlook mail client or the Outlook.com web-based email?</li><li>Do you encounter the same error when deleting emails via Outlook.com on a web browser?</li><li>Do you remember any instances that might have caused the issue?</li></ul>
<p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Office 2016 Won&#39;t Activate, Full of Bugs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwolz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 Won&#39;t Activate, Full of Bugs</h2>
                    <p>I updated because El Captain was crashing my old office install. I am a BizSpark member and got the program with MSDN subscription. I have taken all of the steps to get it setup and installed. I can login to office on the 365 website and it shows my license,
 I can open the programs (word) and it shows me logged into that also. But the program absolutely refuses to activate. I was traveling so I chalked it up as non-us internet, or banned activation from Thailand/Vietnam. I also want to mentioned that I am aware
 of the other topics and I have tried everything that Microsoft recommended on this page&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-to-try-if-you-can-t-install-or-activate-Office-2016-for-Mac-using-Office-365-Home-Personal-or-University-5efba2b4-b1e6-4e5f-bf3c-6ab945d03dea?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now have finally hit my 15 days of trial and have been locked out of all of my work emails. I am in Taiwan now and activation still does not work at all, so i guess it wasn't my location. I have tried everything except deleting the program and reinstalling.
 I do not want to reinstall if possible since I do not want to lose my emails, accounts, rules, and folders I have set up. In the past this has taken me hours to redo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yeah I mentioned bugs right? How about these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program gives me an error when activating and then tells me that I can activate by phone. Thank god! Lets see that window below.</p>
<p>.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6308bb19-cf78-426d-a91d-3322198f47b2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait whats that? The last 3 digits are cutoff from their window, and I have no way to resize copy edit or other wise look at them in any possible way. Could Microsoft have been really so&nbsp;to have their own activation window smaller than the actual activation
 code? Seems so. Thanks for that. I have called the number and confirmed that this last set of numbers should be longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about if instead of Phone Activation I just click the Activate Later button instead. I had hoped it would give me other 15 days but that was wishful thinking. Lets look at the Activation Window after we press that button!</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5acebe76-c8bc-4935-9606-ddb9c9625c5b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow look at that! What a helpful window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded my copy directly from MSDN. Do you have some sort of beta version on there or something? If I uninstall like you recommend is there any way to make sure my accounts (30 Pop accounts) old emails, rules, and folders stay in place?</p>

            <p>So I decided I had to have a working email today and tried to uninstall just as they asked on the instructions page. Deleted all the stuff, restarted, re-installed with the Office Website Installer this time instead of MSDN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install the program, open it up to activate, and now it says No License Found with my account or that I don't have a account at all. Amazing a totally new problem from trying to fix the old one. Also now I have totally screwed myself by deleting all of
 the office files. So all of my accounts, folders, rules, and other settings were deleted. I made a back up of my mail so at least I didn't lose that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why you released this to the public when it wasn't ready. You have wasted hours and hours of my time for nothing.</p>

            <p>Hi GWolz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sorry to hear that you are running into issues with activation of the Office Suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you answer a few questions so that we can better understand why you have to do phone activation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When you trying to activate, are you disconnected from the internet?</p>
<p>2. Can you try changing the region from Taiwan to something else, say US/UK/CN to see if there is some kind of geo lock.</p>
<p>3. Can you go to your Microsoft account settings (<a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx)&nbsp;and send us your unique ID.</span></a></p>
<p>4. Lastly, can you send us the log file from the below location - </p>
<div>

<p>
</p><p>Just spent 45 minutes or so on the&nbsp; phone to Microsoft. Apparently this is an issue that they're seeing a lot at the moment. I was recommended to create a new user account on my machine and install Office using that account. Office installed and activated
 without problems with the new account and is still activated when I log back on as my normal user account.</p>

            <p>Hi Sumesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Yeah of course I was connected to the internet. But i guess you have to ask.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;I tried using my VPN and connecting to several different regions thinking there might have been some sort of local firewall. Same errors in all locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) How would you like this sent?</p>
<p>4) Same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in Singapore for business and the program gave me the same error about needing to call the phone number. But the damn activation key is still longer than the window so I can't do that.</p>

            Interesting solution, not sure I want to add an extra account though. I would rather them fix the problem. I have given up on Office 2016 and just went back to my 2011 install. I just don't have time to not have a working email for days on end.&nbsp;

            I understand where you're coming from. I created the new account, logged in and installed Office and activated it and then logged out again. Once I knew Office was working I deleted the account. Total time - around ten minutes. Far less than the amount
 of time I spent un-installing and reinstalling before trying this.<br />

<p>If this is a new computer, was Windows 10 installed and part of the purchase.</p>
<p>If this is a self build, did you purchase a licence or transfer an existing retail version of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To activate insider builds, the computer needs to be already activated by either of the above.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Professional 2003 disc not working but have product code</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>The hard drive on my computer (Window Vista) has been recently wiped clean and now I want to re-install Microsoft Office Professional 2003. I have the product key but when I go to install Office using the disc I get an error message saying "This program
 has been damaged, possibly by a bad sector of the hard drive or a virus. Please reinstall it." It seems the disc is damaged, so I am wondering is this version of Office still available for download? I do have the product key I just need to be able to install
 the program. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<li>What Skype version are you on? Please specify the <strong>exact </strong>version, not latest or recent.
</li><li>What operating system is running on your device? </li><li>Is this happening to all your contacts? If not, approximately how many are affected by the issue?
</li><li>What happened when you use both the built-in and external microphones? Does it work with Echo Test but not when on a Skype-to-Skype call or a conference call?
</li></ul>

            That appears to have solved the problem with external mic's, made a test skype to skype call and it worked fine.&nbsp; I still am&nbsp; not able to be heard when using to internal mic though is still works for the echo test just not skype to skype.&nbsp; The internal
 mic seem to be getting muted but the mic icon does not show it as muted. <br />

<p>Things seem to be getting worse.&nbsp; Before I saw this post I had a group call I needed to make.&nbsp; The internal mic still did not work, but the external mic seemed to work fine. However after about 15 min it also stopped working.&nbsp; Note I have a second laptop
 and was able to complete my call on that computer using the same external mic. Today, I completely removed Skype from my laptop again then downloaded the newest version (8.10.0.9).&nbsp; The internal mic is non-functional even on the echo test.&nbsp; It took 3 restarts
 but the external mic finally worked on the echo test.&nbsp; I have not had a chance to test on a Skype to Skype call.</p>

            I have now uninstalled and reinstalled Skype 3 times.&nbsp; Problem persists.&nbsp; I have found that if I open the audio mixer and select recording, then select the mic I am using go to properties/level and manually unmute and set a sound level I can then be heard
 but sound on other end is very weak and I get a lot of feedback.&nbsp; Usable but far from what it should be.

<h2>            Outlook App for Android - Widget</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Outlook App for Android on a new phone. &nbsp; When I install the Outlook Calendar Widget, I am seeing 2 different calendars on the Widget (the Office 365 and Gmail calendar). &nbsp; I only turned on the Office 365 Calendar when configuring the
 widget. &nbsp; I have tried to configure this multiple time and each time I get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my Calendar in the full Outlook App for Android, I am only seeing my Office 365 calendar ... that appears to be configured properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else having this problem? &nbsp; Any thoughts on how to solve it.?</p>
