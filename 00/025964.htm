<p>index# is a standard ETSI/3GPP command which fetches the corresponding index on your SIM phone book. Therefore, if you edit your SIM with a SIM reader, you are able to select which phone number shall come up.&nbsp;When it comes to the name display … that is an
 interesting feature request for platform like Series 30+ because the development of Series 40 ceased last year.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Hangs at &#39;Processing&#39; -- I&#39;veTried all the obvious stuff&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2016 has been working fine since I loaded it a couple of weeks back; upgraded from 2015</p>
<p>I did have to disable the add-ins per the published suggestion, after a hang but has been fine since, &nbsp;for several weeks.</p>
<p>Yesterday when I launched Outlook it hung at 'Processing'</p>
<p>Trying safe mode told me that the PST file is corrupt, but failed to repair it when I clicked repair</p>
<p>I used the MS inbox repair tool which completed &nbsp;fine after around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Same problem when I launched Outlook (both in safe mode and regular mode)</p>
<p>I went to previous day's backup PST -- Same Problem -- now I'm worried!</p>
<p>I deleted OFFICE 2016 and my Mail Profile and reloaded both -- Same Problem -- Now I'm really worried</p>
<p>I have MS Security and MalwareBytes -- no security issues reported after scan.</p>
<p>All MS products are up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I took the failed PST (after inbox repair) and loaded Office in a new profile on my home theatre machine that had never run Office before and has very little software loaded on it &nbsp;(both machines concerned running Win-7).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>My Outlook worked fine immediately on the home theatre machine with my PST file from the first.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What services or other prerequisites for Outlook may have become corrupt on my regular machine?</p>
<p>Or what else can anyone suggest, other than a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I'm running Outlook on my HT Machine and everything else on my regular machine.</p>
<p>All advice welcome and I'm prepared to 'experiment' on my regular machine knowing a clean install is the ultimate &nbsp;fix.</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>Dear Palcouk,</p>
<p>thanks for your prompt response. Per your numbering......</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) 2) and 3) There are no indications of any hardware problems on the machine in question. All other programmes on same machine run without issue; no crashes, hangs &nbsp;or other funnies. But just to be sure I ran ALL the relevant Dell "SupportAsssist"diagnostics
 and they all passed. So I don't suspect a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I have no optimisers installed</p>
<p>6) PST is on hard drive, it has not moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Note: Outlook was running fine and now, suddenly exhibits a hard fault. It NEVER now launches correctly and always hangs at "processing" on this machine only. PST File works fine on a "fresh" machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your suggestions, That leaves us with 4)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not installed any specific "add ins" and am unsure where to look for them? Please advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, (and I suspect this), is it possible that some other core requirement for Outlook to run correctly has become corrupt? I'm unsure if Outlook uses .Net framework or some other bit &nbsp;of Windows software infrastructure that could have become corrupt
 with a regular MS update; please advise? The reason I'm suggesting this is because this was a sudden failure and is a hard and completely repeatable problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Sandtonman.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi There, actually no; but I did find out some very interesting information which further narrows down the problem, per below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already stated, I loaded Office 365, as a new user on my Home&nbsp;Theatre machine, which&nbsp;is a Core i7 PC with very little installed on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the most recent non-corrupt PST file and started Outlook. It worked perfectly! and I had no corruption issues
 in South Africa, &nbsp;in the days before Christmas running on the new machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We came to our place in the UK on Boxing day and (as always) I brought the PST file with me and loaded it on my UK machine, after upgrading&nbsp;the machine to Office 2016 and taking forever to load 4 months of MS updates.&nbsp;It has now been working here for 3 weeks;
 again no issues. But I did experiment by archiving all but the last 4 years of mail and Outlook does appear to run quicker. I am still keeping all the daily PST file &nbsp;backups as well as backing up daily, just to be sure :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So again, I can only conclude that &nbsp;some software infrastructure, necessary to run Outlook, has become corrupt on my original machine, as Outlook is fine on 2 other machines with the same PST file.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll experiment on the problem machine and post further when we get back to SA in February. A clean install may be the real solution and I'm probably headed that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Cheers, Sandtonman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the heads-up! &nbsp;I'll try removing Acrobat and any other Applications that may be linked to Outlook which may be causing this. But I still suspect something a bit "deeper" in the system. Will keep posted early Feb, when back in SA; meanwhile all
 good here on UK machine. Cheers, S.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion Palcouk; I have a&nbsp; list of 9 Add-ins, all of which I'd "unchecked" (disabled) previously on ALL 3&nbsp;machines and which are still unchecked on this working machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the problem where certain add-ins prevent outlook starting and the fix whereby it is started in safe mode to disable (uncheck) the add-ins. That problem does not result in a corrupt PST file, Outlook simply hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not that problem; Outlook will not start either in normal or safe mode and, on the affected machine, plus it ALWAYS corrupts the PST file on initial start-up, no matter which mode I try.</p>
<p>

    <title>Outlook 365 Bullet feature is screwy&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulnunn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 Bullet feature is screwy&#33;</h2>
                    <p>For the past month, every time I try to use bullets in Outlook 365, the sentence indents and the bullet appears, but instead of a space between the bullet and the beginning of the sentence, there is a horizontal right facing arrow. It looks like your indent
 icon on the menu of this posting page, except the arrow is before the sentence with a bullet to the left of it. Numbered lists show the same right facing arrow. This is upsetting because I use Outlook for business correspondence every day which requires lots
 of bullets and numbered lists. Please help. Thanks, Paul</p>

            Please, one thread per issue = create a new thread for each issue. Other experts judge from the subject line (title) whether they are able to help. For example, I never used WhatsApp, so I am of no help here.

<h2>            Can I connect the messaging feature on my Win 8 PC with my WindowsPhone&#63;</h2>
                    I have a WindowsPhone (mango) and a Windows 8 PC... I see the same message icon on both. Can I get texts sent to my WindowsPhone on my PC also? Can I text contacts (phones) from my Win 8 PC?

            If I'm not mistaking there is a similar feature with Windows Phone 8 but not windows phone 7.x. The texts would go out through the phone and not the PC itself so the WP8 would need to be connected.

            You have to purchase Office Product keys.&nbsp; Did you purchase a Product Key for Office 2013? The Product Key can only be used once to install Office 2013.&nbsp; If you need to reinstall Office 2013 you can do so from your Office Account at:&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a>&nbsp;
 You need to sign in with the same email address and password that you used to setup your Office 2013 for the first time.&nbsp; Once you have setup Office 2013 you should not need your Product Key again other than as proof of purchase.</span>

<h3> jeff998877  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switching registrars &#38; email from godaddy to another but want to preserve ALL my very old emails. Possible&#63; How&#63;</h2>
                    My main domain and email are currently with GoDaddy. I want to finally transfer my domain &amp; email to another registrar (like 1&amp;1 for example).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to preserve and save ALL of my old emails before, during or after the switch? Been reluctant to switch because of this but hate GoDaddy. I don't have Outlook but I will purchase if it will enable me to do what I'm looking for.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone confirm this?</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks,</div>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to transfer your domain from one host to another but is concerned about the emails that is stored on your account or accounts of your users. Let me help you with your concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that once you move from one host to another, MX records of your domain will change. It means that once you have successfully configured your domain, say on Windows Live Admin Center, the accounts or users that you will add on your domains
 will have a newly created account. No emails or any other data because of the changed MX records.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you can prevent this from happening if you use Windows Live Mail and keep a copy of the emails that you wish to keep. To download Windows Live Mail, go

<h2>            Microsoft Office Customization Tool - setting email to use &#42;&#42;&#42; Email address is removed for privacy &#42;&#42;&#42;</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I'm in process of planning to use a PRF file, I've found answers to most of what I'm trying to do, but would like some help with username and e-mail address fields...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use Google apps and all our email accounts have been setup as Firstname.Surname, as such I would like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>User Name: Firstname Surname</p>
<p>E-mail Address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also point out that out usernames to log onto domain computers are Firstname.Surname, is this same as %username% or is %username% our actual name like Firstname Surname?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks in Advance.</p>
<p>

<h3> bradallen777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy from &#40;Outlook or Word&#41; and Paste to OneNote 2016</h2>
                    When I copy a selection from another MS application such as Word or Outlook, and then attempt to paste that selection into OneNote 2016 the paste options to retain format or merge format do not work.&nbsp; The icons appear active, but nothing happens when clicked.&nbsp;
 The only paste functions that work are TEXT (which loses all original formatting) or PICTURE.&nbsp; This worked fine in OneNote 2013 but the switch to OneNote 2016 is a step backwards in this respect.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?

LouiseBowen</a>. Are you trying to access your Yahoo mail using the phone's browser? You can also try setting it up under Settings &gt; email+accounts &gt; Yahoo! Mail. Enable show password to make sure that you're typing in the correct characters. Once you're done,
 you'll be able to view your emails by tapping the Yahoo! Mail app on the app list or from the home screen. Let us know if you need further assistance.

<p>Have the App, have gone to settings, and clicked "Sync Contacts." This takes me back to the "Your Email and Accounts" setting screen for the phone. This has three sections: my name and info for my Microsoft Acct, then Email, Calendar and Contacts, which
 has my exchange and Hotmail and an option to add an account, but when I click on that it does not give me a way to add LinkedIn. Finally there is a section Accounts used by other apps, which has two MS accounts and a FB one. Bottom line no LinkedIn, nor way
 to add it. </p>
<p>

<br />
Please advise,<br />

<p>The Windows fans / users, are people age 16-18; but also persons over 60 years old. The manner for explain some topics must be some difference, because this is no a "natural selection".</p>
<p>My problem is global. I don¨t why or which is the central cause for&nbsp; others blocking large periods all forma of communications with yours.&nbsp; Maybe the last two months, the two las ítems in each page of "Configuration" do not function until today for example.
 The task scheduler use the good things to bad actions. The Windows update block frequently the actualizacions for Windows. Today or yesterday I use other name to sesión init. In can not signin in that form.</p>
<p>A suggestion is that en each computer exists a compendium of less common services, terms, extensions for rápid acces as a help to solve problems. t
<span>he photographs of 200 or more infected archives is&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>blocked when I treat charge them and upload</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest créate a method to stop the modification of de URLs</p>
<p>Also some form of control or visualización of the activity of the modem routers.</p>
<p>Please dont permit that the activity of the pirats make that my system be truely Windows 7.</p>
<p>Continuaré luchando contra el enemigo interno, sin dejar de aportar comentarios y propuestas. Les pido que no dejen de darme una mano. Muchas gracias por todo. MH</p>

<h2>            Please Help&#33; Office 365 - Outlook &#47;OWA&#58; Security &#38; Administration</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Im looking for a bit of help on a few items that I’m trying to understand/process. Without going into too much detail the background to the request (But to provide enough context to
 help).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I founded a startup which might be acquired. We believe some early employees have and/or bullied others to the point they have quit. We thought the motivation was greed - as they were
 able to purchase any stock that hadn't vested but those that quit. But now it appears It's more complicated, two of the early employees were married… they split up and one quit. it appears that the one the remained was actually having an affair with another
 early employee and they coerced the other employee to quit.... then they brought the stock.... So yes awful shenanigans and im trying to figure out what happened so that I can lay this out to my board and council so they can advise - rather than the acquirers
 finding out and bailing during DD for audit - or thinking I covered it up or was part of it. Please don’t judge, but I will be reporting to the authorities if&nbsp;<span><span>appropriate.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>....So essentially, there are a bunch of email conversations between the three of them and our two of the. We can trace those easily and place in legal audit etc. The problem im trying
 to solve is there are some communications that have been manipulated from the original content either after being received, or by being saved as draft and then allowing access to others to update. Also emails that appear to be from external sources that haven't
 and aren’t real and/or spam just fake internal communications. Pulling headers helps validates this, but for the life of me (i'm an EE not CS) and I can’t figure out some of the hidden and/or manipulated content. I have tools such as Hex editors, open all
 files, content viewers but each communication has different style sheets or character sets that manipulate the content and I don’t know-how to access or remove that or decipher, in some cases there are images hidden as text / content or there’s text/css png/base65,
 winmail.dat the list goes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Q1 - How can I see the original content in human readable form<br />
Q2 - how can I remove style sheets or decode aspects of the edited email to reveal the hidden/encoded parts.<br />
Q3 - how can I trace the email back to a real source, even if that’s internal vs. External (lots of mailbox names, or send as, or received by, or cross tenant, or anonymous&nbsp;items in the header)</p>
<p>
Q4 - some headers have been edited so that the base64 or ascii content has been updated with the hidden message actually embedded in that (so I can’t decode the base64). It’s almost like L33T speak but it’s hard to decipher. In some cases there is a substitution
 alphabet or hints too using a certain font / language / style. therefore the email content is irrelevant as the actual message is in the headers.<br />
</p>
<p>
Please help ! Thank you!<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Dr._Rod_McB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my understanding, it seems you were viewing message headers of the received emails. As far as I know, the message header doesn't include content written by composers. People can only compose in the message body. For your reference, see the instructions
 of message format in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Internet email messages consist of two major sections, the message header and the message body, collectively known as content. The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process
 of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a signature block at the end. The header is separated
 from the body by a blank line.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can find the definition of email in <strong>
RFC 5322</strong>. So you can see the message header is apart from message body, and it works like an
<strong>envelope </strong>of the mail, we cannot modify information in it except <em>
From, To, CC, Subject, Date</em>. Meanwhile, it's not human-readable cause it's designed as machine-readable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you'd like to find the original sender of this email, you can paste the message header to
<a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/MHA/Pages/mha.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Message Header Analyzer</a>&nbsp;website to help you do the analysis. It can help you have a clear view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, Office 365 provides message trace feature which can find all inbound and outbound
<strong>emails records</strong>&nbsp;<strong>within Exchange server</strong>. For your reference, you can learn more details of message trace via the following link. Kindly note that it requires Office 365 admin account in your organization to perform the operation.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>How do I create a rule to send a notification of new mail (not the actual mail) to an external email address.<br />
For example... A new mail arrives on my work exchange mail (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and an email saying: "you have new mail on*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) to my external mail,*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>

            You don't.&nbsp; Outlook does not have the ability to send an e-mail message alert.&nbsp; It's conceivable you could do it with custom code or an add-in however.

                    IE needs to stop downloading things to almost un-findable locations and just download files to the Downloads folder. This has been going on since Windows95. It needs to stop with Windows10.

            I admit it would be nice to have a default folder for downloads. The My Documents folder introducded with Windows 95 worked well for data files. Why&nbsp;something like that was not introduced with Internet Explorer,&nbsp;I'm guessing&nbsp;this goes back to days of doing
 BBS downloading where we actually had to choose a directory to save our files to.&nbsp;When it comes to the internet, the dialog box&nbsp;is still there, but it seems that a lot of people have become&nbsp;too accustomed to just clicking through not&nbsp;really paying attention
 to what the dialog box is really asking of them to do. In these cases, the downloaded file usually winds up going into weird folder locations which will usually be the last one&nbsp;the user or Windows itself may have had opened.

<h2>            Outlook for Mac failing to connect to exchange server 2013</h2>
                    <p>we have recently upgraded our Exchange server from 2007 to 2013. I have a user that is using an apple laptop and unfortunately the client is not able to connect to the server using Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error is&nbsp; account cannot be added. Note that Outlook 2011 requires exchange server 2007 SP1 Rollup 4 or later.</p>

            <p>So you are saying that Draw Borders does not appear in the list when you do <br />
View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Customize &gt; Commands &gt; Format&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>That is strange.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Which version are you using?&nbsp; <br />
(Help &gt; About Microsoft Excel)<br />
I have 11.8332.8333 SP3<br />
Part of Microsoft Excel 2003 Professional Edition</p>
<p>If you are using an earlier version, I would suggest getting it updated</p>
<p>Otherwise, have you tried using Help &gt; Detect and Repair ?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What happens if you try to execute this macro?</p>
<p>Sub AddDrawBorders()<br />
&nbsp; Application.CommandBars("Formatting").Controls.Add ID:=6056<br />
End Sub</p>

<h2>            Relationships Error</h2>
                    I am trying to update the relationships between my tables (referential integrity and cascade) and I keep getting an error that says "Relationship must be on the same number of fields with the same data types."&nbsp; I don't understand what this means.&nbsp; Both&nbsp;
 parent field and child field are a number field.&nbsp; I have other tables where the relationships and integrity are intact, but it doesn't seem to be working for a few select tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Saying they are both "Number" is not enough. The subtypes need to be the same as well. For example two integers, or two long integers, but not a double and a single.</p>

<p>The problem was solved this morning with the help from Office Facebook page. The error was from an "add-on". After uninstalling that add-on, the problem was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply though. :)</p>
