    <title>Problems with NFS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with NFS</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some months ago I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro because I needed the NFS functionality (for a Vagrant based project, which uses VirtualBox and Windows' NFS for the shared folders). I followed the instructions (enabling Service for NFS from Control Panel -&gt;
 Programs -&gt; Turn Windows Features on or off -&gt; checking "Services for NFS", restarting, etc), everything worked great. Some note here: the VirtualBox (guest) box runs Ubuntu, and has a fixed IP assigned: 192.168.33.13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 4 days ago, for some strange reason, it stopped to work. The command that runs behind the scenes, from within the guest (VirtualBox) computer, is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>mount -o vers=3,udp,vers=3,udp,nolock 192.168.33.1:/D/BCEnvironments/projects /home/vagrant/projects</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command has always been the same, and has always worked. However, now I am getting the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>mount.nfs: Connection timed out</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and tried disabling Windows Defender Firewall. This time, I got a different error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>mount.nfs: mount to NFS server '192.168.33.1:/D/BCEnvironments/projects' failed: RPC Error: Unable to receive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried switching the firewall on and off over and over again, and those error messages are consistent (meaning, I always get the "Unable to receive" one when I switch the firewall off, and the "Connection timed out" one when I switch it on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the Internet for an answer, and so far, no luck. Could you please help me out? Thanks!</p>
<p>Pablo</p>

    <title>Xbox One Refuses To Read Red Dead Redemption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trulyvictorious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Refuses To Read Red Dead Redemption</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a brand new copy of Red Dead Redemption on Xbox 360, it was factory sealed until I opened it tonight, I previously bought a fairly nice conditioned used copy of the game and received the same error code "this game isn't playable here", I had
 heard about the scratches/smudges issues, but this disc I'm using now is 100% clean, and I'm not the only person having this issue clearly, as I've done some searching for fixes. I've power cycled, tried installing in online mode, and everything. What's the
 issue here?</p>

<p>Hey there TrulyVictorious,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issues playing Read Dead Redemption. It's very possible the disc may be defective as this error usually happens when the console can't read the disc.</p>
<p>However, let's have you try a hard reset with these steps. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Also, please ensure your console is connected to the Internet and you're signed into Xbox Live if you aren't already.</p>

<p>Turns out my Xbox One, for some reason wasn't catching the 7.5gb update that's required for disc users, seems to be the main culprit for those who got the same error. No idea why my Xbox One was struggling to pick it up, as I was connected and even installing
 a game digitally, I probably wasn't getting any download speed due to the other game.</p>

<p>I kept power cycling until the disc went from reading RDR as "insert a disc" to "install disc", for some reason backwards comp users have issues catching the required update download for backwards comp when using the disc version of a game, it should work
 as soon as the disc is read as install instead of insert though, just click on it when it says install, and it'll mention the update.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally left laptop on, put in case, left for two and a half hours.</h2>
                    <p>Closed the lid of my Toshiba C660 - that's supposed to put it into sleep mode, but some reason it didn't this time &nbsp;- and zipped it up in my laptop case for two and a half hours. Would this be enough to do damage? Any warning signs I should look out for?
 Anything I can do to test if anything is damaged?<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I've done this several times with no ill effects with my 3.5 year old Toshiba Satellite laptop.&nbsp; Of course it does run the battery down!&nbsp; Obviously it's not a great idea to do it, but it's certainly an easy thing to do, especially when you're in a hurry.&nbsp;
 There're some diagnostic tools on your PC you can run if you want to double-check, mine has a Toshiba diagnostic tool, and Windows has some in the Performance and Information tools applet of the Control Panel, if you want to double-check.&nbsp; However, if you
 don't notice any problems, the odds are high that no harm was done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            Laptops are designed to allow the closing of the LCD screen down over the keyboard.&nbsp; There is one hardware component that you should check.&nbsp; If the laptop is using a standard "hard drive," and not a SSD, you might want to do a hard drive.&nbsp; Right click
 the hard drive icon in Computer icon and access the tools section.<br />

<p>I finally found a solution.&nbsp; The problem is definitely a bug in Windows 10 1803.&nbsp; Below is a link to the fix.&nbsp; Once I made the modification to the Host file on each client (step 6.2), they were able to see the shared folders without any problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>As of this evening, my desktop (an Acer All-in-One upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7) has suddenly stopped responding to all forms of input - I can't
 get the touch screen, the keyboard, or the mouse to react at all. The light on the wireless detector doesn't light up, but it's a problem with the computer - the keyboard and mouse both work fine on other computers. The computer seems to start up just fine
 apart from that... I just can't do anything with it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I would like to try doing a clean install, but I can't without something to boot from. Just now I tried purchasing a backup copy, and my payment went through,
 but I got a message saying that the order description / confirmation was not available, and I haven't received a confirmation email, so I'm afraid I just wasted 15 euros.</font></p>

            Hi Anshul,
<div><br />
<div>thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Two days ago a fuse blew in my apartment and the power was suddenly cut to my computer. When I turned it back on, the LAN wasn't recognized anymore. I tried doing a system restore but that didn't change anything. When I tried restarting in safe mode, I
 got an error message saying it couldn't access a necessary device, but when I hit enter it just booted normally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then I tried looking for another system restore point, it told me that there weren't any (there had been others before). Finally I got out another WLAN stick and downloaded some drivers for it, and that worked - and still works.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The next day everything was okay all day, and then I left the house for an hour and when I came back, the touch screen, mouse, and keyboard had stopped responding.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Things I've tried so far:&nbsp;</div>
<div>-the mouse and keyboard (and wireless receiver) all work fine with my laptop. So does the LAN.</div>
<div>-I plugged in another mouse but that's not recognized either.</div>
<div>-I checked the batteries on the mouse and the keyboard. They're ok.</div>
<div>-I tried burning and running a Kaspersky Boot Disk, first from a USB drive, then from a DVD... but I can't do anything like hit F12 to change the order that things boot in, so it won't boot from the boot disk.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- &nbsp;I tried following the instructions to create a restore disk, but the Windows 8 Upgrade program never gave me the option of putting in my product key or installing from media... it just prompted me to choose which version of Windows 8 I would like to
 buy.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- I tried to purchase a backup copy from the Windows Store... www.mswos.com? The payment went through to Microsoft, but nothing else happened.</div>
<div>- I tried remotely accessing my computer using my laptop. but I guess I didn't have remote access on on the computer. I tried remotely connecting to the registry (to remotely activate remote access) but it didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for any advice you can offer.</div>
<div>Best regards</div>
<div>Jaime</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Does anyone have any ideas? Even if the computer problem is too complicated or silly or whatever, I'd still very much like to know if there's anything I can do to get a Windows 8 Recovery disk, besides just sending Microsoft
<i>another</i> fifteen euros and hoping that maybe the purchase will work the second time.</div>
<div><br />
Thanks very much for any help you can provide.</div>

<p>You're using the Source button on your Blu-ray Home Theater box to choose the Optical input? If that's not working, I think your home theater has issues. You could try using the Composite cable that came with the 360 to verify that the left/right RCA audio
 works.</p>

<h2>            Netflix&#58; No UHD on XBOX One S</h2>
                    
<p>I have an XBOX One S, I have a 4k TV, and I have a Netflix UHD plan. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;I can't get any of the content to play in 4k/UHD. &nbsp;I have not been able to set the console into UHD mode because of the asinine way the thing detects 4k instead of just outputting
 a 4k signal and timing out for non-compatible TV's. &nbsp;That aside, the Blu-Ray player and Netflix app are still supposed to work in 4k, even if the dashboard isn't in 4k. &nbsp;How do I get Netflix working in 4k? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I went through all of that before even posting. &nbsp;My guess it is related to not being able to get the dashboard into UHD because my TV auto detects the resolution being put out by the source. &nbsp;The XBOX One S doesn't put out a 4k signal until it thinks your
 TV can, but there have been a number of complaints with TV's, like mine, which fail the 4k test even though it meets all of the requirements. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It took me a minute to figure out how to set the One S into 4k mode. How I went about it. I do agree with the set up process is very frustrating... I can't exactly remember how I did it but it was along the lines of setting it the output to 1080, then under
 the calibrate section, checked (turned on) &nbsp;the "enable 4k" box, then went back to the output and switched to 4K, then under the same area where you checked the 4k box, check (turn on ) the HDR, 24hz and whatever else your TV supports. I hope this is a start
 or a finish to your solution.</p>

<p>I can verify this issue...Netflix UHD does not work on Xbox One S. I have a Vizio M55-D0 with the latest firmware enabling HD10 support. My TV is now recognized by the One S video settings as 4K HDR capable. I am able to enable HDR support and it works beautifully
 with the Blu-Ray app (Mad Max 4K Blu Ray playing 4K, 24fps, HDR as verified by the Vizio settings app). However when I start Netflix, the screen flashes, colors mute, and video fails to switch to HDR or 24fps. Netflix app is clearly broken right now for HDR.
 If I switch HDR off on the One S, Netflix app is fine, plays 4K correctly, colors are fine obviously no HDR.</p>

<h2>            Failure trying to play original xbox titles on xbox 360 even after latest firmware update.</h2>
                    
<p>Today I decided that I wanted to play my old xbox original games on my xbox 360, So I went and downloaded the latest update onto a USB and attempted to update</p>
<p>my console. Apparently my system updated but I still can't play xbox original titles. I don't get an error code it just tells me that the titles are not supported on my device and that I may need a system update to support it, even though I already updated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Only official hard drives that are bought from a reputable retailer (ie. not ebay or amazon online services) will work.</p>

            This error is normally associated with updating Windows Defender definitions. I recommend you go to the malware protection center, download the latest definition then manually install it.

            Hi Rita.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the exact error text written out verbatim, or captured with a screenshot this way:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />Was this an Upgrade from an earlier edition of Windows that ran Microsoft Security Essentials?  <a href="https://appuals.com/essentials-error-0x80070426-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://appuals.com/essentials-error-0x80070426...</a>
<br />
<br />If not is it Activated properly at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  What does it say under Edition and Status at top?  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows To Go is a method of copying a Windows installation to a USB thumb drive that you can boot from another computer.
<br />
<br />If this is the error you are getting:

<br />"You can't install Windows on a USB Flash Drive from setup" 
<br />
<br />change the value of PortableOperatingSystem in regedit

<br />Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Go to HK_Local_Machine/System/CurrentControlSet/Control/

            Hi  PRADEEPSHARMA_123 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Usually after a fresh install, there is a lot of background activity that takes place. 
<br />
<br />- Windows Defender is running a scan updating definitions
<br />- Additional updates might need to be installed.
<br />- Indexing is sorting files
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is:
<br />
<br />Check for updates manually - click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates
<br />
<br />Download and install any pending updates, restart when prompted.
<br />
<br />
<br />Install any Windows Defender editions manually:
<br />
<br />You can also download and install the latest definitions at the following link:

<br />
<br />As for your high GPU usage....
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Andre,</span></p>
<p>Thank You For The Help.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Believe That Maybe, As You Said, It Must Be Due To Some Updates Being Installed Or Other Such Background Processes</p>
<p>Since When I Booted Up My PC A Couple Hours Later The GPU Usage Never Went Above 10 % and Would Only Go to 20 % When I Would Continuously Scroll Through A Page..</p>
<p>
</p><p>However , I am Not Sure If It is Normal For The GPU To Be Used When Moving The Cursor Around Or Scrolling...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, Thank You Very Much For The Help..</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Next Morning, After I had installed Every Available Update For Windows And Also For My GPU , I Checked If The Problem Was Still There, So That You Could Understand The Situation Better I Took A Screen Shot Of the Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c45ab81-62b1-4082-96fc-9cfdd37a00a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c45ab81-62b1-4082-96fc-9cfdd37a00a4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Also, i Would Like To Mention That This Is When I Would Scroll Through The Task Manager Page. Otherwise When Left Undisturbed The Usage Would Be At Max 3 %</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Let Me Know If This Behavior Is Normal or if There Is a Need To Worry&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            See fonts before install</h2>
                    Hi, first thank you for your support.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want to add various fonts, but I would like to see them before.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The common method of opening the font and select install is really tedious when it is necessary to install dozens of fonts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any utility for that purpose?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            One way to get a rough look at a lot of fonts is to go into the folder with Windows Explorer, and change the view to Extra Large Icons (See the upper right corner of the window). This will show each font file as a square box with a three letter type sample.
 Double clicking on the box will bring up a viewer with a larger type sample, and allow installing the font.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Start Menu Size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danja9191  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Start Menu Size</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I installed Windows 8.1 on my Surface Pro from an ISO. Upon the install I had the new, "zoomed out" start menu which could fit four "medium" or "wide" sized tiles in one column. My surface had an "updates available" notification so I downloaded and installed
 the updates (about 60 of them). Since then I'm back to the old start menu which only holds three medium tiles per column. I really liked the layout I had with the four tile columns; how can I revert to that setting?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Tadasha,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My display is already set to its native resolution (1920x1080). Interestingly, I tried 1680x1050 and the start menu looked as I wanted it. Of course, then everything else looked stretched out. I also tried changing the text scaling to 100%, 125%, and 150%
 with no results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anything else I could try?</p>

            <p>This 'solution' only fixes one issue, and barely at that. Before the windows update, I had 5 rows of tiles, the "Show more Tiles" option only increases the tile row count from 3 to 4. The Charm Bar resolution is still far larger than it used to be, as well
 as many built-in apps, Mail, Settings, Photos, etc. </p>

We regret for the inconvenience caused to you. I understand that you are getting an error "something is wrong, try again later" while using Cortana. I’ll certainly help you with this.</div>

2. Open <strong>Task Manager </strong>by pressing <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete </strong>
in sequence.<br />
3. Under <strong>Process </strong>tab, find <strong>Cortana </strong>and right-click on it.
<br />
4. Click on “<strong>End task</strong>”<br />
5. Repeat 1st step to <strong>turn Cortana ON </strong>and activate it with the required information.
<br />

<h3> lozzy-636  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Feature - &#39;Something went wrong&#39;</h2>
                    Recently, I keep getting notified that to access Chrome or Firefox I need 'parents permission' in something they never opted in for. This was ever since I logged into the Xbox with this account and that 'I needed permission' to access these apps. I have
 removed my account from the family and as a child, yet I still keep getting notified that I need permission, but when I click 'send email' it says 'something has gone wrong' I'm guessing it means I'm off the child list, but do I need to do something to confirm
 this? The 'turn off family feature' page did not help me. Thanks.

                    <p>I'm completely new to Windows 8.1, got my first sight of it today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have downloaded and run FreeCell, but it fills the screen. Can I turn off the full-screen mode?</p>
<p>Also, I keep getting asked for permission to note my X-Box details but I don't own an X-Box! How do I get it to stop asking me?</p>
<p><br />
OT: 1) Full screen, 2) No X-Box!<br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
