<p>Hi</p>
<p>Toolbars that are placed on the Desktop are usually provided by the computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>If you have a Dell computer, it is called t<span>he Dell Dock. Go to Start/All Programs, click the Dell folder and you should see the Dell Dock shortcut there.</span></p>
<p><span>If it is missing from the computer, it is a free application from Dell. Here is a link to the download.<br />

            Your D: is normally for Recovery.<br />
<br />
You do not format it; why would you? <br />
<br />
You would only ever delete it if you had made the Recovery disks from it; and even then that is a bad idea in case you lose the disks.<br />
<br />
You do not say what brand of computer tha you have; so contact them for the exact info on doing a revovery back to "out-of-the-box" condition.<br />
<br />
General info below on how to "install again":<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;If the computer manufacturer did not include Vista disk/s, there should be a Recovery Partition on your Hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is the way they do it now, most of the time. We are supposed to make the Recovery Disks ourselves, with instructions included in the installed Manufacturer's&nbsp;Software in Start &gt;Programs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.<br />
<br />
And save all your Data before you do it, as a reinstall wipes everything from your Hard Drive..</span>

 it. Any ideas? I have Windows 10?</p>

</p><p>One possible reason why this is happening is because of an outdated software. In order to isolate what may be causing this issue, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start?</li><li>Were there any recent updates installed on your computer prior to this happening?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling/reinstalling your device driver?</li><li>What other troubleshooting steps have you tried?</li></ul>

            Thanks for your response. I uninstalled and reinstalled the printer drivers and I can scan and print, however scanned products end up in Microsoft Paint for edit and not my preferred Canon My Image Garden. . There was an update &nbsp;to Windows 10 on my computer
 on July 10. Sounds like the culprit! &nbsp;How can I get my scans to go to Canon My Image Garden?

            I've tried to figure out how to do this from both the Image Garden and MX452 manuals. Image Garden manual says to use the M452 manual for scan problems, but the search isn't picking up the required instructions. I will call Canon next week.&nbsp;

<p>Hi and thank you,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I do have the My Image Garden &nbsp;set for scan to open with My Image Garden. This is what Canon said to do, but the scans do not go there--they go to Paint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the start/settings/system hint above. No Canon files show up in the "choose by file &nbsp; &nbsp;type" list, which is extensive and includes all the Microsoft files, games I have loaded, even my tax software shows up, but nothing Canon. There was a plain "photo"
 choice, but neither Canon or My Image Garden were choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the My Image Garden is just not being recognized. It is on my program list with no megabyes. My Canon printer is making copies and printing just fine, but they do not require My Image Garden..It's just the scans that are messed up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Skype. To place a call you need to have a strong Internet connection.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you're on Wi-Fi, move to an area where the signal is stronger or connect to another network. For your reference how much bandwidth
 does Skype need, you can refer to this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/</span></span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, does it happen when you tried to make a Skype to Skype call?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I have the same problem. I'm in Thailand and have a monthly subscription to call US numbers. However for the last 10 days or so, I can't make any calls which jeopardizes my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted and re-installed the Skype app on my iphone and the problem persists. I have a good 4G connection in the place I am and I have been making calls from the same house/room for months.. You don't seem to have a phone number to call or chat to get
 tech assistance :/</p>

<h3> jeffs33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi slow performance and packet time outs when Bluetooth turned on or on battery power, on Surface Pro 6</h2>
                    <p>I am seeing very poor wifi performance which seems to have recently become worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My particular issue is when I connect with a HUAWEI mobile internet device, connected to 4G in the UK.&nbsp; If I connect to the internet using wifi I get poor PING times and also quite a lot of time outs.&nbsp; If I connect using the same mobile internet device but
 use a USB connector it all works fine with excellent performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After investigating, it seems that if I turn off Bluetooth then the wifi connection works fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the driver is fully updated and also installed the Surface Pro 6 drivers from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57514</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off Bluetooth is a nuisance since I often use BT earbuds and the Surface Pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is even worse, I have just discovered, is that things are bad when on battery power only.&nbsp; The ping time increases by 2.5 times, and timeouts start occurring...&nbsp; I can hardly believe it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be an urgent fix for this - it cripples the SP 6 on wifi.&nbsp; Unless it is just my SP 6?</p>

            <p>2.4GHz is used by both WiFi and Bluetooth. Does the router support 5GHz wifi? If<br />yes, use that. If not, try changing the 2.4GHz WiFi channel on the router. </p>

<p>No, the mobile router does not support 5 GHz, so that is not a solution for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have just updated to the 1903 build, even though Windows Update said it wasn't ready for the Surface Pro 6 yet.&nbsp; I had to remove the SD card to get it to proceed but it completed ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still suffering bad wifi performance at times, and I don't yet quite understand it.&nbsp; I was having a terrible time, connected the mobile wifi device directly via USB, then removed the USB connection and things were working well just on wifi.&nbsp; I had previously
 changed the channel the wifi was using from 2 to 6 but that didn't seem to change much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced there is some weird behaviour here, but I need to test in a few more scenarios to try to isolate the circumstances that cause the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input so far.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once I upgraded to 8.1, my HP printer decided it would be offline all the time.&nbsp; Never did get it back.&nbsp; So I bought a new Epson.&nbsp; It won't install.&nbsp; Microsoft says it is compatible.&nbsp; But I keep getting messaes such as "installation failed" with no explanation
 or link to go to.&nbsp; I will get an Apple next time, but my Toshiba Satellite is fairly new and I hate to replace it right now.

            <p>What is the error message you get when you attempt to install the Epson printer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you installing from a disc that came with the printer or did you download updated drivers from Epsons website for your printer model?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to the older HP printer, did you try deleting the printer from Devices and Printers (Control Panel) and re-add it to see if it resolves the problem?

<p>
</p><p>You should also check for updated drivers for the HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another tip. When installing the printer driver, make sure you respond to any on screen prompts that might hidden behind the installation wizard. I was installing an HP printer the other day and I was wondering why the wizard progress bar seem stuck at one
 point. It turned out there was a hidden window requiring an action before it could proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, disable startup items before attempting to install, including Antivirus:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the latest Epson driver.&nbsp; Microsoft says Epson is compatible and gives a link to updated driver.&nbsp; Didn't work.&nbsp; &nbsp; Have installed with disk and without disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did try to install using the two links you suggested.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To be sure delete all the data files then run a shredder on the free space. Then format it and if desired<br />
re-install Windows or leave it blank. (Data can be recovered from just a format though&nbsp;it is expensive.)<br />
<br />
CCleaner has the ability to wipe the freespace.<br />
<br />
CCleaner&nbsp;- Free - download from Piriform or FileHippo (below the for fee offer).
<p>CCleaner is our system optimization, privacy and cleaning tool. It removes unused files from your
<br />
system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space. It also cleans
<br />
traces of your online activities such as your Internet history. Additionally it contains a fully featured
<br />
registry cleaner. But the best part is that it's fast (normally taking less than a second to run) and
<br />
contains NO Spyware or Adware! - Includes Drive - Wiper (Tools - Drive Wiper) which has various
<br />
levels of securiity wiping free space or the entire drive.<br />

<h2>            Remote Desktop Gateway on Non-Domain PC&#63;</h2>
                    I have a current generation Lenovo Laptop with an i5 processor, DDR4 RAM, an SSD, and Windows 10 Pro Installed. I have a desktop I was given secondhand from my employer, and I revamped it and have Windows 7 Professional on that. It's a basic setup with
 2GB of RAM, smaller hard drive, etc. Is there a way besides TeamViewer or LogMeIn that I can use to access my Desktop from my Laptop PC when I am away from home? I would like as close to the built in RDC/RDS program that comes with Windows if there is some
 way around it. Thanks for any assistance.

<p>When they ban an account, they ban the account under the current gamertag name. Even if you were able to delete the account, the name XcaliFlawz would still banned. That gamertag is forever forfeit. If they banned your gamertag, then let you have the name
 back, what form of punishment is that?</p>

<p>Frederick. Hi. Sorry for not replying. I ) I have never done this before so could not find my original request, and also your reply. ( Still do not know how to do this). I have now identified what a .swm file is, but if I remember correctly I asked for info.
 to enable me to open it, or read it. Thanks anyway. </p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 frozen on rainbow screen</h2>
                    Toshiba LX 830 with wireless keyboard and wireless mouse. After an automatic Windows 8.1 update I am unable to use my computer as it freezes on the Windows rainbow screen. I have checked that the wireless modem is working and have replaced batteries where
 required but still no progress. What can I do besides returning the computer which is less than a year old.

            <p>Hello Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you upgraded the computer to <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8.1 Update 1</a></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to know that you were able to get the log in screen back on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue seems to be a random freeze issue. Ideally, Windows Updates do not cause such issues with the computer. Windows Updates help keep your PC safer and running smoothly. All you have to do is turn it on, and you'll get the latest security and other
 important updates from Microsoft automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you update the System to Windows 8.1.1 (Update 1) to receive the latest updates and patches which will help you in fixing common issues automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do post on Microsoft Community Forums in case you have any queries/issues while working on Windows.</p>

            I received advice to use another mouse and once I had that done the rainbow screen rolled up and by downloading the onscreen keyboard I have complete use of my computer. Since this solution works I am convinced the problem is with the Toshiba wireless
 keyboard and mouse so may find out if Toshiba will provide a new dongle. Thank you for those links which I will save for future reference.

Ruth, I have the exact same issue on my Custom Built Computer<br />
<br />
When I play it, it either shows up green (entire window is green&nbsp;with sound, but NO video....
<br />
<br />
Also watching videos in Edge also do the exact same thing. All of it happened after the latest update.<br />
<br />
((Video is an ATI Radeon HD 4250))<br />

    <title>Adaptive contrast , Surface pro useless as photo editor. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpusmc56  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adaptive contrast , Surface pro useless as photo editor.</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased my surface pro 6 , i5 256gb 8g. A week ago and noticed it kept flickering and dimming on it own. Once playing around with the settings and numerous internet searchse I've&nbsp; to realize/believe that the&nbsp;<em>adaptive
 contrast. </em><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is the problem</span>.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled the adaptive brightness, set the brightness to a certain setting in battery mode and powered. Set the battery and powered power setting to the same. And yet still get this flicker dimming and brightening effect , most noticable in low low
 light and goin from white/ mostly white windows to dark or mostly black ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This constantly changing display make it nearly impossible to get accurate photo editing done ie contrast/brightness/hue/saturation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to fix this if possible otherwise I must return it.</p>

<div>To help you out with this issue I have&nbsp;few questions:</div>
<ol>
<li>Is this happening only when you are editing a photo?</li><li>Have you tried to check in other photo editor apps?</li></ol>
<div>
<p>For the meantime, we suggest&nbsp;you to do the following basic trouble shooting steps below:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turn automatic screen brightness on/off</span></em></strong><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span></em></strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Display</strong></li><li>Under "Adjust my screen brightness automatically" select <strong>On</strong>&nbsp;or
<strong>Off</strong>.</li><li>Try to reproduce the issue in both settings.</li></ul>
<div>
<p>* This may impact battery performance, and make sure you are comfortable with turning the feature back on. If you want to keep auto-brightness setting enabled, and the issue is not resolved, proceed to the next steps.</p>

 perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for 10 seconds or until the screen goes off. When you restart the Surface, the updates will be applied and the software will be loaded properly.</li></ul>

            This happens in everything not just the application for photo editing. It happens while watching movies, looking at the desktop and opening windows or folders. I have tried all those things mentioned as i stated before. The automatic brightness has been
 turned off.

<p>Hi there! I am currently having the exact same issue with my own surface pro 6. I have spoken to a Microsoft agent regarding the problem and he has been a huge help in trying to assist in what may be causing this and is currently seeking help from other
 departments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it's a feature Intel added to their drivers known as "Dynamic adaptive display" or something along the sort. It auto adjusts the contrast to match what is being displayed and does in incrementally which makes it very annoying and noticeable. Very
 very noticeable. its suppose to save battery but its terrible. <strong>NOTE IT ONLY OCCURS DURING ON BATTERY USAGE</strong>, when charging it does not occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very happy with the product, however <strong>Intel must be informed immediately from the surface team</strong>. I bought 2 of the surface pro 6 so far, the first having the same issues which was why i had to return and repurchase, only to find the same
 issue occurring on the second model which i am currently using. This being said their must be a few batches with this error as it has not been given much attention as of yet. And yes i ran all preliminary updates and ran through the settings. Spent 5 hours
 updating and checking everything, then restarting only to see it happen on my second device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give huge credit to the Microsoft technical support team as they will consistently get back to their customers and help. Hopefully they could get this sorted out soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gave up, got no help from anyone, was tilt the same thing, return it try another, new one did the same thing returned it went with a 2-1 laptop from Lenovo, don't seem to notice it yet and&nbsp; it&nbsp; has more adjustments all around with battery saving setting
 through the integrated intel graphics card so if ido notice it hopefully i can shut it off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft wants to be Apple then be Apple and fix your ****. Make sure your hardware and software mesh well together. Don't market a product for creators and artists when the contrast and brightness keep changing on their own, there's nothing I can do
 about it at least make it so I can shut it off otherwise how do i know what I'm actually creating in the end.</p>

            So i returned it so i could care less at this point but just step back and look at how absurd this is. You expect me to buy a $1000 laptop and have to the change lines of code in the registry to get it to function appropriately, and after all that when
 and update is preformed it will just reset that code to default. Ya make it a button or just fix it, and once again Apple doesn't have this problem.

            <p>Thanks Anannya,</p>
<p>This was a very helpful response, however I was unable to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The first method confused me and I felt as though if I deleted my User file I would lose all of my data. The second method required a download, which is the problem, so I couldn't do that either, and whenever I try to carry out the third method I get the
 message: Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm still stuck. Thanks for trying though.</p>

<p>Why do you lock all the good threads? I mean every time I find a thread relating to what I searched for it is locked. You have to leave them open as long as the thread remains civilised in nature, months or even years down the line a newer, better solution
 or answer is likely to be found, or a more pushing and developed question could be asked further.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You really are quite notorious for this, and I just wish it would stop. you want to watch and hear us and see what we are doing to advertise to us etc.&nbsp;but you will not let us communicate properly in this open forum.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder the forum is so dead, please let the forum breathe, so it can live to it's full potential.</p>
