<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t update after clean re-installation of Windows 7 Professional disc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Originally, my desktop has two hard drives: a 240 GB Intel SSD called the C Drive for the OS, and a 600 GB Western Digital HDD called the D Drive to store data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, I had Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>In 2015/2016, I downloaded and installed the FREE Windows 10 Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In January 2017, the D Drive to store data was almost full.</p>
<p>I installed a brand new third hard drive, a Western Digital 2 TB HDD called the E Drive for data, but then the C Drive with the Win 10 OS could not be recognised!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC forced me to reformat the C Drive, and reinstall the original Windows 7 Professional disc.</p>
<p>I then downloaded the Media Creation Tool which seems to have downloaded Windows 10, but now, for the past 7 days, my PC has been trying to "Get Updates", but we keep seeing this window below, and the PC can't seem to download any updates for Windows 10.</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/i/s!AuIRWg6EAbYqw9ZZzlxKLo1Ljg-nfw</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how we can download updates to get back to Windows 10?</p>

<span><span><span><span><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened
 is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

                    <p>My 1 month old laptop has been taken over by "RegClean Pro". It comes on and blocks my screen at will. It offers a program which I don't want. It scans my registry (or so it says) at will. I have called their telephone number and it is answered somewhere
 in the bowels of India. They want money to either install the full program or to remove the "teaser" that reviews the "errors" in my registry. I looked in my "add/delete" programs and it is not there. Revo and Iobit cannot find them in my PC. They seem to
 own my computer. My first download after I got my PC was Microsoft Security Essentials. They didn't block it. I spoke to someone at MSFT Help and they suggested I try to return my PC. Hewlett Packard says they cannot get into my PC via remote because this
 phantom is blocking them. Microsoft Help and Assistance is&nbsp;being blocked by this phantom, too.Can someone please hlp me?</p>

            <p>When you save your stuff, just copy it across to the flash drives, and only copy documents, photos, music etc. If you get ISP mail through MS Outlook, save all of your PST files, and if through Windows Live mail, save all EML files. You may need to unhide
 files and folders to make them all visible.. </p>

<p>You really need to ignore stuff like the above. The only way to improve performance is to upgrade the hardware upon which Windows runs. The best way to cripple Windows performance is to run anything like RegClean Pro, Systweak and the multiplicity of other
 'high claims' registry cleaners, that and mess with registry generally.</p>

<p>Witam. Zakupiłem Wiedźmina 2. Wklepałem kod, wyglądało w porządku. Problem polega na tym, że gra nie ściąga się do końca, ale w różnych momentach (50,80%) zaczyna pobierać się od nowa. Na dysku 50 gb wolnego miejsca, dysk niedawno formatowany, cache wyczyszczone.
 Co robić? :/</p>

<p>Czasem się tak dzieje. Problem tkwi w pliku zapisu - musisz przerwać pobieranie i z pamięci dysku wywalić to co już zostało pobrane z Wiedźmina (będzie to nazwane jako Wiedźmin 2 lub jako Uszkodzony plik). Po usunięciu pobierasz ponownie.</p>

<h2>            Manage Wireless Networks</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 has removed this function from the Network and Sharing Center.&nbsp; It is seriously needed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When windows 8 is used for traveling and builds up a long list of wifi connections, it starts to not remember hidden networks.&nbsp; I found a utility that lets me edit and delete old networks, and after deleting all of the unneeded networks it instantly re-connected
 to my hidden home wifi network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, a fix is definitely needed here.&nbsp; Either they need to make the automatic network management work properly, or we need to have the ability to manage them ourselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just realized the easier way might not work for the original poster, if the saved networks are not showing in the pop-up column. &nbsp;Mine all did because they were all multiple entries for the same (home) WiFi network named like: &nbsp;Home Wifi, Home WiFi 2,
 Home WiFi 2 3, Home WiFi 2 3 4 ... Home WiFi 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10, etc.</p>
<p><br />
This is not the only way to use netsh, but it's the way I find easier.<br />
</p>
<p>1) Open a Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges -- if you don't know how, just press the &lt;Windows Key+X&gt; and choose "Command Prompt (Admin)"</p>
<p>2) type "netsh" (without the ") and press &lt;enter&gt; -- your prompt should now read "netsh"</p>
<p>3) type "wlan" and press &lt;enter&gt; -- your prompt should now read "netsh wlan"</p>
<p>4) type "show profiles" and press &lt;enter&gt; -- this will display all saved WiFi profiles</p>
<p>5) type delete profile name="xxx" (use the " around the profile name) where xxx is on the list from "show profiles".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Hint: You can use wildcards -- e.g. in my example above I could enter</p>
<p>netsh wlan&gt;delete profile name="Home*"</p>
<p>and it deletes all of them in one entry</p>
<p>or, I could delete them one at a time: &nbsp;e.g. &nbsp; netsh wlan&gt;delete profile name="Home WiFi" and &lt;enter&gt; to delete the first one only.</p>

            <p>Yes, for some reason Microsoft took it out. I spent an hour talking to Microsoft support trying ton convince him that it was necessary to manage my saved network connection. They said that it will be added back in when Service Pack 1 comes out.</p>

 what exactly will it be linking, and to where?</p>

</p><p>The <span>Xbox Identity Provider is a preinstalled system app that is used by apps and games on Windows to connect to your Xbox Live account.&nbsp; The Xbox Identity Provider isn’t intended to run as a stand-alone application. Games like Microsoft Solitaire Collection

<h2>            Stuck on the &#34;welcome&#34; screen, can&#39;t access safe mode nor reset laptop</h2>
                    <p>Okay so, I've got this issue with my laptop where I can't log in. It starts up fine, gets to the screen with time and my account picture and name etc, and I can enter my password all fine. After I enter my password the screen just enters some infinite loop
 with "Welcome" and the spinning dots..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried almost all solutions or fixes on the internet but none seem to work.. I can't access safe mode, because that gives me the exact same issue (after I restart into safe mode, it also gets stuck on the welcome screen). The past 2 days I've somehow
 managed to (after like waiting an hour on the welcome screen) enter a guest account. It then gives me a message that my account that I tried logging in to, could not be logged into. I've tried doing SFC in command prompt on this guest account, and it said
 it would apply the changes of the corrupt files after a restart, but it didn't change anything after the "updates" were applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find anything on the internet that could help me, so maybe someone here knows a solution..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Roeland25 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to       
        </p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Roeland25 <br />
<br />
Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />
Do this twice <br />
<br />
On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />
Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair <br />
See if Windows startup can repair itself <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore <br />
Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to </blockquote>
<p>Hey, thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every option I could find in those settings, and none could fix my problem, or even worked..&nbsp;</p>

<p>I downloaded this file, and did everything as you described, but even when I was booting from that "last known good configuration" it still gave me the exact same issue, which was just resulting in me being stuck in an infinite welcome screen spinning dot

<h2>            High CPU Usage at Random Times</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have problem of high CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Description:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Computer starts alright, runs good for a short period of time (between 20 minutes to few hours) then the computer starts to overuse CPU and is so slow that it is unusable.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This
 happens few times a day and during that time I have no internet connection.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am beginner with all of this, and not sure what am I supposed to do. Only reset button ever helped.
 When I tried normal shut down, it waited for explorer to stop, but I never started it in first place. However, desktop was all black and high usage was still present. I had to use reset button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Information You might need:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>-I did antivirus (Kaspersky Internet Security) scan and there is no any sort of virus.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>-When I start Task Manager, I found few processes that have high CPU usage.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>sidebar.exe (23-68 CPU)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>taskmgr.exe (28-65 CPU) *once it was 99&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>* potential explorer.exe overuse started later (0-24 CPU)</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>-I have 4 gadgets on desktop. Should I delete them? gadgets process usage: 0-31 CPU</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>-Number of processes: 56, 57, 58</span></span></p>

<h2>            After my last windows 10 update, why does my computer keep restarting, when it says I have had a power surge&#63;</h2>
                    Why is there so many issues with Windows 10?&nbsp; After my last update my computer unexpectantly crashes and it restarts telling me it was due to a power surge.&nbsp; Then it asks me to use F1 to change settings?&nbsp; I restart my computer and it's okay for a short
 while.&nbsp; Or when its asleep and you tap the mouse or keyboard it sometime does it as well.

            <p>I have a similar problem and have tried methods 1 and 2 twice to no effect. Creating a new account means I cannot access all the saved files I have in my primary account so this is not practical and does not actually fix the problem.</p>
<p>This is starting to become really annoying as it is a forced restart so I lose whatever I'm working on at the time.</p>

            <p>Why is it that Microsoft would ask to create a new account if it was the update that caused the issue? &nbsp;Couldn't you all determine what it is in the update that is causing the issue and fix it? &nbsp;I did not have issues with my computer until this last update.
 &nbsp;Since then I have having issues with the computer restarting for no reason. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the first two fixes listed above and it has not worked. &nbsp;I did not have any corrupt files located in the second fix. &nbsp;I just want the update to fix the issues, not create another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Print Artist 24 Stops Working when changing fonts - Windows 8</h2>
                    Whenever I try to edit the font on a selected project using Print Artist Platinum 24, the program stops working and advised to close. This only happens when I'm doing a project from scratch not from pre-made projects. I am using Windows 8. I'm not sure
 what the problem is and what's causing this. The program is compatible with Windows 8 so says the box. How can fix this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the program does not work even after uninstalling and reinstalling it, I would suggest that you check with the manufacturer for further help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the <a href="http://www.novadevelopment.com/software/print-artist-gold-128982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer`s website </a>, this should be working fine with Windows 8. Here`s the support
<a href="http://www.novadevelopment.com/support/customer_service/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website link
</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do reply if you have any other Windows related issues, we would be glad to help you. Thank You.</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open a mounted partition D:\ (exFat SSD) I get this error:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>You don't currently have permission to access this folder.</strong><br />
<strong>Click Continue to permanently get access to this folder.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>So, I click just to get this error:<br />
<br />
<strong>You have been denied permission to access this folder.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To gain access to this folder you will need to use the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
security tab.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and of course because it is not a folder, there is no security tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unblocked updates just to make sure that there isn't something relevant in the pipe, "only" 4 restarts needed and the only thing I got was 600mb of bloatware, more spyware/telemetry and all my privacy setting "miraculously" reset to maximum stalking...</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is really getting mental, what do I do, should I go back to Windows 7?<br />

<p>-&gt; Both files AND folders do have security tabs, but only on NTFS volumes.</p>
<p>-&gt; FAT volumes do not have security tabs.</p>
<p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />Have you used this existing drive before or is this a band new formatted drive?<br /><br />If this is a brand new drive I would suggest formatting the drive again and try selecting NTFS for the partition<br /><br />If this isn't new and has been used before my best advice in this situation would be to see if there are any drivers available for the drive as this could prevent your access to the drive<br /><br />Let me know how you get on

            It's the same drive Windows 10 is running from, W10 died about a week ago so I had to reinstall and to not to lose any data I have everything that matters on a separate partition. That partition can be access from linux and can be scanned by an antivirus
 but not opened by the Explorer...

            <p>I have the same problem. While charging (battery level being low, 10-15%) the estimated time to fully charged is shown as 3-4 minutes that is not true! The real time is two hours or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried methods 1 &amp; 2 without success. Method 3 is (in my case) not possible because the device manager doesn't show any "Power Adapter". I tried to update adapters under "Batteries", but it didn't help either. The updater claimed that I already have
 the latest versions.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run the SFC scan:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to restart the computer in safe mode and check if it helps:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Please let us know the results. Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Kaspersky is hardly the industry leader.&nbsp; Almost anything besides Kaspersky, McAfee, and Symantec will work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things like AVG, Avira, ESET, etc work as well or better than Kaspersky and cause very little issues.&nbsp; BTW Kaspersky is not compatible with the current versions of win 10 (Insider builds)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I had also contacted Microsoft Desk. There Mr. Chris suggested I use Windows iso file and update my OS. I have done it on Monday 07th March and since then I am not facing any issues for the past 4 days. But lets see if I don't face
 any issues for the next month or so I will say this is my answer to the problems I was facing. I have Kaspersky Antivirus installed onmy laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep you posted on the above.</p>

<h2>            2 USB ports do not detect my USB headset while one USB port does</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have brought HP pavilion power 15 laptop. My msi DS502 headset is not detected by the 2 usb ports while it works perfectly fine in the 3rd one. Moreover, it receives the power from these 2 ports as the LED on the headset turns on when i plug it in these
 2 ports. My External HDD works in all three ports. What could be the reason for it to not work and how can i solve the issue?</p>

<p>El gears 3 es más delicado con la conexión de internet.</p>
<p>Un cuate nunca podía terminar las partidas igualadas en su consola, lo botaba, tiene internet por cable y la cambió por la mia yo tengo infinitum y así sin broncas el juega bien y yo también es un problema que solo &nbsp;se da en gears 3, me d ala impresión que

<p>que bueno que lo mencionan, conmigo no encuenta partidas igualadas (tarda mucho y me canso de esperar-) y con la lista de forces of nature NO ME A TOCADO JUGAR EN NINGUN MAPA DEL DLC SOLO JUEGO EN LOS MAPAS BASICOS, me tiene harto por que es la lista de
 forces of nature, asi que es una jalada, y en old school me pide mas mapas, en el unico en el que juego es en Rave Down, SINCERAMENTE ME ARREPENTI DE COMPRAR EL PACK FORCES OF NATURE.

<p><span>After you insert the CD, close the PDF file then go to Start, Computer, identify the CD drive then right click on it and choose Explore. This should show all the files on the CD.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the type of CD it is, there can be different types of files listed – in most cases there will be an application file that you can open. As an example, if the CD is for an installable program, there
 should be a setup or install application that you can open and run.</span></p>

    <title>USB flash drives is recognized late. What is the reason&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esrakaraca  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB flash drives is recognized late. What is the reason&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I have Windows 7 x64 on my laptop. It is working fine, but there is a problem about the USB drives. It takes too long to detect USB mass storage devices. When I connect it to the USB port, Hdd lamp is on for a few seconds. (15-20 sec.) it finishes
 what it does, then the usb drive is detected. it takes too long just for the first time plugging. If I unplug and plug it in again, it is detected instantly until the computer is shut down.<br />
<b>By the way, this problem occurs on every laptop which has a usb wireless mouse. If I disconnect usb mouse and reboot, the usb is recognized instantly.</b> When there is a usb mouse, it takes too long. What is the relation between the usb wireless mouse and
 any flash drives?<br />
<br />
<b>additional information: </b><br />
computer has enough memory 4GB.<br />
no application is running background. processor isn't busy.<br />
flash drive doesn't have much data on it.<br />
anti-virus software is up-to date and there is no virus or malware on the laptop. If the Antivirus is disabled or uninstalled, the problem still continues.<br />
<br />

<br />
1. No error messages.<br />
2. Avira Antivir Free Antivirus<br />
3. I didn't make any changes.<br />
<br />
I guess I was misunderstood. No error messages, because the USB drives work correctly. But it takes longer than it should take. Normally flash drives are recognized in 2-3 seconds. But it takes 50-60 seconds. after that it is working perfectly, without errors.
 if I plug out then plug it in again, it works normally. in a second or 2, it is recognized. I wonder why it takes longer for the first plugging in.<br />
clean boot didn't help. still it takes longer. <br />
I guess the problem is related to USB Policies. (policies of Regedit)<br />

                    <p>&lt;Original title: Japanese language not properly displayed in some installed programs in Windows 8&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed Windows 8, the default language of the DVD is UK English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to work with Japanese language, so after installing windows I downloaded and installed the Japanese language pack.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f5ac192-9785-4a3e-ac5c-04a5eb960ebd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is correctly displayed in Japanese, however some programs show garbled text when I try to install (I tried to install anyway, but the program text was also garbled)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d107e434-8e2e-4c73-a9ed-a5f804e355f0" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some programs are correctly displayed in Japanese (e.g. CoreTemp or <a href="http://hide.maruo.co.jp/software/hidemaru64.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hidemaru</a>, a Japanese text editor) some are not (like <a href="http://www.forest.impress.co.jp/library/software/lhaplus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lhaplus</a>, above screenshot, this is a Japanese program which default language is Japanese)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using an English language versions of Windows 7 before, and never had this issue.</p>
<p>If anyone has an idea how to fix this, I'll highly appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you !</p>
