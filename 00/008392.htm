<h2>            Outlook 2016 and SBS 2008 Exchange</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>We are testing our first Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 on our Small Business Server 2008. I did a clean install of Windows 10 and Office 2016. Everything went fine.</p>
<p><br />
When I try to connect Outlook 2016 to my Exchange Server running under Small Business Server 2008, I receive the message " The resource that you are trying to use is located on an unsupported version of Microsoft Exchange.&nbsp; Contact your e-mail administrator
 for assistance."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am the .e-mail administrator and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
As I read the different articles, it seems my options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded to a newer version of Exchange, which means I have to upgrade to a new version of SBS.
</li><li>Downgrade Outlook to Outlook 2013. </li></ul>
<p>Do you know if I have any other options.&nbsp; By the way, while I know windows pretty well, I am learning SBS 2008.</p>

<p><br />
Thanks,</p>

<p>Dennis</p>

</p>
<p>Your only option is to downgrade office. If you bought the retail (full package product licence) you are not entitled to downgrade rights.</p>
<p>This is a poor situation for those with SBS 2008, i know a few businesses in a similar situation, you need to buy VL copies and get downgrade rights that way. Or purchase 365 subscriptions which have the office products and use the older 2003 version you
 are (currently but for how long?) entitled to.</p>

    <title>Drawing on canvas disappears from adding a caption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robbo d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drawing on canvas disappears from adding a caption</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I recently found an annoying glitch that seems to hide my drawings on Microsoft Word 2007 after I save a document and close it. I have worked out how it happens (which I will step you through), but I want to know why it happens and how to correct
 it. First I would like to stress that as far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with your viewer settings. I have spent the last day checking the settings (which were correct), plus the images don't display on anyone else's computer (where other images will),
 nor do they display in a PDF format. So yes, the fridge is plugged in at the wall and turn on, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to recreate the problem (makes for a neat magic trick!).</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open a new word document. Now lay down a canvas (Insert -&gt; Shapes -&gt; New drawing Canvas) and draw a pretty picture.
</span></li><li><span>Because you picture will go down into the MS-word Bermuda Triangle, keep it simple, so just draw a box.
</span></li><li><span>Now fill it will colour so we can see it (optional). </span></li><li><span>Save your document and close it. Now reopen it, your drawing will still be there, but not for long.
</span></li><li><span>Now because we want people to know what it is, add a caption by right clicking on the Canvas and selecting insert caption. Call it "The hidden box", or whatever takes your fancy.</span>
</li><li><span>Save and close the document. I hope you weren't attached to that picture, because when you open it, it will be gone, and the canvas outline will have changed to a blue lined box when clicked on, almost like a type of image.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>So I think we have established that it is the caption that causes it. So I would like to know if anyone knows why, but more importantly, how to reverse it. I have copied the whole document (after the image has disappeared), saved it in a new file and
 noticed that the new document is smaller than the old one (by alot too). Which must mean that the image is still there somewhere in the document. But how can I access it again? If anyone has any idea, I would love to hear them.
</span></p>
<p><span>It is a really annoying problem as I have spent my time drawing an image to describe my topic, only to save and submit it and have it lost in cyberspace by following academic protocol and placing a caption in. I even lost marks on a paper, because
 the submitted copy (which was submitted as a PDF) had an empty box instead of my image. And I am not the only person who has had this problem as a Google search revealed similar complaints, but not a single solution. So if you like a challenge, here it is.
</span></p>

            <p>Hi Doug, first of all thank you for taking your time out to have a look at this issue&nbsp;and replying. It is interesting that you are not able to replicate the problem, perhaps&nbsp;reopening the possibility of an over looked setting on my behalf. I double checked
 my method and I'm still getting the same results of the disappearing picture. </p>
<p>If you could spare the time to have a look at the document, that would be greatly appreciated as I do find the drawing element tools on word to be very handy. So much so that I have used them in may reports and have encouraged colleagues to utilise it when
 they have seen the benefits. Therefore I would like to be able to ensure the reliability of the images I draw in my reports.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through researching the issue, I have found a few cases that match my own, however none of them appear to have a solution.</p>

            <p>I don't know whether it's relevant or not, but if I have the drawing canvas formatted as In Line With Text, inserting a caption (which I would expect to be in an ordinary text paragraph but instead is in a text box), changes the text wrapping on the canvas
 to In Front of Text (which is the default wrapping when the canvas is inserted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I even tried this was to see whether, with the inline canvas selected, the caption might be actually replacing the canvas, but that definitely doesn't happen. In any case, I can't reproduce the error, either.</p>

            At this point it seems clear to users that the Canvas is a POS. I hope that Microsoft comes to terms with this fact soon and either gets rid of it or makes it work.<br />
My specific problem is that when I create a picture and add callouts (which forces me to use the canvas), the picture does not appear in my PDF.<br />
Perhaps the ultimate solution is just to switch to Framemaker for all my documents.<br />

            I have experienced the exact same problem on Word 2007. I don't know how to get back an image that was lost in this way but here's how I prevent it from happening:<br />
After inserting the caption it appears as a text box with a blue dashed outline indicating the edges of the box. Grab the bottom left corner of the box and drag it to the right and up to shrink the box somewhat. Then send the box to the back by right-clicking
 on it and selecting Order-&gt;Send to back.<br />
In my case, I could now save the document, close, open again and the drawing with the caption was still visible. Hope this helps!<br />

            <p>Sorry to bump this thread but recently i'm having exactly the same problem, HOWEVER:<br />
</p>
<p>1. If you add a caption for a canvas, then save and exit when the cursor is still blinking inside the caption box, the drawing WILL disappear when you re-open<br />
2. If you add a caption for a canvas, then click on a canvas to focus, and then save and exit, the drawing WILL NOT disappear when you re-open<br />
<br />
With two canvases:<br />
1. Draw canvas 1 and 2, add a caption to canvas 1, click con canvas 1 and save, nothing is lost<br />
2. Draw canvas 1 and 2, add a caption to both of them, then click on one canvas and save, the drawing inside not-clicked-when-save canvas WILL disappear when re-open<br />
<br />
This is just ridiculous, I've lost so many drawings.</p>

I'm using Word 2007, and the file was saved in .docx format<br />
I figure out that after adding a caption, i must reclick the canvas correspond to it at least one time, or the drawing will disappear</p>

            In some versions, an <strong>empty</strong> drawing canvas will disappear if you click outside of it, but this doesn't seem to be the case in your document. I'll look more closely into this later, when I get the chance to test in Word 2007.

            I haven't been able to reproduce this in Word 2007. Can you reproduce the problem with any document that you create in Word 2007, or just with some documents? Are you seeing the problem only with *.docx files? Please elaborate.

<h2>            Emails disappears from my Outlook Inbox and Iphone Inbox</h2>
                    Hi, I just noticed my emails sync (disappears) from my inbox. But if i search any previous email it comes up after search. As i also have POP Folder where lots of email were there and i just moved all emails from POP to Inbox.
<br />
<br />
Here is my Question. What should i do inorder to stop my emails sync(or disappear automatically) from Inbox.
<br />
Same thing happens from iphone Hotmail Inbox , it disappears after couple of weeks. Even i did the setting of sync to No Limit.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            <p>I had emails disappear right before my eyes going from folder to folder, not sure why but figured out how to get my emails back.</p>
<p>1). go to the location on hard drive where your outlook.ost file resides. &nbsp;right mouse click and click on go to location of file.</p>
<p>2). rename the file to something else like *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>3) start outlook and it will start syncronizing all mail on the server down to your outlook.</p>
<p>4) click on every folder and you will see it synchronizing, may take a while especially if you have tons of email.</p>
<p>thanks and good luck!</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default account settings won't influence the process of sending or receiving emails from your IMAP account at all. Based on your description, there is something wrong with your IMAP
 account settings in Outlook 2016. First, please make sure you can sending emails from the web mail app with you IMAP account. Then click File&gt; info&gt; Account settings&gt; Account Settings, select your IMAP account and click Change…&gt; Reset Mail settings to see
 if it works for you.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the issue persists, please tell us the detailed version of your Outlook 2016 for further investigation. You can find the information under File&gt; Office Account as the following picture shows.</p>

<h2>            CTRL &#43; ALT &#43; ENTER</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently writting my PhD Work and now i have some kind of accident. In the middle of my footnote i ve pressed CTRL - ATL - ENTER instead of CTRL - ALT - DEL (to sign out). Now my footnote is some kind of mirrored and i'm not able to delete it. Taking
 an old version of my work isn't possible because i saved it long time ago in thinking of there will be an easy way to fix it later... But at the moment it seems to be a bigger problem than i thought. Deleting the footnote isnt helpful also, because this kind
 of failure just spring to the next footnote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            What I found worked was selecting the style separator and the following footnote reference and pressing
<strong>Ctrl+Spacebar</strong>. You will then have to reapply the Footnote Reference style to the footnote reference after the break.

                    Attachments missing from e-mails sent to me by friend&nbsp;using Office 2010&nbsp;. I am&nbsp;using&nbsp;Windows 7 and Windows live mail with Open Office. To try and fix the problem I have the newest version &nbsp;of Open Office and have downloaded Office 2007 viewer. One way
 I have been able to get them is to have the e-mail forwarded from another friend who is&nbsp;using&nbsp;Office 2007. The attachments came in .docx format and a PDF file both arrived OK and I was able to open both documents.

<h2>            deleting list of call made and&#47;or received</h2>
                    Is it possible to delete the list of call made. I have calls showing from early 2017, and since they no longer show dates but rather today or yesterday it is very confusing. I would really like to be able to delete a call after it was made or attempted.

<p>Hi, George</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to remove the bubble that shows the call you received or you made from the application. In the Skype for Windows 10 version, it is designed that your messages and call history will be shown as today, yesterday, a week ago, etc. depending
 on when you made or received them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noted your suggestion on having an option to delete a call after it has been made, received, or attempted. We appreciate any feedback you provide to help improve the Skype client.</p>

<p>I used to have Office Professional 2010, which stopped working some time ago. I decided to purchase a licence for the current office 365 personal. After downloading, this wouldn't wok. I discovered after some research that this was due to it not working
 with the old 2010 version still installed. Tried to uninstall but had become corrupted which meant that I couldn't uninstall using the control panel. I used Microsoft's page which automatically will use Easy Fix to uninstall (<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8</a>).
 However, in addition to the 2010 version this also uninstalled the new 365 I had installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>I am trying to install Office to my laptop again through Install button it gives me next to my account, but each time it gets halfway through the installation and produces the following Error: "Couldn't stream Office" with Error Code 30015-25 (-1610612703).
 I have tried the 'go online for additional help' option but this just says to reboot the computer etc but I have already done this.</p>
<p>I have tried multiple times and different times of day, and even tried after a clean boot, but each time will get to the halfway point and produce this error. There are no issues with the internet connection itself either so I cannot work out what is going
 on. I have tried for days to contact Microsoft to obtain some help but their chat service will never load and neither will anything when I select call back - so I'm stuck for being able to contact them directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions to help I'd really appreciate it as I'm completely at a loss on how to fix this.</p>

<p>Hi Jayne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for letting us know the troubleshooting that you've performed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several reasons why an error occurs while installing Office. This could be caused by system compatibility, corrupted software, and/or virus/malware. If the issue persists after
 completely uninstalling Office, we suggest that you try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check if the computer meets the <a href="https://products.office.com/EN/office-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system requirements</a> to install Office.</li><li><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair Office</a> from the Control Panel.</li><li>Use the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-the-office-2016-offline-installer-f0a85fe7-118f-41cb-a791-d59cef96ad1c#OfficePlans=signinmsa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Offline installer</a>. This may help bypass potential proxy, firewall, antivirus, or Internet connection issues that might occur during an Office installation.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update is with the result.</p>

<p>365 installs in parallel with 2010, the fact that 2010 is still installed is of no consequence.</p>
<p>You don't mention what win version you are using, but if Office 2010 'stopped working' then there is a fundamental issue with your system and buying a new Office version is not going to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>The error msg you are seeing is usually caused by insufficient disk space, what size is C:\ and how much free space do you have on your unknown win version?</p>

<p>Apologies, the laptop is running Windows 7. Unfortunately insufficient disk space shouldn't be a problem as the C:\ drive is saying there is 521GB free of a total 681GB.</p>

<p>Unfortunately these have not worked so far. It definitely meets the system requirements as have had Office loaded before, and now there is no Office in the control panel to fix. I think I have tried the offline installer, but I shall try again, thanks for
 the recommendation!</p>

<p>I have just tried the offline installer again and have been reminded of the issue I had. The offline installer will say it has downloaded successfully, opens a program called 'nero' which tries to burn something to a disk. I assume this is to create the
 virtual disk but&nbsp;won't allow me to change to this option and when I try pressing the next button it obviously prompts me to insert a disk which isn't what I want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at this page (<a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/office-365/87770/office-365-tip-use-office-2016-offline-installer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/office-365/87770/office-365-tip-use-office-2016-offline-installer</a>) to get some tips
 and it says "On Windows, the offline installer is a single disk image (.IMG) file. Just double-click it to add this virtual disk to File Explorer." I cannot find this 'image file' located anywhere, it isn't even appearing in the downloads folder.</p>

<p>I'm running an Exchange 2010 SP3 hybrid deployment. My mailbox was migrated to Office 365.&nbsp;On my device, when I go to send an email, it can only find other O365 mailboxes, or recent people that I had emailed prior to being migrated.</p>
<p>I thought it was Unified GAL? Why can I not see any On-Premise users?</p>

<p>Hi casarray,<br />
<br />
Yes, a unified GAL should be available for an Exchange hybrid deployment. Since you noticed this issue on your mobile device (if I understand it correctly), can you please check if it can be reproduced on
<strong>Outlook Web App</strong> or <strong>Outlook desktop client</strong>?<br />
<br />
Also, please let me know if the issue occurs to other Office 365 cloud users in your hybrid deployment.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Allen</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yes, if I log onto Outlook Web App, I can search the directory without an issue. The issue is only on mobile clients. I'm not the only one with the issue though, everyone who has been migrated has the issue, regardless of type of device</p>

<p>I think I may have figured it out. When I setup ActiveSync on my phone, I choose not to turn on contacts. I don't want my personal contacts syncing to my work email. The devices are mostly iPhones</p>

<p>Hi Donny,</p>
<p>I suggest you update the Outlook for Mac version to 15.16.0 or higher to see if it works.

<h2>            Importing Data from another excel file</h2>
                    <p>I would like to be able to import the values into a different worksheets on the file. Ideally, the macro would open up the open file window and then copy over the values from the selected document into the workbook without deleting the macro button. Is this
 possible?<br />
</p>

            Rather than a macro, another feature you can look in to is "Get &amp; Transform (2016)" or "PowerQuery" (2013).
<br />
<br />This feature allows you to manipulate data. The feature records the manipulations and applies them when you upload additional data.
<br />
<br />Here are some links about the feature
<br />
<br />@ Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016 Intro -   <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-Transform-in-Excel-2016-881c63c6-37c5-4ca2-b616-59e18d75b4de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-Tr...</a> 
<br />Excel 2016 includes a powerful new set of features called Get &amp; Transform, which provides fast, easy data gathering and shaping capabilities. Get &amp; Transform enables you to connect, combine, and refine data sources to meet your analysis needs. These features are also used in Power BI, and in the Power Query Add-In available for previous versions of Excel. Links to more info about using the feature.

<br />@ Get &amp; Transform- Pivotal Advance Boosts Excel’s Power – PowerPivot Enhances PivotTable  <a href="http://www.excel-university.com/articles/journal-of-acct/pivotal-advance-boosts-excels-power/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.excel-university.com/articles/journa...</a> 
<br />September 2011 	Jeff Lenning
<br />In today’s accounting world, financial and operational data typically is stored in a variety of programs and formats. When accountants need to prepare a report based on data from various systems, the first step is to export the data into Excel. Typically, it is fairly easy to export the required data into Excel. But, depending on the structure or format of the data, or if multiple data tables need to be combined, it is not always easy to summarize the data in a single report.
<br />That’s where a new Excel tool called PowerPivot comes into play. PowerPivot is a free plug-in from Microsoft that boosts the capabilities of the already popular PivotTable function, allowing you to create previously impossible PivotTables that enhance Excel’s efficiency and effectiveness.  
<br />
<br />@ Getting Started with Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016 <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Getting-Started-with-Get-Transform-in-Excel-2016-a8310388-2a12-438c-9d29-c6d29cb8df6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Gettin...</a> 
<br />With Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016, you can search for data sources, make connections, and then shape that data (for example remove a column, change a data type, or merge tables) in ways that meet your needs. Once you’ve shaped your data, you can share your findings or use your query to create reports. 
<br />
<br />@ Overview of Power Query  <a href="https://www.excelcampus.com/powerquery/power-query-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.excelcampus.com/powerquery/power-qu...</a> 
<br />Heard of Power Query but not sure what it is exactly?  This article explains what Power Query is all about along with some of my favorite features.
<br />
<br />@ Power Query 101 <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Power-Query-101-008b3f46-5b14-4f8b-9a07-d3da689091b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Power-...</a> 
<br />In this tutorial, you create a query that imports data from a web page. As part of this process, you navigate across tables available on a web page, and apply data transform steps to bring the table into a new shape.

<br />It was great to see the excitement around Power Query and PowerPivot, but this meant there were lots of questions about these tools, so I’ll attempt to answer them here.

            Yes, as I said they are only retained if Word shuts down abnormally.&nbsp; Pull the plug out of the wall or hold down the power button until the computer shuts down without first closing Word.&nbsp; Then when you re-start the computer and Word, you should find an
 asd file.

            <p>Word 2013 and Word 2010 do retain the last auto-saved file (*.asd) for each unnamed document that has not been saved since the last time AutoRecover data was saved, assuming that "Keep the last autosaved version if I close without saving." Look at File tab
 | Info | Manage Versions | Recover Unsaved Documents. However, I would never depend on this feature. A good tip is to save with Ctrl+S as soon as you pause typing.</p>

<h3> hartful  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I enlarge the icons on my toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    I now use Mozilla Firefox because MS hasn't created IE9 for XP Pro X64 and I was left out in the cold on a number of websites.<br />
<br />
The problem that I'm having is the small size of the icons on my bookmark favorites bar at the top of the Firefox window.&nbsp; Is there a way to make them larger?&nbsp; I unchecked "use small icons" but the size has remained the same.&nbsp; All texts sizes are fine.&nbsp; I want
 to just enlarge the icons a bit.<br />
<br />
When I accessed Firefox help, it said that the icons are under MS control.<br />

<p>It looks like you need to know how to enlarge the icons on bookmark favorites bar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are CSS codes to customize firefox settings, I would suggest you to post the question in Mozilla support for further assistance.

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how to sync data from SharePoint Online to OneDrive. Do you mean
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-sharepoint-files-with-the-onedrive-for-business-sync-client-groove-exe-59b1de2b-519e-4d3a-8f45-51647cf291cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Syncing SharePoint files with the OneDrive for Business sync client</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although OneDrive for Business and SharePoint online are cloud service, they are designed for storing different data. You can get details from
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/should-i-save-my-documents-to-onedrive-for-business-or-a-team-site-d18d21a0-1f9f-4f6c-ac45-d52afa0a4a2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use sync client to sync your SharePoint files locally,<span>&nbsp;
</span>the column you create online won't show in your sync folder,<span>&nbsp;
</span>but you can customize more column to organize your files like you manage your local file normally.</p>

<p>Hello </p>
<p>world</p>
<p>foo</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want&nbsp; to import into a table with four fields such as</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text data should go into &nbsp;Field2. When i try to import by using a variety of settings in the import window, advanced settings, fixed field width, delimited fields etc...&nbsp;I always get some version of "failed to import data" or "unable to append"&nbsp;&nbsp;due

<p>How to specify the import data settings to do this .</p>
<p>*** ALSO ***</p>
<p>Where do i find the list of&nbsp;field delimiter (special character) definitions&nbsp; eg. {tab}, {space} , {none} etc....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for any helpful replies.</p>

<p>P.S. Again the disapointment at microsoft "improved" products is disheartening to say the least.</p>
<p>I do not use that often but&nbsp;MS office products &nbsp;sure seemed alot easier and intuitive durring MS heyday in the early 2000's</p>

            <p>Short answer, you cannot do it.&nbsp; Append function adds more records, not fill a column (field).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would need to import the data and then update the field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there is a big problem with this because Access stores records like a barrel of bricks. Access will not know which record to put the imported data.&nbsp; If you do not care which record gets the data then add an autonumber to the imported data and join the
 autonumber fields in the update query.</p>

<div>If you are experiencing <i>key violations</i>&nbsp;on a <i>Primary key</i>, then you may be attempting to import duplicate values.</div>

<p>Where do i find the list of&nbsp;field delimiter (special character) definitions&nbsp; eg. {tab}, {space} , {none} etc.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;i need {paragraph} or {CR LF} or {^M ^J}&nbsp;but i can not find the codes Office understands.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<div>
<p>These <i>special characters</i>&nbsp;seem pretty universal through the Office applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ^p represents a&nbsp;<em>hard return, paragraph break,</em>&nbsp;<em>¶, CRLF, CHAR(13)&amp;CHAR(10)</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&lt;enter&gt;</em>.</li><li>The ^l represents&nbsp; a&nbsp;<em>soft&nbsp;return, line feed, ↵, LF, CHAR(10)</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>&lt;shift&gt;+&lt;enter&gt;</em>.</li><li>The ^m is a&nbsp;<em>manual page break</em>&nbsp;and is largely unrelated to the ^p and ^l. ^M was used as a
<i>CR</i>&nbsp;character in UNIX and Macintosh.</li></ul>

            <p>That is what i am trying to do, add / append &nbsp;more records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The table happens to be empty.</p>
<p>I only have the data for Field2 in my text file. One data item per line.</p>
<p>I am trying to convince Access&nbsp;to add&nbsp;one new record and populate the Field2 of each new/appended record with the one&nbsp;word from each&nbsp;&nbsp;line in the &nbsp;text (.txt) file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe that such a mundane and simplistic task would be so difficult for such a powerful tool&nbsp;as MS Office Access 10 .</p>

            If the text file will not import into <i>Field2</i>, it is almost assuredly one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;following:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Duplicate entry in text file which cannot be used in a <i>Primary Key</i>&nbsp;field which has a constraint of
<i>Indexed: Yes (No Duplicates)</i>. This would also include two or more <i>blank lines</i>. It would also include an entry that pre-exists in
<i>Field2</i>.</li><li>One or more blank entries in the text file that conflict with a <i>Primary Key</i>&nbsp;constraint of
<i>Allow Zero Length: No</i>.</li><li>Field3 and/or Field4 having a constraint of <i>Required: Yes, Allow Zero Length: No</i>&nbsp;and/or
<i>Indexed:&nbsp;</i><i>Yes (No Duplicates)</i>.</li></ul>
<div><br />
So the problem could be in either <i>Field2</i>&nbsp;or one or both of <i>Field3</i>&nbsp;and
<i>Field4</i>. Remember that by appending values into <i>Field2</i>&nbsp;you are essentially automatically creating
<i>Null</i>&nbsp;or <i>blank</i>&nbsp;values in <i>Field3</i>&nbsp;and <i>Field4</i>. <i>Field1</i>&nbsp;should not be an issue as the
<i>Autonum</i> will fill as necessary.</div>

<p>My Access table is empty. </p>
<p>I am only trying to populate or&nbsp;append to the empty table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a rather mundane task, yet i can not convince MS Access 10 of what i want to do.</p>
<p>That is...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read one line from the text file (which contains one word per line), &nbsp;append a new record to the table with the&nbsp;word in Field2, continue &nbsp;until all lines are read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the refresher-lesson in special characters but how do you type&nbsp; {<em>¶ } or {CRLF} or {enter} or {paragraph} in teh Access text import&nbsp;popup&nbsp; ? Or more importantly what is the list of valid {$} expressions ?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those codes may be universal but i can't seem to locate them in the Office Access help ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nor did &nbsp;Office help&nbsp; find any useful hits on searches for&nbsp;field/text/import data delimiters ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a search on {tab},&nbsp;{space}, delimiter , you will not find any reference or mention of these universal codes yet the terminology and those constructs are in the import text data popup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for trying to help solve my data import issue.</p>

            If you have a file that is a list of words one to each line. Then you cannot use the automated import routines since there is no paragraph delimiter. You can try opening the file in Word where you can convert a text list to a table using paragraph as a
 delimiter. But where does the record end?<br />
<br />
You can write a VBA import routine to import the text file one line at a time then append it to a table.<br />

            Can you post sample data from the text file?&nbsp; Post at least the data that would become two Access records.

            So the developers added on a feature to this version that is completely useless, however useful features like sorting by online contacts vs those offline are ignored.&nbsp;

<p>Currently, the option to sort contacts who are online is still not available in Skype for Windows 10. Rest assured we will take note of your feedback and send it to our developers. This will help us improve our services and engineering.</p>

I deleted contacts by mistake and need to restore them.&nbsp; I routinely sync with PC and the contacts are on the PC.&nbsp; If I run an active sync won't it delete the contacts on the PC thinking I wanted them gone since I deleted them.&nbsp; I want to do a one-way sync
 from PC to phone.&nbsp; I don't see settings for this.&nbsp; What do I do?

            Delete your existing ActiveSync partnership and then set it up again.&nbsp; When you sync with a new partnership, the computer will not delete any of your contacts and you can sync all the contacts from your computer to your Omnia

<p>Hi EdVester,</p>
<p>Normally, if we drag a file from browser then drop it to Outlook, it would download the file in the mail as an attachment and also create a url shortcut of the file location in the mail as an attachment too.</p>
<p>To investigate the issue, I'd like to collect some information:<br />
1. Can you drag and drop files&nbsp;to the&nbsp;Outlook client as attachments before? <br />
2. Do you refer to Office documents or other file types? <br />
3. Does it happen to other PCs&nbsp;using&nbsp;IE?<br />
4. The detailed version of your Outlook client and IE, and your OS.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jim</p>

<p>hi edvester,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>to troubleshot the issue, could you try the following steps to see if there is any improvement?</p>
<p>1. add the sharepoint site into trust sites zone in the internet explorer browser via<strong> internet options &gt; trusted sites &gt; sites</strong> as below:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14fc677b-b113-4869-8884-24038fc217fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14fc677b-b113-4869-8884-24038fc217fb" /></a><br />
2. enable <strong>sharepoint dragdownload control</strong> and <strong>sharepoint opendocuments class</strong> add-ons via
<strong>internet options &gt; programs &gt; manage add-ons &gt; sharepoint dragdownload control &gt; enable</strong>.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8942a81-6ceb-49c2-bf80-cd7340e8d0d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8942a81-6ceb-49c2-bf80-cd7340e8d0d6" /></a><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f714204b-eff3-4516-b46d-75f8c65c6875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f714204b-eff3-4516-b46d-75f8c65c6875" /></a><br />
3. clean the browser cache via<strong> internet options &gt; browsing history &gt; delete</strong>. please
<strong>note</strong> that we need to back up the data before clearing up the cache.
<br />
4. close the internet explorer browser and restart it. then go to the document library.<br />
5. drag and drop a document into the central option in the whole email instead of the place of cursor.</p>
<p>during my test, i noticed that, if we drag and drop the file into the cursor, we only get a link. if we drag and drop a file into the center of email or the blank space, we will get an attachment. therefore, could you try it to see if this is your situation
 on your side?</p>
<p>if the issue persists or anything is misunderstood, please let us know and we will continue to discuss the situation based on the update.</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>Hi EdVester,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>To troubleshot the issue, could you confirm the following details?</p>
<p>1. Can you add an attachment via dragging and dropping the file icon instead of the file title?
<br />
2. Can you drag and drop a file in a local folder to the email as an attachment? <br />
3. Does the issue occur on other site collections? <br />
4. May I know if you are using Windows 10?</p>
<p>In addition, to analyze the cause, could you send us some related logs? To collect the logs, I have created a workspace, you can access it via private message.<br />

<p>Hi EdVester,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing those logs with us, we will look into it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to better clarify the issue, could you please share the following information with us:<br />
1.A screenshot of the email which encounter this issue.<br />
2.Since other PCs are working fine, it seems this issue is related to the PC client. In this case, please try to set up a new computer login account and try drag and drop files in SharePoint to Outlook to check whether the issue persists.<br />
3.Are the Office 365 account which you used for configuring Outlook same with the one you used for logging in to SharePoint?<br />
4.Some tenant information. To protect your privacy, I’ve send you a private message to request it. You can reply the private message via
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Fraser</p>

<h2>            calling</h2>
                    How do I make the Skype video call continue for as long as I want until I manually stop the call? As things stand now, the call ceases after a few rings if the called party doesn't answer.
