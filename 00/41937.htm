<h2>            Xbox One in Lithuania</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am a Spanish Transport Pilot and I will be moving to Lithuania.</p>

<p>initially that country does not have XBOX Live support.</p>

<p>May I still be able to play online?</p>

<p>In that case, how can I do it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You will be able &nbsp;to use Xbox live. It doesn't matter where you use it. As long as the account is from a country that supports xbox live. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically you can even use Xbox live on the moon if you had internet.</p>

    <title>Product Key accidently used for two PC installs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drdigit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product Key accidently used for two PC installs.</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 Pro successfully from purchased disk on one PC.&nbsp; Without realizing the key was good for only one install, I installed it on a second PC using the same Product Key and disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; The license key was accepted and the install completed and
 seems to work fine.&nbsp; I am now getting an occasional error message saying that the product key I used has been used on another PC.&nbsp; When I dismiss the message, Windows 8 seems to continue to work well.</p>
<p>I thought that the installation would have stopped as soon as I entered that key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can I expect, if I keep using that PC with its current Win 8 installation as is?&nbsp; I am losing some of the functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I do purchase an additional license key, can I just enter it at the error message without reinstalling everything?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an upgrade from Windows 7, if that makes any difference.</p>

            <p><span>Hi drdigit,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows 8 Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that you have installed Windows 8 on two computers with a single product key and it goes to some reduced functionality. Do not worry; I am here to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One Windows 8 license allows just one installation and activation on one computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is spelled out completely in the Microsoft Software License Agreement you apparently agreed to when you first install Windows 8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To read the Agreement again, type <b>WINVER</b> in the Search box and press the Enter key located on your keyboard.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then click <b>on Microsoft Software License Terms</b> and read Paragraph 1:<span>&nbsp;
</span><b>Installation and Use Rights.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to purchase a new product key and to reinstall it on the other computer. You need to uninstall the current version of Windows 8 installed on the computer before reinstalling using the new product key.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Make sure you take the backup of all your important data files before performing reinstalling Windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for everyone's help.&nbsp; I phoned MS about the issue.&nbsp; A nice tech told me that I could resolve the situation by buying an additional license key for the cost of the download, since I already owned and paid for the disk version.&nbsp; He asked if I would
 like to be transferred to the sales department.&nbsp; I said yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sales department told me that separate license keys were not for sale at any price.&nbsp; I referred them back to the tech department.&nbsp; I was transferred back and forth a few times and got a supervisor involved too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final word was that separate licenses were not being sold at that time, tough luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved the problem by throwing money at it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though my PC was qualified for the $39 download, it no longer was because the abortive install from the disk wiped out whatever was needed to verify the upgrade price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I threw the extra money at the problem and paid $69 for a $39 dollar install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got some more misinformation about how to fix the situation easily from the locked version the disk installed on the machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, Windows 8 Pro is installed properly and works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have any qualms about paying the asking price for a product.&nbsp; I think the $39 upgrade was an epic fail on Microsoft's part though.&nbsp; I don't believe that I should have been overcharged for the qualifying PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine someone might think that if they paid extra for the disk&nbsp; in the price of the first qualifying machine upgrade, that they could use it and buy the license key for a second QUALIFYING installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I could have taken the time to reinstall the original operating system, searched all over the place and maybe found a driver that would work with the network card in the PC, gotten on the Internet and hoped for the best downloading the $39 dollar install.&nbsp;
 After talking to tech support though, in the event I may have had some problems with the install, I had very little confidence I would have gotten the help I needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do understand that it was a launch of a new operating system. I don't understand why the support and decision making to go the extra step to find a good solution wasn't there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So no, there wasn't a number available to call to buy a second key at any price.&nbsp; You need to do some kind of complete install, most likely the download option.&nbsp; I recommend you just throw money at the problem.&nbsp; That works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I want to thank the people who responded here.</p>

            I purchased a computer, and I want mention the brand, but it crashed and I upgraded to my present computer about a month later. They info from the first was transferred to the new computer and I have had no problems using word until today, however, it
 has been awhile since I wanted or needed to use it, so this problem may have existed for a couple of weeks or so. In any event the site pops up but I cannot type anything new, but I can access the old. It says that it is locked. Why is this&nbsp;happening now,
 after several months. What can I do to get it unlocked. I haven't been able to find a route to do it. Thanks, H. G. Allen&nbsp;

<p>It won't happen. On January 1st, they removed all avatar gear relating to guns and violent weapons and added a no weapons policy in the avatar rules. So something like that would not appear on the avatar marketplace anymore.</p>

<h2>            0x8007045D Error</h2>
                    Ok so this is my problem I'm&nbsp;running a crossed&nbsp;here. Currently I&nbsp;had just bought a new HDD for my system (Western Digital WD VelociRaptor WD6000HLHKX 600GB 10,000RPM Bare Drive) for my everyday use of my system. The issues&nbsp;that I&nbsp;always keep running into
 is upon the fresh install of Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit. Right after it completes&nbsp;Copying Windows files,
<u>Expanding Windows files</u> it never gets past 1% and gives me the error message:
<b>Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007045D.
</b>Now before I&nbsp;do anything else or, decide to send the drive back to newegg.com for either a refund, or replacement, anyone have suggestions on what I&nbsp;could&nbsp;do or what exactly&nbsp;is going on with this?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked up some info about this and every place gives different problems (HDD is bad, media is bad, ect)&nbsp;so it's entirely&nbsp;unknown at this time what is causing this.&nbsp;<br />

            Also if this might help on the matter. I though about using a Windows XP disk to format the drive to NTFS format and then install, or upgrade to Windows 7 Pro that way. Well in doing so, the boot process in doing so on the XP disk caused my system to BSOD.
 So i'm not sure if it's something on my system causing this, or if the drive is faulty.

            <p>Generally a drive comes already formatted and ready to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you start the install with the Windows 7 disk, have tried letting Windows 7 format the drive? It sounds like you've got an XP disk, have you run "chkdsk.exe" on the drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's very possible it's a defective drive.</p>

<br />
That has no relevance, the BIOS would see a "fat32" or a "NTFS" and doesn't have the option to change it in the BIOS.

            <p>When i bough the HDD from newegg.com it was bare. So of course i went about and formatted the drive upon the pre-install of Windows 7 Pro 64-Bit. The thing is that, i've attempted to do a re-install again and again and now, i'm getting some headway here.
 The expanding Windows file is ACTUALLY installing, (up to 87%) but it still did the error last time i checked. So i'm not sure what the deal is here but i will keep you posted.</p>

            Ok so update: the OS fully installed on the HDD! Right now it's preparing the system for the first time, so as i said from before, i don't know what's going on here or if this drive has a mind of its own lol.

            <p>If you get Windows installed, I would check the drive for errors with Windows 7 built in tools&nbsp;before you spend a lot of time installing programs. In fact I would do it before you activate Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how the drive performs, I've been thinking about going the raptor route instead of ssd? All my experience index scores are maxxed out except for the 5.9 I get for the hard drive.</p>

            Sorry for the lengthy delay here. Right after i wrote the last post i had to head off to work. So anyway, the drive reads fine after the Western Digital Data LifeGuard finished its full scan. So i'm not sure what exactly was causing it to not&nbsp;install Windows
 on my system. Strange i say but, yet again that's the thing about this stuff. You never know how its going to turn out overall!&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Defender won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dodgethis57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>Although I repeatedly said no the "update to windows 10" notifications that I received in my taskbar, I walked in my office last night to find that it was 80% through the installation, so I had no choice in the matter and decided to hope for&nbsp;the best. &nbsp;I
 had chosen NOT to install it as I have a Dell Inspiron 580 which showed up on the Dell site as having not been tested for compatibility with Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the weather tile won't work &amp; I get a white screen when I click on the store, those are minor issued I could live with. &nbsp;However, I do need to have security software. &nbsp;After the installation of Windows 10, &nbsp;the notification section said Windows
 Defender had been installed, however, the Security &amp; Maintenance page said Windows Defender was off. &nbsp;When I opened the Windows Defender settings they were all grayed out. &nbsp;In searching the community I found that Windows Defender would not run if there was
 any other anti-virus/malware software running. &nbsp;I did have the free version of Iobit Malware 4.0 . &nbsp;This was &nbsp;on my computer when it was running Windows 7 Home Premium while Microsoft Security Essentials was running without any problems. &nbsp;I uninstalled the
 Iobit&nbsp; &amp; restarted the computer. &nbsp;The security page then said both Windows Defender &amp; Iobit were off. &nbsp;When I clicked to turn on Defender absolutely NOTHING &nbsp;happened. &nbsp;When I tried to go to the settingS I could no longer bring them up. &nbsp;I just got a box that
 said the app had been turned off and to turn it on in Security &amp; Maintenance, which is how I got to that box in the first place. As an experiment, &nbsp;I started up the Iobit malware Fighter (I don't think it was actually uninstalled as it started right up without
 my having to download it again - it is part of a suite of Avangate programs in Advanced system Care 9 ) and after that, although &nbsp;the Security Page still shows that both Windows Defender &amp; Iobit are off, I could again at least get to the Windows Defender settingS
 page, where everything is again greyed out. &nbsp;Although the Security &amp; Maintenance page
<em>still</em> says BOTH Defender &amp; Iobit are off, I am currently running a scan with Iobit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess Iobit is working even though the Security Page says it is off, but is there any way I can get rid of it and run Defender? &nbsp;Do all the Avangate programs have to be uninstalled to make Defender work? &nbsp;It seems like this is a problem for many people
 so may I should just stick with the Iobit Malware or go back to Windows 7? &nbsp;Incredibly frustrating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            To add some clarification, the model S2319H has a built-in speaker.  Model S2319NX does not.  Your S2319NX has audio in and out ports, but does not have speakers built in.  On your model, the audio line in port would allow you to plug speakers into your monitor's audio line out port.  You would need to run a speaker wire from the computer to the monitor first though.

    <title>Network drives don&#39;t reconnect on Windows 10 boot up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strinjf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network drives don&#39;t reconnect on Windows 10 boot up</h2>
                    <p>I have two NAS drives mapped as X: and Y: drives on my Win 10 laptop. &nbsp;These always re-connected on boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently replaced the hard drive with an SSD and did a fresh install of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I boot, the network drives do not reconnect. &nbsp;I get the pop up (bottom right corner of the screen on boot with the yellow warning triangle) with the message "Could not reconnect all network drives. Click here to check the status of your network
 drives. &nbsp;Windows Explorer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drives appear mapped, but with a red cross on their icon. &nbsp;Attempting to access them gives the message: "Restoring network connections. &nbsp;An error occurred while reconnecting X: to \\192.168.0.3\Shared-files. &nbsp;Microsoft Windows Network: A specified logon
 session does not exist. It may already have been terminated. &nbsp;This connection has not been restored."</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, I have written a small command file to drop and re-create the network drive mappings<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>net use x: /d<br />
net use x: \\192.168.0.3\Shared-files /user:***** ******<br />
net use y: /d<br />
net use y: \\192.168.0.2\share /user:***** ******<br />
exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a proper fix for this issue?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can I play online multiplayer with friends on the same console&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying to figure out how to play Battlefront multiplayer with friends on the same console. We both have xbox live gold accounts and either one of us can go on multiplayer alone. I know that in Gears of War 3 you're able to go do online multiplayer
 in splitscreen, so is the process different on the Xbox One?</p>

<p>As long as you have that person bring their account onto your Xbox or just have them sign in as a guest, the game does say it support multiplayer split screen up to four players.</p>

<h2>            Getting the installation files with a product key.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to transfer my copy of windows 7 from one PC to another, but I don't have my installation CD anymore. I used the MagicalJellyBean keyfinder to get my license key, but when I go to http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery to get the .iso
 file, it pops up an error saying:</p>
<p>"Error</p>
<p>We encountered a problem with the validation request.&nbsp; Please assure your product key is for a product supported by this site and was entered correctly, then try your request again"</p>
<p>I had a friend also try with a key he knew should be valid (never used), and he got the same error, could anyone provide insight as to why it's doing this?</p>
<p />

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with game freezing and getting kicked. Have you made sure the controllers are up to date? If using batteries try a brand new set. When you update the controller leave the headset plugged in. Also is your console plugged directly into
 the wall? If not try plugging into the wall outlet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these out and let us know.</p>
<p>

            <p>Ok.. Here goes with specifics to mine, since OP hasn't responded.</p>
<p>When I click on start button a dialogue box saying "Critical Error Your Start menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it next time you sign in" Pops Up.
</p>
<p>Secondly Cortana or any of the new apps don't work. </p>
<p>Also, in the task manager "shellExperiencehost.exe" is not running.&nbsp;I cannot start it, running it as administrator.
</p>
<p>I ran sfc /scannow and no errors were found. </p>
<p>I created another admin account, and by logging in with that account, I am able to get all the new apps, start menu, etc. working. This basically, to me, proves&nbsp;there is nothing wrong with the files or applications or executables. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't help me, because all my settings are under this account that cannot load start menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I fix this particular account? so Windows Shell Experience Host will run? Start Menu will run? New metro apps such as Edge browser and Cortana will work?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you that from using the second administrator account, I found nothing from Windows 10&nbsp;itself is corrupted, everything works and launches properly.
</p>
<p>So I believe this is related to the user account permissions issue with my Microsoft Live account.
</p>
<p>Let me know next steps to fix permissions or how to get this working again.</p>
<p>Dan</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: I tried to convert my Microsoft account to a local account, and it gave an error.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I will certainly help you with the issue you are experiencing with the power settings on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur, if the power settings are corrupt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow below mentioned steps to fix the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Reset and restore the power plans to default&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click “<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>”<strong>,
</strong>and then click on <strong>command prompt</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. In the command prompt, type <strong>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes
</strong>and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Exit command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> This would reset the power plan settings to default. Any previously customized power plans would be removed.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also recommend you to check the battery with other PC and see if it is working. If it does, then this may be issue with the battery.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please get back to us, if you still facing issue

</p><p>If you are ready to use a magnet on the drive, then your best course of action is a re-install of Win7.&nbsp; It almost always results in a dramatic improvement of performance.&nbsp; And, besides depending on how you got rid of Win10, that could be causing problems
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the process I use for my clients' computers:</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Re-install Windows 7 </strong></em>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Fully backup your&nbsp;DATA.</li><li>Use Windows Easy Transfer (built-in) to create a&nbsp;transfer file.&nbsp; Works almost always and reproduces all your settings, backgrounds and most data.</li><li>Use your hard drive manufacturer’s drive tester software to ensure you are working with a good hard drive.&nbsp; If yours is a laptop with a hard drive 5 years or more, just replace the hard drive.</li><li>This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;M
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>When you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>Do NOT install any programs, none</li><li>Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you
 keep updating until you get there.</li><li>Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 working and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter
<strong>Microsoft.com</strong> in the list</li><li>Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type <strong>device</strong> in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get
 drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install
 malware.</li><li>Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type <strong>defragment</strong> in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till it completes all passes..</li><li>Next, you will need to take steps to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; First step is to change the Windows Update setting to NEVER. Second step is to download and install GWX Control Panel.</li><li>Re-install your programs</li><li>Use Windows Easy Transfer and fill in missing data from your backup</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>

</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>This answer was extremely helpful...I'm trying to help my parents with their computers that have windows 7 which they prefer to Windows 10....My dad seems to think they have too much memory used up and it's slowing down the system. If they wanted to purchase
 a new hard drive for HP lap top, prob 7 or 8 years old now, would it be worth it or should they just buy a new machine? If so, can they also load the new computer with Windows 7 only? I don't believe they need to purchase new computers but I'm trying to explore
 all the options.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>
<p>Sherry</p>

<p>I am a retired guy who looks after about 150 Win7 computers.&nbsp; A lot of my clients are folks like yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would definitely replace the disk drive.&nbsp; A laptop with a 7 year or more disk drive has a drive that is either failing or about to do so.&nbsp; Replace it with a 500G
<strong>7200rpm </strong>drive.&nbsp; Cost should be like $70 or so.&nbsp; It is actually quite easy to replace the drive physically speaking.&nbsp; In most cases there is door on the bottom that you remove by removing a few Philips head screws and a little ingenuity.&nbsp; Then
 the drive is held in place with a couple of the same screws.&nbsp; Then the drive itself is held in a carrier of a sort with another few screws.&nbsp; Re-assemble.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember you will need your Win7 Product Key and a Win7 install disk of the&nbsp;correct type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newly re-built PC should perform vastly better!&nbsp; Others may suggest you use an SSD instead of a disk drive.&nbsp; I would not because the age of the machine does not justify that greater expense and I doubt your parents could see the difference in performance
 for the purposes they use the computer for.&nbsp; It is faster, but in real terms the difference is not that perceptible, particularly for the way they likely use their computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>No you cannot buy new Win7 machines any longer and although you may be able to find a new license on ebay or Amazon, you would be violating the warranty terms of the new computer if you installed Win7 over a Win10 computer that was new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the wireless is not working up to par, you can buy a thumb nail sized USB wireless device that is a replacement wireless for about $20.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People commonly confuse the term memory for the disk drive.&nbsp; Right click on the C: drive in Computer to see the pie chart depicting disk space in use.&nbsp; If that number is over 75% in use, your dad may well be correct.&nbsp; Chances are it is a 160G drive and&nbsp;replacing
 with a&nbsp;500G will really fix that, especially if your replace the current 5400rpm drive with a 7200rpm one.</p>

<p>hello, as i have worked myself in i.t. for 20 years i have already tried this as often a cancel and re-enabling is a fix in many systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my account had my 'skype in number' as a second option so i switched to that, saved, logged out, logged in and then changed back to my mobile number and saved, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>no change. just me losing money doing a number of tests to friends mobiles who then reported 'shows skype user name'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not the only person to report this in recent days and it has happened to me before at christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have also tested using web based version and on pc's running win7 / win8 with same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>looking forward to your further support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i received the code from skype and set it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>system says my mobile number would now be my caller id.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sadly this is not the situation and still shows my skype name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i'm nowhere further and still wasting my credit testing it.. so skype profit out of the fault!</p>
<p>
</p><p>when will skype accept there is a problem? and maybe put it on the 'heartbeat' page?</p>

<p>well EXCUSE ME for getting the terminology wrong.. maybe that is why skype took four days to resolve it.. they misunderstood the context of my support request!</p>
<p>
</p><p>so very sorry for saying ID when i should have said it showed my SKYPE NAME when i sent sms messages after showing my mobile phone number for years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>as you are a 'community moderator' i guess you, in your role will know the problem was resolved yesterday? maybe that memo didn't get to you yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh.. and by the way.. during the time the problem existed, the settings on the webpage gave a choice of either my mobile number OR my skype-in number as an option for 'sender id'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh, and once again, the link you sent me originally to set my 'sender id' is well out of date as it shows all settings actioned in the desktop client.. this is not the case and you need to log in to the website and action there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and one more thing.. see attached image and reference to 'Caller ID' and NO MENTION of 'sender id'..... looks like i was actually quoting direct from skype itself!</p>

            Ditto StevoGee. I have had the same problem. I just picked it up early January. I have tried many times to Verify my mobile phone number &amp; tested it &amp; also losing money by doing so. I have sent my disgruntled feedback to Skype asking for real tech support
 &amp; not to ask the community.

<p>hi vicki, i don't want to suggest something that has possibly already been suggested but have you tried logging in to your profile on the skype site and totally removing your mobile number and then log off, then log on again and re-add your mobile, save
 and log out and then wait for the text wit the code and then follow the process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>you may have done this but i've know n this process to work in other systems.</p>
<p>
