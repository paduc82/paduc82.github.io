            Im not sure what the exact problem is but i have a laptop where my webcam was working for dell video chat and not for skype... what i did to solve the problem was i downloaded a driver from dell and bought two years of driver updates from driver detective
 and it solved my problem. Driver detective is only 9.95 for two years of unlimited updates for your driver to keep it up to date.&nbsp; Drivers are specialized pieces of software that allow Windows to communicate with other software programs and hardware. Without
 drivers, hardware you connect to your computer â€“ for example, a video card or a webcam â€“ would not work properly. If this doesnt work i would uninstall the program and reinstall it after you download the driver. hope this helps solve your problem! ps. dell.com
 has the driver download

            Hi Brennan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This likely means there is a corruption in the Settings app or your Windows 10 installation.
<br />
<br />Here are some things you can try....
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />	Click Windows PowerShell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />	At the command prompt, type the following, hit Enter the restart. 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Check your hard disk for any errors:
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.       
        </p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/ab5ad872-dcf5-49c3-b6e2-582a1e98acc7" title="LovreMamuziÄ‡">
<p>
</p><p>I definitely understands how important it is for you to recover the account. However, we do not have an option to recover your account here, this process should be done one your end as you are the only one who knows the information you provided when you
 created the account in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this case, I can only suggest to fill out the recovery form again: <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a></p>
<p>You may refer to the following tips below to help you with answering the form:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi
 or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred. </li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)
 and also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge.
</li><li>You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After answering the form, please expect an email reply within 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<div>The CD plays great in my car but will not load in Windows. I don't get any messages or anything, it just says the drive is empty. I know the drive works because it reads all the other CD's I've tried. What could possibly be wrong? Can you help me fix this?
 It's not my taste in music is it? The drive was able to read other albums by America. It's kind of frustrating.</div>

    <title>Two square bracket keys don&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philippeventura  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two square bracket keys don&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying again to solve this problem which hasn't been resolved.<br />
<br />
My two square bracket keys type two of the same characters every time.&nbsp; Which ever language I use them in or with a different USB keyboard, the problem remains.<br />
<br />
There are 3 places where that act normally: in Safe Mode (not in Clean Reboot), in DOS mode and in Sage's ACT! software.<br />
<br />
This problem started occurring a couple of weeks ago for no apparent reasons (ie no changes, no hardware changes).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've updated the keyboard drivers.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The two keys function perfectly in ENGLISH (US) mode.&nbsp; But in no other modes.&nbsp; I use these keys for French language accents: ^^.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS I use a Dell Vostro 3500 with Win 7<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>If the keyboard keys worked&nbsp; fine a few weeks ago then&nbsp;I would suggest you to perform&nbsp;a System Restore to the date when&nbsp;the keyboard&nbsp;was working correctly and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>System restore in Windows 7</strong>:</span></p>

<div>Have you checked it in&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a>? I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;you give that a try, and see if the keys are working properly or not.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>Some reasons for computer slowness:<br />
<br />
1. Computer hasn't been maintained - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance</a> <br />
<br />
2. Computer is infected with malware - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> </span></p>
<p><span>Note: Running an antivirus (which one?) is insufficient. Follow the steps on each computer carefully, not skipping the preparatory work.<br />
<br />
3. Hard drive is too full. Remove unnecessary stuff, uninstall unused programs. Don't forget to back up!<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up</a><br />
<br />
4. Flaky third-party software. Toolbars and add-ons are particular culprits in this area. Uninstall toolbars (Google, Yahoo, ISP-branded, etc.) and look carefully at what add-ons are in use in your browser(s).<br />
<br />
5. Computer has too many unnecessary programs/processes running in the background. Manage your Startup:<br />
<br />
For XP - How to Troubleshoot By Using the Msconfig Utility in Windows XP - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560</a> <br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx</a> <br />
<br />
For Vista/Windows7 - Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a> is also very useful.<br />
<br />
6. User is running a bloated/invasive antivirus program such as ones from Norton and McAfee. Replace with a better program. I recommend either NOD32 (commercial) or Avast (free). Avira is also good but the free version has an unpleasant nag screen (Google for
 instructions as to how to disable this). User may also be running more than one real-time antivirus/firewall/security program.<br />
<br />
7. User has installed new programs that are processor and/or memory-intensive (Photoshop, AutoCAD, Mathmatica or the like) and doesn't have the necessary hardware power.<br />
<br />
8. Hard drive is failing and is in PIO Mode. This is very dramatically slow (like being back in 1985). See Hans-Georg Michna's information here -<a href="http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10</a>

            Hello, how are you, I send this information to you, I hope it helps you
<br />
<br />Many Internet Web sites contain JavaScript, a scripting programming language that runs on the web browser to make specific features on the web page functional. If said program has been disabled within your browser, the content or the functionality of the web page can be limited or unavailable. 
<br />
<br />To allow all websites within the Internet zone to run scripts within Microsoft Edge, you'd need to enable Javascript through the Windows Group Policy Editor, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Click on the Start menu, type Edit group policy and select top most result to launch.
<br />2. Expand the User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components folder.
<br />3. Expand the Microsoft Edge folder.
<br />4. Double-click Allows you to run scripts, like Javascript.
<br />5. Choose Enable and click OK to confirm.
<br />
<br />Note: The following instructions will not work in the Home or Starter editions of Windows; Group Policy Editor is not available in these editions.

            hello how are you, thank you for responding and be aware of the indications to solve the problem, if it is enabled it could be a registry error uninstall and install the IE again and it's good that you want to try Chrome since you have other possibilities and get what you want
<br />
<br />Glad to help

<h2>            Permanently deleted files Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have deleted files and folders permanently in windows 7, checked the recycle bin and its empty but if I type the file or folder name in the windows search bar it finds them again. I have some old Outlook notes with passwords that I want permanently
 removed but windows 7 does not seem to allow me to do this? I have checked some of the similar posts which recommend downloading disk wiping tools but surely windows must have some way of allowing you remove these files permanently?</p>

            <p><span>Thank you for your replies. It seems I was not waiting long enough for windows 7 to remove the permanently deleted files. I was permanently deleting the files and then searching
 and finding them still active on my system and I could still open them as well. So I thought they were still being retained by windows. However as you said, the next day when I searched I could again find the deleted files but this time I could no longer open
 them. I had run disk cleanup earlier but the files still appeared to be on my PC.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue has been resolved and again thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Migrate KMS host Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm planning KMS migration on Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2012 R2</p>
<p>for Windows 10 KMS activation without service suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These 5 steps are right?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Set up Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>
<p>2. Add a role of Volume License Service on Windows Server 2012 R2.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Activate as KMS host, Install license related files(*1), Add SRV record in DNS</p>
<p>3. Verify new KMS host ( Windows Server 2012 R2 ) starts License activation from KMS client.</p>
<p>4. Delete SRV record old KMS host in DNS.</p>
<p>5. Change old KMS host ( Windows Server 2008 R2 ) to KMS client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1*)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that correct to copy 2 directories below to new KMS host, and "slmgr.vbx /rilc".</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, below is the system requirement for Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your PC meets the system requirement, I would suggest you to upgrade to Windows 10 using an ISO file by following the instructions given by Andre Da Costa on

HAVE to save your pictures, documents and other personal stuff on extern harddisk and USB-stick!!! This is VERY IMPORTANT!!!</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>IF you upgrade, or buy a new PC with Windows 10 inside, you just need to back up your stuff, before running Windows Update. Some of the updates are rathere UPGRADES, than normal Windows-updates, so you CAN loose your stuff again. This, many users ALSO experiences!</p>

</p><p>When uninstalling an update, you check for updates again, and will get it RIGHT back! Rightclick on it, and click on Hide Update, so it can collect dust in the "Quarentine"!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when changing these settings, you have to check for updates manually, and keep an eye on the KB-numbers, so you don't accidently install them again...</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft doesn't do BIOS updates except for its own computers. Same for drivers, they all have to come from either HP or nVidia. It doesn't make any difference that HP owns Compaq. The main consideration is that your computer hardware is already old (XP
 era) so&nbsp;you shouldn't expect that there will ever be any&nbsp;more BIOS updates, or drivers from HP for any OS that HP does not support using on that computer.&nbsp;It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;the same for any other computer brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last OS supported by nVidia&nbsp;for your chipset and graphics combination was Windows 7. If the computer will work at all in Windows 10 it will most likely be using legacy drivers that would be installed by Windows 10, if there are any. I tried installing
 Windows 10 on a similar HP computer. Unfortunately shortly after starting, the installation rolled back because of an incompatible add-in graphics card that is installed in place of the on-board graphics so I can't confirm for certain whether Win10 will work
 or not&nbsp;on the stock configuration.</p>

<h2>            Install Windows 7 from Get genuine online kit</h2>
                    I have purchased a Windows 7 Home Premium get genuine online kit because I thought my present windows xp was not legitimate having had activation problems, however since ordering this software from Microsoft I resolved the activation issues as it transpired
 my copy of xp is legit. I still wish to upgrade because support for xp has been withdrawn. My question is, can I still install Windows 7 from this Disc or do I change it for the standard upgrade and are there any issues I should be aware of.<br />
<br />
Many thanks from not very savy user! Mike<br />

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hello,<br />
Thank you for your response. After further searching I have found the solution from this website: http://www.walkernews.net/2012/10/20/how-to-fix-windows-8-comdlg32-ocx-file-missing-error/#comment-18336.
<br />
To make the 32bit software usable, the visual basic 6 files needed to be copied to windows 8 and registered into the correct folder which is not windows\system32 but windows\system or Windows\SysWOW64.<br />

            <p>Hi Stan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that when you download the ISO file for Windows 10 the initial file is compressed to a file size of 3 - 4 Gb. After the download,&nbsp;when you&nbsp;install the file with expand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you refer to the post by Andre Da Costa and&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (Windows &amp; Devices for IT Pro MS -MVP)">ZigZag3143 (Windows

<h2>            Microsoft employee training program</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a student at University of Maine at Farmington, and I am doing a paper on Microsoft's training programs. I was wondering if anyone could give me information on what kinds of training occurs, how long the training program is, and how it's presented?
 Is there a trainer for the training? Does it involve e-learnings, videos, discussions, reading, interactive videos, seminars, webinars, paid or unpaid, in house or does someone come in from outside the company to train? How is it evaluated?</p>
<p>

            Hi Audrey,
<br />as far as I know Microsoft dos not disclose such information.
<br />Nevertheless you may send your question in paper e-mail to Microsoft.  May be you'll be lucky.
