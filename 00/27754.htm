    <title>Malicious, Known Hacker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuckerzr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Malicious, Known Hacker</h2>
                    I have spent the past week researching through support topics regarding "hacked" accounts, "blocked", etc. to trying to resolve my particular issue on my own but I have not had any luck.. Here is a breakdown of my issue: I recently discovered someone had
 been (sneakily) using my email account; sending messages, creating character damaging Ads/profiles, etc. It was only accidentally discovered because this person had previously been deleting the emails (in my account) and I luckily saw one of the emails before
 it was deleted. However this email is not with Microsoft it is with another provider and once emails are deleted it is "forever" so I had little luck in solving the issue.. The only possible solution to find this person was to start back-tracking... As this
 is the THIRD time I have been "hacked" when I have tried very hard to be secure. The two previous times I was "hacked" out of my account was with Microsoft (Hotmail). When these two hotmail emails were hacked and I was unable to get back into my account I
 simply made another one (as is suggested when you can not fill out the verification forms correctly). I assumed it was a random hacking/malware problem and I let it go.... Now that I have discovered this malicious activity I have begun to really investigate...which
 brought me back to my most recent Hotmail email that was hacked almost two years ago: I attempted to log in. The screen said: "it appears someone else may be using your account" and brings me to the security page where I can choose the alternate email address
 or answer my secret question. The alternate email address shows the first two letters followed by stars... those first to letters are my EX-spouse's. I know knew who the hacker was!! (As I opened that particular email after our separation years ago) there's
 no way she would be listed. I tried my security question but it must have been changed (go figure). Now that I know who hacked my last account I'm quiet certain she is the one who hacked both my email address before and after that as well. The problem here
 is she has been maliciously pretending to be me and I have no idea what she used my hotmail account for because I can't get back in! I CAN log in and be shown as logged in but I'm re-routed to fill out a verification form for an email I used two years ago
 to "confirm" its me.. which I have continuously failed. I have contacted Microsoft support twice now. The first time on January 2nd, 2014 where I was suppose to receive a response in "24 hours" and received none.. I have sent in another but I am not hopeful
 I will get a response which has led me here for help.... I can prove beyond any doubt this is my account. I need it back. I could not get back in before and simply started a new email as your company (Microsoft) suggests to do... Yet, The hacker continued
 to use my account... I need this malicious activity to be stopped, she may not of used the Hotmail the way she did my current email by posting things but even so, if i can get back in and print the page that shows her email was the one who hacked mine I can
 use this in court... I'd appreciate some help as I've said I've exhausted all other options. I am ready/willing to provide ANY proof needed to show who I am and who my Ex's name is to regain access to my Hotmail. Thank you for any responses.

            I have been waiting on a response from Microsoft since January 2nd. Do they not answer support requests? And if not, why have a place to contact them for support at all?<br />
<br />
If this is the norm from Microsoft, how do I resolve this? Should I stop wasting my time waiting and go through a legal way? If so.... any advice on how this can be done?<br />

            <p>It's hard to say whether or not what you've experienced with the Microsoft support website is the norm.&nbsp; Judging from postings here, it appears it may be, but then people who find themselves helped and satisfied usually don't post about it; only those receiving
 little assistance do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For a long time, Microsoft's approach to Hotmail security was extremely weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;The extra measures such as two-step verification are fairly recent.&nbsp; Even still, it seems that Hotmail/Outlook.com accunts remain pregnable more than I would expect.&nbsp; However,
 I've had my account for close to twelve years and I've never been secretive about it.&nbsp; Yet in all that time, I've never been hacked.&nbsp; Go figure.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's a free service and worth every penny you spend on it.&nbsp; There are so many similar services, the effort to get help with Outlook.com may not be worth the benefit.&nbsp; It may be better to close the account and switch to another service in cases such as yours.</p>

<h2>            List numbers disappearing</h2>
                    I have had a consistent problem with numbered lists in Word 2010.&nbsp; When I copy text from another part of the document (sometimes from another numbered item, sometimes from a regular paragraph)&nbsp;and paste it to the end of an existing&nbsp;numbered list&nbsp;item,
 the number completely disappears.&nbsp; When I push the numbering button it does not come back.&nbsp; If I try to backspace it into the previous listed item to get the numbering going again, the previous number disappears too.&nbsp; I have resorted to some other creative
 cut and paste work arounds but am sick of it.&nbsp; Help!!

            You may be also pasting the formatting from the copied text into the list. When Pasting use the second option "Merge Formatting" instead of the first "Keep Source Formatting" and see if that works.

            <p>Hi Janet,<br />
<br />
Deleted items or old items stay on your email for 30 days. If it is more than 30 days, it will automatically be deleted. You can still recover deleted or old items within 14 days. If it passed more than the said days, then it will be permanently deleted.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to help resolve your concern, you may configure your email account to not empty the deleted items folder when you sign out to do this in Outlook.com, follow this steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Outlook.com.<br />
</li><li>Click on the <strong>gear icon</strong> and choose <strong>Options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Message options</strong>, uncheck <strong>Empty the Deleted Items folder when I sign out</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If you are using an Outlook application, you may refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/empty-the-deleted-items-folder-9196f9a0-7c10-4802-9afa-269a7dcfd11f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            As per your concern, emails that are older than 30 days will be automatically deleted. To prevent this from happening, we suggest that you set up AutoArchive to your emails. This will set old items you want to save in the Archive folder.<br />
<br />
To set up AutoArchive, you may refer to the steps on this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Archive-older-items-automatically-25F44F07-9B80-4107-841C-41DC38296667" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Outlook 2016 and Outlook.com are two completely different things. This forum is for Outlook.com, not Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 has no mechanism (except AutoArchive) for removing messages from the Sent Items folder. What I suspect is one of two things: 1) you are using a view that limits the date range of items you see; they are still in the folder, but the view hides
 them. 2) You are using an IMAP or Exchange account and your Sync Slider is set to the default of 30 days.</p>

    <title>Converting Word .docs to Publisher .pubs formatting issues &#40;Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crackahjackk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Word .docs to Publisher .pubs formatting issues &#40;Office 2013&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am trying to convert word documents to publisher documents for a non-profit I'm volunteering for. Unfortunately, I'm running into an issue when I do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Issue:</strong> Images, text boxes, etc. are all becoming mixed up and incorrectly placed. One page documents will be split into four pages with small bits on each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would probably be possible to manually edit each one back to its correct state, but only working 3 hours a week with over 100 files to edit, this is going to be a seriously painful process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I Want: </strong>I want to convert the files and keep the same formatting so that the various aspects of the file remain in the same place in both the Word and Publisher versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help, Jack T</p>
<p>

I heard that the 6630 (and others probably) can be used to control PowerPoint presentations remotely.<br />
<br />
Any idea how this is done, or what is needed?<br />

                    <p>All of a sudden my Contacts disappeared after I had attempted to add multiple contacts today. The first few times it claimed there was an error - "it's not you its us", then when I went back to my email nothing works the address box will not autocomplete,
 so I went to contacts and despite claiming there were 76 contacts none show up, then all of a sudden my contacts are back but nothing will work - I can't reply to email, send new email and if I type in an address and hit send then nothing happens and the To
 field goes blank.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update for Lumia 535</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi. I have Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual Sim. I am getting a message from Windows Team that A MAJOR WINDOWS UPDATE IS NOW AVAILABLE. But when I check for updates, there is not update and
 it says YOUR PHONE IS UPTO DATE. Please tell me what's happening? And also tell me how will I get Windows 10 update? I need Windows Insider for it? Or I will get it from PHONE UPDATES in settings?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And I have read that Windows Phone running&nbsp;</span><span>Lumia Denim can only enjoy update of Windows 10. And I guess I have&nbsp;</span><span>Lumia Denim. I also attached pictures
 with my post. So please help me and guide me when and how I can get Windows 10 update.<br />
Best regards<br />
Thank you and have a nice day to entire Microsoft Team &lt;3</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a6065de-b0a6-4184-8e56-117b0692cfec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a6065de-b0a6-4184-8e56-117b0692cfec" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57fc5552-0d7f-48d4-988b-305821ce5442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/57fc5552-0d7f-48d4-988b-305821ce5442" /></a>

    <title>Revert back to old version of Outlook with former menu ribbon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomwillig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Revert back to old version of Outlook with former menu ribbon</h2>
                    The new update to 365 changed the outlook email ribbon to some horrible new format causing the user multiple steps to do what&nbsp;was once one button. The old version that basically had the WORD ribbon for outlook was great. This new version is worse than
 Gmail. Extremely kludgy, inconvenient and laborious.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
QUESTION. How do I revert back to the old version and not allow it to be automatically updated?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> lucaswsg  say:</h3>
<h2>            How long will office products work after deleting user from o365&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I need to perform a cutover migration, but my client has been using o365 subscription for office licenses while still using onsite Exchange. &nbsp;They are now want to do the migration to Exchange Online, but the users are already created. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that I need to delete the users from o365 prior to migration, but would like the least amount of down time for my client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to know how long they will still be able to use full functionality of locally installed office products after their user has been deleted. &nbsp;I will be immediately starting the migration, but this can take a very long time to fully migrate all users.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            constant Cannot Perform The Requested Operation error clicking Contacts at bottom of Contacts</h2>
                    
<p>When I use my Outlook Contacts, I am constantly getting an error box when I click on&nbsp;the Contacts&nbsp;names at the bottom of my Contacts that I have associated with other Contacts. The box says:&nbsp;Cannot Perform The Requested Operation.</p>
<p>I am so sick of seeing this. I don't know what I did or am doing that now causes this to happen. I did need to reinstall my PST file recently after reloading Office 2003. Also, I use cCleaner to clean my machine daily at login. I am the only user of this
 home pc - the only login, the only admin and the only actual user.</p>
<p>If I click the Contacts button at the bottom of a contact and then find the same Contact and click Apply, it&nbsp;becomes clickable.&nbsp;Now if I double click one of those&nbsp;Contacts and double click another Contact at the bottom of that Contact when it now opens,
 I get that same silly message.</p>
<p>If I click Show Help when this error box pops up, it tells me that You have most likely attempted to view the calendar for a user who has one or more of the following issues: 1. Is not part of your domain 2. Is not listed in the LDAP 3. Is not a member of
 your Exchange Server 4. Has not granted you the necessary permissions to view their calendar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid this error message, use the Open Calendar command only if the attendee is using &nbsp;Exchange Server. ... If they are not part of your network, it is very
 likely you cannot gain access to their calendar. (clickable link&gt;) More information about this error message online. If clicked, this is what you get:</p>

<p>I have over 1000 Contacts in my Outlook, so manually fixing all of them is not a pretty option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I manually go thru and find each of those Contacts at the bottom of each Contact and click Apply for each, then it stores it and it will open that other Contact if clicked - now and even after Saving, Closing and re-opening a Contact. But only for the
 ones that I manually fixed.</p>
<p>What&nbsp;is going on and is the an easy fix?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately - the answer is "no" to a "bulk fix"</p>
<p>The techno mumbo jumbo reason is as follows:</p>
<p>Contacts at the bottom of a detail page are stored in what's called the "Links Collection" which in simple terms - points to specific contact items identified by their unique &lt;Entry ID &amp; Store ID&gt; (StoreID references the PST file itself). The EntryID for
 an item is Outlook's unique identifier for any given type of item.</p>
<p>When you move contacts that are referenced by any &lt;links Collection) to another PST file - both the EntryID and StoreID for those contact items get changed so when you click&nbsp;on a contact in the list (link collection) &nbsp;- the original reference cannot be found
 - ergo - the error you're encountering. That's why when you manually find the correct contact and apply it - the correct info is once again stored in the associated &lt;Links Collection&gt; and the error disappears.</p>
<p>Had these contacts been &lt;moved&gt; to a different folder in the same PST&nbsp;file (InfoStore) then the information in the &lt;Links Collection&gt; would have remained in tact since the EntryID for the items would not have changed.</p>
<p>That's also why if items are exported, deleted,&nbsp;and then re-imported - a new EntryID is assigned to the imported item nullifying any references that may exist in any existing Links Collection. Same holds true if a contact folder is moved in its entirely
 to another PST file - references to any contact items within the moved folder from a links collection will be broken.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t get rid of highlighting in my document.</h2>
                    <p>I was typing an outline in Word and highlighted some words. Using "bullets and numbering" I added some numbered entries below the highlighted words and the numbers themselves showed up highlighted. Even though I removed the highlighting for the original
 words, I cannot seem to get rid of the highlighting on the numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to remove the highlighting from numbers created using "bullets and numbering"?</p>

            I'm not able to duplicate that effect. I would try inserting a return between the highlighted lines and the numbered lines and ensure it isn't highlighted. Then remove the numbering, reapply the style for that text and add the numbering back in. Then delete
 the extra return. Any better?

    <title>How do I show field codes by default&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I show field codes by default&#63;</h2>
                    Hi Bob and others, <br />
I have the same problem but more help is needed! It is working with the right-click in the code and select the toggle field code but nothing is happening when I use alt+F9. But my problem is that I don't know how to make it show as content everytime I open
 a new document - I have tried to close down and restart but it has still not changed so I have to do the right-click every time. Can you tell me how to change it?
<br />
<br />
Best regards,
<p><br />

 perfectly :) <br />

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Which folder are you referring? Is it the folder in the <strong>Outlook desktop app</strong> or the
<strong>Mail app</strong>? If you're using any of this application, there is a possibility that the issue your experiencing is caused by a corrupted component on the application itself. Were you able to check your folder when you sign in using the Outlook website?
 We need these information to properly isolate the issue.</p>

    <title>MS Access 2016 - Add data from a form to a table - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isjimbaround  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access 2016 - Add data from a form to a table</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to create a form that gathers data for NEW USERS and saves the data into an existing table.&nbsp; The data will later be retrieved to verify that user ID and password is correct and to determine the users security level.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that this can be done by binding the form to the table, but this situation has a few specific criteria that I need help figuring out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I do not want existing records in this table to be UPDATED from the form; only add or APPEND</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I want the user to confirm the password that they enter in another form field (i.e. the "Password" field and the "Confirm Password" field should match).&nbsp;If the two values match, the value in the "Password" field of the form is added to the table.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;I do not want new users to be able to scroll through other user data in the table (this is why I don't want to bind the form to the table). Even after disabling the Record Selector in form properties, the up/down arrows can still scroll through bound
 records.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the easiest solution would be to disable the ability to scroll through existing records.&nbsp; This way I could bind the form and table and only need to add a little VBA to handle the password confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if anything is unclear.&nbsp; Thank you for your help!</p>

            <p>1. Set the Data entry property of the form to Yes. This will only allow the form to enter new records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Have the user first enter the password into an Unbound control. then have them enter it again into a bound control. In the Before Update even of the bound control, check to see if they match otherwise cancel the entry.</p>

            <p>I suggest you create a new Personal file and move your macros into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Find your XLSTART folder, probably something like C:\Users\<em><strong>&lt;USERNAME&gt;</strong></em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART</p>
<p>2) With Excel closed, move any PERSONAL.<em>something </em>files to your desktop.</p>
<p>3) Open Excel.&nbsp; Record a macro to create a new PERSONAL.xlsb file in the Excel 2010 format).<br />
4) Go to your desktop, rename your original Personal.xls file to "Personal_OLD.xls"</p>
<p>5) Double-click on it to open it.&nbsp; It may be Hidden, in which case, do View tab &gt; Unhide &gt; select "Personal_OLD.xls" &gt; OK.</p>
<p>6) Press Alt+F11 to open the VBE, then drag each of your modules from </p>
<p>"VBAProject (Personal_OLD.xls)" </p>
<p>to </p>
<p>"VBAProject (PERSONAL.XLSB)"</p>
<p>The modules wont be moved, they will be copied.</p>
<p>7) Once you've done that, go back to Excel and close the "Personal_OLD.xls".</p>
<p>8) Restart Excel and verify all your macros are present, then you can delete the files from your desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

</p><p>At least one of your Project Online administrators needs to have a copy of Microsoft Project Professional to create and edit calendars.&nbsp; Assuming one of you has Project Pro, complete the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log into PWA with administrator permissions.</li><li>Click the Settings menu button (it looks like a gear wheel) and click the PWA Settings item.</li><li>In the Enterprise Data section of the PWA Settings page, click the Enterprise Calendar link.</li><li>On the Enterprise Calendars page, select the Standard calendar and click the EDIT button.</li></ol>
<p>The system will launch Project Pro and open the enterprise Standard calendar for editing in the Change Working Time dialog. Edit the calendar as needed and then click the OK button.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the ONLY way to create and edit calendars in Project
 Online is to use Microsoft Project Professional.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Outlook calendar shared on internet returns Error 500</h2>

<p>We too are experiencing this issue.</p>
<p>Calendar published previously worked fine, but now people receive the&nbsp;error 500 when viewing an event.&nbsp; No changes had been made to the configuration by us since it was previously working.&nbsp; The calendar was shared publically (externally for anyone who knows
 the URL).</p>

<p>OWA version is 16.1235.13.2006541.</p>
<p>When publishing the calendar in OWA permissions were selected as "Full Details".</p>

<p>Hi Edward,</p>
<p>From the current information you provided above, it’s not an issue related to calendar permissions. We need to collect more information below for further analysis:</p>
<p>1. Do all users encounter the issue?</p>
<p>2. To identify if it’s a specific browser issue, please try changing to another browser.</p>
<p>3. How does the owner share the calendar? Using OWA (Outlook for Web App) or Outlook client? Detailed steps would be appreciated.</p>
<p>4. Please try sharing another calendar to see if the issue can be reproduced. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>One of my calendars which I have been sharing successfully (it's public) since January now returns a HTTP 500 error when anyone clicks on an item to open the description. It has been the case now for one week.</p>
<p>You can check for yourself here: <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/___@___.___/969ee2254ea346b9a400003859a6336811259171121337630913/calendar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook.office365.com/.../calendar.html</a></p>
<p>As far as I understand it, all items are public or certainly that's what I intended.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have some answer for this.</p>
<p>I checked with our techguy who said that it's because Microsoft updated the application and are aware of this fault.</p>
<p>and the version is:</p>
<p>"fileName": "prem/16.1250.10.2008072/scripts/en/boot.anonymous.mouse.strings.localized.min.js"</p>
