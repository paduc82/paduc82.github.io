    <title>I NEED HELP TO RESTORE COMPUTER BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandee m  say:</h3>
<h2>            I NEED HELP TO RESTORE COMPUTER BACK TO FACTORY SETTINGS</h2>
                    I have a Dell computer running Vista Home Premium 32 bit.&nbsp; On April 14, I was trying to update some drivers, install a music player, &amp; even install Vista Service Pack 1.&nbsp; Is Service Pack 1 a new item?&nbsp; I've had my computer for several years and I have
 automatic updates so I was surprised when I turned on my computer on April 14 and a message came up saying Windows had this important update &amp; did I want to install it, which I did.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Anyway, between all the stuff I did that evening I somehow totally screwed up my computer.&nbsp; When nothing would work correctly, I went to the Back up &amp; Restore Center.&nbsp; I have used this at least a couple of times before without problem.&nbsp; This time however, there
 were no restore points to choose from except April 14.&nbsp; Nothing before that.&nbsp; When I clicked on choose another restore point, nothing happened.&nbsp; I tried choosing the restore point of April 14 but that did not help anything.&nbsp; Then to really screw things up,
 I decided to restart my computer in Safe Mode.&nbsp; I'll never use that option again.&nbsp; Now I cannot start up in anything other than Safe Mode.&nbsp; I have run Spyware, Malware, and all the "fix your computer" options I could find.&nbsp; Nothing has helped.&nbsp; I had come
 to this forum after that and the person who was helping me finally said the only thing left for me to do was to do a complete system recovery.&nbsp; He said there was nothing more he could think of to help me.&nbsp; He did not tell me how to proceed.<br />
<br />
I'm not crazy about doing the recovery because I'm sure I'll have things afterward that will need fixing, such as my Internet service and who knows what else.&nbsp; But not having a lot of money right now, I also don't want to take my computer somewhere to be fixed
 if I don't have to.&nbsp; Could you please help me sucessfully do a full system recovery?&nbsp; First of all, how do I save my pictures and files I don't want to lose?&nbsp; And how do I know what I need to save?&nbsp; I have a USB flash Memory Stick that I plugged into my computer.&nbsp;
 It downloaded the software but I have no idea how to get my files to transfer to it.<br />
<br />
And what about if I have a virus?&nbsp; Would I be transferring it to the portable storage device and then reintroducing the virus to my computer when I transfer it back?&nbsp; I did run spyware &amp; malware and nothing shows up but clearly SOMETHING is wrong.&nbsp; I do have
 a reinstalation disk that came with my computer but I shouldn't need to use that, should I?&nbsp; Does anyone have the patience to give me DETAILED instructions on how to do the recovery, including how to do a back up?&nbsp; I would love you forever.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is Dell's way to reinstall from the&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;to your computer.<br />
<br />
Answer the questions in Blue; it is in a sequence.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://supportapj.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?journalid=67E9C215C4BABD6CE040AE0AB5E14F05&amp;docid=336966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://supportapj.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?journalid=67E9C215C4BABD6CE040AE0AB5E14F05&amp;docid=336966</a><br />
<br />
And this way if you also have a Recovery partition on your Hard drive.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
To save your Data: files, photos, music, etc:<br />
<br />
1. Plug in flash Drive<br />
2. Go to where your files are kept<br />
3. Right-click on what you want to save, example:&nbsp;a photo album &gt; Send To &gt; click on the USB Flash Drive(it might be Drive E: or F:)&gt; it will&nbsp;save to it<br />
4. Repeat until you have saved all&nbsp;your Data.<br />
<br />
When it comes time to reinstall the Data, plug in the Flash Drive, AFTER you have a Anti-virus, and Anti-Malware installed, right-click on that flash Drive? Scan it before copying files to your computer.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
You should after reinstalling that Image, have a trail period for an Anti-virus; ask here if you don't for a good free one.<br />
<br />
And reinstall those 2 Programs i gave you.<br />
You'll right-click and scan&nbsp;your Flash Drive with them:<br />

<h2>            Windows error No Certificate Available</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 on a fairly new Dell computer. When trying to download software I purchased from Dell it is stopped by a Windows Security error dfsvc that says "No Certificate Available. No certificates meet the application criteria. Click OK to
 continue or Cancel." The download is stopped. I have spoken with Dell Support via email several times and sent them screenshots of the error details but they have no solutions. Has anyone else tried to download software from Dell and had an issue? I have downloaded
 the most recent .Net framework. Anyone had similar problems?&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for your response. I checked the link out and I believe it is a bit too technical for me to understand. I just can't believe that the people at Dell who are selling the software for customers to download can't be a bit more helpful. I may just
 have to give up on it and ask for a refund. Thanks again for trying to help.</p>

<h2>            Kings Quest Complete Collection - Rubble Without A Cause not working</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the Kings Quest Complete Collection a few months ago, downloaded and completed Chapter 1 (A Knight To Remember).&nbsp; I was really excited finding out that the 2nd chapter was coming out today (Rubble Without A Cause).</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I can't get it to work :(</p>
<p>I go to the Xbox store and either the complete collection or season pass page, download the next chapter and then sit and wait for a few hours for it to install, which it does without reporting any errors.&nbsp; When I reopen the game, the 2nd chapter still says
 "Available to buy".&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled the whole game, then did the same for just chapter 2.&nbsp; Neither approach has worked.&nbsp; I still only have access in the game to chapter one.&nbsp; Anyone else having this issue?</p>

<p>Yes, when I go to that episode in the game and press "Available now" it takes me to the download page in the xbox store for that episode, where it clearly says (in capitals no less) not to download that version if you've got a season pass or complete collection
 (and handily, the 'buy now' button is replaced with a greyed out one that says 'unavailable').</p>
<p>From the game, if I press on the 'season pass' link at the top of the chapter selection screen I get taken to the season pass download page and can download the episode from there, which then doesn't work as described in my original post. &nbsp;There doesn't
 seem to be an option in my game to download it without going to the xbox store.</p>

<p>I can confirm that I am experiencing exactly the same problem - so you're not alone :(<br />
<br />
I've tried re-installing the game multiple times - but with no success.</p>

<p>I decided to go have a chat with Xbox Support about this and whilst I was doing that I noticed that the release date for Chapter 2 on the Xbox Store is 15-Dec-2015 (next Tuesday) - so although it appears that the chapter is now available from inside the
 game, its not actually available from the store until 15-Dec-2015. and a quick Google seems to confirm that date also.</p>

<p>I'd come to a similar conclusion, but it's very confusing how the game says "Available now" under chapter 2. &nbsp;I am keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow the game will magically start working, I don't think I can cope with another reinstall!</p>

<p>Agreed. Very misleading - but like you, I'll give it another go tomorrow (15th) and if it still doesn't work, then I'll be back with Xbox Support to sort it out.</p>

<p>It's now the 15th, and I'm having the same problem with the "Complete Collection" version. I downloaded the compatibility packs, but Chapter 2 is still listed as "coming soon" in the chapter menu.</p>
<p>Also, when I launched the game, I didn't get a title update. I assume this is necessary to unlock the new Achievements in the game.</p>

<p>Can you all please try power cycling your consoles by holding the power button on them for 10 seconds until they shut down then unplug and let sit for 10 minutes to see if that helps?</p>

    <title>Unsigned Afc.sys file for DVD drive... Windows cannot verify the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unsigned Afc.sys file for DVD drive...  Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. &#40;Code 52&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently used a new backup drive and installed the appropriate software.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after doing so, my DVD drive will no longer function because it says that all the drivers can not be signed.&nbsp; When I look at the drivers, the problem driver is the
 afc.sys file from Arcsoft v. 1.0.0.3 .&nbsp; It is located in the folder&nbsp;c:\Windows\SysWow64\driver\ .&nbsp;</p>
social.answers.microsoft.comd reinstalled the backup drive software as my computer's troubleshooter suggests, but to no avail.&nbsp; What else can I do before I restore all of Windows?

<p>Thank you everyone!</p>

<p>You can try to check if it's in the device manager:</p>
<p>Press the Windows Key + Break key combination, then click device manager.</p>
<p>Click View -&gt; show hidden devices</p>
<p>Then you can see if you can find de arcsoft aspi driver or de ppdus aspi driver and delete that one.</p>
<p>Afterwards reboot the machine.</p>
<p>I hope that will work to remove the driver.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if you can provide more information regarding this issue. Please answer these questions for a better understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to search for any app using the Search Charm?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you try accessing the System Restore from the Control Panel?</p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you suspect any virus or other malicious software infection on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 1: Run the Apps Troubleshooter</i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Let’s run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some
 issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Download the App Troubleshooter</span></i></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the troubleshooting report and let’s know the details. You may also refer to this article for more app troubleshooting:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b><i>Troubleshoot problems with an App</i></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, then let’s try the next method to check if this is caused by any corrupted or damaged system files on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 2: Run an SFC Scan</i></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The “<b><i>sfc /scannow</i></b>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard and select “<b><i>Command Prompt (Admin)</i></b>” from that menu.<span><span><br />
b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<b><i>Enter</i></b>”
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 72pt"><b><i>sfc /scannow</i></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 72pt">&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also check if this is caused by any third party software conflicts on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 3: </i></b><b><i><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<b><i>How to perform a clean boot</i></b>” and follow the instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and
 Windows 8</i></b>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></i></b></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<b><i>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</i></b>” given in the section “<b><i>How
 to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</i></b>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”, to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span></i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are unable to find any conflicting software on the computer, then try accessing System Restore from Control Panel and restore the computer to a point when everything was working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Method 4: Perform a System Restore</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To perform a <b><i>System Restore</i></b>, please refer to the article given below and follow the instructions given under the section: “<b><i>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</i></b>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</i></b></a></p>
<p><b><u><span>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>
<p><b><i>Important: The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the recently changed
 settings on the computer.</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the results.</p>

    <title>After I install the &#34;Theme from Internet&#34; &#40;Screensaver is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agorbylev  say:</h3>
<h2>            After I install the &#34;Theme from Internet&#34; &#40;Screensaver is disabled&#41; PC &#38; Notebook lost the &#34;Lock Screen&#34; previously worked with &#34;standard&#34; a screensaver</h2>
                    <p>Today I noticed on this the relationship: after&nbsp;I install additional "Themes from the Internet" -&nbsp;option of theme&nbsp;a "Screensaver"&nbsp;I&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;off, as it was before&nbsp;- I lost "Lock Screen" previously worked&nbsp;with a "standard"&nbsp;screensaver. If I switch option of
 empty screensaver to "Start from...", I see Lock Screen without slide-show my photos:( Screen go to black after 1..2 minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe anyone has experience with<span> restoration</span> "normal Lock Screen" from oblivion?&nbsp;Previously, this happened on PC, and today on my laptop (windows 10 x64) :/ Or how to correct the registry(?) to set up to "standard
 screensaver" with slide-show?</p>
<p>Best way is make "standard screensaver" visible in drop-down list of screensavers&nbsp;installed in system!&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>Themes enable users to customize elements of the Windows visual style, including elements such as the desktop, background, and screen saver.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Right-click desktop, select Personalize, then Lock Screen, then select Screen saver settings. You can then select what screensaver you want.</div>

            <p>1. "Themes enable users to customize elements of the Windows visual style, including elements such as the desktop, background, and screen saver".<br />
Lock Screen is Screen Saver?! NOT: it hasn't on list installed Screensavers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. But you wrote: "Right-click desktop, select Personalize, then Lock Screen, then select Screen saver settings. You can then select what screensaver you want."<br />
See point #1! How I can it select "screensaver Lock Screen"?<br />
But "it looks like the boa similar to the boa..." :) It is collage-maker for images from folders added to it on Personalize screen.
</p>
<p>This future has stopped working after switch to other theme&nbsp;and&nbsp;even after reverting to the default theme and default values: "screen saver Lock Screen" not working:(

    <title>Laptop does not load user profile, cannot logon even with safe mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akbar1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop does not load user profile, cannot logon even with safe mode</h2>
                    <p>My laptop was infected with SystemFix virus which I got rid of with Kaspersky antivirus. However, it had caused all my files and folders not to populate when start button was clicked. Also, the hard drive would not show any files or folders except program
 and App Data folders. I restored my files from my backup drive, that probably created duplicates and filled the hard drive.&nbsp;Still, I could log on and use the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,in trying to fix the problem I must have made changes that have caused bigger problem. I CANNOT now log on to my laptop because it does not accept my password and gives an error message 'user profile not loaded.'
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The windows 7 starts and asks me about my password and then HDD password before it gets to the Windows screen for password. Even trying to run in the safe mode requires password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I logon bypassing ANY AND ALL requirements of a password and then fix the original problem of not showing my files and folders in my hard drive and having them populate in my Start button?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried several suggestions made on this forum but none did work. Please do not assume that I know a certain step when carrying out a task. List the step as they should be taken. Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help will be highly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth icon missing in settings Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth icon missing in settings Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to windows 10 and I was looking for the Bluetooth icon in my settings but there never was one. I searched around and found that if I went to the airplane mode, I could turn Bluetooth on. So I went to look for airplane mode and after and hour
 of searching, couldn't find it. I have downloaded the Bluetooth file on the Microsoft webpage and still no luck. Can someone help me? I just want to listen without a wire on my headphones.</p>

            <p>I had a similar experiences on windows 10 via an HP laptop (admittedly old).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally clicked airplane mode and turned off wifi and bluetooth. When I turned AM off, neither wifi nor bluetooth would work. I had to reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted, I clicked the notifications icon in the tray and turned wifi on and that worked fine. I then clicked the bluetooth tile, and it only briefly highlighted and stayed dim. This made me think bluetooth was not working. However, when I turned
 on my bluetooth mouse, it worked. I was also able to add a bluetooth device through the add device option in settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, bluetooth was working, but settings was indicating it was off. After reading the issue here and replies below it, I decided to check in services. Sure enough, a service had become disabled and thus would not run. I went to the services
 panel, and re-enabled (automatic) that particular service, and voila, bluetooth still works &amp; I'm now able to toggle bluetooth on in settings so that it both looks "on" and shows the connected devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my overall recommendation is to go to service and find any Bluetooth services not running and start them. You may find one or more that are disabled and need to enable them first. The one that was disabled on my Hp laptop was named "Bluetooth Driver Management
 System."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of this issue is bug related, it may be that this particular service does not turn back on when airplane mode is activated and re-activated.&nbsp;</p>

<br />I would look for your money back and possibly report that website . . .

<br />Windows 10 Pro for $10.00 - it could not possibly be legit - much too good to be true, sorry !!

    <title>windows 8 camera &#34;device is being used by another program&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bchamp1987  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 camera &#34;device is being used by another program&#34;</h2>
                    <p>"Cannot connect to this webcam. close any programs that may be using your webcam, and choose Set Up Audio and Video to try again"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded from Vista to Windows 8 on Sunday.&nbsp; Using Skype on Sunday evening, the camera worked fine, but I could not get the microphone to work.&nbsp; Monday I loaded a few additional applications (Trend Micro, iTunes, Media Center, and a few others from Microsoft)
 and then I got the microphone to work (just had to select another microphone).&nbsp; Sadly, the camera no longer works.&nbsp; I have since removed all the programs that I installed on Monday and done every possible search to see if this is a driver issue.&nbsp; Should not
 be a driver issue as the camera worked once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unknown Device Identifier can locate the camera - Ricoh Company Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC4 -&nbsp;although it does not show up in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled the drivers that I could find and done the reboots to let them automatically reload and still no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Sony Vaio VGN-FE53HB-W (Japanese model as I live in Japan) - The only change I did Monday that I did not undo is to change the operating system from Japanese to English leaving the keyboard as the Japanese layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even attempted to use and external camera (Logitec) but still no camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are getting error “Cannot connect to this webcam. close any programs that may be using your webcam,
 and choose Set Up Audio and Video to try again” while using web camera in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let’s test the issue in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1
 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility,
 and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these
 steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run the app troubleshooter and then try to run the apps and check if that helps. You may download and run the troubleshooter
 from the following link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the apps with which you face the issue and check.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on the apps and click on uninstall.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>‘Store’</b> and click on <b>‘Top free’</b> apps download and install the apps</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer and try to use the app and check</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I went through everything as you mentioned in your message but I did not have any luck.&nbsp; I do have a few questions/concerns though.</p>
<p>1) You mentioned "uncheck safe boot" - This was not checked on my system when I looked.</p>
<p>2) "Selective Start-up" was already selected when I clicked on the "General" Tab.</p>
<p>Since I did not have any programs on the PC other that the Microsoft programs, I only needed to worry about the MS Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that being said, there was a little difficulty trying to check the camera using Skype of Messenger, as when I unchecked&nbsp;half, or around 20 or so MS services, I could not log into either of the other services.&nbsp; I then reinstalled Windows 8 just incase
 I toyed with something too much, such as changing the language from Japanese to English, but no change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then stared the entire process over and attempted to use some of the programs I had deleted from the Metro screen such as "Camera" and "Movie Maker" since I could not access Skype of Messenger while fidgeting with the MSCONFIG screen.&nbsp; To make a short
 story long, nothing I did worked, even after unchecking 20 MS services at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Methods 2 and 3, I tried those before and after Method 1 but still at a loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to installing Windows 8, the "Upgrade Assistant" ran and said that my camera was compatible.&nbsp; I still need to search Sony's Japanese website more thoroughly.&nbsp; I searched the US website and found the same camera driver, however upon downloading it,
 I got the message that said something such as "the program is not compatible with your operating system" or something to that effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any additional advice I will gladly accept, however, uninstalling Windows 8 is not an option.&nbsp; On a side note,&nbsp;can anyone tell me when the Surface Tablet will be available in Japan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Srinivas KR</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if I missed something in all of the instructions about getting Vista switched over to Windows 8, but I solved the camera issue this evening.&nbsp; I just happened to attempt to re-install the Office programs using the original CD from when I purchased
 my PC.&nbsp; I remembered when it did not load that I had read something about my CD drive not working.&nbsp; It does not work, but I am sure it can be fixed after a bit more reading.&nbsp; Anyhow, in C drive, I found a folder called "drivers" so I opened it and then I found
 a file for "camera" so I opened it.&nbsp; In that folder was a word that said "install", so I clicked it.&nbsp; My camera now works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure where the program came from, I will just assume that you did that for me and close this with saying, Windows 8 is by far the best system ever!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your help!!</p>

            Had this problem. Only program that I could think of that might be using the camera was hand gestures. Disabled that by going to tool bar, hidden icons, select gestures, turn off. Resolved the problem - at least for now.

<div>I deleted all printer drivers and tried to reinstall the printer for about 30 times... without success.</div>

<p>I installed windows 7 on my Sony Vaio which was originally OS windows vista (Sony Vaio VGN - FE890)&nbsp;and my webcam is gone. Am I suppose to install the old driver "Vaio Cam capture Utility" and would that even be compatible with windows 7? or do I install
 something different? which would be more uptodate?</p>

 I did not open it, nor do I want it to be popping up all the time.&nbsp; I have run a scan, I have disabled the windows key on the keyboard (just in case I was somehow hitting it by accident since I . can't seem to find the keys on this Samsung laptop).&nbsp; I don't
 know how to fix it and it is driving me crazy.&nbsp; It is as if I went to the start menu and clicked on computer, only I didn't.&nbsp; Please help!&nbsp; thank you.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><b><span>
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Check in Safe mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also check if the issue persists in safe mode.</span></p>

<p><span>Now perform Step 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error message, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as
 a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><b><span>Please note:</span></b><span>&nbsp; After the troubleshooting, make sure to boot your computer to normal mode by following
 the step 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>I will suggest updating your anti-virus and malware/spyware protection and removal software and run a full
 system scan once again.<br />
<br />
You can also use the Malicious Software Removal Tool.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool checks computers running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows 2000, and Windows Server 2003 for infections
 by specific, prevalent malicious software—including Blaster, Sasser, and Mydoom—and helps remove any infection found. When the detection and removal process is complete, the tool displays a report describing the outcome, including which, if any, malicious
 software was detected and removed.<br />

            <p>Hi - there are ways you should be able to recover the original photo. What photo editor were you using ? Some have an option to revert to the original, but failing that you can restore an earlier version from your pc...see the information at this link...</p>

            <p>Hello Marcus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Is your computer get overheated only while playing games or while using applications too?</li><li>If it is while playing game, is that with only one game or with all games?</li><li>Did you make any recent changes (Hardware or Software) on your computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime your CPU usage goes up, your computer will generate more heat.&nbsp; The fans in your computer will normally dissipate the heat before your CPU gets too hot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common cause of computer overheating is dust accumulating inside your computer on the CPU.&nbsp; Open up your computer case and clean out the dust.&nbsp; A can of compressed air should make quick work of it.&nbsp; While you are in there, verify that the computer
 fan is running when your computer is turned on.&nbsp; A failed fan will cause overheating as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting you may try to boot the computer in <strong>safe mode </strong>
and then check the status. T<span>ry to boot the computer in safe mode and see are you able to login in safe mode or not. You can refer to the below mentioned article for booting the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below
 to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Problem installing a HP PSC 2355 printer in Windows 7. </h2>
                    I am trying to install my HP PSC 2355 printer in Windows 7. HP states that they do not have a full function driver for this model for Windows 7. However, the driver that comes with Win 7 has a driver that will give the printer basic functions which is
 all I need. One should change the device installation settings so that updates are performed automatically. I have done this. However, when I connect the printer (USB port) no window pops up to indicate that a new driver has been installed nor is there any
 other action and the printer still does not function. I have tried this numerous times and it appears that Windows 7 doesn't even recognize that there is a printer attached. What do I do?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit pre-installed on a new computer<br />
HP All in One PSC 2355 printer<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can manually install printer and drivers</p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Open Devices and Printers by clicking the
</span><span>Start</span><span> button, and then, on the Start menu, clicking
</span><span>Devices and Printers</span><span>.</span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Right-click the printer you want to update, and then click

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a2af57cd-38c5-489d-af67-58eda83164e0" title="rickpakmer">

</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no option to delete your picture in Skype. You can only change your profile picture. For your reference you can check this FAQ link: &nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA3571/how-do-i-change-my-profile-picture-in-skype?q=delete+profile+picture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 do I change my profile picture in Skype?</a></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option to create a customize Skype name is no longer available. Once you created a new account the system will automatically generate your Skype name.
