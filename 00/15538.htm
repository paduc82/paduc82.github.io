            I reinstalled but it did not solve the problem.&nbsp; I was able to right click on the excel file in the EMail, click on "save as" and save into Excel.&nbsp; IN EXCEL I then right clicked on the file, went to properties, clicked unlock and was able to open the file
 finally !&nbsp; I don't think the file was locked, but in a round about manner I was finally able to save finally ........ but problem still exists.

<h2>            Office 2013 Home and Business Product Key</h2>

            I am afraid Microsoft do not send&nbsp;Product Keys unless you purchase software directly from Microsoft. You need to go back to the vendor.

    <title>E-mail forwarding Exchange Online and On-premise Exchange from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-mail forwarding Exchange Online and On-premise Exchange from Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>I have to following case</p>
<p>- on-premise Exchange 2007 environment with active mailboxes. Primaire e-mail domain is @test.com
<br />
- Existing Cloud identity accounts on Office365 with test.onmicrosoft.com UPN that are using Sharepoint Online within the Office365 tenant<br />
- All Cloud identity accounts have a configured e-mail forward to there on-premise Exchange 2007 mailbox (so its: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &gt;&gt; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>I want to convert the existing Cloud identity accounts to synchronized accounts with all existing functionality</p>
<p>- Created AzureAD connect<br />
- Added custom domain test.com to Office365<br />
- Added test.com as primaire e-mail adress on Cloud identity's (so primaire is now *** Email address is removed for privacy *** on Office365 mailbox)<br />
- UPN on on-premise is the same as primaire e-mail on Office365 so existing accounts are converted at Azure AD sync</p>
<p>Now when SharePoint online generated an e-mail notification to a user it is delivered at the Office365 mailbox but off course not forwarded anymore to the on-premise Exchange server mailbox. THe e-mail is sent internal and not looking at the external MX
 config. So it ends up in the Office365 mailbox<br />
Thats because the primaire e-mail adres on Office365 is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>How can I forward the e-mail to the Existing on-premise Exchange mailbox? How can I config SharePoint Online to look at external MX when sending e-mail?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Mikkie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The behavior cannot be changed currently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To work around the issue, you can refer to the following steps:<br />
1. On the on-premise Exchange server, add a new accepted domain “<i>sub1.test.com</i>” and add “<i>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</i>” to the proxy address of the mailbox “<i>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</i>”.<br />
2. On the Office 365 side, change the forwarding address to “<i>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</i>”.<br />
3. On the DNS hosting provider, set the MX record of domain “<i>sub1.test.com</i>” to point to the on-premise Exchange server.<br />
Please note that, we MUST NOT add the domain “<i>sub1.test.com</i>” to Office 365 in this case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need assistance when referring to the workaround above, please feel free to let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Claud</p>

<h2>            Lumia 1020 phone need to roll back version of Lumia Camera software</h2>
                    <p>Hi ms Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lumia Denim<br />
Lumia Core Build ID 3051.50009.1451.10458<br />
Application Version 3.15.4.28</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so proud when I finally returned to the USA from working overseas and bought my</p>
<p>Lumia 1020 phone with the fantastic camera! I have used it to take amazing pictures. One</p>
<p>day about two months ago I noticed there was an update for the Lumia Camera app, so</p>
<p>I foolishly updated the app. This was a big mistake. Now the app will not save the .dng</p>
<p>files which makes the unit so special, so it's pretty much just a normal camera now. I did</p>
<p>everything that people have said would fix it, but nothing did. What I really need to do</p>
<p>is to roll back the Lumia Camera app to the one that still worked. Please direct me to the</p>
<p>archive of older app software so I can use my phone camera again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in case you are going to suggest some of these, don't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>* try a reset of your phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>* try a hard reset of your phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>* uninstall and reinstall the app</p>
<p>
</p><p>* delete all the photos and the Camera Roll folder, then make a new Camera Roll folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>* send your phone to a repair place for $75</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you have to do is read online, and you can see that NO ONE has had any success with</p>
<p>any of these 'solutions' - the problem always comes back. I never had any problems until</p>
<p>I updated the Lumia Camera app, so I really need to roll back the app. If you are not at</p>
<p>all familiar with this, it is a very common procedure with computers and servers when an</p>
<p>update causes an essential application to stop working. In cases like this, such as I have</p>
<p>experienced with computers and servers while working at Universities, the performance</p>
<p>of the application is essential and the update is not - so going back to the previous one</p>
<p>is the sensible approach. I have an Android tablet and had to do this several times before</p>
<p>and it always ended up solving the problem, as you roll back versions eventually you will</p>
<p>find one that works again. Where are the older versions of Lumia Camera please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>yours - PJ</p>

<p>AFAIK, rolling back is not possible ...</p>
<p>Don't know why but on my Lumia 1020 the version of Lumia Camera is 4.10.0.6 and there is no problem in saving .dng</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I am sure you must have already confirmed but can you once again check if in the Lumia Camera applications--&gt;settings--&gt;Capture mode--&gt;JPEG (5 MP) + DNG (34 MP) is selected ? If its already there select some other option, reboot the phone and then again
 select the option for DNG. See if it makes any difference.</p>

            <p>Hi farby and others,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for chiming in. the current version of Lumia Camera is</p>
<p>4.7.2.5 with Cyan, whatever that means. If you are running an</p>
<p>older version then I want to get that version so don't update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to figure out how you could send it to me? There is no</p>
<p>conceivable reason why rolling back applications could not</p>
<p>be done. although there might be reasons why it is not made</p>
<p>easier for people to so, ones that really really need to do it.</p>
<p>Those reasons are a very dark subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search online for others who have had this problem,</p>
<p>you can easily see it is a very very common problem and no</p>
<p>one has ever reported any solution that solved the problem</p>
<p>on a permanent basis. This problem keeps coming back so</p>
<p>the real solution is to make the older version available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I and others have tried the solution you suggested, no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- PJ</p>

            <p>Hi PJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your phone would appear to be on WP8.1 Denim, but Lumia Camera version 4.7 is an old version - it is supposed to be on 4.10.x.x now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Were the phone signed into the Preview for Developers earlier?<br />
- Did you already try uninstall Lumia Camera and fresh install from the Store?</p>
<p>- Is all additional updates installed, from the Store app &gt; . . . &gt; Settings &gt; swipe up &gt; search for updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise this may be a good time to back up everything then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/mobile/support/product/lumia1020/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987&amp;category=softwareupdateanddownload" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">recover the

            <p>Hi hpholm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for helping me out. I never signed into the Preview for Developers,</p>
<p>but I bought the phone used and the previous owner may have, if that is</p>
<p>something that would matter. The seller reset everything to 'as new' before</p>
<p>I received it. I have thought about doing that, resetting it to 'as new' I guess</p>
<p>that's what they call a 'hard reset' but I have a really large number of contacts</p>
<p>and I don't want to have to reload them all again. I keep uninstalling Lumia</p>
<p>Camera and reinstalling it hoping that a new version will come out that fixes</p>
<p>the problem, but so far, the problem keeps coming back every time. When I</p>
<p>try to see updates as you suggested, that is really my problem in the first place.</p>
<p>The 'store' told me the Lumia Camera app had an update and I foolishly did</p>
<p>it and now the saving .dng files has never worked after I did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't have to look very much online to see this is a very common fault.</p>
<p>There are dozens of others in the same predicament. No one has found a</p>
<p>solution that works, every time someone thinks they have found one they</p>
<p>later on report that, in fact, the problem only seemed to be fixed but, in fact</p>
<p>the problem never goes away permanently but just keeps coming back. It is</p>
<p>something that the author of the Lumia Camera App has put in the updated</p>
<p>versions of the software! I want to roll the application back to the one that</p>
<p>worked just fine for many months before I made that fatal mistake!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try saving everything from my phone to my own laptop. Is there a</p>
<p>way to do that? I mean without floating all my stuff out into 'clouds' etc...</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, there is a pair of accounts in my 'Settings' =&gt; 'email &amp; accounts'</p>
<p>one is the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but I didn't know I had that one</p>
<p>and I have never used it (don't know what the password is and I really</p>
<p>have no interest in getting another e-mail) and my yahoo.com e-mail</p>
<p>but I do not use my phone for e-mail and I probably never will. There</p>
<p>is a sort of warning that the yahoo.com e-mail 'needs attention' but as</p>
<p>I say I don't use my phone for e-mail so I don't even know how that got</p>
<p>in there because I have been careful not to put e-mails into my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I need is a way to copy all my contacts into my laptop. I copied</p>
<p>them from my old Nokia phone with Symbian OS into the Lumia with</p>
<p>a nifty app that transferred through the bluetooth but my laptop does</p>
<p>not have bluetooth so I need another way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to save all my contacts to my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yes, I still cannot get Lumia Camera to save .dng files, that is my</p>
<p>problem that I really really want this forum to help me with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- pj</p>

    <title>Alternative Line Service &#40;A.K.A. Line 2&#41; in Windows Mobile 6 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alternative Line Service &#40;A.K.A. Line 2&#41; in Windows Mobile 6 Pro &#40;Pocket PC&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently own a HTC Tytn II. As many of you know, this uses Microsoft Mobile 6 Professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My service provider (Orange UK) provides me with a network standard feature called 'Alternative Line Service'. This is commonly known as 'Line 2'. Orange UK doesn't implement this in any customised fashion. It's implemented in the GSM standard
 way. Meaning if a handset supports ALS correctly, it will work correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables me (on a handset which supports it), to have two incoming lines, to my device. I can also switch from Line 1, to Line 2, to make outgoing calls on the two different lines. This is using only on SIM and is handled on the GSM network
 side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, it's unclear whether or not Windows Mobile 6 Professional supports Line 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I insert my ALS SIM into my Tytn II,&nbsp;I see a '1' at the top of the screen. If I go into the dialler, and hold down '#', the device changes the '1', to a '2', indicating the outgoing line is now at 2. When testing, this works as you'd expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I tap on the '2' at the top of the screen, I get a 'MultiLine' popup bubble, saying I am using line 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However there is a problem. When users call my Line 2, they are given a NU tone (also known as a 'dead' tone). They can call my Line 1 without issue.&nbsp;So I am unable to receive calls on my Line 2. Whether or not my active outgoing line is Line
 1, or Line 2, should make no difference, but just in case, I switched my outing active line to Line 2 - it made no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if I open up the dialler, then press menu, options, there is a TAB called 'ALS'. In this TAB, I can choose my outgoing line as line 1, or line 2 (obviously this is another way of changing outgoing lines instead of holding down #).&nbsp;There
 is also a drop down menu, allowing me to choose the ringtone, for incoming calls on line 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, because of all the software menus, I have to come to the assumption that Windows Mobile 6 Professional, was designed to support Line 2. But it looks like it doesn't work. I have tried my SIM in another Tytn II, and the issues still persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this is not a network issue, as I have placed my SIM in a Sony Ericsson P1i and the device works with Line 2 without fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be great! I suspect only the Windows Mobile 6 team can really answer this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kirk.</p>

<p>I have the exact same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stock, the Orange Phone version of TYTN II does not support the LINE 1 and LINE 2 Feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, using a Later radio version, and re-flashing to a Win 6.1 Rom, will give you the added menu options in Settings / Phone / Line selection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've re-created your issue where Line 2 calls are met with a dead tone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after contacting someone I know in HTC, There is no support for it. I am unsure yet if it is down to Hardware support.. or Software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having to wait on him to return with some more info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will however keep you posted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makes me feel pretty miffed too that HTC include this on SPV but not Pro versions of WM6</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the info HarvSingh,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it strange that HTC will allow you to choose the incoming ringtone for line 2, but that apparently incoming calls aren't supported? Then why on earth could we choose a ringtone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect this issue to remain unresolved, but if you could keep me posted on any developments you have, that'll be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Guys, had a few WM6 phones now and none so far have had ALS enabled which is a real bind as Line 2 is important to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worked no probs on WM5 Excalibur from HTC, probably all WM5 phones, and we know its there in WM6 like you say as half the settings are there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had 4 or 5 different WM6 phone samples from HTC and others via work but none so far have even offered the 1 or 2 at the top like your TYTN II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like even if they did my Line 2 would be dead incoming from what you say but I still keep hoping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand from other posts that you can activate the options it if its not already showing by amending "ShowALSPage" to 1 in your registry under HKLM/Software/OEM/PhoneSetting</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a non-tech I dont even know how to that (let alone flash a ROM) but when I finally got the courage to use a Registry Editor I didnt have a folder called OEM in that place, let alone PhoneSetting anyway on an new Palm Centro I have&nbsp;- any
 idea on that, is it hidden somehow?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping fingers crossed anyway, I womder what would happen if we got a WM6 phone directly from Orange (I get mine direct) ... not even contemplating spending all week on the phone to them though to be told they dont understand anyway ...</p>

                    I want my figures to be formatted as follows:&nbsp;<strong>Figure 1: </strong>Figure description here. I can set the figure caption style under the style menu but I have to pick either bold or not it won't let me do both. I also want to cross-reference my figures
 in the text but when I do it puts the reference as bold but I want it to follow the 'normal' style of my document. How do I fix these issues? I realize you can make these changes manually but I am about to start writing a several hundred page document....

            Use Alt+F9 to toggle on the display of the field codes and add a \*charformat switch to the REF fields and the format the R of REF with the desired format.&nbsp; While it may seem to be just as easy to apply direct formatting to the cross reference, that will
 probably not be retained when the fields in the document are updated by the process of printing the document.

<p>I already have my two ONEDRIVE accounts ( outlook and office365 &nbsp;) working on my outlook app (ios latest version for iphone), however when I try to add another ONEDRIVE account of office365 it says "The Microsoft Account doesn't exist, Enter different account".&nbsp;</p>
<p>it's weird because I have those office365 accounts registered in the app... and they are working fine as office365mail accounts...</p>
<p>any idea?</p>
<p>I tried deleting and reinstalling over and over again.... differents networks... etc...</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>hi jorge,</p>
<p>about the issue, may i know if you run into the following error message?<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/482e31fb-e0c2-4905-a6be-7324326b26d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/482e31fb-e0c2-4905-a6be-7324326b26d1" /></a></p>
<p>if so, i would like to explain that when we add a work of school account(office 365 account) to the outlook app on iphone, we need to select
<strong>exchange</strong> instead of <strong>outlook.com</strong> in this page. meanwhile, when we log into<strong> outlook.com</strong> in this page, when need a microsoft account(personal account).<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34133678-0502-403c-9dec-a15887446321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34133678-0502-403c-9dec-a15887446321" /></a></p>
<p>therefore, could you try the following steps to log into outlook app to check the result?</p>
<p>1. open the outlook app and select <strong>outlook.com</strong>.<br />
2. log into with your microsoft account. then, touch <strong>settings</strong> in the lower-right corner
<strong>&gt; add account</strong>.<br />
3. select<strong> exchange</strong> and log into with the work or school account.<br />

<p>Thank you, there is a misunderstood ... I'm fine with email account setups as office365, the issue comes with an extra onedrive setup account into the outlook app.
</p>
<p>Emails are running well... not the same for the onedrive setups.</p>
<p>Previously I said it was weird because I could configured those onedrive accounts into the onedrive app, not outlook app.</p>

<p>hi jorge,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>when we add an account via <strong>files</strong> in the outlook application on the iphone, we can only add the onedrive service which is intended for personal. we can’t add the onedrive for business service which we need to log into with our work or school
 account(office 365 account). onedrive for business is different from onedrive and more details can be found in the article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-onedrive-for-business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
what is onedrive for business</a>.</p>

    <title>DISABLE BROADCAST SSID ON WINDOWS PHONE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hyjax ltd  say:</h3>
<h2>            DISABLE BROADCAST SSID ON WINDOWS PHONE</h2>
                    <p>I want to disable the broadcasting of my Windows Phone Hotspot SSID.&nbsp; This is a well discussed security vulnerability and is recommended to have disabled on all wireless access points/routers/hotspots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a function of Android Hotspot, Apple Hotspots, and even the most worthless of all, NetZero Hotspots have this ability.&nbsp; For Windows to not have added this is slightly absurd with todays understanding of personal network security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are several links as to why this is a security risk to have enabled and allows for others to easily hack ones network if they have 'BROADCAST SSID' enabled:</p>

            <p>Wow. All those links are wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling SSID broadcast is actually WORSE security. Why? Because clients that know your network are now yelling out your SSID any time they're on in attempt to find it. Imagine a person going up and down the street knocking on every door looking for you
 and saying your name and ID. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if those clients are mobile, they waste battery trying to find it, checking if it's present if there's no other WiFi they know is in range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hiding the SSID is false security when it does the opposite. You have nothing to worry about when using the hotspot functionality in regards to broadcasting the SSID.</p>

<p>Go read ANY of the articles I sent you.&nbsp; Unless the packets are invalid or the key is somehow manipulated in transit by brute force the devices DO NOT send them back unencrypted.&nbsp; This was covered two years ago at the hacking seminar in Vegas.&nbsp; I am the
 one who uncovered this problem so companies like TP-Link and most the others could fix it on their devices.&nbsp; You can also turn off the signal beacon of the receiving device to get&nbsp;rid of the problem via router config&nbsp; As well, your explanation still 'holds
 no water' as the devices would still be "yelling out your SSID" with it disabled from broadcasting at the source or not.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So you are incorrect.&nbsp; That USED to be the scenario until we got it addressed and MOST companies have fixed this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please add this ability.&nbsp; Right now the Windows Mobile platform is the ONLY device I know of that DOES&nbsp; NOT allow this.&nbsp; Not to mention it should be user preference.</p>

<p>You know, I seem to recall this being a place that can be done too.&nbsp; I suppose I can always 'hash' it out on their FB page as well, making sure to indicate this post so they can see the answer you first gave.<br />

I'll try that but you guys are being socially engineered into a very shotty OS.&nbsp; You guys should wake up and smell the consumer services being offered by those who have been around.</p>

<p>You tell me to go somewhere else to offer this as a suggestion , yet when I entered this community for development of Windows 10; it was clearly stated on the web page that we offer them her as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, being you have every other device, why would you think Windows should be the ONLY one to not offer this?&nbsp; It is sad that companies like Lithium are given so much power in forums that a great OS like Windows 10 can be so eaily socially manipulated out
 of VERY IMPORTANT security features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do what this forum was told to us it should and forward this requerst.&nbsp; I am posting a link to this very thread on the Windows Mobile FB and Twitter accounts so they can see we are being trolled out of doing EXACTLY what we were instructed to do.</p>

<p>I will accept the question as to it being not able to do CURRENTLY is answered.&nbsp; However, with the links I provided about this issue; it actually has not been fully discussed as to why this feature is STILL not in the Windows Mobile platform.&nbsp; My 'game'
 is this forum was explained as a place to get answers and SUBMIT feedback to issues and missing components of the Windows system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This particular feature represents a HUGE security risk for people and business professionals.&nbsp; I am curious as to why some of us are continually told this is not the place to submit such suggestions/issues once discovered it cannot be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Insider page itself, this IS the proper channel to submit these.&nbsp; So my 'game' as you put it is to wonder why we are told it is not.&nbsp; I will put that to another thread though so this one can be closed, even though only a portion of the answer was
 given and then poorly referenced as well as incomplete information given by the responder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good day sir.</p>

<h3> global11  say:</h3>
<h2>            JBL PowerUp Speaker</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I am in the US, bought a PowerUp speaker from Australia as could not get in the US. Now I got the speaker today, powered it up, charged battery (full) , connected with Bluetooth or NFC and is connected to phone but no sound at all. I am not iliterate
 in computers or phones so I feel there is nothing else to try to make it work. In my opinion is a faulty Speaker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I deal with it?&nbsp;Is there a &nbsp;warranty in the US&nbsp;although I bought it overseas? I would need a new one I read online in TELSTRA support that is a problem that have happened already. FAULTY SPEAKER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really frustrated and kind of regreting this Lumia&nbsp;switch from Iphone already, really love the phones, the idea, the accesories but I have&nbsp;bought 3 Lumia 920, 2 of witch I need to soft reset at&nbsp;least once a week as they freeze regardless of&nbsp;where they are
 from, 2 are AT&amp;T&nbsp;1 is unlocked and behave the same way, &nbsp;waiting for a software update before deciding&nbsp;throwing in the towel.</p>
<p>The third one, the LOCK screen button is already out of order so I need to wait for the screen to go off to put in my pocket.</p>
<p>I am not a basher or have dark intentions these have been my true experiences with my Lumia phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone help me and see if I can exchange this speaker in the USA please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a feeling I am going to get the cold shoulder.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear of your issue but unfortunately warranty remains in region of supply, so whilst this apears most generous in the EU region it can seem quite restrictive elsewhere. Whilst "Portico" update resolves many issues upon generic SIM free versions,
 seen reports of Bluetooth problems remaining upon ATT software ones.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, I am upset but I know you personally dont make the rules on returning items so&nbsp;I appreciate the post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paid&nbsp;$230 or so with shipping, will toss the speaker as shipping costs will make it prohibitive to return and get a new back. Lesson learned this happens to me&nbsp;for buying an unreliable defective product.</p>
<p>Will return 2 of the phones next week.:thumbdown:</p>

<p>Outlook Mobile consists of Calendar, Contacts, Notes, Tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you setup your partnership, you were asked what you wanted to sync ... right?</p>
<p>You would have checked items like Contacts, Calendar, Email etc ... did you do that?</p>

 locally created and saved files.&nbsp;The problem is just on my Mac and not user specific (another user couldn't open these files using their own credentials on my machine). Only Office files on the server share are affected. The Mac is not bound to any Active
 Directory domain or has ever been, though the server is part of an AD domain, using DFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jason</p>

<p>Hello Derek Koop,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post in forum. Regarding your above description, I'd like to recommend that, please try to repair an office application with both

<p>
</p><p>Also, please try to open outlook in <strong>safe mode</strong> and check the result. For opening outlook on safe mode Press
<strong>windows +R key</strong> and type command <strong>outlook.exe /safe</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: There is a space between outlook.exe and /safe.</strong></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I’d like to collect below information from you.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the suggestions Darpan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- I ran the Quick Repair and Online Repair</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I then ran Outlook in safe mode</p>
<p>Still the signature options would not open. Below are images of the two methods I use to open the signature options.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. In a new message I click Signature, in the Message ribbon and then select "Signatures..."</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. File-&gt;Options, under Mail select "Signatures..."</p>
<p>For both options, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked on another machine with Office 365 and a stand alone 2003 MS Project and this issue doesn't happen. My machine has MS Project 2019.</p>
<p>The signature options <strong>does </strong>open if I sign into a local account on my machine.</p>
<p>I am still at a loss on how to solve this, any more suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<div>I resolved the issue by refreshing my install of Windows 10 by:</div>

<div style="margin-left: 30px">Then re-installing Office 365 apps<br />
<div><br />
<div>I had also noticed that when I logged into a different account any image files created by my main account would not open and give "Invalid Value for Registry" error. I am assuming there was another underlying issue, so I decided to bite the bullet and
 just refresh the install.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Windows 10 serial USB problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim_724  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 serial USB problems</h2>
                    <p>The latest (January) update to Windows 10 seems to cause problems with the USB serial driver when connecting to an Arduino. I can upload a small sketch to an Arduino Mega, but larger sketches fail with an "averdude checksum error", and I get periodic freezes
 when sending commands via USB serial to my 3D printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I isolated the problem to the latest Windows 10 update, rolling back to the previous update solves the problem (as does using Windows 7, dual boot on the same PC), however 24 hours after rolling back Windows is now prompting to install the update again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I delay the update until Microsoft fix this bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, by "larger sketches" I mean the Marlin firmware for my 3D printer, whereas the standard blink test sketch will upload without problems. The implication seems to be that occasional packets are arriving corrupt, hence large uploads get the checksum
 error, but smaller uploads have a good chance of succeeding without any corrupt packet (this would also explain the occasional freezes I saw during printing). I have been using the same hardware for at least 6 months without problems, and the problem completely
 clears up with the older preview build, or Windows 7, so seems unlikely this is an intermittent hardware fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboard is an Asus Z97-PRO, I can provide other info or logs if required.</p>

            <p>Thanks, yes I already set this to slow but Windows insisted on re-installing the update this afternoon anyway (the only option it gave was to delay the update for a few hours, after that time expired it updated automatically), so at the moment it's looking
 as though I'm stuck with this update.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 Email account Setup difficulties</h2>
                    <p>A bizarre problem I'm seeking help with, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a new Work-based email address to use via their&nbsp;email server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have signed in on their Webmail and changed the password.&nbsp; TX and RX emails fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have, after some&nbsp;difficulty&nbsp;setup the same email account on my MAC using my outlook 365 account and now receiving and sending emails fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have also set-up same account via outlook on my phone Samsung S8 with little or no problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Completely unable however to set up the same email account&nbsp;in Outlook on my desktop PC as my primary work tool. Automatic set-up or manual set-up where possible of the account fails and reports email and password not recognised.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly I have already got three other emails accounts in that&nbsp;outlook and the other devices running a&nbsp;mixture of exchange server and Imap /POP accounts fine with no issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It attempts to connect to the new email server with same details but it reports password&nbsp;or username failure&nbsp;!!! Account Working on both, webmail,&nbsp; MAC Outlook,&nbsp;and Phone Outlook ??? Just Doesn't make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC or Outlook not able to set up this account!&nbsp; Anyone got any ideas whatsoever please as I'm stumped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            What are you using for antivirus and firewall? it seems like it might be an autodiscover issue. 
<br />
<br />Is this an office 365 account? If so, support and recovery utility might give you a few clues - it should be on the File, Support menu or can be downloaded from <a href="https://diagnostics.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://diagnostics.outlook.com/</a>. 
<br />
<br />If its not an Office 365 email account, try the test at <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/</a>

<p>Hi Diane,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your reply. I do appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Bit defender Suite for Antivirus and Firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a 365 account&nbsp;but the tool you linked me seemingly cant log into my personal office account (or my work office account for that matter) even though I can do it from a webpage !! so have given up on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As is stands after much faffing about I have loaded the email account I write about to&nbsp;Outlook on :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imac Mini &amp; Samsung Galaxy S8 and can log into webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot load it to Outlook on my Desktop or IPAD ???? Both cant log in and say'the password,&nbsp;username combination wrong&nbsp; which it obviously&nbsp;isn't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant understand why you can log in using some&nbsp;hardware but not others&nbsp;using same username details and passwords?&nbsp;Seems nuts to me.</p>
<p>

            On the mac and phone, is the account set up as a Microsoft Exchange account? 
<br />
<br />Did you try to set the account up manually on the ipad, using the same settings as used on the phone?

<p>ON the phone it is set up as an exchange account and was found through the simple set up process from the email address and password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the Imac mini I had to mess with the username to add the company name in front of the email name (i established that from looking at the details on the webmail login details) It is, however, recorded as being an Exchange /Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Desktop because&nbsp;its&nbsp;an exchange&nbsp;account it won't let me try and set up manually and then asks for email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then</p>
<p>
</p><p>brings up this grey Windows security&nbsp;box asking for the password which I give it and it then just goes round and round in this loop asking for my password.</p>

            Screenshot didn't make it - you need to save it as a file and add it or share a link from onedrive or another file share service?

<p>Since the last reply, I have tried the manual set up&nbsp;route on iPad with the details taken from the account set up on the mac mini as I read it off the screen to include email, password, domain, server etc and it still can't log in ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot was only to show the Microsoft grey security&nbsp;box asking for your password so wont bother going to all the hassle for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any way on a PC I can manually set up the account&nbsp;details even though it is an exchange account?&nbsp;</p>

<br />No, not as an Exchange account. You could set it up as imap, assuming the admin has imap enabled for your account. But imap is email-only. 
<br />
<br />Have you asked the admin who gave you the account how to configure it? They may be blocking some devices or outlook versions.

<p>Had wanted to avoid that with&nbsp;the new employer as it sounds stupid that I can log into it on some devices but not others and thus thought that maybe it is a problem others have experienced, hence this forum post hoping to find a simple how to trick.&nbsp; Might
 have no option here but to ask.&nbsp; Why would they lock out PC's ?&nbsp;or Ipads for that matter, surely not.</p>
