Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers.

<br />You should try a USB to Com Port Adapter. (Note I have not used one of these in a few years.)

            If you have a properly installed and working device that converts a USB port to a com port then the software should be able to find the phone when it is plugged in.. Best to check with that device maker's support as well as that of your phone. Windows is neutral to those processes.
<br />
<br />You should also check with the laptop maker's support in case there are issues when using such a device with that laptop's hardware.

            BTW if you have an older device it may not work with the more current BIOS, chipset, and hardware in the new laptop as well as Windows 10. So you may need a newer device.

            Hi Kenzie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br /> 
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam and Display drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on PC sticker.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including BIOS, Chipset, network, USB, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You must now use System Restore to undo the damage. Keep tapping F8 at boot time in order to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then use a restore point that predates the installation of the keyboard splitter software (badware?).

There are numerous options built into Windows to help you get out of this predicament:<br />
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li><li>Ask your friendly computer dealer to reset the password for you</li></ul>
The method with sethc.exe works too but it is complex and requires many additional steps. Did you carefully go through with each of them?<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Bluetooth LE pairing stopped working after recent automatic updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to pair a BLE keyboard with my laptop. I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 about 2 weeks ago. After installing all the necessary drivers for bluetooth 4.0, I was able to pair and connect my keyboard successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But somewhere in these last 2 weeks, it has stopped working. I tried to repair the device. Now, I can't seem to get it to pair again. I initiate the pairing process, but do not see any passkey dialog on the screen. There is no error or related logs in the
 event viewer. The BLE driver status also shows that it is up to date and working properly. The only change that I see, have happened is some automatic updates were installed. One of them is KB3163018. As per the details, it does include bluetooth related fixes.
 Even after uninstalling this update, the problem stays. So I am not sure, if it caused the problem. However, there were some other updates too, which I didn't have the option to uninstall.</p>
<p>I have tried pairing other classic devices such as mobile phone and it works fine.The passkey dialog is shown as expected.&nbsp;<br />
Please help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the PC and the BLE&nbsp;keyboard&nbsp;you are using?</li></ul>
<p>I am using Lenovo G510 laptop with Windows 10.1 Home edition. For bluetooth, the PC is using Broadcom bluetooth adapter with BCM4324 driver. (Bluetooth version 4.0)</p>
<p>The BLE keyboard is an android application which implements HID over GATT protocol. The android device is Nexus 9 with OS version 6.0 (Bluetooth version 4.2)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How do you connect the Bluetooth keyboard? Is it via USB dongle? If so, did you try to change the USB ports to see if it works?</li></ul>
<p>I am trying to pair/connect through Bluetooth Settings screen of the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>No, I don't have any restore point set. The only option I see in recovery settings is to reset or go back to Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you check if the same keyboard works on a different computer?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, the same keyboard works fine with a Mac or another android device. I had it working with this PC also 2 weeks back. I have no idea what changed.</p>
<p>I have already tried "Hardware and Device Troubleshooter". Sadly, it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    My laptop has been having these weird glitches of some sort, where it says "Identifying Internet Access" even though I am connected to the internet.&nbsp;Another weird thing is that the internet still works perfectly fine. I just shrugged it off, but the next
 day&nbsp;it said "Not&nbsp;connected - Connections are available." Just like the day before, the internet still worked fine. Even though my internet still works, can someone&nbsp;tell me a fix?&nbsp;

<h2>            Logged in as a temporary user</h2>
                    Upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 yesterday. Everything seemed ok until today after a restart. Windows will not load my user profile, and will only sign me in as a temporary user. I have signed out and back in, tried signing in as a local user (previous
 windows 7 user profile),&nbsp;restarted, turned off and back on. Account settings and sign in options&nbsp;look to be ok. How do I get my user profile back?

<h2>            Download free blu ray player for windows 8</h2>
                    I just recently updated to Windows 8 and when I tried to install the PowerDVD 10 that came with my Bluray Drive it installed fine but when I tried to play a Bluray it said something about Integrity of Drive or Software or something. So this is why I am
 looking for a new Software. I tried looking online and most are Pay to use like UFUSoft Blu-ray Player or I have never heard of so I dont know if I can trust them.

<h2>            Screen goes blank after installing Adobe Flash player.</h2>
                    <i>WHY DOES MY SCREEN GO BLANK AFTER I UPGRADE ADOBE FLASH PLAER</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>01/05/12<br />
<br />
Hello!<br />
<br />
I just purchased this emachine--windows 7 on 01/04/12 and my old computer was windows xp. I tried to down load my screen savers and after I got their web page up, they advised me that I had to add***adobe flash player ***in order to view their screens. I clicked
 on it---and it did not show up on my desk top. I was choosing my screen savers and then about 10/15 minutes into it---my screen went blank (white)---I could not do anything--no pointer---nothing in the task bar except ***computer protection is off!!!&nbsp; This
 always said it was on until--- I did this adobe flash player. I could not do anything at all---So I turned off the computer and waited a couple minutes and turned it back on. When it came on--- I tried to navigate to control panel to undo what I did and the
 screen went blank (white) again!!!&nbsp; I did the same----turned it off and started over again---I managed to uninstall the Screen Saver Info before it went off again----turned it off and on again---this time it stayed on---I still do not have my screen savers
 and******* I am afraid to try it again*******I may never get it back up again******can anyone help me with this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks.............jj<br />

            &nbsp;Hello,
<div><br />
Which browser&nbsp; is installed on the computer?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Perform steps mentioned below and see if the issue occurs.
<br />
<strong>a:</strong> Choose '<strong>Settings</strong>' from the Flash Player's pop-up menu.
<br />
<strong>b:</strong> Uncheck the <strong>'Enable Hardware Acceleration' <br />
c:</strong>&nbsp; Click <strong>'Close'</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform <strong>System Restore </strong>from <strong>
Windows Recovery environment</strong> using the<strong> Windows Installation disc</strong> and see if the issue persists.</p>

<div>Hi William,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. What exactly do you mean by uploading a CD to Media Player?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. What is the file format of the CD?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Media Player does support MP3 file format.</div>

            Mine is an HP Envy.&nbsp; I have reset to default settings (screen 5 &amp; 10 minutes, system 15 and 30) and it still sleeps after less than 3 minutes inactivity.&nbsp; To be precise, it repeatedly sleeps after 2 minutes and 20 seconds (140 seconds).&nbsp; I timed it 3 times
 consecutively on a stopwatch!&nbsp; Sad but true

<h2>            Windows Update Stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    I just barely got my ASUS K55N-DB81 Laptop and when I try to install updates for windows 8 through windows update, the percentage stays at 0%. This sucks because this is my second ASUS K55N, I sent the other one back because of the same problem, and it
 also had some configuration issues. So this new one I got is still having the windows update problem. How can I fix this? I have 66 updates that need updating but the updates just won't install.

            Hi Abdul,
<div>I have a similar problem with my Acer laptop. Windows detects 71 updates then gets stuck on 0% when trying to download them (it ends up timing out with error code: 80080005). I tried troubleshooting the update software but the troubleshooter retrieved
 error code: 0x80070490 when trying to fix Windows Update Database. This was done under clean boot.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I'm going around to every article I've read with this problem and pasting my findings below because I had the same problem and it drove me up the wall. But first to make sure we are talking about the same issue here is what happened to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System</strong>: Windows 8 (Not 8.1)</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong>: When clicking "check for updates" it would show updates (sometimes) and&nbsp;I'd select the updates I wanted and start the process and it would just sit there. It would say 0% forever. I'd get frustrated and try a solution like the first&nbsp;two
 listed below and nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First, I tried everything. I ran the Windows Update&nbsp;troubleshooting tool everyone keeps referencing.
<strong>This didn't work</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried all the command line options. Variation after variation after variation... none of them worked.
<strong>This didn't work</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THE NEXT ONE WORKED!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I recognize other people might have different factors affecting them which means this might not work but in another thread some guy said he finally got up in frustration and walked away from his computer and then coming back hours later (with the screen
 still on) it was actually updating. It appears there is an issue (from what I can tell unique to Windows 8) where it won't show any progress on updates even though it is downloading them in the background. It then kinda pauses (for god knows how long) and
 then Windows says to itself "well great, I've sat around on my butt long enough and I've downloaded all these updates let's actually install them now and if I feel like it I'll make the progress bar show that I'm working".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to&nbsp;do the same thing... besides at this point I was ready to&nbsp;open up my office window and throw the computer out so it was probably best I step away from it.&nbsp;Here are 3 important points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;The first&nbsp;time it didn't show any progress update. It still showed zero after sitting there forever. I restarted it and then when I went back I noticed that the counter that shows Important and Optional updates had went down because it installed them&nbsp;although
 not a single thing in&nbsp;Windows (progress bar, restart screen where it says "Don't Turn Off Your Computer I'm Updating") showed me that it was working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>b)&nbsp;Next, I thought "okay, I'm going to pick the smallest update on the list." It was about 1.3MB. I installed that one and the progress bar moved half way and then stopped and seemed to freeze. I couldn't actually even click anything on the Windows Update
 box. Instead of restarting I took a post-it note and placed it on the exact line where the progress bar stopped. I checked it 5 minutes later and sure enough it move... by like 5 pixels but it actually moved! Something was happening! Then all the sudden it
 zipped to the end and wanted to restart. I did and everything was fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>c) During this rando Windows "I don't want to tell you I'm doing any kind of updates error" it also wasn't showing the screen where you shut down and restart that says "Don't Turn Off Your Computer&nbsp;Updates Are Being Configured". The screen was actually black.
 At that point I figured I'll give it a shot. Well it&nbsp;appears that it was actually doing that but just showing a black screen because when I got back to Windows they were successfully installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the lesson&nbsp;learned here... wait... just wait a really long time. Get up and pour yourself a glass of wine and do something else because staring at the screen will make you want to lose your mind. Come back after you've watched a movie and see if&nbsp;something
 happened. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some other poor souls out there&nbsp;who spent hours trying other stuff that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- J&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh FML dude are you serious? Dayum! I've got work that needs to be done tonight and it's already getting late! Looks like I'll be pulling an all nighter whether I like it or not.</p>
<p>I've tried a whole bunch of different stuff too and it seems that this is my only other option at this point. Your description sounds a lot like what's happening to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Man, I'd already had this problem the other day I couldn't get it working so I ended up doing a reinstall! I was working tonight when I got the notice again that the computer was going to restart itself in 15 minutes with no option to delay and I had a bad
 feeling it would **** again so I frantically googled for how to stop it from happening. I tried every method I could find in the time I had but none of it ended up making any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I just have to sit and wait (and wait and wait) watching the clock and being pissed while my laptop looks like it's sleeping, wondering if it's actually the same problem as yours and whether anything is actually happening at all or if it is actually
 just sleeping? And then in god knows how long it might - just might - come back to life and start running again?</p>
<p>I'm actually wondering if it would be quicker to do the reinstall again. FML :(</p>

<h2>            Netflix flickering</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so when I go onto netflix on my 360 netflix flickers. It seems to be getting worsworse but I don't know if I just think it is or if it actually is. My 360 is less than a year old, my tv is also less than a year old. I've switched around hd cables.</p>
<p>Etc</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>do microsoft respond to these ever? Because realistically that is what I'm looking for. I am also currently trying to contact them.</p>

<p>The two solutions on the net that I have seen are:</p>
<p>- lower your resolution to 720p (which I did, and it went away but is now back) however I don't feel like I should have to do this, when a) it isn't a problem on games or my desktop, so why should I have to lower it for netflix when I am paying £10 a month
 if I wanna watch it on my 360.</p>
<p>- uninstall the netflix app, clear the cache, then redownload it, log back in of course. And I assume in a few months repeat when it happens again. (I've not yet done this, because I really don't want to)</p>

<p>If there anyone has any suggestion on how to get this solved or if you yourself are having this problem please leave a reply. Hopefully a solution in the form of an update will appear.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;Which type of console are you using? &nbsp;Are connected via HDMI or composite cable? &nbsp;If it's HDMI have you tried using a composite cable?</p>

<p>I think it is an xbox slim?</p>
<p>I am using HDMI, and I have tried a composite cable which did work, however I would like to view netflix in HD because as far as I am aware the netflix app on the 360 does offer this?</p>
<p>thank you for your reply</p>

            <p>Ok, it could be the cable itself then. &nbsp;Do you have another that you could try? &nbsp;If so, do that. &nbsp;If it still has the same problem there may be an issue with the video card/HDMI card and could require a repair of the console.</p>

<p>I have tried another hdmi cable with the same results. however with similar results being displayed across google i doubt it is merely hardware based.</p>
<p>out of interest though if my xbox 360 is malfunctioning after less than 12 months of use am i able to send it back to Microsoft?</p>
<p>the problem that I am having is despite many attempts to contact them and the incredible amounts of notes that people have left online (on this site and others) there seems to be no aim at solving the problem by microsoft..</p>
<p>and considering the fact that people are paying them money that seems more than slightly unfair.</p>

            <p>You can certainly send it in for repairs. &nbsp;As a matter of fact, so long as you registered your console when you purchased it a warranty should still be available on it for the repair. &nbsp;Please click the link and follow the instructions to set up a repair of the console.</p>

<p>I just had this problem and went a couple hours with xbox live support and netflix support. They didn't have any solutions, but I found a video on youtube and sure enough, the problem is definitively an error in the netflix application porting the HD video
 information to the HDMI. The problem is only fixable by using a composite cable instead of the HDMI. I have contacted both Xbox and Netflix with the solution, but I doubt they'll act on it, otherwise there would be an update that would fix the problem right
 after you download the app - and this problem has been around for almost two years that I've seen on these forums.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your input SirLythan. &nbsp;However, this thread is quite old. &nbsp;For future reference it would be better to create a new one instead of bumping an older one.</p>
