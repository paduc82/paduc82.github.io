    <title>&#91;W10&#93; &#91;driver&#93; How 2 install original OEM driver files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#91;W10&#93; &#91;driver&#93; How 2 install original OEM driver files - without OEM installer - on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>I want to install original OEM driver .dll files in windows 10. The OEM does not provide an installer for these files. How can i make windows 10 use the .dll files that i choose?</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the upgrade to windows 10, i have had problems with USB3, battery charging and SSD not working properly (99% busy freezing computer). USB3 no longer reliably reads all devices plugged into it (USB2 is still fine with everything). Battery charging is
 intermittent and moody. I have read that many others are having these issues since upgrading to windows 10. When i first upgraded, I dindt have any issues, but after I did a clean install (because my SSD was too full), the legacy drivers were no longer used,
 and my problems began.<br />
<br />
ASUS provides and installer for 8.1 SATA disk drivers and this allowed me to fix the SSD problem by using the original OEM (Intel supplied) drivers.<br />
<br />
But ASUS doesnt provide an installer for USB3 or battery charging drivers. I have these files copied from a backup of my original OEM windows 8.1 installation. I want to make my computer use these original OEM driver files for USB3 and battery charging.<br />
<br />
I have tried to do this with the Device Manager and it just tells me (incorrectly) that i have the best driver installed. I tried the browse for driver files, and 'have disk' method. they didnt allow me to change the drivers.<br />
<br />
I tried deleting the driver files in question, and it says that only a Trusted Installer can do this.<br />
<br />
How can i make my laptop use the older driver files (that will probably fix all my problems) when I dont have an OEM installer to install them?</p>

<p>
</p><p>To assist you with the issue, you can also do a rollback of driver but this will take your time another problem. The best way to get things done is to call your manufacturer or check on there website if there are files that you can download and have it install

<p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>The option to rollback the driver is grayed out because it is a clean installation.
</p>
<p>Asking the OEM to make the installer is not really practical - even if they do so, it only addresses a single issue, and windows 10 has more than a single issue on upgraded devices. I have already stated in the question that the OEM does not have installers
 for these drivers.</p>
<p>The only practical and acceptable solution is to be able to install original OEM .dll files without an installer.

            Hi<br />
<br />
It seems that you have a Brother Printer configured as a Network printer.<br />
<br />
There is Nothing to look at Network wise<br />
<br />
If you want to connect to the printer for configuration purposes, use the printer's Utility (available on line, or on the printer's drivers CD).<br />

<p>Go to Devices and Printers</p>
<p>Right click on your Brother printer</p>
<p>Select <strong>Printer Properties</strong></p>

    <title>MTP driver apparently OK but not in explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> extremedevil  say:</h3>
<h2>            MTP driver apparently OK but not in explorer</h2>
                    Hi, I recently changed to Win 8.1 (x64) and for some reason the OS is not recognizing my phone or my tablet (both have MTP interface).<br />
<br />
Apparently the drivers (MTP &amp; ADB) are correctly installed, I see both of them on the device manager with no errors, and I can even connect through ADB. Also, in the devices and printers site I see them under the unspecified type. I also see them on the safely
 remove menu (but the icon is a generic device, not a multimedia one).<br />
<br />
I've tried countless solutions, and also all types of drivers. Sometimes I get error 10, sometimes nothing.<br />
<br />
I've read one solution that is to install the media feature pack for N versions of Windows but that's not my version. But then I remembered that I messed up with the system codecs not long ago. Maybe there is a connection?<br />
<br />
Apart for MTP and ADB devices in device manager, I have a hidden device under "other devices" category with the name of the phone (GT-I9300 in this case). That's the name that should be seen on the explorer to access the phone's files.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I can't explorer any android device through MTP.<br />
<br />
Any solution or approach to find the error?<br />
<br />
I will provide any info you guys need.<br />
<br />
Thx in advance!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I understand that you are facing issues while connecting your phone as an MTP device.
</span><span>I will certainly help you with this issue. This issue might occur due to a driver conflict. Before we proceed, I would like to ask you, What the make and model of the phone that you are trying to connect to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods in order to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: Download and install drivers.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To download and install all the drivers, I would recommend you to refer to the following link.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If method 1 does not fix the issue, refer to method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2: Uninstall the Ghost Drivers</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Several things can contribute to the addition of ghost devices in the Windows Device Manager.&nbsp; Some of these include adding or removing hardware.&nbsp; These "ghost" devices can retain Port, SCSI, Target, and logical unit number (LUN) information
 that conflict with the active devices being used by Windows.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, hardware instability can result.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To identify and remove the ghost devices from the Windows Device Manager, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Press Windows Logo + X keys together and select Device Manager from the List.<br />
2. Then, select View from the drop down and select to&nbsp;Show Hidden Devices. <br />
3. At this point, any ghost devices will be seen with lighter, transparent icon and can be removed.<br />
4. Right-clicking the ghost device and selecting "Uninstall".&nbsp; <br />
5. Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues</span><span>, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Thank you</span></span></p>

<div>Right after a fresh reboot, I can open the Mail app and use it for about 20 minutes (sometimes).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Going to another app then going back to it will cause it to show the big blue mail screen with icon centered then it disappears and goes back to the Start Menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UAC is on default.</div>
<div>I'm running dual monitors, lowest resolution is 1920x1080.</div>
<div>I've done a refresh of the system files.</div>
<div>I've deleted my sync'd account and created another local user account.</div>
<div>I've created a 2nd local user account.</div>
<div>I've uninstalled and reinstalled the Mail/etc app.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mail app doesn't work. &nbsp;Calendar does. &nbsp;Weather works sometimes. &nbsp;Messaging always works. People works.</div>
<div>I've updated java x86 and x64 to the latest and greatest available via java.com</div>
<div>I've deleted the Store cache and reinstalled.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can go to the top left corner and slide the mouse down to Mail and tell it Snap Left or Snap Right, and I can see my emails but not the contents. &nbsp;From there if I slide it fullscreen, it crashes again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the latest release version of NVidia drivers as well as the latest beta version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once again, I DON'T HAVE AVAST. &nbsp;</div>

<div>Mail didn't load.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ran selective startup. &nbsp;Mail opened. &nbsp;So I waited and cruised Facebook. &nbsp;Went back to it and same thing. &nbsp;Opens the window icon, closes. &nbsp;Still lets me snap it left or right.</div>

            It's been running for over 12 hours, stuck on "DxDiagCmd".
<div><br />
<div>I'm going to close it and try again after a reboot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit: &nbsp;</div>
<div>After a reboot and running MSDT as admin, it's still stuck on "DxDiagCmd". &nbsp;Been running for over an hour now.</div>
<div>My Bing searches for a fix haven't provided any insight.</div>

            <p><span>After leaving my computer on overnight, as I usually do, the Mail app stops working – when launched it starts them immediately shuts down.&nbsp; If left open
 (and available using tabbing) it opens but any activity – deleting messages for example – immediately closes the app.&nbsp; When in this condition, Store won’t open asking that I try again later and People behaves like Mail.&nbsp; Chrome and other internet connected
 application opens and uses the internet normally.. It also seems that desktop mode apps work correctly – Outlook 2013 for example.&nbsp; When I reboot the PC everything is normal again until it once again goes unused for some amount of time (i.e. overnight) thought
 I have not found out the critical unused time – more than two hours, but exactly how much I don’t know.</span></p>

            <p>Thinking that there is some background activity that is happening when the computer is inactive,&nbsp;I've&nbsp;changed some of my power settings.&nbsp; Now the display dims in 10 minutes-the display turns off in 30 minutes-the computer sleeps after 1 hour and I have to
 enter my password/pin when it wakes up. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These changes have helped to some degree, in that the mail usually come back when the computer emerges from sleep –&nbsp;I've&nbsp;only had the problem once since I made the changes.&nbsp; I’m afraid however, that it has done nothing to cure the underlying cause of the
 problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I might add that when newly emerged from sleep, several of my email accounts do not appear though the unread count shows the correct combined total.&nbsp; After a bit of a wait, however, all the accounts do re-appear, so I’m assuming the delay has something with
 the speed the computer emerges from sleep.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope someone at Microsoft finds this helpful and that perhaps a solution will become available.</p>

            I may have found what might be causing my particular problem - a process called "Runtime Broker" - though a solution has yet to be discovered. &nbsp;This morning I once again found my Mail app opening and immediately shutting down. &nbsp;I went into the task manager
 in 'Ended' the process called "Runtime Broker" then went back to the Mail app and it ran as it should, as did the other Windows Store Apps which are also usually affected when I have a problem with Mail.
<div><br />
<div>Apparently "Runtime Broker" has to do with the state of Windows Store apps that are running in the background. &nbsp;I'd guess that something is causing it fail to manage those states correctly. Maybe someone from Microsoft can provide addition insight - or
 confirmation - and a fix. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do understand that "Runtime Broker" may be running as it should, and that some other activity, process, or app may be interfering with it's correct functioning, but for this morning it seems that ending the process (it seems to restart&nbsp;immediately) has
 solved my problem for now. &nbsp;I'm also relatively sure that at some time in the future (like tomorrow morning) it will have returned.</div>

<h2>            Windows Image Restore Refuses to Recognize WindowsImageBackup Folder on External Hard Drive, and I&#39;ve Tried Everything &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been having severe issues with attempting to restore an image that I made of my computer that is only two days old. After extensive online searching for solutions and using my own knowledge of computers, I've still come up short. I'll explain the
 problem as best I can and detail what I've tried so far to fix it (to no avail):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The Problem:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I was trying to fix the "computer rot" affecting my laptop, so I decided to reformat it using my Windows 7 disk. I made a mistake during the process, and I lost a large portion of my personal data that I very much need to get back for work. Fortunately,
 I very recently made an image of my hard drive only two days ago before I tried reformatting, and I stored it on my Western Digital external hard drive. When I booted up Windows 7's image restore software from the installation disk, the software refuses to
 recognize the existence of the hard drive (which is indeed functional, because I can see and explore it in Windows Explorer once the laptop is fully booted up).&nbsp;</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>My Setup:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>HP Pavilion dv7 Laptop (Product #: LM726AV) with 700GB Internal Hard Drive </li><li>Western Digital Elements 2TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive (Model #: WDBAAU002OHBK)
</li><li>Windows 7 Home Premium (with SP1 and the most recent updates as of March 14, 2012)
</li><li>A "WindowsImageBackup" File (355GB in size and named exactly as it appears in quotation marks)</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Attempted Solutions:</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I first tried using the standard Windows 7 system image restore after booting from my Windows 7 installation disk. This failed because, no matter what I've tried, I cannot get the restore software to recognize my WD external hard drive is plugged in, and
 thus it cannot see the WindowsImageBackup folder. I have tried putting the external HD first in the boot order (didn't work), I have tried searching for drivers for my specific external HD (they don't seem to exist), and I have combed through my BIOS to see
 if there was some relevant setting I needed to find (there weren't any). This frustrates me, as this is the reason I bought my external hard drive in the first place.
</li><li>I have tried putting the WindowsImageBackup folder ON my laptops internal hard drive. Although it did recognize the WindowsImageBackup folder, it turns out you can't re-image a partition using a file on the same partition.
</li><li>I have tried using EASEUS Partition Master to temporarily make a new partition on my laptop's internal hard drive so I could put WindowsImageBackup folder on it. I figured out later that, because my WindowsImageBackup folder (355GB) &nbsp;is just slightly over
 half the size of my hard drives capacity (700GB), I can't actually make both partitions large enough to do this (i.e., trying to image a 355GB partition onto 345GB partition doesn't work).</li></ol>
<div><b>What I Need Suggestions For:</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>What would be the simplest solution would be to somehow get Windows 7 to actually recognize my WD external hard drive after booting from the installation disk. If I could find drivers that would make it realize the hard drive is indeed connected through
 a working USB port, my troubles should be solved. I have no idea why this bug still exists after 3 years of Windows 7 being on the market, but it strikes me as a fairly crucial one to fix (especially before Windows 8 comes out soon).
</li><li>Also, I was wondering if there is any third-party software (such as Acronis or something like that) which would allow me to restore from my Windows-created WindowsImageBackup folder that's stored on my external hard drive. I haven't been able to find any
 so far, but I was hoping that perhaps someone here might notice this.</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so very much for reading through this. I would appreciate any and all help or advice anybody has that would allow me to remedy this unfortunate issue.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All the best,</div>
<div>Nick</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. I've tried all you suggested:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Yes, I tried all USB ports. None worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Running Chkdsk turned up nor fixed anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I have been to those pages before, and I didn't see anything new there that might help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have any other ideas that might help?&nbsp;</div>

            hi there nick: what a fantastic help you get from this site, no? it's been more than 2 1/2 months since you posted this, and nobody but NObody bothers to try a serious answer. I am having the selfsame problem, windowsimagebackup not recognizing my external
 hard drive with the image on it. someone suggested I should 'demolish' the HD and put it inside my desktop pc. HA!!!<br />
<br />
but maybe, just maybe, in the meantime, you have received something that works? in that case, would you be so kind and tell me/us?<br />

Hello All,<br />
<br />
I found out that you MUST have the folder WindowsImageBackup on the root of the usb drive for the Windows 7 Setup to recognize it.<br />
If you copy the backup elsewhere the setup didn't find any images.<br />

            Sorry to answer this so late, but perhaps some other guys can have the same problem.<br />
so for me the problem comes from the utilization of an external hard drive usb 3.0.<br />
indeed the recovery disk from windows 7 (32 or 64) don't load natively the drivers for the usb 3.0 so your external hard drive isn't correctly detected.<br />
You can try to put the drivers usb3.0 on a usb key to load them at the recovery program, the driver you must load are:<br />
iusb3xhc.cat<br />
iusb3xhc.inf<br />
iusb3xhc.sys<br />
nusb3hub.cat<br />
nusb3hub.inf<br />
nusb3hub.sys<br />
ou can find them into the c:\windows\system32 (you do a search here for nusb* and isub*, you'll find them easily<br />
<br />
for me this method doesn't work but for some guys on internet that works that's why i put it here.<br />
<br />
the method that works for me is to install a windows 8 or 8.1 and burn a recovery cd from it.<br />
indeed the windows 8 or 8.1 have the usb3 drivers which work natively so no problem with the harde driver 3.0<br />
<br />
you can also put your windowsimagebackup on a external hard drive 2.0 or lower, it ll work but it's much slower and with a data save at 30go and more, you know the difference.<br />
<br />
Some other guys tell to me to use macrium reflect or other but the advantage on the use o windowsImageBackup its if i want to restore an image from a i3 to a i7 computer, it works. i have just added the driver from the new computer with drivermax for example
 and its quite fun.<br />
if you try to do the same with macrium it never works.<br />
<br />
so when you'll have a network with a lot of different hardware when you use macrium you'll have a ton of image for each hardware. And i your work with WindowsImageBackup, you have just Image for each software. (this works only on windows 7 and upper) if your
 computers network are one xp keep going with macrium<br />
<br />
regards guys<br />
<br />

            <p>If you have a System Image Backup which System Recovery will not restore, you have a couple of options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Mount the VHD containing your old C drive (or whatever) and recover lost documents etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Use a different utility to restore the VHD to the hard drive.</p>

            <p>OK, so it's Hotmail that's removing messages from your <em>Deleted items </em>
folder; they are kept for, I think, ten days and are recoverable for some time after that - perhaps 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You shouldn't use the <em>Deleted items </em>folder as an archive for this reason. Get into the habit of moving read messages to a different folder so they're not automatically deleted.

<h2>            Getting Event ID 10016 for several CSID and APPID</h2>
                    <p>Asked to look at a laptop that keeps crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not entirely convinced that this is the problem but the event log shows hundreds of Event 10016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a few articles on this problem ( the Microsoft one is useless ) which involve finding the CLSID/APPID in the registry, taking ownership of the keys and rights, then going into Com Exp to set the required permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is&nbsp;the number of errors involve numerous CLSID/APPID, what is common to them all (that I have checked) is "Unavailable SID" so even if I did trawl through who am I changing access for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the best of my knowledge no user has ever been removed so it is not that a known SID is missing.</p>

    <title>Movie Maker 2.6 Audio track inconsistency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dans186  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker 2.6 Audio track inconsistency</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows MM 2.6 for many years, without any problem. Just recently, in the last two projects I've done, it started giving me trouble. When I import certain audio clips, they are not as they ought to be. For instance, I import a 19 second audio
 clip, and it shows as a 32 second audio clip. If I play the project from the beginning, there seem to be no issues, but if I try to skip around in the timeline, the audio dos not play as it should, as in, it will play at a point inconsistent with where the
 timeline ought to sync up. This is happening with other audio files as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If I drag my audio into the audio timeline spot, and skip to say, 5 minutes into the project and hit play, the audio will not play from a point 5 minutes into the track, it may play from something like, 3 and a half minutes into the audio track. This
 makes it impossible to sync up my video since the audio track is incorrect and inconsistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If anyone has had this issue, or has any thoughts, I'd love to hear them. I tried reinstalling WMM2.6 once, but Maybe I'll try again.</p>

            Hey Dan ! I had the same problem and i found out how to fix this. The audio format you are using is not ''very'' compatible with MM 2.6. The software will accept it but will completly &nbsp;mess it up. what i am using is &nbsp;FORMATFACTORY. google that. you can
 change any type of audio, video, picture within seconds.. So you need to change your audio format to lets say MP3. that will work perfectly. heres my email if you need something else<br />

            This suggests to me that the issue may be with the cd/dvd drive rather than anything software based. It could even be something as simple as the lens needing a clean.&nbsp;Have you noticed any faults when trying to play a commercial CD or DVD disc? Replacing
 the drive is relatively inexpensive&nbsp;if necessary, but I'd try a cleaning disc that is suitable for use in PCs&nbsp;in the first instance... btw is this a laptop or a desktop PC?&nbsp;

<p>Okay, so am I the only one who hates the Oblivion way to level up? &nbsp;You have the perfect +5/+5/+5 and then you have the +5/+5/+1. &nbsp;But it drives me crazy when playing to think about having to level up a certain way to optimize my attributes. &nbsp;And if you
 do it wrong, you could potentially pay for it after 50-60 hours of gameplay. &nbsp;I hate hate hate that. &nbsp;Please tell me Skyrim isn't like that. &nbsp;I love Oblivion but the leveling system keeps me from playing it all the way through. &nbsp;Because I want to do everything
 - and by the time everything gets done, all the creatures could possibly be too powerful if I don't have my stats right.</p>

<p>Personally ive always liked the oblivion leveling compared to the fallout leveling, it just seems odd to me that i will get 20 headshots then suddenly i can hack or pick locks better!! as far as the secondary skills go i think things like jumping/lockpicking/stealing
 should only earn XP by actually doing them, NOT by kills.</p>

<p>that depends on the system they use. i mean yeah, you shouldn't necessarily get xp from the actual kill, but by using the strength and stamina and whatever else for aiming and recoil and all that needed to make the kill, sorta like the oblivion system. that
 is something i would like to see in the next fallout, but i doubt it because bethesda seems to be removing as many rpg elements as possible in order to make it more "streamlined".

<p>I liked the idea of the Oblivion level system in that you level up the skills you actually use. &nbsp;As long as the level system in Skyrim is intuitive, rewards the player for his/her actions, and helps enhance the gameplay then it's fine by me.</p>

<p>i'd love to see some kind of "arcade" &nbsp;system that shows the xp float up when you hit something or otherwise gain experience. sort of like borderlands or dragon age and so on and so forth.</p>

</p><p>As you can see here, whenever I click on the overflow arrow to show hidden icons on my taskbar, the menu thing appears behind the taskbar, hiding a few icons. I recently installed a mouse driver, which is hidden by the taskbar and can never access the software
 from here, which is quite annoying, since its the&nbsp;fastest way to open it. I have tried closing some of these apps, but it still appears behind the taskbar, no matter how small&nbsp;it gets. I have also tried&nbsp;changing the size of the taskbar, but nothing has worked.
 Does anyone have a fix? </p>

            Hi Adam, this is a known issue with DPI scaling in Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Desktop Settings 
<br />
<br />What Scale factor is set there 
<br />
<br />Click Custom Scale and adjust your Scale factor 
<br />
<br />Log out and back in to Windows 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this is resolved, if not, adjust the scale factor and log out and in, until you can see all the icons

            Hi, Rae66
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />When you reset your network, Windows will forget your Ethernet network, along with all your Wi-Fi networks and passwords. It will also forget additional connections, such as VPN connections or virtual switches, that you’ve created. Resetting will disable and then reinstall all your network adapters and set other networking components back to their original settings. You’ll even have to run through the questions you saw when you first installed Windows where you select whether you want your PC to be discoverable on the network.
<br />Once you’ve exhausted your other troubleshooting efforts, resetting the network is easy. Open Windows Settings by pressing Start and clicking the Settings button (or just by pressing Windows+I on your keyboard). On the Windows Settings screen, click “Network &amp; Internet.”
<br />On the “Network &amp; Internet” page, select the “Status” tab on the left and then, on the right, scroll down and click the “Network reset” link.
<br />The “Network reset” screen warns you about what will happen when your network is reset and also lets you know that a restart will be necessary. Click the “Reset now” button to reset the network and restart your PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

            Hi Rae.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>

<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

            It depends when. When i restart no it isnt so i need to go into network adapters and enable it. When it drops out, only the one wifi is shown and all others have disappeared. Again, i do all the troubleshooting with only limit time suceess before it drops
 out. I'm a point to recover an old version of windows and be done with this version. I did the one option to perform the analysis of the wifi and have the wlan report. I was hoping microsoft would look at to see if there something there that would assist in
 finding a solution.&nbsp;

</p><p>I've tried to post it directly into my youtube account and then I get a message of error with the code 0x800488FB.</p>
<p>

<p>Can you verify whether you are talking about saving the project or the movie?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save the project, you are using <strong>File &gt; Save project</strong>. The result is a .wlmp project file which contains the save state of your project so you can come back and make future edits. Is that what you are having problem saving? If so, what
 is the specific error you get?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are you instead talking about saving the *movie* using <strong>File &gt; Save movie</strong>. The result of that is a .mp4 movie file which is a playable video/audio file saved to your PC. If you are seeing problems during that process, can you explain exactly
 what you see on the screen. What is the exact error message? How far into the rendering (%) are you when you get the error? Have you ever been able to save this project as a movie? Have you tried making a second copy of the project (File &gt; Save project as)
 and using that instead? Also, if you do make a copy of the project, try deleting parts of the project from the end until the movie will save. How much of the movie can you save this way?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting the error with the second option (after I finish the project and want to save it as a file on my computer). The error message I get is that standard text that can happen with all of the other applications, something along the lines of "Windows
 Media Player stopped working and has to shut down". I get this message immediately after I choose where I want to save the file (and I've tried a couple different places) and click save. That's when it shuts down.</p>

            <p>You have probably already tried this if you've been checking the forums, but for me what worked was ensuring that my domain account DOES NOT HAVE local admin rights on the computer.&nbsp; If I want to install programs etc, I have to enter my personal account
 username and password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp;computer (MacBook air 2011 with win8 pro) started out with my personal account with local admin rights, then my IT guys joined my computer to the domain, creating a second account on the machine, without local admin rights.&nbsp; So far the apps have been
 working fine for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the first go around they gave me local admin rights, and most apps did the splash screen / close thing. Others have had this same experience.</p>

            Honestly I have read a lot about this. There are so many posts that MS needs to make some sort of announcement. There are a lot of theories as to what is causing the issue and most of them seen to be centered around Anti-Virus, Firewalls and such. I have
 read that Windows 8 has beefed up it's security and anti-virus protection with Windows Defender. I had the same issues as everyone else. My metro apps would not work. Click them, you get a splash screen, and then it appears to be loading with the spinning
 dots in a circle and that is all I could get. I worked on it for 2 days and with extreme frustration. I took some advice of some of the other people having the same issue and I completely uninstalled Mcafee Security Suite, re-booted the computer and low and
 behold, that solved "my" issue. As for others I can not say. I never once refreshed or recycled it. I wish I had just done this a couple of days ago! I hope you make the correct decision for yourself. I now have no 3rd party anti-virus anyt

            If you are running the latest version of Windows 10, 1709, it might be related to a bug:
<br />
<br />RDP client (mstsc.exe) crashes within a minute after establishing a remote session.	
<br />
<br />Workarounds:
<br />· Disable redirected printers.
<br />· Use UWP RDP app.
<br />Fixed for future updates. Pending fix for current update.
<br />
<br />Get Microsoft Remote Desktop - Microsoft Store

            If one of the PCs has1709 version of Windows Installed then it is a known issue. As said, you can try disabling shared printers. Otherwise the fix would be up next week on Patch Tuesday.
<br />Hope that helps!

            Hello Rodlo!
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to change the unit of measurement in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Close all open applications. Click the Windows button and then click Settings options.
<br />Select the Time &amp; language option
<br /> In this window, make sure that the Region &amp; language option is selected on the sidebar, then select the Additional date, time, &amp; regional settings
<br />Within this window, click on Region option
<br /> Within this dialog box, make sure that the Formats tab is selected, and click the Additional settings option
<br />Make sure that you are on the Numbers tab. Then locate the Measurement system option, click it, and choose Metric
<br />Click the OK button to apply changes..
<br />
<br />Hope this helped!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is already in Metric on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is setup in New Zealand Home Location so it is already setup in Metric.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fea3626-6114-47c9-bb8b-47e164586935?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7fea3626-6114-47c9-bb8b-47e164586935?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that, Cortana is working on my Windows 10 PC with Metric, but on the Invoke, she is saying in US measurement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in both between New Zealand and US and need to hear the right units where ever I am at the time. (In NZ now.)</p>
<p>

            To get Cortana to switch to Metric for weather you have to do it the weather app. 
<br />Go to search and type weather and open it.
<br />Then top left the 3 lines click that and go the bottom where you see settings.
<br />You will see it there.
<br />I had to do this cause I am in Canada and we use  Metric as well.
<br />Celsius is where it's at ;)
<br />
<br />Let me know if that's what you were looking for.

<h2>            Game Freezes, then forces Xbox to shut down</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot even play the first level. Once I got to a point where it would let me play, the graphics would just keep glitching. It then would follow by completely freezing and shutting my XB1 off (forcefully). I have power cycled, unplugged all the cords,
 uninstalled then re-installed the game and keep encountering the same issue. It is unplayable at the moment. My last resort is to set to factory defaults (which I am avoiding, if possible). This is the second game I have encountered this issue (the other was
 COD: Ghosts). I am to the point where I am ready to exchange this for another console or just buy a 360 again. Any help that anyone can offer is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>It does not recognize my disc half the time, kicks me to xbox home when I try to play co-op most of the time, sticks in load frame constantly, bugs, errors, getting stuck in walls, etc. Ubisoft says they will replace the game cd if I pay a $20 fee lol. I
 am returning to Amazon for a replacement. Hopefully it helps! Ohhhh, took me 12 hrs for initial install from their servers using 54k internet (usually takes me 20 minutes at most for any other game, including the previous AC Black Flag). Really dissappointed
 I am having so many issues with this game. Have uninstalled and reinstalled, only took 4 hrs this time @_@ Hope everyone else is having better luck!</p>

            My settings are the same as iFiredog said in that thread.&nbsp; I'm guessing maybe my Norton could be blocking the port?&nbsp; I'll google Norton and see how to turn it off or allow the ports.

            Norton doesn't allow the port settings that I need for charter email so I'm assuming that's why I can't send emails. I found old pop settings and entered those and it's working with those settings.&nbsp;

<p>Unplug the Xbox for 30 seconds and plug it back in (it will fix it). The other option is to change power options to Energy Savings (the Xbox will just boot up slowly).</p>
