            Hello,<br />
Power-cycle mostly helps, but it also might be a problem of Xbox live itself or a new updete from Insider preview ring (experienced it myself)

<h2>            Surface Book New Update Worst Ever&#33; Affected Windows Hello, Tablet Detachment, Projection Mode, Pen Capabilities, Track pad Gestures, Apps Crashing, etc.</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Rishi. I have a Surface Book with </p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6600U CPU @2.60GHz 2.81 GHz </p>
<p>Installed Ram: 16.0 GB</p>
<p>Edition Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Version 1803 Installed on 04-06-2018</p>
<p>OS build 17134.167</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this new update, I am not able to do:</p>
<p>1. Windows Hello not working!</p>
<p>2. Surface Pen not able to write anything (Note: Pen Connected and even rubber double tap works). Thus, unable to use Pen supported apps such as OneNote, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Not able to detach into Tablet Mode&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If I want to extend or project my display, it doesn't support.</p>
<p>5. In the initiation of Surface the display adapter fails and black screen appears and message is displays that it failed after display appers within 5 seconds.</p>
<p>6. Some apps like Fresh Paint not working at all. Even some stops working i.e. Crashes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that Microsoft is reputed and I believe in you. After buying such expensive Surface device, I don't want it's productivity to be ruined. Please give premium service to Surface segment at least and test your updates prior to it's final release so that
 it won't cause hindrance to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will be great if you come up with new update asap to solve this issue. </p>
<p>Thank you!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you try simplifying your configuration before allowing the re-install?&nbsp; Sounds like you have something always there and interfering, so then you have to guess at what that might be and get rid of it temporarily.&nbsp; Typical examples are security packages.&nbsp;
 In my case I frequently have had to uninstall Hyper-V before getting a cumulative update which doesn't cause performance problems.&nbsp; Fortunately, lately I have not had to take such strong measures but I haven't seen the new update yet so thanks for the "heads
 up". &nbsp; ; )</p>

    <title>GTA 4 &#40;PC&#41; help, Games for windows live support page is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reckoning833  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA 4 &#40;PC&#41; help, Games for windows live support page is down..&#63; This is the closest related forum I could find</h2>
                    So I bought a game from steam a while back, GTA IV. (the PC edition of course) it was a midweek sale. when I bought it, it came with gta: san andreas, gta4, and episodes from liberty city. I never had an xbox or anything, and gta4 uses games for windows
 live (for a reason only god knows). So I had to make a LIVE account and everything. I finally get into the game after making like 8 different accounts for services. When I get into the game, I notice that you have to launch episodes from liberty cities from
 WITHIN gta4. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rT94CIk.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the title screen looks like this</a>, giving you the option to play gta4 or one of the episode from liberty cities. I wanted to play one of the EFLC one day, so I clicked play on the right
 side of the screen. then I was prompted to choose which episode I wanted to play. The problem is the same for both of them. When I click play on either episode, it brings me to a LIVE overlay that
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/z8xNO7k.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">looks like this.</a> So I hit redeem code (in hopes that I could download it in steam if they game me a key). And here's where my problem starts. It brings me to
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/H18ZdUi.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this error</a>. So I click ignore, and try to hit the download button instead. Same error. So I just hit "troubleshoot" and it sends me to
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/MhRrnJm.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a support page that isn't even there!</a> "More information" sends me to the same broken link/page. I then just tried to open the games for windows live program it installed by itself on my computer and
 it gives me <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zpBDxrC.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this error upon opening.</a>&nbsp; It's not my internet or computers fault. They're both flawless.<br />
TL;DR: I never asked to use LIVE, and I never want to (I even bought the game ON STEAM), and it's giving me so much trouble.<br />
questions:<br />
1. Is anyone else having this problem?<br />
2. Can I play my games that I spent money for?<br />
3. Where else could I post this in addition to get more help?<br />

            If it's any consolation MS is shutting the much hated GFWL down in, I think, June this year.
<br />
GTA4&nbsp; is renown for it's problematic install/activation process, as is the game for it's<br />
poor optimisation from console to PC. <br />
Why Steam versions require GFWL is even more bizarre in many eyes, but probably has to
<br />
do with Monopoly$oft wanting a share of the&nbsp; $$, or maybe it's just because of the multi-player option being linked to GFWL.<br />
<br />
I don't the details of the Steam version ,but with the retail disk version of GTA4 you need to download and install the more recent version of the GFWL client to get it to function correctly.<br />
The Steam keys are just another layer of trouble.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/games/en-US/Support/Pages/technicalIssues.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Games for Windows - LIVE : Support Documents</a>&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
- The best way to get around the GFWL issue&nbsp; with the retail disk version is to use what is<br />
called an&nbsp; <i>xliveless&nbsp; </i>fix. This replaces the xlive.dll in the game. I don't think you can play<br />
on line when using this though ( I never tried the on line play).<br />
You can find xliveless fixes on the modding&nbsp; sites, but you would want to verify they can be used<br />
with the Steam version without getting into trouble with Steam (potential for account being closed).<br />
<br />
When the almost universally hated GFWL&nbsp; (anyone who does not hate it must live in a very<br />
strange space - lol ) does finally shut down things are likely to get very interesting and
<br />
frustrating depending on the developer/publisher of those games that used GFWL, <br />
as it will be up to them to migrate to Steam or put out a patch that stops the need for GFWL,
<br />
so&nbsp; there could be a lot of games that become unplayable (unless they have xliveless fixes).<br />
- The only news I've heard so far is the Batman Arkham series games are being migrated to
<br />
Steam, with a result of the game saves not being functional (due to yet another totally
<br />
A-retentive copy protection concept that for mysterious reasons links the games saves to the DRM).<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, MS has already shut down the GFWL marketplace, and apparently the support site<br />
( so thoughtful - NOT....)<br />
<br />
In spite of the GFWL connection to MS, the closest related forums for GTA 4 would be -<br />
1) For questions relating to Steam and their codes for the game, or other possible differences
<br />
from the retail disk version that&nbsp; may be in the Steam version - The Steam forums.<br />
<br />
2) The Rockstar GTA forums or one of many other GTA sites, including the GTA&nbsp; modding sites.<br />
<br />
btw - I never asked to use Steam either, but even when buying retail disks I've been forced<br />
to use Steam on over a dozen occasions. <br />
This was extremely frustrating when still on dial-up and having to patch games before being
<br />
allowed to play. I couldn't play FEAR 2 for nine months because of patches that were about 1GB,<br />
and Steams self centred - 'if your not on high speed internet, tough luck' attitude.<br />
People love Steam, but it's just another avaricious corporation like Monopoly$oft.
<br />

            Yeah, I use to hate steam when my internet was bad too. It's really annoying not being able to play games after you buy them because of an update..<br />
Anyways, thanks for the reply, helped a bunch!<br />

 one of the most profitable games of all time. It blows my mind that I can't find one coherent patch to make GTA 4 (steam version) run on Windows 8.1 (Have an Asus ROG laptop with Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M, Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @2.5Ghz). I have about 40+/-
 browser tabs open with different/conflicting advice how to troubleshoot this game, and keep on making minute progress until reaching another error that either forbids play, crashes the game, or freezes my whole system. Rockstar makes so much money, it's absolutely
 inexcusable that they sell such junk. I have already spent 5 hours trying to make their game playable and have decided I'd have an easier time picking up a new programming language by tomorrow or hand solving a couple differential equation problems in complete
 darkness, than play this game tonight (without handicapping the online component of the game with the xliveless mod).</span></p>

    <title>Skype birthdays in Windows Live calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeuth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype birthdays in Windows Live calendar</h2>
                    My Skype account and Microsoft account became linked when I signed in on the Metro client. Now the birthdays of my Skype contacts are showing up in my calendar, which I don't want. I can turn off the birthday calendar entirely, but I want it&nbsp;to be on for
 contacts from services that I care about. Is there a way to stop Skype from polluting my calendar short of unlinking the accounts?

            Same here. I have many, many contacts on Skype that I don't care for. Now imagine that in calendar live tiles on win 8 and win phone 8 there is only space for one entry. This is now always blocked with something like hululila78's birthday instead of meeting with important customer. I usually don't even know who is behind these silly nicknames. The merger if all contacts into one big soup is ****. I had my worlds neatly separated and Skype was always a bit messy.

            Thanks for the advice, but this is not what I am looking for either. I am having the same issue. I don't remember everyone's birthday's so i like that it syncs, however the app would be much better if you could delete individual events such as birthdays
 of Skype contacts you rarely talk to or FB friends that you aren't that close with. This auto sync is a good idea in theory but really annoying in reality. I want my google calendar to synce but not everything else, is there a way to isolate which accounts
 sync? I even unlinked my Skype account from Microsoft and the birthdays still showed up in my live calendar.

Unfortunately this doesnt really solve my problem, either. As everybody above me mentioned there should be a possibility to disable the import of skype birthdays to the calendar. Its really anoying and the only workaround is to lose all birthdays? Not satisfying
 at all :-/<br />

            <p>Agreed. This is incredibly frustrating, and overwhelmingly stupid. I used to actually use Skype but I've uninstalled it everywhere except one machine, and I've unlinked my accounts from Skype.</p>
<p>This Birthday issue and the "Skype rings on EVERY machine and doesn't stop ringing when I answer on ANY machine" really makes me wonder who's in charge of QA.</p>
<p>They've managed to take a mediocre but usable product and turn it into something approaching malware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And don't get me started about the advertisement infestation. Yuch.<br />

            This problem makes the calender worthless which removes a huge chunk of the funcionality of a smarthphone. I keep getting stupid skype contacts (which are my clients) birthday notifications. They don't even have real names on skype. I wish to have facebook

            It's absurd that this is still a problem two years later. It really stupid that strangers that might have gotten onto your contact list momentarily will have their birthdays permanently linked to your calendar forever.

            Hi Roman, I had a look at the specs for your system . . .
<br />
<br />If you do decide to run Windows 10, go for the 32bit version!
<br />
<br />The 64bit version of Windows 10 will not run on your Sony Vaio
<br />
<br />Your system is just about good enough for the 32bit version, Windows will use about 1GB RAM and that will leave you enough ram for your applications and open documents. Your Processor is at the bottom end, but will work . . .       
        </p>

    <title>External Hard Drive Not Working, Possibly Corrupted&#59; How to make - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Not Working, Possibly Corrupted&#59; How to make it functional again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys! </p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago, I started getting notifications on my PC that my external hard drive had a problem and needed to be fixed. I ignored the notification, as I was able to use the device just fine. Then two days ago, I tried deleting a file on it (Minecraft),
 but the delete window didn't even pop up. It was then that I decided to format the device. This was when the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first sign of the problems to come was the notification "<em>windows was unable to complete the formatting".
</em>After repeated attempts to format the device and with the constant failure, I decided to look up the problem. The solutions displayed were moslty composed of recovering the data, however there were some that I thought relevant. I've tried using CMD(Administrator),
 diskpart, disk management etc. All of these methods have failed. When I used diskpart, I almost always failed when entering the command "<em>clean</em>"(I only succeeded once, but failed later), disk management was unable to format the device when creating
 a new simple volume as well. In desperation I've tried using MiniTool and EaseUS, but both failed(I tried both twice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the specs of the external hard drive(as far as I know):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seagate Expansion Drive (465 GB)</p>
<p>USB 3.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screenshot below. The disk is labelled as "<em>Disk 1</em> ".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee09228e-7733-463c-976e-ab27e216f0e1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee09228e-7733-463c-976e-ab27e216f0e1?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Aman, well you have done everything correctly and tried all the steps that any of us would suggest . . .
<br />
<br />If anything can get that drive back it will be the free version of AOMEI Partition Assistant

<p>Really? How will Partition Assistant save a failing drive, if that's what's happening?&nbsp; What about Seagate's own diagnostic utility?</p>

<p>One more suggestion - do you have (ans use) Y-connector? May be the problem is in insufficient power. Or did you use extension cord?</p>

</p><p>If you have a problem sending or receiving mail, please use the <em>Ask a question
</em>option on the <em>Participate </em>menu to start your own thread about your unique problem. Because every mail server has its idiosyncrasies and there are so many settings involved, a solution for one user will rarely be helpful for another. There can
 be no troubleshooting of a problem like this without seeing the entire error message verbatim. It's the only clue we have to what's wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inability to send or receive messages is almost always caused by problems at the server or by inappropriate settings in the client. Repairing the Windows Essentials installation will almost never mitigate messaging errors, but it won't hurt, either.</p>

<h2>            Unable to get DHCP client service to start automatically</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a computer that was recently infected with a fake AV protection virus.&nbsp; The user removed the virus using Microsoft Essentials and Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Afterwards, they were unable to connect to a network with either the wired or wireless network
 cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The afd.sys file had been deleted and was stopping DHCP client from starting up.&nbsp; As soon as I restored AFD, I was able to manually start DHCP client.&nbsp; At this point, I was able to connect to the network and get on the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is as soon as I restarted the computer and logged back into Windows, DHCP client is not automatically starting as it should per the setting.&nbsp; I can still go in and start it manually, but it will not start by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using Winsock fix, the different netsh commands, /flushdns and /release&amp;renew, tdsskiller, and a number of other programs that I've come across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is running Windows XP Service Pack 3</p>
<p>Microsoft Essentials, Malwarebyes, Superantispyware, and CCleaner are all installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to get this to start running automatically without having to do a reinstall of Windows XP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br />
This may mean that you have a SATA drive.&nbsp; If so, you need to enable something like "legacy mode" in the BIOS before you can use the XP CD to do a reinstall (unless you have a floppy drive to add in the SATA drivers or slipstream a CD with the SATA drivers).<br />

<h2>            printing problems keep getting error message 105-100003</h2>
                    I have installed a kodak Esp-3 printer on my pc/mac systems. i have connected this printer to a hub that is connected to a base station called Airport Xtreme from mac.I use the bonjour progam to work with my windows pc.I'm able to print from mac.
<u>when I try to print from my pc using kodak printer,it said error 105-100003.</u>Windows 7 said that there is no problem with the printer. I contacted kodak for troubleshoot,spent almost two hours on the phone with no result. They say the problem is windows.The
 sharing feature in my Hp s7700y pc windows 7 OS is not accepting my sharing network.I also have another printer{brother intell-2820} connected the same way and My pc can print on this printer with no problems.Why I can't use the network option with the codak
 printer. Both printers are recognized by bonjour and my home network.

<p>Does the printer work if connected through the USB port?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would presume, since you spoke with Kodak, that you have the latest driver for the printer installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,I'm thankful for your reply to my question. I am still in the same boat. The error message still pop-up 105-100003. I did follow all the instructions with the clean boot-and no results yet. thanks again. I have no problem printing from my mac to both
 printers. I can only print to my brother-2820 printer from my PC. If I can use both printers with the mac.I should be able to do the same with my PC(w-7OS.} Both are connected using USB cables and a hub to my airport Xtremebase station. &nbsp;

<p>has anyone figured out the multiplayer online with this game ?</p>
<p>seems that there are no cops and just a series of short uneventfull races. only played for a few hours but was very disapointed and got bored with it. nothing at all like the first most wanted or hot pursuit both games waaaaay better than this P.O.S. game.</p>
<p>NFS games seem to just get worse and worse the run was a flop and this one seems to be heading the same way.You would think these game makers could figure it out but i guess not LAST game that I ever pre order.</p>
<p>I hope somebody has some secrets that I havent figured out yet. otherwise this game just SUCKS!! for online play stick with hot pursuit !!</p>

<p>I almost got the newest Need For Speed game but opted for Madden 13 instead. They haven't been the same since the Most Wanted game for the old xbox. I played that game a lot and even won a few races :) . My favorite car in that game was Webster's Corvette.</p>

            <p>One way to check would be to boot from a System on a CD and then check your hard drive.&nbsp; Since you state that you don't have any CDs, I suggest that you create a free Hirens Boot CD.&nbsp; Download the file from the following site.&nbsp; Don't be fooled by advertising
 downloads, the real download box is&nbsp;the light-green rectangle at the bottom with a disk icon in it.<br />
<br />
Hirens:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&gt;<br />
<br />
Then use the procedure here to burn a bootable CD:<br />
&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/</a>&nbsp;&gt;<br />
<br />
You should then be able to boot your system from this CD.&nbsp; At the first screen, choose "Mini Windows XP" and wait for it to finish booting.&nbsp; You can then check your disk like any other disk using "chkdsk".<br />

<h2>            Unknown Device On Home Network.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I noticed a device called iCamera on my home network under cameras.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94f490ba-1845-4ad8-b046-da2428fa234a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94f490ba-1845-4ad8-b046-da2428fa234a" /></a></p>
<p>After a while of being online, it seems to disappear, only to reappear with a new MAC address. Does anyone know what this might be and how to get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note: We never bought any wireless cameras,</p>

            Could be an App loaded on any phone or device you have. Do you have kids?<br />
<br />
Could be a neighbor's alarm cam, maybe mounted outside.<br />
<br />
Check with router maker's support, documentation, and forums for the method to block the&nbsp;device. Having a password for router is one step. You can also block that specific device.<br />

<h2>            videocall</h2>
                    Hi, the problem is that when i call to my partner, for an hour everything is alright, however, sometimes if we watching something, or playing or whatever we do, skype decided to switch off my camera when i didn't even touch it or my partner trying to switch
 it on, but i can't see him, and its actually shows that camera is on. Sometimes even on/off camera doesn't help so need to recall to have camera on again. And the big problem is, sometimes we just leave videocall overnight, and what happens, skype actually

    <title>Share system sound doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. bones.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Share system sound doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running the most recent version of Skype on Windows 10 (Not the built in Windows 10 application), and I'm having issues getting Share system sound to work.<br />
<br />
It used to work, no problems whatsoever, but now when I click on Share system sound, nothing happens. The option doesn't change into Stop sharing system sound either.<br />
<br />
My friend running Windows 10 as well, also not running the built in App, same version, is able to use his option just fine.<br />
<br />
What I've tried so far:<br />
</p>
<p>- Reinstall Skype</p>
<p>- Checked if there's updates</p>
<p>- Verified version (7.39.0.102)</p>
<p>- Deleted the Skype folder in AppData/Roaming</p>
<p>- Restarted PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>But sadly, no changes.<br />
<br />
It DOES work when I use the Windows 10 App, but I do not like using that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this issue?</p>

            They were actually disabled in 2001 with the introduction of "Office XP", and totally removed for good in late 2002 with the release of Office 2003.
<div><br />
<div>You can restore them to 2003 with some system registry modifications and careful file replacements, but it's not supported. &nbsp;And this can't be done at all in Office 2007 forward.</div>

<h2>            Switch Windows S mode to Enterprise</h2>
                    <p>I'm in a company, we purchased volume license of Windows 10 Enterprise. </p>
<p>These days when I re-imaged one Surface Laptop with a clean image (version 1803), the OS went to S mode.</p>
<p>Even after I typed in our license, it said I have a digital license, and the OS was still in S mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want use Windows Store to get a "free" upgrade to Enterprise, because:</p>
<p>1. We purchased legal license.</p>
<p>2. Devices are imaged to domain user, they needn't and they shouldn't use Windows Store AT ALL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            Hi there ZhaoStar! Unfortunately the only way to switch out of S mode is trough the store. S mode is specifically made to only interact with windows programs, and the store.
<br />
<br />You should use the Store to go to enterprise, its not really a free upgrade, its just turning S mode off.

            No, im sorry. The way Microsoft designed windows 10 was to start everyone off on base, and have them use their keys to activate the home/pro/enterprise versions. Really the only way from S mode is to use the store.

            Hi Zhao.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should obtain Enterprise installation media from the Volume Licensing Service Center here using your account:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecent...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're maintaining multiple machines then use SysPrep to generalize the install for mass deployment via image:  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/dd744512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versi...</a>(v%3dws.10)
<br />
<br />Make sure S mode is disabled in the image.  To do this initially use the Store to toggle it off (not upgrade) or ask the VLSC whose Support comes with your licenses.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Thank you very much, however none of these methods resolved the issue. I was able to download windows 10 from the windows update file, but the same thing occurred after my PC was re-configured and would not restart after shutdown. I have Windows 7 Professional.
 Any other suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
