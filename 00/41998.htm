<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 failure to burn CD</h2>
                    <p>"Windows Media Player cannot burn the files. If the burner is busy, wait for the current task to finish. If necessary, verify that the burner is connected properly and that you have installed the latest device driver."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message continues to appear.&nbsp; Blank CD is Sony CD-R.&nbsp; (First CD actually recorded about 4 minutes before message appeared and because of that has been rendered unusable. Current CD has not partially burned anything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched this error and all reports of it appear to be with Window 7 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Media Player 12, but it does not come up in 'Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features' to uninstall or change a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some reports of this error have suggested using other media players to burn the CD. I want to use Windows Media Player.</p>

</p><p>I appreciate your assistance.</p>
<p>However, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to troubleshooting Windows Media Player Settings, I also tried troubleshooting Windows Media Player DVD and Windows Media Player Library</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting Windows Media Player Library resulted in 'Media library is corrupted'. However, I do not have an issue with viewing and playing music files. Therefore, I did not 'Recreate media library'.</p>

            I did that and "fixed" all items for the Media Player.&nbsp; It still plays&nbsp;the current library songs. &nbsp;It still will not burn a CD.&nbsp; I place the songs in the "burn" area. The CD shows almost 100% free space. I hit "Burn" and it immediately I get a blank page.
 In the past the page showed the songs being burned.&nbsp; I cannot uninstall Windows media player because it does not show in the Control Panel.&nbsp; I would greatly appreciate any assistance you can give me.

<p>my dell laptop was having same problems?</p>
<p>I asked my husband to look into it because he was a programmer and knows more than I about PCs.</p>
<p>He found that my&nbsp; default app settings for Music and Video were set to Groove for Music and Movies for videos.&nbsp; Because the Music was not set to use Windows Media Player he assumes that was why I could not burn CDs.&nbsp; It did give an error message stating
 that the dvd player was not able to burn the CD---that was a hint I guess.&nbsp; hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Disc Tray Closes By Itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nyghtbayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc Tray Closes By Itself</h2>
                    
<p>Well, lets see if I can actually get help unlike with other times I've posted on here. I'm having a rather peculiar problem with my disc tray. When I eject the tray (using either the button on the Xbox or using my controller) the center light doesn't stop
 flashing like it normally does when the tray is fully extended. It continues to flash and after about 5-10 seconds, the tray retracts itself. It also has a habit of not stopping the motor before ejecting a disc, even when I'm idling at the dashboard. A CD
 will sometimes spin in the tray when I open it. Anyway, the first problem is my main concern. I have shut the Xbox off and turned it back on again. It is a black Xbox 360 Elite model. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Well, I had this problem too. Sorry you didn't get help on here before. Well, here I am.</p>
<p>For this, it sounds like something is wrong with the sensor. With the new Xbox, there's those pressure sensors instead of buttons that do the work for you. To fix this, turn the Xbox off and get a Q-Tip soaked with isopropyl alcohol, also called "rubbing
 alcohol" (not water so you don't screw the system up, alcohol evaporates and doesn't conduct electricity), and clean out the sensor area, making sure that there isn't anything stuck in there, like dust or food, that could be tripping the sensor. If that fails,
 there is probably a problem either with the button on your controller (which would make it eject/close) which could also be fixed a similar way. If that fails, it could be an electrical problem. Check in games to see if the "Y" button triggers anything by
 itself. Then, you'll know if it is the controller. If not, and it still doesn't work, send your Xbox in to get repaired, either at Microsoft or at any game retailer (I.E., GameStop) which can do it for you. Good luck!

<p>It could still have the pressure sensor, if it's new enough. If not, there could be something stuck in the button itself, which would have the same fix and things to do if it doesn't work, only a different way to clean it, which is obvious if you look at
 the console itself.</p>

<h3> finchomatic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invite Party Bug - Party Issue</h2>
                    
<p>So here's the scenario. I'm playing a game of Killer Instinct, I'm invited to a friend's lobby and I hit "launch" in my notifications menu. As soon as I hit that I get asked to join a frends lobby. Good so far. But after a match I choose to leave. However,
 for some reason (I feel it's with Xbox,&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;Killer Instinct), I am continuously prompted to join the lobby, over and over again.</p>
<p>The party system that Xbox One currently is, unfortunately, still bugged. Because I hit the launch button, I join a friend's lobby
<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;it thinks as thought I'm in a friend's party, which I'm not. When I attempt to go into a Ranked Match online, it says I need to leave the party. I'm not in one though. So my question is, why am I being prompted to leave a party in a ranked
 match, when I am not in one?</p>
<p>I've attempted to close Killer Instinct and re-open it, but I am<strong>&nbsp;still</strong>&nbsp;prompted to join a match, from the same person who invited me to start with, upon starting the game, even though numerous times before I have opted to not join it. I
 have done a hard reset of my xbox so I can go into a ranked and this has solved my problem of going into ranked, but I don't think this should happen.</p>
<p>The feature to invite friends is a great first step for the Xbox One, but in the case of Killer Instinct, it hinders your ability to go online in a ranked match in order to play someone, because it considers you to be in a party when you really aren't. I
 hope somewhere in the April update there is a solution to this.</p>

            <p>You may not be in a party, but having joined your friend the console is bundling you into the same game session, hence it thinks you want to keep playing with your friend.</p>
<p>If you actually were in a party, the easiest way to resolve is to snap party, then press Leave and then Game (you could even stay in a party and you would still be able to play ranked matches with others).</p>
<p>If you're not in a party, there are a couple ways this should work:</p>
<p>Go to Friends, locate your friend, press A to bring up their profile, go to the right where it says they're in a game session, click A for details and you should be able to select Leave Game.</p>
<p>Or - Launch another game, then launch Killer Instinct again.</p>
<p>Or, as you have already discovered - turn off and on the console.</p>

            Hi Abdus,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Desktop background issue you're experiencing might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to a recent change made on the PC.<br />
<br />
That being said, were you aware of recent changes made on your monitors or devices? Do you have administrator right on your PC?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, make sure that your Windows 10 PC is up-to-date, as well as your display adapter.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.
        </p>

<p>Have you tried choosing a different Desktop background? Did the same issue occur? It's possible that the size of the image is causing this problem.<br />
<br />
How about performing a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>? This can make sure that no app is causing this.<strong> Clean Boot</strong> helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when running or installing a program in Windows 10.</p>
<ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for <strong>msconfig</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>System Configuration</strong> from the search results.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>Services</strong> tab of the<strong> System Configuration </strong>
dialog box, tap or click to select the<strong> Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab of the <strong>System Configuration</strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>Startup </strong>tab in<strong> Task Manager</strong>, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong>Disable</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Close <strong>Task Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>Startup </strong>tab of the <strong>System Configuration </strong>
dialog box, tap or click <strong>OK</strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about Clean Boot, you may check <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</em><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, let's see if doing this from a new administrator account will make a difference. If yes, then your current account might be corrupted. Here's how to
<strong>create another administrator account</strong> in Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>
Account</strong> &gt; <strong>Family &amp; other people</strong>, and select <strong>Change account type</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Administrator </strong>under <strong>Account </strong>type &gt; <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Restart your machine and sign in with the new administrator account.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 app issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendowner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 app issues</h2>
                    I had windows 10 installed last week and ever since have problems with apps I was using in windows 8. The money app works fine, the mail and calender apps were partly. The sports app displays up to date photos but I cannot open it The get skype app will
 not open and then disappears. The store app opens but will not install any updates for my suggested apps. Seems strange some apps work and others do not begining to feel that revert to windows 8 could be on the cards. I would be grateful for any help in resolving
 these issues.

            Hi tried all the things you suggested and also have run the App troubleshooter and tried reset windows store , none of these have made any difference to my apps. Beginning to think I may revert back to Windows 8.1 and see if all apps work ok then and try
 upgrade later unless any other suggestions you think I can try. Thanks for your help.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to install a legacy operating system in a dual boot configuration alongside Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that you must install the older operating system first, and then install the more recent operating system. If you don't (for example, if you want to install Windows&nbsp;7 on a computer already running Windows&nbsp;10), you can render your system
 inoperable. This can happen because earlier versions of Windows don't recognize the startup files used in more recent versions of Windows and can overwrite them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to initially install Windows 7 and then install Windows 10 in dual boot configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the link below and follow the suggestions provided by &nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e5564792-9930-4912-828b-e206924b132a" title="Andre Da Costa"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Andre Da Costa</span></a> on April

    <title>Windows 10 not displaying WiFi access points previously connected to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholasscavone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not displaying WiFi access points previously connected to</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung TabPro S Windows 10 Pro device and it has worked perfectly until about 3 or 4 days ago. The system will not display any WiFi access points except for the 3 I had last connected to. I have just come off a project and had successfully connected
 to the office wireless many times and it, like others, in in the Known networks list. Now, at home the system sees the 2 home networks, but will not see my third network router or even see my Samsung phone when i turn on and use it as a hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read as much of the solutions in the community as i could find, tried out most of them, uninstalled the adapter, ran the regedit string command, refreshed the TCP/IP, etc and nothing works. Unlike some of the others with the problem, i don't see the
 other networks on the logon screen, only the three it always shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely a Windows issue as my wife, who has the same machine, has the same problem and it occurred at about the same time. Unlike me, she does nothing remotely technical with her device and updates are automatic on hers because if left to her
 she wold never do them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all the back and forth, it seems a real issue and i just did a cumulative update hoping that would solve the problem but it did not. Microsoft cannot be unaware of this issue and has not chosen to fix it for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have done all the easy stuff, what I'd like to hear is from someone who has has this issue and had a fix</p>

            Hi Nick.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates by installing and running Hide Updates tool from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already did most of that and nothing worked, even went to Samsung support who reinstalled from their software the adapter. Tried all of the other items except for the Media Creation option and completely reinstalling Windows and resetting up the machine.
 This is not a hardware issue this is a Windows issue that happened on both my machine and my wife's machine at the same time. Same problem, same access point issues, she can't see anything even when in different [laces and neither can I.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something in Windows Update caused this issue and I do not think it unreasonable to be reluctant to trash the machine, (both of ours) to satisfy what is a Microsoft issue. We live in Belize and if you knew how difficult it was just to buy a copy of Office
 (2 hours on the phone with Microsoft to fond a work around to letting me buy a copy from a Canadian Amazon with a US credit card while ion Belize) you would be reluctant as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the posts I see that I'm not the only person with this issue, do a search for it and you'll see, but since what seems like last year it is still a problem without an official fix short of trash the box and start over</p>
<p>

            Did you determine which Update, uninstall it or SysRestore and then hide it as I suggested.  I can't imagine how you got through all of those steps before clicking the Didn't Help button, most take several hours at least and it works.

<p>I've been trying to resolve this for about 5 days off and on. Searching forums, trying things and seeing what happens, looking for the answers that had the most claims of success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More fool me, i had such a good run with Windows 10 I broke the first rule of IT "never trust anything, because it will go down on you" and did a back up but not a Restore point. (Yeah, I know, dumb) and when I took a look at rolling back the update that
 I think caused the issue, the August 14th cumulative update, it had been overwritten by the August 30 update. Was not sure where to go with that one so went down the path of seeing what could be done to make the adapter work with the updated Windows install.
 Eternal optimist that I am, I have had some success with this method before, just not now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like that will be my next attempt though.</p>

<h2>            Seagate External 2T Hard Drive</h2>
                    My Toshiba Laptop updated to the latest version of Windows 10, version 1607 and OS Build 14393.0. Now my Seagate 2TB External drive is no longer recognised, it simply says F:\ is not recognised and the parameter is incorrect. I have checked to see if driver
 is up to date, any help would be most appreciated

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a&nbsp;some questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did this start at the point of the WAU upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the external drive connected to the PC during the upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the external drive USB powered or does it use an external power supply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried using the drive on another PC to make sure it is functional?</p>

            <p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>I should point out that I updated from Win 8 to Win 10 some time in September</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions;</p>
<p>Yes, I used the Seagate drive the previous day</p>
<p>No, the Seagate drive was not connected during the upgrade</p>
<p>The Seagate external hard drive is USB powered</p>
<p>The contents on the external Seagate hard drive are still intact and can been proven on another PC</p>
<p>I have a external WD hard drive which is still recognized post upgrade</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like&nbsp;there may have been a problem with the&nbsp;device migration completing&nbsp;the first time it was plugged in.</p>
<p>For my example I am using a Seagate FreeAgent Go USB drive. This is the event of first time I plugged it&nbsp;in to this PC since the WAU upgrade was completed. This&nbsp;would be a good indicator of what you should see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/194212fb-ebee-4dc0-ab8c-2fbbbbbb77a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/194212fb-ebee-4dc0-ab8c-2fbbbbbb77a3" /></a></p>
<p>With the drive plugged in.</p>
<p>Right click the Start button and select Device Manager.&nbsp;When Device Manager opens&nbsp;if any of the main headings are expanded with a warning icon next to a device that is a problem area. Do you see any thing like that?</p>
<p>Go to Disc drives and click on the arrow next to it to expand it. Is your device in the list? If it is right click on it then select properties, in properties click on the Events tab. What do you see? The example above shows a drive that is installed and
 working properly.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f46c04-8b3d-49d1-826e-f1e2e3fe93d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f46c04-8b3d-49d1-826e-f1e2e3fe93d8" /></a></p>
<p>If you've gotten to this point and you see a problem lets try this first:&nbsp; Close the properties&nbsp;window and right click on the&nbsp;device again and select uninstall then select yes. Then unplug the device and do a "Restart" (not a shutdown and start) and then
 log in to your account and wait&nbsp;10 minutes then do a "Shutdown". While shutdown plug the drive back in and then startup (boot up) and login to your account and wait, Windows will then&nbsp;attempt to install the&nbsp;"New Hardware", often this procedure&nbsp;does the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what you find Mark, Good Luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Richard&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Richard</p>
<p>The device states that "This device is working properly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the drive details I believe the problem is the RAW file system?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6af7070f-b50a-4f20-8421-2ae8213b0d2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6af7070f-b50a-4f20-8421-2ae8213b0d2a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know all the files are intact on the Seagate drive because utilising my work laptop I can browse all the files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I originally upgraded from windows 8 to 10 back in September I had no issues with the drive, it was the upgrade that occurred on October 16 that created the issue. Seems to be how Windows 10 now views the drive</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bingo, that would do it. Raw basically means no file system type&nbsp;found or it&nbsp;is unreadable. This is actually not that uncommon were a disc suddenly turns&nbsp;Raw. Many times this is the first indication&nbsp;that a disc is starting to fail, mechanically or otherwise.&nbsp;What's
 interesting is that the work laptop can read it. I would be interested to see what Disc Management shows in the work laptop, also, what is shown in the volumes tab on both PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a good idea to backup or copy all of the data you want to not loose onto another drive using the wok laptop ASAP then see if a reformat completes successfully on the disc using&nbsp;the home PC&nbsp;if you want to try&nbsp;to repair the disc and reuse it, that
 may be risky however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The RAW drive is a hard drive partition which has not been formatted with the file system neither FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 nor NTFS/NTFS5. The RAW drive can be caused by a number of reasons such as virus infection, format failure, accidentally shut down operating
 system, power outages, etc." Also unplugging the drive without using the safely remove hardware function.</p>

<p>I have managed to use the Seagate dive in two different Windows 7 machines, being able to browse, open, close and save files with no issues and have included an image of the of the Seagate drive showing a NTFS file system from the Windows Disk Manager.</p>

</p><p>I still feel this is a Win 10 upgrade issue as everything work after the original Win 10 release, it was the October upgrade I started having the issue</p>

<p>After the anniversary update I can't access my external hard drives any more!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would avoid reformatting or doing anything major to your Seagate drive, unless you've backed it up first. I think
<strong>first </strong>your drivers should be updated. Looks like you've got the right one for the drive itself...</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's a MSFT driver. But what about the Chipset driver...?...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click to update it (at the Driver tab), if it isn't that. That's clearly a combination MSFT/Intel driver. Consider updating all of your major drivers - first via Device Manager - then visit your Toshiba site to see whether they have even greater versions.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you go to these Seagate links and check for any available&nbsp;firmware for your drive&nbsp;(you'll need the serial #)</p>
<p>and download and or use their diagnostic tools found at the first link. The second link has their free Disc Wizard tool to use if you want or need to make changes to the disc&nbsp;beyond what&nbsp;Windows Disc Management can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SeaTools:</p>

</p><p>Also take a look at your storage controllers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, some external drives file systems&nbsp;are not being read correctly&nbsp;by Win 10 v1607, from what I've seen most of these are some Western Digital drives and a few Seagate drives, on some systems that have been in place upgraded&nbsp;as&nbsp;opposed to a clean install.
 There was a similar situation with version 1511 that apparently was addressed in a subsequent cumulative update that corrected the issue. The drive in the above snapshot is a Seagate USB 3.0 drive that is less than 1 year old, it was listed as Win 10 compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With/if all else being right your best bet is with Seagate support short of copying the data to another device and wiping, reformatting, allocating and partitioning&nbsp;the drive for Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what is the&nbsp;partition style&nbsp;shown for the drive (if any):</p>

            Hi,<br />

Cable connection, outdated video card drivers, etc. can be few of the reasons why you're getting a crashing blue screen. We'd like to know if you have made any recent changes to your device before this issue begin.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 wont sleep any more - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markg_95032  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 wont sleep any more</h2>
                    <p>i built this computer based on a asus z170 deluxe motherboard and intel processor a couple years ago, and it has worked fine.</p>
<p>Recently, sometime in the last 4 weeks, it did an automatic update and now it wont sleep, the display wont normally dim (the display will turn off, but then a short time later turns back on) etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i have done:</p>
<ul>
<li>checked the powercfg -requests; nothing new here, i had a few overrides like google and the sound card, but those were old and still valid. &nbsp;nothing new pops up.</li><li>did the power troubleshooter, reports all is fine</li><li>did the system file check, no bad files</li><li>disabled all of the startup programs under file manager, no change</li><li>booted into safe mode; the display does dim somewhat, but it doenst go into sleep mode</li><li>checked the powercfg /lastwake just in case, reports 0 wake history count; not a surprise since it never went into sleep, but data for sake of completeness.</li><li>reinstalled windows 10 onto a new drive. &nbsp;this worked until i updated it to the current version and installed a couple programs. &nbsp;now it acts the same as the original system. &nbsp;deinstall the programs and it still doesnt work right. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>its clear im missing something, but not sure what. &nbsp;nothing else has changed, no new software programs (but any of them may have installed an update, so who knows).&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just know something changed when the new windows update was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any further troubleshooting i can do that i missed? &nbsp;i thought i was pretty good at this stuff but this is kicking my butt.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Lynn,</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you're unable to print or connect to your printer in Windows 10, follow these steps to try and fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Make sure that your printer is plugged into the power supply and turned on. Check the USB connection (for wired printers) or the wireless connection (for wireless printers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. If none of the above steps work, download and run the printer trouble shooter.</p>
<p><span>Type troubleshooting on the search bar.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</span></li><li><span>Click<strong> </strong>on<strong> Printer</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ul>
<p>3. If you‚Äôre still having problems, your printer may need a new driver. <strong>
Right-click </strong>(or press and hold) the <strong>Start</strong> <span>
Windows logo Start button</span>, and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Expand
<strong>Printers</strong>, find your printer in the list, right-click (or press and hold) it, then select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if it works on your printer.</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I recently bought mass effect for pc for my windows 7 computer,however, I am having several problems on getting it to install. First off the disc was dirty(even though it was brand new) and the&nbsp;following&nbsp;error popped up: "safedisc.exe could not be
 found to be written". Then,windows asked me if it installed right,with 2 possible answers: No,install with&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;settings" or "Yes". I clicked no, and windows now skips over the installation and says it was&nbsp;canceled. I then copied the install files from
 the disc to my computer to install but the same error(safedisc)&nbsp;occurred.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Earlier&nbsp;I tried installing it on a different computer running XP,and the safedisc error&nbsp;occurred. I then learned that the disc was probably dirty and then i cleaned it (it was). I then retried on the 7 computer and windows continued to skip over
 the installation wizard with it's "recommended&nbsp;settings". I then tried again to install it on the XP computer and it worked. I then put the files on an external HDD and tried to copy them to the 7 computer. However, whenever i launched it the following error
 message popped up:______has stopped working. Windows is looking for a solution for the problem." This happened when launched from the HDD or the local disc.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyways, now that the disc is clean,how do I stop windows from skipping past the install on the disc?.</strong></p>

Hi there Mike.&nbsp; I had the same issue. Your log files suggested Kaspersky may be the culprit here. In my case, I disabled my "Self-Defense" feature of my "Kaspersky Free". Everything upgraded without a hitch. Later you can enable "Self-Defense".&nbsp;

    <title>Headphones audio only works when the Recording settings tab is open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manlyflower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones audio only works when the Recording settings tab is open</h2>
                    This might be strange, but I just recently upgraded to win10, and all of a sudden the audio has begun to act up. Namely when I have my headphones in, the sound they make is strangely distorted, almost like the PC isn't balancing it correctly. Even stranger,
 when I opened the Recording tab in the Sound properties window, it fixes it. However when I close the window or even move to another tab, the sound goes back to sounding loud and hollow. I haven't seen a problem like this before, and I honestly have no idea
 what's causing it.

<h2>            Window Update for Atheros AR5007 802.11b&#47;g Wifi Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I have received the following Windows Update for the above Wifi Adapter but it switches my Adapter off and crashes the computer and I have to recover with System Restore. I have tried installing twice and the same thing happens. I am running Windows 7 Home
 Premium which I upgraded over Vista with no problems&nbsp;and IE9 and Norton Internet Security 2012. The Norton was already pre-installed when I bought the laptop which is an HP Compaq C740EM.</p>
<p>Is there any solution to this problem please or should I ignore the update as I have no problems with internet connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualcomm Atheros Communications Inc-Network-Qualcomm Atheros AR5007 802.11b/g Wifi Adapter</p>

            <p>I'm sure we are aware how to hide an update, Babu. But thank you for your support. Why are we being offered an update that will cause our wifi to stop working in the first place? Certainly, this is a scare and unappreciated. We count on Microsoft to keep
 us up-to-date. If this update only pertains to certain pcs, doesn't it seem wise to clue customers in? A simple warning would be sufficient. At least customers would know to restore their sysytem if the update was unsuccessful. This is what I did also.&nbsp;The
 point here is, should we check to see if our wifi driver needs to be updated by the&nbsp;pc manufacturer&nbsp;or not? Since Microsoft has again shaken my reliability in their recommendations for updates from other outside companies, it seems a wise choice to check with
 the manufacturer on their recommendations.</p>

<p>lol you all are terrible. &nbsp;Luco1993: I'd say if he just sat on it a couple of seconds, you are fine. &nbsp;Some 360s seem fragile, but they aren't that fragile. &nbsp;As long as your cat didn't lay on it for hours, it should be fine. &nbsp;Now if your cat was on it for
 a very long time then there could have been an over heat issue, but since it was a couple of seconds, I'd say don't worry about it. &nbsp;It sounds like your 360 is laying flat, if so, then I would suggest keeping it flat just in case Mr./Mrs. Whiskers tries to
 take a snooze on it. :)</p>

<h2>            How does WoW64 work on Windows 7</h2>
                    I am trying to install a VPN client to my companys portal, we have our own.&nbsp; It installs fine but when I try to run the program it doens't run, I am running&nbsp; windows 7 64 bit. I have read that most VPN's won't work on a 64bit system. I was curious if there
 is a special way to use the" WoW64 " that is built into windows 7 64bit&nbsp; to utilize it, I understand its sole purpose is to allow 32 bit programs to install and run on 64bit OS. Thanks for the reply.
