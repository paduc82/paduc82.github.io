<h2>            Users</h2>
                    <p>I need a basic lesson on Windows 10 as it has to do with granting permission to use or copy a file.&nbsp; I am the only user of my PC.&nbsp; I have had this DT for 3 years; it did not have Windows 10 but shortly thereafter I downloaded 10. &nbsp;I had help setting it up
 and if I remember correctly I had to establish a user account and assign a pass word.&nbsp; Time&nbsp;has passed and I &nbsp;have not until this week had to refer to this matter.&nbsp; For a backup of my data in case I had a complete failure of my&nbsp;computer, I chose using a 128
 GB flash drive with&nbsp;the intent of downloading my complete Windows C drive of 80 GBs.&nbsp; Shortly after the download started&nbsp;it stopped and a popup state, "You'll need to provide permission to copy folder- Window 7/16/2016."&nbsp;
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>How is this done?</strong></span></em> I see no place to enter and information or now to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked on this assumption which has lead me no where so far.&nbsp; Going to Windows Explorer and to Windows C Drive/users/administrator/what I think is the name I gave my account/ and from there I can find nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping in mind that I want to clean up my computer and uninstall duplicates,&nbsp;it&nbsp;bring up another basic question,&nbsp;&nbsp;I use and save to &nbsp;folders under
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THIS PC </span></strong>primarily with the most common being: Documents/Pictures/Desktop/Music.&nbsp; These can all be found under Windows C Drive which is no surprise to me as it is my understanding that Window C
 Drive holds all of my data.&nbsp; But, ever so often, if I am not being observant, by default, what I save as a document goes to Windows C Drive/user/test and does not appear&nbsp;in the document folder under PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all,&nbsp;I was a long time figuring out where my
 saved document was going but most important, is this not a duplicity using double storage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My download also stopped with a pop up stating I had over 3000 entries of the same name but not what I was.&nbsp; How do I deal with this.&nbsp; Also, I note that I have a long list of "Suggestions" in C Drive.&nbsp; Should I keep these?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will appreciate any help you can&nbsp;give me so I can get a better understanding of just how Windows 10 works.&nbsp; Of course, the answer to that posed in the lst paragraph is the most important.&nbsp; Thanks and Semper Fi Ben&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is little point in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">copying</span> the entire drive as a backup as a significant part of it would be unusable to restore to a rebuilt computer. This includes most directories apart from the User folders so if
 backing up by a simple copy the backup should be limited to the specific files and folders needed. On the new computer all programs would have to be reinstalled anyway. Be a bit more selective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to back up the whole drive is by using the System Image tool but this requires that the entire drive is restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows protects certain files and folders as being something even the Administrator should not modify in the normal course of events so require a somewhat convoluted process to break that protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The philosophy of backup is somewhat different with Windows 10. Logging on using the Microsoft Account stores key security information on the OneDrive profile. If you have to rebuild/replace the computer at some time in the future logging back in using that
 same account allows your security profile to be restored automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you then store your user files (documents, photos etc.) in your OneDrive space then again by logging in using the same account they become available immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you keep files locally on the PC then look at the File History tool. This copies all files in your user profile to another location (your 128GB key?) but a little bit more. Having copied the original file set it scans those folders in the background at
 set intervals for any changed files and makes new copies of only the new files. The "history" aspect is because even when it finds a modified file it does not delete the original but keeps it. This means you can restore a file that you regularly modify at
 any point in its history you choose.</p>

            <p>Hi Hairy Fool:&nbsp; I now have had time to concentrate on my problem.&nbsp; As it turns out, I needed your insight to get me focused on my real problem which is: saving and I may need to start a new thread.&nbsp; But, your insight has been very helpful.&nbsp; First of all,
 your first three paragraphs make complete sense; it is your last paragraph that is probably most important and that has to do with the 'file history tool.'&nbsp; Being a complete novice with Windows 10, I had a difficult time finding this subject and turned to
 'help.'&nbsp; While the write up most certainly helped, the wording is not the same as comes up from the start button.&nbsp; In the first place, 'help' states to look for update and recovery and in settings it&nbsp;is update and security which I believe is the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, once there, I could not follow the directions with any success; it kept rejecting my thumb drive .&nbsp; Let me state that I do not understand the BASIC&nbsp;difference in the files under this PC and Window C drive/user/test---on my computer, they contain a lot
 of duplication but do not totally contain the same information or data.&nbsp; I have been intentionally saving to This PC mainly folders: downloads, documents, pictures, music, desktop and music.&nbsp; While I can understand the need for a user program if there is more
 than one using the computer (in my case, only me), I&nbsp; totally do not understand the concept of using user/<strong>test</strong>.&nbsp; What are we testing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the instructions under settings, the only options I could come up with was c drive/user/test.&nbsp; I tried serval approaches to change to This PC and list just&nbsp;the folders I wanted to save but when they appeared, the changes still read c/&nbsp;user/test.&nbsp; At
 this point let me say that I inserted my 128 GB thump drive in a USB port&nbsp; on the back of my computer.&nbsp; I finally found a popup that recognized my thumb drive&nbsp;and states that Libraries, Desktop, Contacts, Favorites are being saved.&nbsp; If
<strong>Libraries</strong>&nbsp;include documents, pictures, camera roll, and videos then&nbsp;it saving what I want.&nbsp; Actually, I eliminated music&nbsp;as that&nbsp;5 GBs of program &nbsp;data can be downloaded from CDs that I have.&nbsp; I have it set on resaving daily which is the longest
 interval available, but would rather it was weekly.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have it set to run automatically until there is no more space available---I wonder how long the 128 (actually `113 GBs will last) and I hope I will be notified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion of using File History sounds as if it is exactly what I have been looking for but I am not sure that I have the right settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please&nbsp;comment on what I have written.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please make any suggestions&nbsp; to set me straight, thank you and Semper Fi Ben&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I am not sure where "test" comes in. If there is a folder C:\Users\Test then a user called test has been created at some time, its not a Windows created folder. You should really only have two main user directories if yours is the only account ever created
 \Users\<em>your_name</em> and \Users\Public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 1st off check that no other users exist, if you find Test remove it but copy any files that you need from its folders. If the folder does not exist it cannot be written to so if the User does not exist delete the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember File History will create one master backup of the selected folders. From then on it ONLY backs up modified files so in practice hourly, daily or weekly for the average home user will not make a significant difference. Where it comes in is if you
 make changes to the same file all day every day. Then you would get a file copy for each backup session so if for example you are writing a book then that file will have a sequence of backups but for many writers it could be useful to go to a specific draft
 at any time they choose. Alternatively if you tend to modify or create different files each time then you only get the new file once. So for example&nbsp;10 files per day would produce 10 backups each day, 70 for the week. A weekly backup will backup 70 files,
 exactly the same. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So the effect of not being able to set it weekly will depend on how you use your computer. It will also have a bearing oh how fast the backup drive is filled because 100GB of documents will a lot of files, on my system 8500 photos are only 38GB.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Settings shows multiple instances of Amazon Firestick</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 10 Home, 64 bit, fully updated.</p>
<p>I have Amazon Firesticks in two home TVs on the same Wifi network.</p>
<p>I just noticed that under Settings &gt; Bluetooth and other devices, that one Firestick was Listed 10 times and the other one 6 times. They show as "Not Connected" and the only option for each entry is "Remove Device".</p>
<p>I don't know what triggers the entries.</p>
<p>Is there any reason not to remove these entries?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help,</p>

<p>I was tempted to remove them all, but I'm not sure how to reinstall one if in fact it's needed for some reason. I will dig a little deeper at Amazon as you suggested. So far I haven't found anything helpful there.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recently updated from one version of Windows to another, it's possible that the current device driver is for the previous version of Windows. For us to isolate the issue, can you send us a screenshot or picture of the blurred lines that you're getting?
 With regard to this issue, we suggest updating your graphics card driver. To so do, refer to this

<h2>            Xbox fell and now wont play certain game. All others work.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok xbox 360 slim took a fall while playing BF4. This disc is fine I have tried disk in 2 other 360s. The xbox is fine because it plays all other games. Here is where it gets weird. I even tried my Friends BF4 disc and it will not play in my 360. His disk
 and mine both work fine in &nbsp;the 2 other 360s. I tried to install game to hard drive using my disc and it feezes at %27 and says disk read error. So I tried to install his disk in my 360, same exact thing freezes on %27, seems like something isn't jiving between
 my 360 and BF4 now. Really odd! Any advice? So its NOT the disc because NO BF4 disc will read in xbox now and its NOT the drive because all other games will play and read fine.</p>

<p>Hello. I am sorry to hear that you are having issues with your XBOX playing BF4. Have you cleaned the system cache after it failed to install to the hard drive or play on the XBOX? This is the link on how to do that.

<p>Also I will post a link to the CD Drive troubleshoot page. Maybe this might help.

<p>It does indeed sound like your drive is having some trouble. It must be a hardware issue since it occurred after the drop. The disc can be ruled out because it plays on other systems. Your system can play most games fine but is having trouble with a few
 (we know BF, maybe others). Something with the drive must have been slightly knocked off kilter.</p>

<p>Hi Connor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to us with this issue. Sorry to hear that you haven't received your deep freeze bundle in Fortnite. Is this something that you purchased directly from the Microsoft Store or is it something that you purchased in-game from the Fortnite Store?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did purchase it in-game and you didn't receive it, then you would need to reach out to Fortnite Support by
<a href="https://epicgames.helpshift.com/a/fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contacting Epic Games</a> to see what may have occurred. If this is something you purchased from the Microsoft/Xbox Store, then you may wish to check your order history from your Microsoft account to ensure that it is listed there. For more detailed information
 on how to best do so, I recommend using our support article,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/check-xbox-live-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check your Xbox purchase history</a> , which can take you step by step to troubleshoot
 what may have happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps out!</p>
        </p>

            Good day! I apologize that you are having this issue and I am hoping we can work through it and fix it.
<br />
<br />If you want to know how to remove cookies and browsing histroy, can you please let us know what browser you are using? 
<br />
<br />In most cases, you hit a drop down menu or settings in the top right corner of a browser &gt; go to history &gt; delete history. 
<br />
<br />But again it depends on what browser you are using. 
<br />
<br />Thank you

</span><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1296d6d3-a0db-4052-a6b4-8ca4de8da666"><span>theelderone</span></a>,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to<span>&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft Community where you can find answers for all your windows related issues. We are happy to help you.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let’ s start with few questions:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your graphics card?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried to install the driver on any other computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exact error message do you get?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You can go to the Microsoft compatibility center and check if the graphics card is compatible with Windows 8. Here is
 the link for your reference.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/e<span>n-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to log on to the manufacturer's website of the graphics card and check if there are drivers
 compatible drivers for windows8. If the drivers for windows 8 are not present then
<span>&nbsp;</span>install the drivers in windows 7 compatibility mode and check with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Try installing the driver and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

    <title>HP Wireless printers not working in Windows 10 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdwh  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Wireless printers not working in Windows 10 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>My second painless update from Windows 7 to Windows 10 on laptops. On the latter, I had been printing to nearby HP 8500 all-in-one and HP 6500A Plus all-in-one printer/fax/scanner machines (maximum of six feet away). Now the main laptop HP (4g or is it 4m
 of RAM) runs OK (a bit slower) under Windows 10 and solved a couple of older Win 7 problems. BUT......will not recognize either HP printer. With a USB cable attached, it sort-of prints a test page sometimes on the 6500, but after downloaded/installed appropriate
 HP drivers, running Print Wizard, and Print Doctor from HP, still won't recognized or run either printer. I haven't tried an awkward, long-distance USB connection to other, older printers (Epson, Samsung) but really want these wireless printers to work as
 they did before with both Win 7 laptops.</p>
<p>HELP, please.</p>

    <title>windows 10 stuck on a screen saver picture - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 10 stuck on a screen saver picture</h2>
                    I downloaded windows 10 three days ago. Today when I turned the computer on the mouse did not show on the screen. I shut the computer off and changed the batteries in the mouse. When I turned the computer back on it went to a picture of some rocks by an
 ocean. The mouse still doesn't work. On the screen it asks "Do you like what you see". I can't get past this screen. Any answers for this?

            <p>Mystery of being stuck on Screen Saver/Login Screen could be as simple as clicking the Num Lock key and making sure its engaged which then takes you to the Login Screen. Once there enter your password and hint the Enter key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just helped my parents login after 24 hours of them trying to figure out what was wrong with their new computer that I recently upgraded to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently Windows 10 took away the feature that allows you to use the mouse to click enter and replaced it with a password viewer that unscrambles the password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured it out by sheer accident when I was talking and not paying attention to what I was doing and I clicked the icon with my mouse like I always do and I kept wondering why I couldnt get the computer to work. My natural inclination was to then keep
 clicking with the mouse while I was giving the screen my full attention. Once I realized that function no longer worked like the enter key, I pressed it from the keyboard and wala, the mystery was solved.

            <p>Dear Guru Kiran G,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help but unfortunately the fix you suggested did not work. Changed Administrator to someone else and re-booted etc. but all that happened was that it loaded about 5 or 6 Apps but still not loading anything else, including all of my software
 and files where it merely indicates that all folders are empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I have a back-up of my files which is about 98% up-to-date. Perhaps it might be best to do a clean install of Windows and re-load all of my software and files from disk/back-ups/downloads etc. &nbsp;I only have a Windows 8 Pro disk and have previously
 updated to 8.1 and then to 10. Can I re-format C: &nbsp;drive , re-load W8 and upgrade to W10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you can think of an alternative this might be the best option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, &nbsp; Graham Vincent</p>

            <p>Dear Guru Kiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent a reply a few days ago but not sure whether it went O.K. &nbsp;so I have now sent another reply which might reach you this time. Anyway, as suggested I produced an ISO DVD. I then re-booted the PC from the disk and it reloaded a clean copy of Windows 10.
 It only remained for me to recover all of my software and files from original disks and back-ups from various locations and to run the necessary updates. Everything is now running O.K. but with one exception. Windows Live Mail will not run correctly and keeps
 giving me an error code 0x800CCC90 which I can't seem to eradicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help.</p>

<div>Thanks for getting in touch regarding the e-mail error I was receiving which was preventing me from accessing Windows Mail. Fortunately, I had another mail package I was able to use without any problem although it was not one that I wished to use because
 I prefer the screen layout of Windows Mail. However, after a couple of weeks and without making any changes to mail/server Windows Mail suddenly started to work again and it is now working O.K.&nbsp; So, thanks for your assistance in helping to get my PC running
 again, including Mail.</div>

                    <p>I had several applications open, and when Amazon Music launched Microsoft Edge, the touchscreen froze, although music continued playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pushed the power button to turn off the screen, waited a few moments, then pressed it again, hoping the screen would turn back on and the problem would be resolved (screen unfrozen). Instead, the screen consistently failed to start up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then held down the power button for&nbsp;roughly five seconds, hoping to do a hard shut off. I then pressed the power button and waited, and repeated this a few times, and the computer failed to start back up. I was able to get the computer operating again
 via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-wont-turn-on-or-wake-from-sleep?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="getting a computer going that won't start up normally">

<p>It seems to me Microsoft is still correcting the display driver problems:&nbsp;My display adapter is&nbsp;Intel(R) Display Graphics 520, according to the Device Manager. (From past experiences of it crashing and recovering, I think the error message that flashes too-briefly
 indicates it is "for 8.1".)</p>

    <title>Help with MSR partition on secondary drives - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help with MSR partition on secondary drives</h2>
                    I have two secondary hard drives that have MSR partitions on them. I want to use them in another setup but dont want conflict if possible because of partitions. I also dont want unneeded partitions. Both drives have partition one as MSR. Do I need to delete
 these, if so, do I extend my main partition? Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time.&nbsp;

            Should be.  Only problem is if there is boot code left that could conceivably interfere, which is only suspect because the MSR partition presence means an OS was once installed on the drive and it was not wiped with Diskpart Clean or Clean All commands to get boot and partition code and the hidden partition out.

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are few factors that may have caused or triggered this problem on your device. A few would be having an outdated driver, incorrect settings, or a possibility that there's an issue with the keyboard that you want to connect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to be properly assisted with this concern, I recommend that you get in touch with the Samsung support team as they are the appropriate team to provide the necessary assistance and proper recommendations as to what keyboard is compatible with your
 Galaxy Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any Windows concerns, feel free to post it here in the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            You can change the display language to English in Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Region and Language.<br />
<br />
If you want a full English version, you can either upgrade to Ultimate and install the English language pack or buy and install an English version of a lesser Windows 7.

                    Bonjour<br />
<br />
J'ai un problème lorsque je fais une recherche dans ma bibliothèque ou dans un dossier. Je tape le mot recherché dans l'outils de recherchesitué en haut à droite mais systématiquement, il est indiqué "Aucun élément ne correspond à votre recherche".<br />
<br />
J'ai même essayé avec un mot clé que je savais exister dans le dossier mais il ne le trouve pas.<br />
<br />
J'ai essayer les différents paramètres proposés "Types", "Taille", ou "Autres propriétés" ou même les "Options avancées" avec l'indexation mais ça ne fonctionne toujours pas.<br />
<br />
Merci de votre aide.<br />
