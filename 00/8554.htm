<h2>            In Excel, can you put a formula total in the footer&#63; If so, how do you do it&#63;</h2>
                    I tried putting a total in the footer using =Sum(T3:T40) and it faithfully typed that out. Is there a way to put it in so that it recognizes that that is a calculation?

You would have to use VBA to do that.&nbsp; Search google or directly visit Chip Pearson's page at

<p>
</p><p>User has rules setup in Outlook to Move mail items from the inbox directly into a sub-folder for each client. Since the rule is setup in Outlook it is immediately applied by the Office365 mail server - before his iPhone syncs and gets the new mail item.
 If his iPhone gets a new mail item in his inbox he will get a notification. If there is a rule that is applied moving it to a subfolder he gets no notification.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook email conversion problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook email conversion problem</h2>
                    A couple of months ago, I took one of my two email addresses, and converted to the new outlook.com from hotmail.com.&nbsp; I have the 32 bit Outlook connector installed on MS Outlook 2007, and running a 64 bit MS Windows Professional system.&nbsp; The old email
 address in the folder section was automatically created in a separate folder, and within the main category listing of my newer outlook.com email folder.&nbsp; I cannot seem to receive emails any longer in my old email address, which I "thought" would still work,
 as one would think that you want to at least give time for your contacts to transition into the newer address.&nbsp; On 3-5 occasions, I have noticed that when I delete emails from&nbsp;a totally separate email address, those deleted emails end up in my newer outlook.com
 address deleted folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange?&nbsp; One would think so.&nbsp; First I thought I was hacked or something, so I visited the online version of Windows Live and changed&nbsp;my password for the&

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; The emails received earlier were not hacks or otherwise, but I smell fishy things every day in my line of work, so perhaps I was being over cautious.&nbsp; One recent&nbsp;problem is that&nbsp;I cannot see any way to add a hotmail account
 I have had for years, to the newer outlook.com site.&nbsp; I have even sent an email to
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** in hopes of repair, as this is driving me nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now when I go to outlook.com or windows live hotmail, etc. which takes you back to outlook, I cannot even see this email that I sent to microsoft.&nbsp;
 I have multiple problems, and I know it is not me, as I have been computer literate since my first commodore, or shortly thereafter in the Computer Science&nbsp;studies&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; All I&nbsp;want is to have my (3) emails all&nbsp;in one&nbsp;location, as it SHOULD&nbsp;BE.&nbsp; My desktop
 Outlook 2007&nbsp;will not even sign in anymore.&nbsp; I have changed my password via the Microsoft process to ensure I was rid of&nbsp;any&nbsp;possible wrongful intents, and still no access to my emails.&nbsp; I ensured&nbsp;my password change was similar&nbsp;in&nbsp;Outlook 2007, but no&nbsp;access.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 can go to outlook.com however and see 2 of my email accounts, but the third one is still&nbsp;hiding in the dust somewhere.&nbsp; In my email to miscrosoft, which I know I sent, I explained everything in full detail&nbsp;with the&nbsp;severe problems I have been encountering
 for over 2 months now.&nbsp; Ironically, this all&nbsp;began when I&nbsp;converted one email address to the new outlook.com email extension.&nbsp; I have posted&nbsp;in this forum before, with many trying to assist, but at the time, I was so cautious of&nbsp;providing any information to&nbsp;anyone.&nbsp;
 For those who assisted, and may be reading this, my apologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a victim earlier in life which caused severe burdens on me and my family, and ever since I have been over cautious on some things, especially identity.&nbsp; Is there a way to start off
 fresh? Can I just delete my accounts and start over again with the same addresses?&nbsp; Can you simply have one password for all three accounts?&nbsp; As I cannot make this work.&nbsp; Due to the large problems I am having, and they are large due to government communications
 with relation to work, I just need to have outlook.com and&nbsp;MS Outlook 2007 get together and recognize my three email accounts, and allows me to enter either location with one password.&nbsp; One email has outlook.com at the end, and the other two have hotmail.com.&nbsp;
 Any help would be entirely appreciated on how I can get a fresh start without losing emails, contacts, etc.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure exactly what you are trying to do.... </p>
<p>If you want to delete the accounts from Outlook 2007, you can do that. If mail was downloaded by outlook connector and it's not in one of your accounts online, export the mail to a local pst file first.
</p>
<p>If you want to delete them online, you cannot do that. That will delete the account from Microsoft and i don't know if you'll get it back.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how outlook.com was supposed to work with address conversions - i didn't convert any, but added an outlook.com address to my existing Hotmail address so i could claim the alias. I have no idea what will happen when they decide to retire Hotmail
 addresses. </p>
<p>This forum is for issues with Outlook 2007 (and other versions) installed on your computer. We can't do anything with outlook.com and while we know some stuff about it, aren't the experts.&nbsp; you need the outlook.com forum at

    <title>Sync Issues in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sync Issues in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting sync issues on my Outlook 2016. I have tried all of the fixes I have read on-line but it keeps giving me sync issues on folders that I no longer have (have deleted). I still get all of my e-mails from all sources (cable one) so I need to know
 if this is a major problem or how I can fix it. This is a personal account (not business) that only I use.</p>

            Did you empty the deleted folder? That might help... if not, renaming the imap data file and letting outlook rebuild it should fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />Right click on the account name in the folder list, choose Open File Location then close Outlook. Rename the selected data file and Restart Outlook.

            It's an imap account so trash is the Deleted Items. If the Trash folder has the little triangle icon, you have folders in it. 
<br />
<br />In this screenshot, I have deleted folders in the Trash folder.  If you have folders there, delete them and if you still get the errors, a new data file will fix it.   The sync errors are annoying but its not urgent to fix - so no rush. 
<br />
<br />To start with a fresh data file, right click on your name and choose Open File location. Close Outlook, then rename the data file and restart outlook. 
<br />
<br />But before you do that -do you have calendar and contacts in folders labeled 'this computer only' ? If so, they should be exported first.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a9f858c-6d54-49a2-b103-17b5cc9f6cea?upload=true" />

            Are  you getting sync issues messages for the folders or for other things? It's not unusual to have a few sync issues when you use an IMAP account. I wouldn't worry about them too much.

<h2>            Chromebook and older iPads no longer able to skype&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I work at a nursing home, and we were recently donated 3 iPads and a chromebook so that our elderly residents could start facetiming and skype-ing with their loved ones that live far away and in other countries.&nbsp; &nbsp; Am I really being told that the residents
 that were using skype will no longer be able to see their families? I tried all of the fixes everyone has been posting on here and so far nothing is working.

<h2>            Lumia 929 icon camera flash is not working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just noticed that my phone's flash is not working. I have tried using the flashlight app, Instagram, and of course the camera hoping to get the flash to work but no luck. I am not sure what to do here and can't find any topics that can help me fix this
 problem. So here I am. Thank you in advance for any and all information provided!</p>

            <p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>It sounds like a hardware problem, but there's two more things you could try and do.</p>
<p>1) Soft Reset</p>
<p>or&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Hard Reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these are software related, and could fix the issue if it is the OS that's having problems. &nbsp;The other option is to contact Microsoft about a replacement/repair, if it's still under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Soft Reset</strong></p>
<p>(No data loss, but back up your phone just in case. &nbsp;Make sure you have at least 30% battery)</p>
<p>1) Press and hold the POWER and VOLUME DOWN keys until the phone switches off.</p>
<p>2) Release keys and let phone boot normally</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hard Reset</strong></p>
<p><strong>ALL DATA WILL BE LOST!! &nbsp;BACK UP YOUR DEVICE FIRST<em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>1) Press and hold the POWER and VOLUME DOWN keys until the phone vibrates.</p>
<p>2) Immediately after the phone vibrates, hold the VOLUME DOWN key</p>
<p>3) When an exclamation mark appears, press the following keys in sequence:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; VOLUME UP</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; POWER</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; VOLUME DOWN</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; VOLUME UP</p>
<p>4) Phone will reboot back to factory defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helps. &nbsp;The soft reset may be the best bet to try, and then try contacting Microsoft.</p>

            Gently exert finger pressure on the back cover around the flash and turn on the flashlight. If it comes on its the flash module contacts.

            This fixed my issue, I had dropped my phone on a concrete floor (thank goodness for phone cases) and hadn't realized the battery cover had partially come undone. Pushing it back together fixed the issue, I didn't even think to check with the phone case
 off.

            Hello. Is your hotmail email account blocked? They are trying to send you a text message to input a verification code and unblock it. You can't send a text message over a land line. So you should give them an alternate email address to send the verification
 code to. If you don't have an alternate email address, you should fill out this form:

<h2>            Not so much a windows question....</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p><br />
Not so much a windows question but more of a readers poll...<br />
<br />
I have an HTC 8X, and have for just over three months now, and for some reason I'm having issues with cellular connectivity. I'm not getting 4GLTE where I should and am barely getting 3G anywhere...and lately I've been randomly slipping into roaming.<br />
<br />
I tried a soft reset, but I'm at home where I only get 3G, so I'll have to wait until I start moving about town, but this is a very new development (this past week) and I want to know if anyone has had the same issue and if so; were you able to fix it?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
-Kevin</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3G, 4G LTE is the network transmission speed</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have used the phrase "and lately I've been randomly slipping into roaming. " which sound like a network with low coverage</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try going&nbsp;</p>
<p>SETTINGS / &nbsp;MOBILE + SIM &nbsp;/ Sim settings &nbsp;SEARCH (set to automatic) your network fastest transmission speed is shown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You &nbsp;can then go to the networks website and check 4g speed</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real test is 2 phones on the same network and if one phone is 3G and the other not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before a factory reset a call to your network customer service s with your location should give you more information.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I prevent Skype from adding modifying or changing my contacts lists in iOS</h2>
                    <p>It’s ridiculous. Every time I open Skype, I have new contacts in my list, even though I have SYNC disabled AND “Appear as suggested contacts” disabled. I use my Skype for very confidential adult work and don’t want, for instance, my mother showing up in
 the list. Good grief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do they have to make it so frickin complicated to prevent them from changing my Skype address book? I want control over it, not

<h2>            Strange click &#38; drag behavior</h2>
                    My Publisher, part of Office 2010 Pro, is behaving strangely. I recently moved to a new computer w/ Windows 10, so it may relate to that? When I attempt to create or modify the shape or position of text boxes, when I click on one of the corner points to
 drag, the cursor jumps to another area. Do you think I should try reinstalling? Something else? THANKS for any help!

            Check if you face this problem on other office applications. If you do, then repair office, reboot the system and see if you still face the same problem. Try with a different mouse.<br />
You may reinstall office if the above fails.

            For what it's worth, this is the "Academic" version of Office Professional. It may be just Publisher that's acting up. I seldom use text boxes in Word, but the ones I tried creating worked ok.

<p>Hi Fernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be caused by several reasons. It is possible that Word app may have been corrupted or some program files are causing this. For us to come up with an effective resolution, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to the computer recently? Recently installed any software or updates?</li><li>Can you provide us the exact error message that you received?</li><li>Have you checked your other apps/programs if they're getting the same issue? For example: OneNote, Excel, and etc.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run a quick repair to your app. You may refer to this

            If you perform a soft reset on your device and if the functionality does not come back then you may have to do a Hard Reset that will bring your device back to factory settings (as if it was a brand new device).&nbsp;

            I would Hard Reset.&nbsp; In fact it will fix the issue and will be the&nbsp;fastest solution in the final analysis.<br />
<div><span>gcut1 said:&nbsp; </span>If I need to do a hard reboot, how do I back up my contacts?<br />

Are you syncing your device with Outlook on your PC?&nbsp; If so, when you reconnect and establish a new partnership, the new sync will bring it all back over.<br />

</p><p>I had this problem with several machines at work and it was resolved by going to compatibility view settings and<em>REMOVING</em> msn.com from the list. Every machine that had this problem in IE9 also had msn.com listed in the compatability view settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This actuall works to solve the problem.</p>

            I am running Vista and IE9, which, when I try to update, says that IE9 IS the most current browser for Vista.&nbsp; At someone else's suggestion, I went to TOOLS, COMPATIBILITY VIEW SETTINGS, and removed MSN.COM from the compatibility view list.&nbsp; My MSN.com
 homepage immediately changed from the unusable "list look" to what I assume is the new MSN.&nbsp; Try it - it can't hurt at this point.

            Download speeds are affected by many things. Starting with the server doing the download, through all of the servers and network connections between you and the source server.&nbsp; The bottle neck could even be at your "ISP" (Internet Service Provider), they
 could "throttling down" the connection to that server if they think it has been "too busy". You have tested and confirmed that the slowdown is not likely at your end since other sources can download at reasonable speeds.<br />
<br />
Since we don't control the route of the connection between us and the server, the only thing I can suggest is to try a different download source. Do you download from a different website. Hopefully that will be faster<br />
<br />
With your product key you can try downloading from one of these other sites:<br />
<span>2010 Full Download</span>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: if you do not have the installation file on an “official” MS installation disk, download and save it to your HD. Then you should burn it to one or more DVDs for future
 use. And at the same time, write down the product key on the DVD. You need both items for future installations, say after your computer crashes and you have re-installed windows. At that point you won’t be able to extract it from the registry and won’t remember
 where the online account is.</p>

Since you are haveing download problems, now is a good time to mention something else to be aware of. MS is "sneaking" an alternate installer to users. Rather than doing a "normal" installation, they are giving people an installer that creates a "virtual machine".
 Office is actually installed on a MS server and downloaded EVERY TIME you use it.&nbsp; If you know what to look for you can the "normal" installer. Here's how:<br />
<div>
<span>Switch to using an MSI-based Office edition (only applies to versions bought online)</span>

</span></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: I have been told that Office running in C2R and C2R itself require separate uninstall steps in Programs and Features.</p>

                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have a file that is marked read only in my Dell x51v pocket PC 2003 SE. I want to make it not read-only but it is greyed out when I explore the PDA from my PC and I can't work out how to do it on the PDA.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? <br />
