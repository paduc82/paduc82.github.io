<h2>            everything on Skype is gone</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all: sorry for my English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i had skype on my mac. The old version didn't work as it should be. The other person didn't hear me. I had problems to log in...</p>
<p>I think 2 weeks ago I deleted the old version and downloaded the new one. Everything was allright (I guess). I had all my contacts and chats back. (I didn't skype since the new download. So I don't know about the sound.) Today I want to open Skype and I
 had to log in. (Normally it just opens.) Right now all my contacts, my chats, my profile picture, my quote... Everything is gone and I can't find it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to have everything back?</p>

<h2>            VBA Macro in Word to Create &#40;But Not Send&#41; a New Email from Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a sample VBA script that will silently send a new email without ever actually showing the email on the screen. I'm hoping to modify it so that the new email is actually just created and opens on the computer without sending. This gives me the opportunity
 to actually review the email and I can push "send" myself after verifying that it has the information that I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the sample that I used:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()<br />
Dim OL &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Object<br />
Dim EmailItem &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Object<br />
Dim Doc &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As Document<br />
<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Set OL = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")<br />
Set EmailItem = OL.CreateItem(olMailItem)<br />
<br />
With EmailItem<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Subject = "Insert Subject Here"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Body = "Insert message here" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Body Line 2" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; _<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; "Body Line 3"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .To = "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Importance = olImportanceNormal 'Or olImprotanceHigh Or olImprotanceLow<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; .Send<br />
End With<br />
<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
<br />
Set Doc = Nothing<br />
Set OL = Nothing<br />
Set EmailItem = Nothing<br />
<br />
End Sub</p>

    <title>Office 2016 Retail Keys not always matching Computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okseeusoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2016 Retail Keys not always matching Computers</h2>
                    <p>I am extremely unsatisfied with both your Online Chat and Phone Tech Support.</p>
<p>I don't want to call back approximately 17 times and spend 2.5 hours again over a simple question so I'm posting my question here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 15 computers that have Microsoft Office 2016 Retail. <br />
<br />
The licenses for each of those computers have been installed using the various Installers in our Microsoft Account.</p>
<p><br />
All of these keys are assigned to our Microsoft Account.<br />
<br />
I am attempting to match the keys in our Microsoft Account with the keys on our computers so we insure that our computers are properly licensed.<br />
<br />
Using your web-based Microsoft Account Office Installer process that doesn't show the product key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 computers match 6 of the license keys in our Microsoft Account using the View Product Key step..&nbsp;<br />
5 computer are somehow using the same license key.<br />
4 of the computers have a license key that does not match any of our license keys based upon using OSPP.VBS /dstatus.<br />
</p>
<p>All of these computers show Office as ACTIVATED using OSPP.VBS /dstatus.</p>
<p><br />
Logically, this is not an efficient way of managing Office Keys and in my opinion this is due to your current method of assigning keys using the Microsoft Account Installer process which then prompts you to choose which key to use without showing you which
 product key you are assigning. &nbsp;Your present method would be great for one person with one product in their Microsoft Account but seems silly for people with multiple products in their Microsoft Account. &nbsp;In fact, one of your tech support agents said that
 was the issue - we have too many products in our Account so apparently we shouldn't have spent so much money at Microsoft. &nbsp;Seems awfully obvious that one would need to be able to see which Office Key they are assigning to a computer when a person clicks on
 Install in their respective Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is situations like these that I would think logically that I should not have to be posting as a problem. &nbsp;And when we multiply this issue by tens of thousands of people it seems rather ridiculous. &nbsp;And offering chat with people that are not able to adequately
 answer any question that I pose to them does not seem at all efficient nor productive either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Should I fix this by matching the keys to the computers which your Installer process somehow failed to do?<br />
</p>
<p>2 &nbsp;Why do 4 of the computers have a license key that does not match any of our license keys based upon using OSPP.VBS /dstatus? &nbsp;One of your agent incompletely communicated something about token key versus actual key. &nbsp;What does that mean? &nbsp;Is this scenario
 as described normal now? &nbsp;Why would it work this way?<br />
</p>
<p>3. If I do need to fix this, how do I get all of the keys to match the keys in the Microsoft Account? &nbsp;Clearly, the Office Account Installer is not the way to resolve this as that is just going to prompt for which key to pick without showing the actual key
 which will just return me to the situation that I'm in. &nbsp;It would appear the way to fix this is by using the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(61, 61, 61, 1)">OSPP.VBS /inpkey process. &nbsp;Is that what I am supposed to do? &nbsp;Why
 am I having to do all this to simply have an accurate inventory of the Office keys on our computers?</span></p>

            Hi, I don't really understand where you are with this.&nbsp; First of all, I am sure you know, but just to clarify, the 25 character key provided by the vendor is not the actual Product Key, it should properly be called the Redemption Key because that is what
 it is. It is also your proof of purchase.&nbsp; The actual Product Key is the 25 character key you can obtain by going to your Office Account at:
<a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;and clicking 'View your product key'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Often the problem is that when the various Office
 software was installed no note was taken of which computer matched which Product Key.&nbsp; See if this helps:&nbsp;

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
To further isolate your concern, we'd like to ask the following questions:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>With the 25 digit key that you've mentioned, is it a Product Key or a Redemption Key?</li><li>How many Microsoft Accounts did you use to purchase Office 2016?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            I have read your question and what you are saying does not make sense.&nbsp; The <strong>
Actual Product Key </strong>must match the&nbsp; installed software.&nbsp; Where the problem arises is matching the
<strong>Redemption Key </strong>referred to by Microsoft in documentation as the Product Key with the installed Office on the computer.&nbsp; This should have been noted when the software was installed and matched with the Actual Product Key which can be obtained
 from the Office Account.

<p>PS: what I suggest that you do is download the free version of <a href="https://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Belarc Advisor </a>on each of your computers. Belarc Advisor with show you the last 5 digits of the Product Key for the&nbsp;Office 2016 installed on that computer.&nbsp; You can then go to the Office Account at:

 5 digits of the Product Key identified by Belarc Advisor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Or instead of using Belarc Advisor you can use the link I provided above, which you appear to have ignored, to find the Product Key on each computer:

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A histogram or Pareto is one of chart options of Excel that shows the frequency of data. There is no limit when creating numbers for the chart since it can be stretched out and viewable for you. In your case, this has been easy to create since it will be
 stretched out from 0-10 only. You can visit this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-a-histogram-85680173-064b-4024-b39d-80f17ff2f4e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to know more about how histogram works in Excel.</p>

<h2>            Reading pane for Outlook 15.17 for Mac keeps changing size, after update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just did some updates to Office, and noticed that when using Outlook for Mac, the reading pane keeps resetting back to a default size (below list, and taking up about 75% of the column). I drag the delimiter down a bit, so that it only takes up about half
 the column, but every time I go back to that folder, it resets to the default 75% again.</p>
<p>I have multiple mailboxes within Outlook, so some of the folders do manage to 'remember' where the reading pane is, but most of the folders forget, and I'm constantly having to resize them. Also, when I do a search, the reading pane resizes back to 75% again,
 and I'm having to drag down the delimiter to see the search results...</p>
<p>Is this a bug that needs to be fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are so many bugs with Outlook for Mac - I wish I could be used in some sort of programme where I could give feedback on working with Outlook for Mac to let Microsoft know what the issues are!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Julie.</p>

<p>Hi all, an update just went out (15.17.1) that should fix the most common reading pane size bug reported. We are still investigating some other view sizing issues that are not directly connected to the reading pane bug. &nbsp;The release notes for 15.17.1 don't
 seem to be fully propagated, so the link to the associated KB article may not be working yet.</p>

            I only find the Microsoft Alerts Daemon.app file. I don't see any other on my Lion system.
<div><br />
<div>If it's not causing any issues I would leave it alone. Or if it's really bothering you then move it out of the Applications folder altogether and continuing using Office until you're satisfied that everything is still running normally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can always reinstall Office if you find problems later.</div>

            Hi Administrator Twin City Mission,<br />
<br />
How do you rename? Do you use SharePoint Online GUI or use script?<br />
If you were using SharePoint Online GUI, could you provide a screen shot of the error message? Including details. To protect your private, you could share it via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1526553508069">
Private Message</a>.<br />
And do you have special keys in your new name of folder or document? If that is the case, you could change the name and try again.<br />
About the problematic &nbsp;sites, dose they have something in common? Specific type maybe? Could you share the sites URLs with me too via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox?tm=1526553508069">
private message</a>?<br />
Dese this happen to all the libraries within these sites? What if you create new libraries in these sites?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Alex

<h2>            Modifying Text Box with a Macro</h2>
                    I am working on a form and I need to have&nbsp; a text textbox (inserted from the insert tab not the developer tab)&nbsp;update with a macro. The textbox cannot be an activeX control otherwise it&nbsp;messess with the progression of the form filling out. Is this even
 possible? or does it have to be an activeX control for a macro to update it?&nbsp;

            <p>In case anybody else has this question this is the process I used to solve my problem and get a standard textbox (NOT ActiveX)&nbsp;to update with a Macro... First, I needed my field to be a text box I was hiding and disabling formfields such that when the disabled
 formfield was selected it would push the focus to the next form field which was these textboxes that are only supposed to be labels and the cursor was getting stuck in them so if you dont absolutely need it to be a standard text box I recommend using an ActiveX
 text box instead. So here is what I did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First insert your text box, Then press record macro. Name your macro something obvious like "textbox Name" From the home tab on the far right get your select tool (Icon looks like your mouse pointer) once you have done this you can select your textbox then
 press stop recording. Open your macros and select the one you just recorded and press edit. The only purpose in doing this is to see what Word has named that particular textbox. I couldn't figure out how to rename it or know what it was named any other way.
 Now that you know what that particular textbox is named you can get it to update by using the following code...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ActiveDocument.Shapes("Text Box name").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.TypeText Text:="What you want it to say"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helps on the off chance someone else out there has this need!</p>

<h2>            Sharepoint online...creating Windows 10 Explorer folders for desktop access</h2>
                    <p>I'm new to SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created Several SharePoint Sites and uploaded a handful of documents. I'm setting this up for several groups inside our org and would like to mimic their folder experiences as much as possible...some users aren't online/cloud savvy just yet. Is this
 possible...How can I map the SharePoint online documents &amp; folders to look like the folders experience they are familiar with? Windows File Explorer is pretty easy to use and familiar to many...can I create SharePoint Folders in Windows File Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confident I'm not the first to ask this but my new-ness is making this more difficult than I'd suspect it would be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks All!</p>

<p>The suggestion to sync is an irrelevant answer to a question about creating network locations that mimic the familiar windows explorer experience. Duplicating cloud stored files locally completely defeats the purpose of using cloud storage. It's also well
 known the sync clients don't work well and the sync process will consume your machine's resources unnecessarily.
</p>
<p>Network locations are a far better option but unfortunately the aging webDav transfer protocol they rely on is very unreliable when combined with Msft's flawed authentication design. Sometimes they work, sometimes they throw uninformative errors and Msft
 escalation engineers have been unable to figure out why. It has something to do with the inability of the explorer process to handle authentication the way a browser does.</p>

            It is not possible to tranfer real or windows media player to ur device instead u can download some applications for for that, for video streaming (youtube videos) "Mobitubia" application&nbsp;is a good one. I hope there is a version available for s40 devices
 too( dig into this site <a href="http://www.gallery.mobile9.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.gallery.mobile9.com</a>&nbsp;) for audio u can get this piece of software called "KD player" which is a look alike of WMP which works well on all java based S40&nbsp;Phones, i doubt whether&nbsp;u can stream music with that

<h2>            How to edit the &#34;Home&#34;tab with custom toolbar</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have recently moved from Outlook 2007 to 2010. I like to use TwinBox to review my twitter feed and it used to work great on 2007 where I could see the tweet ribbon displaying on the main Outlook mail page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now in 2010 it is moved to the add-Ins section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically i want to move a custom tool bar from the add-Ins section to the Home tab so that i can see it whilst on my normal view, not have to click to add-Ins.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>No, the Custom Toolbars group only exists on the Add-Ins tab and is basically only there for backwards compatbility. It would suggest that the TwInbox haven't fully completed their work on Outlook 2010 integration yet.</p>
<p>As said, you should contact them if you want to give them feedback about their tool or ask about their future plans.</p>

            Hi - you may be fare better with this Q in another section... it's not really WMP related. FWIW - If I'm working on mp3 files I usually simply send them as email attachments. If you need a more definitive answer update and I'll see if your Q can be relocated.

<h2>            Some emails are not delivered</h2>
                    
<div>Hi,</div>
<div>we have very strange issue:</div>
<div>we have domain vendor.com and customer.com</div>
<div><b>Customer</b> is on <b>Office 365</b> and the <b>Vendor</b> on <b>BlueHost</b></div>
<div>there are some emails from vendor to customer are not&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;and there is NO NDR returned. NOT all the emails.</div>
<div>some emails with&nbsp;attachment or&nbsp;impeded&nbsp;screenshots (attachment is docx and pdf) and it's clean. and sometimes if you send to multiple users like 2 persons in to and 2 in CC, however if you send to test email (empty and one person will delivered)</div>

<div>Also if you tick the delivery&nbsp;receipt&nbsp;it will on come (means the email is not delivered yet.)</div>
<div>we opened a case with both MS and Bluehost.</div>
<div>Microsoft answer: the email is not hitting office 365&nbsp;because&nbsp;it's not shown on message tracking as dropped or taken spam or even quarantine.</div>

<div>BlueHost: says the email went out from our servers and it's shown on the logs. (i&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;this with them&nbsp;because&nbsp;i send them specific date "then send me the emails subjects that sent from thier servers" and the emails are not delivered are&nbsp;mentioned).</div>

<div>we tried also send from another users and to send to another users also the same issue.</div>
<div>also we tried adding whole domain and users as white list on office 365. and also no hope.</div>
<div>all other emails we send from are ok (yahoo, hotmeial, gmail)</div>

<div>Any other idea can help, will be appreciated..</div>

                </div>

<p>Hi Support7207,</p>
<p>To better understand the situation, I‚Äôd like to collect the following information first:<br />
1. When did you notice this issue? Was everything working fine before?<br />
2. As you mentioned two examples which may result in the specific email not be delivered (the emails has attachments or is sent to multiple users), do you mean the issue just occurred randomly from the sender side?<br />
3. For example 1, what if you resend the email with the same attachment or impeded screenshots from another personal account like Gmail or Outlook.com account? If possible, could you provide the example screenshot or attachment via workspace so we can also
 run a test. The way to access the workspace is contained in the private message below.<br />
4. By saying ‚Äòall other emails we send from are ok (yahoo, hotmeial, gmail)‚Äô, do you mean the vendor can send all the emails to any other mail services successfully? If not, please clarify it.<br />
5. Since you‚Äôve opened a case with Microsoft, please also share the SR number so we can check the communications from our side. Here is the link to access the private message:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations</p>
<p>Any updates will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

    <title>Sync problems with XV6700 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laserman-oregon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync problems with XV6700</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Verizon XV6700 that I have been using for 3 years.&nbsp; It syncs fine on my XP computer but will not sync on my new Win 7 system.&nbsp; It connects and I can explore the phone, see files, move files, etc., but when I try to sync it says it is syncing but
 it has been over 12 hours and it's still syncing...&nbsp; nothing is really happening except the little arrows are moving on the phone and the computers says "syncing".</p>
<p>I have Outlook setup exactly the same way as on the XP machine, same folders, contact list, exchange folders, etc., the only difference is ActiveSync 4.5 on the XP and Sync Center on Win 7.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Gary</p>
<p>P.S. I tried to update the mobile device center and it errors out saying "device unplugged".&nbsp; It is plugged in and connected to the computer.&nbsp; I tried running it without the phone connected and it gives me the same error.&nbsp; The version I have is 6.1.6965</p>

    <title>OSX Mavericks &#43; MS PowerPoint 2011 &#43; presenter view &#61; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OSX Mavericks &#43; MS PowerPoint 2011 &#43; presenter view &#61; window manager crash&#63;</h2>
                    Since upgrading my MacBook Pro to OSX Mavericks I've had issues running slide shows using an external monitor or projector. Looking for a fix or workaround.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Details</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Early 2011 MBP (8,2)</li><li>OS X Mavericks (10.9.1), all patches current - fresh install (reformatted drive)</li><li>PowerPoint 2011, patched current 14.3.9 (131030) - fresh install, then applied updates</li></ul>
<div>
<div><b>Scenario:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>MBP + external monitor or projector connected via Apple display adapter (either VGA or DVI)</li><li>Open PowerPoint and load a slide show</li><li>switch to slide show view with presenter mode enabled - non-mirrored displays</li><li>move the mouse pointer - even slightly - and it looks like window manager crashes, external display goes back to wallpaper, presenter display becomes corrupted and you have to wait while the windows restart. Presenter display reappears on the onboard display,
 slide show DOES NOT reappear on the external display. You must exit slide show mode and return in order to activate the external display.</li><li>This is consistently reproducible</li></ul>
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
</div>
</div>

            Wow - did &nbsp;not need to re-install everything. &nbsp;All I did was in Powerpoint on the Mac was to go to the Window menu and click Arrange All and it brought them to the window on my mac. &nbsp;Now when I open new powerpoints they display on the screen.

            <p>I solved my issues. &nbsp;Taking the advise of someone else, creating another user validates the problem resides somewhere in the Office preferences. &nbsp;Only way I was able to fix it was to do a complete, and I mean a complete, uninstall and then reinstall, apply
 all patches and updates (make sure you check for updates several times during the reinstall) and then reconfigure the apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is working again but what a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the uninstall instructions I used:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option to remove a contact's status can only be done on your contact's end. You cannot adjust or remove it for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
