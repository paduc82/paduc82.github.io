<h2>            X-Box account profile hi-jacks Windows 10 admin profile</h2>
                    <p>My son asked if he could update an icon on his X-box profile account, but needed to do so via Windows 10. I agreed and closely observed to prevent any downloads or unauthorized changes. I clicked the X-box icon on my PC and he logged in. We never made the
 changes he wanted to, so I closed down my PC. This morning upon start up 'My Admin Login' had been replaced with his X-box login, password, profiles &amp; who know what else. (In hindsight we should have created a new profile, but who knew because there were no
 pop-ups or no warning of potential profile changes). I've attempted to fix the issue by contacting both X-box &amp; Windows tech support, which both have failed to assist me in fixing this issue. This morning via phone I was bounced around to 5+ individuals from
 X-box to Window Support, back to X-box &amp; etc until the last tech (accidentally) disconnected the phone call. I've use the chat feature and was to be transferred and "We lost connection". I'm explaining this issue as "X-Box hi-jacked by Win 10 profile". Some
 techs may say create a new profile, however this will not bring back "my" desktop. Files located on desktop, bookmarks &amp; etc. ANYBODY, would there happen to be a fix?</p>

<p>To RSmith007-it seems the next steps is to create a new profile or new user.</p>
<p>you don't have to worry with your files since you can recover it</p>
<p>just simply open file explorer on the new user right click on the old user folder then take the ownership to access the files.</p>

<h2>            Skype Number, Call Ended when answering</h2>
                    <p>I have just purchased a Skype telephone number, I have tested calling the number from my mobile phone. Upon calling Skype shows on my computer the number is calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt to answer the call it says 'Call ended', the phone is still calling, Skype then shows the answer/drop call alert again, if I answer then it is the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Skype for Linux just downloaded today, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.</p>

            Same problem for me on Skype for Linux 5.5.0.1, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. I believe it started with your July upgrade. I'm also trying to get chat or phone support as a paying customer but the only contact option available is "Community Forums". How can I get
 text or phone help?

<p>Hi Rhiza_E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any updates from Microsoft? It seems like I'm not the only one (with Ubuntu&nbsp;<span>16.04 LTS) having problems and I happen to be a paying Skype customer too. My call-in number is currently unusable on my Computer.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Please, I signed into my skype account , and found out that whole my chatting history is deleted, knowing that I've done a recovery to my windows before, due to having some slow, and I choose the option ( remove all my files, apps, and settings ). Is there
 any relationship with doing this and deleting my chatting history in Skype?&nbsp; Is there a way to recover them?</p>

<p>No, not this one, I have another one that have skype account. At first, I thought maybe due to skype update, every thing got deleted,&nbsp; but when I read here some replies that says, all messages will be stored in the device by default, I don't know about this
 and I had done a recovery to my system before which deleted every thing. Now windows is running fine, but I lost all my history chat in skype.&nbsp;It has some memories I'd like to keep. It's really annoying, If I know I wouldn't have done a recovery.&nbsp;</p>

                    <span>My PC is running Windows 10 with the latest updates but has suddenly become unusable
 with disk usage staying at 100% even with nothing running and just the same processes listed in Task Manager as before the problems started. I've tried a few suggestions found in online forums - disabling Windows Search and Superfetch, adjusting page file
 size, etc. but nothing has done the trick yet. I don't have any outside anti-virus software installed. I read about the potential MSI issue but don't have IDE ATA/ATAPI Controllers listed in the Device Manager. Finally, it seems to boot up normally and will
 have periods where the disk usage drops and it's usable but those moments are brief and it inevitably goes back up to 100% usage.</span>

            If you have Anniversary - see the top pinned thread.&nbsp; I saw a couple of pre-anniversary clients with 100% disk usage - both fixed with a Windows "refresh" (with "keep data" option).&nbsp;&nbsp; This may seem drastic but if you originally upgraded to 10 from 7 or
 8 it can be a worth-while exercise.&nbsp; Just make a backup of data (precaution) and any program licenses as these will be uninstalled (unless they came from Windows store).

            Thanks for the quick reply. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the refresh only seemed to have a temporary impact. &nbsp;Back up to 100% disk usage and everything shuts down to a crawl.

<p>Hey I played to chapter 10 and everything seemed perfectly fine UNTIL I was struck down by the boss and the game just died. I tried run it again a million times but every time I was stuck at the 'Press Any Button' before the title screen...</p>

<p>Ah the dreaded 'Any Button' glitch, I was hit by this at Chapter 9. </p>
<p>What I did to solve it was I power cycled the console by holding the Xbox Button on the console for 10 seconds followed by unplugging the power cable from the system for a further 10 seconds before plugging it back in. Upon powering the console up again
 I found the glitch had been fixed. </p>
<p>Hopefully this works for you. </p>

<h3> robert ferrentino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Event Log Never Logs Channel, logs placeholder &#34;Media Center&#34; instead.</h2>
                    <p>When a program records, or fails to record, the event is logged in the event log. Every event has the same channel attribute, fixed to "Media Center". The expected value
 would reflect the channel the tuner was tuned to (i.e. Channel 9).</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span>One MAJOR point of having the event viewer is to be able to troubleshoot recording issues. When the Event Viewer never records the channel this greatly
 limits the usefulness.</p>

<h3> imrekugler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power BI Install Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to install Power BI. &nbsp;It appears it has installed, however when I start up the app I just get a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I uninstall by double clicking on the program in the task bar, it doesn't really uninstall..... &nbsp;When I go back to the store, it shows "this app is installed". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I got a bad install, how do I force a re-install or un-install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            Hi Imre,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Does the issue persist with a particular app?</div>
<div>2. Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<strong>Apps troubleshooter.</strong></div>

<p>
</p><div>If&nbsp;you still want to uninstall the app, refer</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Sideload Apps with DISM</p>
<div><strong>refer (Remove Apps) </strong></div>

<p>
</p><p>I did all the things in the first link you gave me for troubleshooting, except that uninstall seems impossible.</p>
<p>

<p>You will need to continue working with support. No one from Microsoft reads this forum and no one from the enforcement team uses the forums. You would have to file a complaint on them via the console in order for the enforcement team to investigate them,
 but since this would have been something that did not happen on Live, they would not be able to ban him.</p>

<p>All the enforcement team would be able to see is that he made purchases, not that he stole your information. So they would not have enough information to ban him. If he stole your account information via messages over Live, then they would be able to ban
 him.</p>

<p>Those ticket numbers are for phone/chat support only.</p>
<p>As Smwutches said,we are just regular gamers here,no one from Microsoft or the enforcement team reads these forums.</p>
<p>All anyone can see is that there were transactions on your card,not who made them.</p>
<p>You would really need to take this up with your family &amp; your bank/card issuer.</p>

<p>Hi are the videos captured on Xbox one? If so you can get them on to your own PC by doing the following.</p>
<p>Once video is saved share to your One Drive.</p>
<p>This will make the video accessible from any of your devices which are linked to you One Drive (your PC for example)</p>
<p>Access PC File explorer open the One Drive (right click select open from menu)</p>
<p>Your saved videos will appear then just drag and drop on to your PC. </p>
<p>The videos will come off the One Drive and now be saved on your PC</p>
<p>Hope this helps, let me know how you get on</p>

    <title>How to&#58; Reinstall or Restore your original Windows Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre da costa  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to&#58; Reinstall or Restore your original Windows Installation After Upgrading to or Evaluating Windows 10</h2>
                    <strong>Technical Level</strong> : Intermediate <br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
<p><strong>Please note this article details instructions about migrating from preview builds of Windows 10 to a previous version of Windows (Windows 7 or 8/8.1). Although the article discusses pre-release&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;builds, the same instructions work if you
 are running the final version of Windows 10 and want to reinstall your previous version Windows.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Previews currently available will eventually <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install/expiration-dates-for-windows-10-technical-preview/b979fd2b-f8fc-4e6b-a023-f018a0a44127">
expire</a>. The expectation among users should be that they will either need to upgrade to the&nbsp;final release or reinstall their previous version of Windows after they have completed their evaluation of the Windows 10 Preview. Microsoft officials recently indicated
 the intention of having the preview releases support upgrades to the final version. This is the intention, but of course, things can always change on the road to RTM. With the excitement surrounding the arrival of a new major release of Windows and the more
 public approach to testing Windows pre-release version, a lot of persons who are normally not exposed to beta testing are jumping in without hesitation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide to pay for the final release or you would like to restore your previous version of Windows, you will need to be prepared if this becomes the eventuality. The following wiki article shows you how.</p>
<br />
<strong>Details</strong><br />
<p>If you upgraded or migrated your previous version of Windows to Windows 10&nbsp;you can consider the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-use-the-rollback-function-in-windows-10/3e9e5c2d-239f-488c-9f48-64a226302657">
Rollback option</a>. If you have been diligently updating to each new build of Windows&nbsp;10, you will
 be able to <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
go back</a> to&nbsp;the most recent build.&nbsp;If you somehow migrated from Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7/8/8.1 to Windows 10 and find out there is no option to go back, then you will have to prepare to do so manually. Microsoft has indicated when users upgrade or migrate
 to Windows 10, the recovery partition used to restore your system to its original factory state becomes inoperable.&nbsp;The recovery partition&nbsp;is used in the event you need to reinstall Windows on your computer.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>What is the recovery partition?</strong></p>
<p>Some computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some Windows XP, Vista and even Windows 7 users, if you don't have a recovery partition, you might have to use the recovery media that came with your computer to reinstall Windows. The recovery media often comes on a DVD or set of CDs that are sometimes
 labeled Recovery, Operating System, Drivers and are installed according to how the disc is labeled (Disc 1, Disc 2, Disc 3). Unfortunately, sometimes these discs get lost or damaged. Your best course of action is to request recovery media from the manufacturer
 of the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link to all OEM contact numbers you can use to request recovery media from the maker of your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemcontact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemcontact</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What if you upgraded to a retail copy of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgraded to a retail version of Windows, then you can use your reinstall disc to reinstall Windows on your computer. See links below for
</p>
<p>instructions. If you have an upgrade version, this will require that you first reinstall the qualifying license in order to use the upgrade
</p>
<p>version. Please see the links below for work arounds for doing a clean install with the upgrade version:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 8/8.1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8/8.1 users are sometimes limited in this respect, this is especially true for owners of certain form factors such as Ultrabooks that do not have optical drives normally used to facilitate the restoration of a system. In this case, you will have
 to manually download a copy of Windows 8/8.1 in order to reinstall the operating system. Unfortunately, this can be quite a chore. Fortunately, due to possible feedback and ongoing refinements and third party advancements, reinstalling Windows 8/8.1 since
 its release in 2012 is a lot more convenient. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Downloading Windows 8/8.1 - things to take into consideration</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were running Windows 8.0 prior to upgrading to Windows 10, think deeply whether you want to go back to this release or just go directly to Windows 8.1 with Update 1 which can be easily downloaded. Windows 8 users have until early 2016 to upgrade to
 Windows 8.1 with Update 1 in&nbsp;order to continue receiving support. January 2016 might seem like a long time away, but its best you do it now to save you all the trouble. Besides, its way more reliable, considering that for Windows 8 installations, upgrading
 to Update 1 is a staged process, you have to first upgrade to Windows 8.1 through the Store, then install Update 1 through Windows Update. By simply downloading Windows 8.1 with Update 1 media, you avoid all this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do you do it?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft recently released a new Media Creation Tool&nbsp;which you&nbsp;directly download and create a .ISO file for Windows 8.1 with Update 1.
</p>
<p>Lets take a look at how that is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download the Media Creation Tool from the following link and save it to your Downloads folder:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click Media Creation Tool file to launch setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0554eaea-55e9-4b34-a35f-19831473a366" /></p>
<p>Wait while setup begins</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/715a9bdd-3fa5-45ab-81a9-e530cbcd6477" /></p>
<p>The following window allows you to select the Language, edition (Core or Pro), Architecture (32 or 64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3726ad96-f618-4fab-b7ba-0a9e4db48c83" /></p>

<p>Choose how you want to prepare your files. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install by creating media</strong></p>
<p>This I think is one of the most important steps, a lot of persons do not have fast Internet Connections, or they are using metered Internet Connections which prohibits them from downloading large files using their ISP over a period of time. Windows 8 is
 a 2 GB download which is still significantly large for some Internet Connections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB flash drive</strong></p>
<p>If you have a thumb drive with 3 GBs of available space, you can use that to create a bootable copy. Thumb drives are very cheap these days, so pick up a couple and create one as your first backup option. This is especially recommended for persons using
 Ultrabooks which do not include optical drives (DVD) or Netbooks. There are some desktop systems that do not include one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISO file</strong></p>
<p>An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 8, a blank DVD. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO and burn it using the built in Disc Image
 utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Creating a .ISO file</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. </p>

</p><p><strong>Retrieve your product key:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 8 setup did not retrieve your key and you had to use a generic key from the link provided, here is how to retrieve the product key from the BIOS.</p>

    <title>I see CSRSS&#58;EXE not CSRSS.EXE in Taskmanager&#47;Processes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredgoldfarb  say:</h3>
<h2>            I see CSRSS&#58;EXE not CSRSS.EXE  in Taskmanager&#47;Processes.</h2>
                    <p>Task manager shows an oddly named process, similar to csrss.exe&nbsp; but has a COLON ( : ) in place of the period ( . ). This is what is showing up: csrss:exe<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find it's location so far, when I click on "End Process"&nbsp; the standard Taskmanager warning comes up about other processes might be affected, but otherwise, nothing else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Search came up with&nbsp; two help file locations along with this csrss.exe.mui&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 which though similar, has the ( . ) not the ( : ) colon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me figure out if there is a trojan/virus/malware or if it's the real deal, the csrss.exe file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp; </p>

<h3> chiphil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open the application &#34;iTunes&#34; because another user has it open.</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new computer with vista. Installed iTunes on this computer and found that there is some problem between the two profiles on the computer. I run iTunes on my profile - but whenever my wife's profile is active we get consistent error
 messages stating "<span>Cannot open the application "iTunes" because another user has it open. Ask the other user to quit the application and try again"
</span>
<div><span><span>I need to keep itunes open in my profile - and anyway why are they triping over each other in the two profiles in Vista...we never had this problem in XP.</span></span></div>

<p>Find the Itunes.exe in the Itunes folder in Program Files.&nbsp; Right-click on the .exe/ Properties/ Compatibility, look down the bottom of that page for "Privilege Level" and tick the box that says "Change settings for all users".&nbsp; In the next window tick the
 box that says "Run this program as an Administrator".&nbsp; This may only solve your problem if you can both run it as the same username.<br />
<br />
When you Run a Program as an Administrator you should get a UAC prompt (unless perhaps you have disabled UAC?<br />
<br />
To see file extensions you may have to go into Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, there you can untick "Hide known file type".&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update failed due to bad graphics card, restoring to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> auswin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update failed due to bad graphics card, restoring to Windows 7 stuck on Restarting...</h2>
                    <p>So my laptops discrete graphics card fried itself a while ago, causing an indefinite black screen after the Windows logo at startup, so I had to disable it and uninstall its drivers, then install the drivers for the integrated graphics card. That's worked
 just fine until I decided to update to Windows 10 today. Everything went well until the last restart. Then it went to "Hi", then cut to black. I knew exactly what that meant, and that is that it installed the graphics card drivers for the discrete card without
 asking me. So I thought maybe it would continue to install and then I could shut down using keyboard shortcuts. However, I soon found out that it didn't keep installing at all, and instead halted everything when the screen went black. So I thought ok, I'll
 just boot into safe mode and disable the graphics card again like I did before. However, it won't boot into safe mode until I finish the OS setup (I take all the steps to get to Safe Mode, however it will then just restart again and go back into the regular
 mode setup), and I can't finish setup until I get into Safe Mode. See the dilemma? So I think OK, I'll just downgrade back to Windows 7, as that option is still obtainable in the Recovery menu during boot up. So I choose that option, put in my password, etc
 and now it has been sitting on a screen saying,</p>
<p>"Go back to the previous build</p>
<p>Restarting..."</p>
<p>for the last hour and I'm afraid it is stuck. Anybody know what I should do? And does anyone know if there is a way to keep Windows 10 from downloading new drivers on installation and instead force it to use my integrated graphics card drivers I already
 have installed?</p>
