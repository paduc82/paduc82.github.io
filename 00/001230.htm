<h2>            Word 365 on iPad Pro Leaving LARGE blocks of space in document</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching the net for an hour now and can't seem to find a solution for this phenomena.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Word 365 for iPad Pro. NOT the desktop Word for Mac. Version is 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, something got set in my document somewhere, because there are huge areas of white space that are appearing randomly in my document. When flipping pages it's very easy to see. There may be one or two lines at the top of the page and then the rest
 of the page is blank, only to start again at the top of the next page. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the usual things. I turned on the hidden marks and there was nothing unusual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even edited it on a Windows MS Word 2013, and couldn't find a thing under the space before/after paragraphs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have opened the saved iPad document in Word on my desktop and those blocks are there also. it's almost like there are HARD page breaks, but the hidden marks don't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this is a bug?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's causing the anomaly?</p>

            <p>So I did something and it seemed to fix it, though I'm not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When right clicking in paragraphs and choosing the "paragraph" option, I noticed that under the "Line and Page Breaks" tab, that "Keep with Next" was checked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the whole document (Cmd-A) and then set the above option off. Boom. Everything was fixed. From my reading, I thought that checking that option would have had that affect, but it's the opposite effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my new documents the default IS to Keep Paragraphs together which doesn't been logical.</p>

    <title>attachment window disappears when attaching excel file to outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deb rozeveld  say:</h3>
<h2>            attachment window disappears when attaching excel file to outlook 2010</h2>
                    When I have Excel open and I go to Outlook 2010, create a new message and click on the Attachment icon, the window opens so that I can browse to the file I want to attach.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But, as soon as I click on the file I want to attach, the computer moves my screens back over to Excel. &nbsp;If the file that I wanted isn't showing on the screen (because it's alphabetically not showing because of the amount of files before it), I have to
 click back to the insert attachment window and scroll to the file. &nbsp;When I click on the file, it once again brings me over to Excel and I have to click back to the insert window again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The 3rd time I try and attach the file it will work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If Excel is not open, everything works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that I could close Excel every time I want to attach something, but I work in Excel all day long and don't want to be opening and closing every time I want to attach a file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>

            I *believe* I made have found the solution. &nbsp;I had to turn off the "preview" pane in Windows 7 for another reason and I believe this fixed it for attaching documents also.

    <title>Office 365 installation failure &#34;Background Installation ran into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hugo ahlenius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 installation failure &#34;Background Installation ran into a problem&#34;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to get Office 365 2013 Small Business installed on my Windows 7 64-bit Urtimate machine. The computer previously had Office 2007.<br />
<br />
I have tried many things, including the FixIt clean-ups for Office 2003,2007,2010 and of course 2013. I have troubleshooted the Internet connection, and uninstalled a bunch of possible problematic programs. I have tried with the firewall disabled and on - same
 problem. Clean boot - same problem. <br />
<br />
But when I try to install I always get this popup "Background Installation ran into a problem". It still continues to stream/install, and shortcuts to the programs are on the start menu, but they don't work, and I am not able to repair the installation.<br />
<br />
Any tips?<br />

            I can add that I can install without any problems in a Virtual PC instance (hosted on the computer with problems) - which proves that the network, router etc is not the problem.<br />
<br />
I have tried both 32-bit and 64-bit installers, with the same problem.<br />

            <p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Outlook Community. As I understand, you’re unable to open Outlook after installing Office 2010 in Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know the account type configured in Outlook (POP3, IMAP, Outlook Connector and Microsoft Exchange)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs if there is an issue with Outlook Connector installed on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue of unable to open Outlook, you may follow the steps mentioned below and verify the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1] Uninstall Outlook connector version from Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>2] Restart the computer.</p>
<p>3] Download and install the latest version of Outlook connector from the link mentioned below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24677</a></p>
<p>4] Once done open Outlook and check if that resolves the issue.</p>

<p>I receieved a lumia 1520.3 rm-938 for fathers day.&nbsp; Used it about a month and releaized reception blows on tmobile.&nbsp; Purchased a lumia 965 to replace it while i left the country (reception supurb) &nbsp;and sent 1520.3 back for repairs.&nbsp; Guess what? Got a letter
 that many have recieded on here that device cannot be repair because it was not made in the USA.&nbsp; BS.&nbsp; Stand behind your name and product.&nbsp; Satisfiy the customer.&nbsp; I have purchased apple phones from the china store and had it replaced here in the US and vice
 versa.&nbsp; I love the nokia brand and microsoft.&nbsp; But getting BS replies about how they can't do this or that on a phone not made here or there is trash.&nbsp; I've been recommending the Lumia line and MS to everyone i know.&nbsp; I will now have to withdraw that base
 on my current experience with their support.&nbsp; On top of that the repair center in dallas made an error with my address and for some reason the phone was sent back to them.&nbsp; I have not heard from them and the reply i recieved from customer service did not point
 out anything regarding the shipping.&nbsp; just kept apologizing about their **bleep** service and there warranty procedure.&nbsp; They normal buyer does not know anything about regoin specific device and warranty based on where it's made.&nbsp; If it's sold here in the
 USA, having bands that work with the carriers here.&nbsp; Then why should it not be supported by NOKIA/Microsoft.&nbsp; On top of that should the repair center not have realized they got a rejected package and correct the error.&nbsp; The phone is in damn near mint condition.&nbsp;
 Why don't nokia make an attempt to give me credit for the phone so that I can go purchase another nokia product.&nbsp; I would have been satisfied with that.&nbsp; Or replace it with new 1520.3.&nbsp; And if the&nbsp;new phone&nbsp;has the same reception problems i would be able to
 live with that.&nbsp; At lease Nokia tried.&nbsp; Instead of sending a **bleep** reply letter apologizing and basically telling i'm screwed, thanks for your money and keep supporting us.</p>

<p>The notion that an Apple phone bought at another place in the world can/will be serviced anywhere else is a myth and is actually not the truth. Just like most any other consumer product these devices are covered by a region specific warranty and you can't
 claim it cross region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the T&amp;C for Apple product warranty.. look it up..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try searching for 'global warranty' on the Apple support site and find numerous threads on exactly this.</p>

            I did not finish reading your post. I stopped halfway.<br />
<br />
You cannot expect the warranty of one product/brand to be the same with everything else. Just think of the consumer law in each country, they are not the same.<br />

<p>Say what you like. &nbsp;But i speak based on experiences. &nbsp;Not whats written on a peice of paper. &nbsp;It had a fried logic board from a CHINA bought iphone. &nbsp;I replaced it here in the states. &nbsp;I don't care what their warranty states. &nbsp;I got it replaced in an apple
 store in houston. &nbsp;And at this point i just want my phone back. &nbsp;It's saturday and I was suppose to receive it monday. &nbsp;They had an address descrepency on it. &nbsp;It got returned to nokia dallas repair center. &nbsp;And they have been unable to track it down. &nbsp;Great
 job Nokia! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, &nbsp;! Any update about your concern? Did you already receive your phone from the repair center? To clarify the manufacturer's limited warranty, Nokia does not have an international warranty. Once the technicians found out that your phone is not intended
 for where you're located, which in your case is US, they will just send it back to you un-repaired. This has been a frustrating experience and we understand you for feeling that way. To know more about the manufaturer's limited warranty, go here:&nbsp;<a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/guides/WC_B9229743_EN_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/guides/WC_B9229743_EN_1.pdf</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a safe one!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;MonkeeKing<span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am sorry about your issue with Nokia, regarding your 1520.3. I was in the process of purchasing one, until I read your post. Now, I have changed my mind.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please don't let Nokia get away with it. Sue them in a small claims court, one of the TV courts. Do this, not just to try to get a replacement for your device, but also to give them a bad PR for not standing behind the product that they manufacture.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Talk to the press.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to every known news outlet and make your issues with Nokia public.</span></p>
<p><span>Make Nokia&nbsp;come out in public to explain why they should keep your money.</span></p>
<p>Even if you don't prevail legaly, The unsupecting world would know Nokia for what they really are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage every victim of this ridiculous scam to take similar actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Yes indeed it is a ridiculous scam! I am now involved with the same issue and my parents 1520.3 Rm-938. Microsoft will not even commit to repair! And it has been confirmed to be under warranty! They advised me that if they replace the phone, they will send
 we the hobbled ATT 1520 with no Qi charging and lame LTE bands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We bought the 1520.3 Rm-938 for these EXACT reasons, so it is unacceptable for it to be replaced with a far inferior product. It is actually a breach of&nbsp;warranty.&nbsp;Microsoft repair&nbsp;has been ignoring me&nbsp;for 5 days now, and their twitter account is more than
 useless. What happened to Microsoft? &nbsp;</p>

<p>You are using a product not officially/originally sold to the NAM market. The warranty for this product is only valid for the regions it was intended to be used and sold to as per the warranty T&amp;C (which btw are virtually the same for any consumer brand/product
 in this respect)</p>

<p>Not correct Paul</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Microsoft mobile support website clearly states that the 1520.3 Rm-938 is under warranty in the USA (see my attachment). Additionally the customer care case manager confirmed that the RM-938 would be either repaired or replaced under warranty at the
 Texas repair facility. However, if it was to be replaced, it would be replaced by&nbsp;the AT&amp;T model, which as you know is missing Qi charging and critical LTE bands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is simply unacceptable. If I send a device to be repaired under warranty,&nbsp;I expect it to return to me repaired and with the same functionality as when&nbsp;I sent it in.</p>

<p>The odd thing is that afaik (but I could be wrong) the only model sold in the US is the ATT model as the 1520 was/is exclusive to ATT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the attached screenshot is correct and the official Microsoft pages state that the device is in warranty for the US it would seem that it should be repaired as such. I'll try and get one of the mods to look at this for you.</p>

<p>Hi Ginger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please make sure the Outlook has installed the latest update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can start Outlook in safe mode via the steps below to verify the result:</p>
<p><span>1. Hold Windows key + R.</span><br />
<span>2. Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:</span><br />
<span><em><strong>Outlook /safe&nbsp;</strong></em></span><br />
<br />
<span>Note: There is space between Outlook and /</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If Outlook works in safe mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:</span><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox.&nbsp;<br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it.&nbsp;<br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work, may I confirm the following before proceeding?</p>
<p>1. Are you using an Office 365 Business account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. How do you configure your account?</p>
<p>3. Do anyone else have the same issue in your organization?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Round Up in Word 2010 via VBA</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a document that I store raffle numbers for a short time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how many raffle books I need, I know that each book has 50 tickets in it, so I need to divide the total number needed by 50, but say I have 51 tickets, I will need 2 books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Word 2010 VBA to round up to the nearest 50, so that if the answer to my question is...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1 and 50, I will be told that I need&nbsp;1 book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between&nbsp;51 and 100, I will be told that I need 2 books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 101 and 150, I will be told that I need 3 books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is that part of the code I currently have:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BlockSets = Round(Tickets / 50) 'Tickets = Raffle Ticket</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>

<h2>            Printing Double Sided from Word</h2>
                    I cannot print Double Sided from Word 2016 on my Mac. I went to Layout and set it to Long-Edge binding, even saving it as a preset. But, for some reason, it still prints 1-sided. My laptop prints PDFs double-sided but not Word docs. So I am convinced there
 is a problem with Word. Anyone who has any advice - it would be much appreciated!

            <p>I appreciate how you might believe as you do, but Word really has no way of knowing whether its output is being directed to 2 sides of a sheet or only to one... nor does it care :-) In fact, Word doesn't even know what size paper is being used [despite the
 specified document dimensions], the number of pages per sheet, etc.&nbsp; It simply hands off the data including the page layout specs for margins &amp; orientation. IOW, Duplex is not a layout specification of the document. It's a print function handled by the printer
 &amp; its driver software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common reason for a printer to not perform as it's expected to is that its driver software is corrupt or out of date. In such cases, it isn't unusual for certain features to "work just fine" with some programs but not with others. There have been
 numerous reports of similar situations related to Apple's rapid-fire release of ne operating system software... developers no sooner get something right when Apple goes &amp; pushes out a whole new set of underpinnings which require different coding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... The first steps to resolution of the issue are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make certain that your version of OS X is fully updated.</li><li>Office 2016 should be at v15.27 or later</li><li>Equally important, check the mfr's web site to see if there is a firmware and/or driver update for your model. You might also see if others are reporting a comparable issue.</li></ul>

<h2>            Iris scanner comes on and doesn&#39;t turn off until device unlocked</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Today I noticed an issue with my Lumia 950. If I receive and miss a call while the device is in my pocket, the iris scanner will turn on and not turn off until I unlock the device. If left in my pocket the red light stays on and the device becomes very hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------</p>
<p>Update: I have not had this problem for a week.</p>

Saro33</a>. Thank you for posting on the community. How's the phone doing? Are you still experiencing the same concern? Doe it only happen when you receive a missed call or even with other notification? We look forward to your reply. &nbsp;

            I am having serious issues with the phone. &nbsp;Iris scan keeps turning on like yours have and my battery gets drained very quickly every time. &nbsp;The iris scanner doesn't turn off and even while charging, it is still on. &nbsp;The phone doesn't get charged and it
 is really really annoying. &nbsp;This is after I brought back the phone from MS Store to try to repair the problem!

<p><span>Hi Vikas,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In my experience, the kb2566790 is an error code when you sign into your Skype for Business (SFB). If I misunderstand it, please add some clarification for me thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In general, the kb2566790 shows you have a <strong>
DNS configuration issue</strong> ( custom domain) of SFB with your office 365 account. If the custom domain is hosted on office 365 you can ask the admin to sign into office 365 admin center to check it, if not your admin should know where to check it.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Please use the admin account to sign into <a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadmin.microsoft.com%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C8cc7d5d252dd4078fff308d608b733b3%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636705980259516106&amp;sdata=7IziJw9NCVawfjVpt3MylzQ6pnjAn9CyKhveJTzqql4%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Navigate to Set up &gt; Domains.</span></li><li>
<span>Choose your custom domain and extend the Skype for Business. You can refer to this article

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, if the issue persists after you checked the DNS configuration, I need to collect some information for a further investigation:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Does only you meet this issue? What about other people in your organization meet the same issue?</span></li><li>
<span>Have you configured your SFB account to another computer and if you meet the same issue? Please share the result to me, thanks.</span></li><li>

    <title>Printing envelopes in Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorgule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing envelopes in Word</h2>
                    <p>A colleague created a word document that allowed multiple envelopes to be printed in one batch (mail merge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I printed out my letters on the envelopes using this word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, now when I want to print just one envelope, it pulls the address from the first list of addresses from the word document that has multiple addresses. It prints out the address I type in the address with the address from the mail merge document
 on either side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the ability to just print an address on an envelope again?</p>

            If you have a document that contains all the envelopes, each envelope will be in a separate section. To print a single envelope, enter the section number (such as s22) in the Pages box in the Print dialog.

<h2>            Save outlook attachments nothing happens when I run the code</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>In a previous agency I set up rules which would run scripts save and rename attachments....saving the attachments to specific folders on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From memory, the script was from Ron De Bruin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have access to that script.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I've found his and other scripts and although I can successfully set up a rule and chose the script to run, when I run the rule nothing seems to happen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you supply me with a a script that works or help with trouble shooting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using MS Office 2013 Windows 7 32bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest script i have been experimenting with (and which doestn't work) is below....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

    <title>Why does my Windows Phone rename music files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jay745  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my Windows Phone rename music files&#63;</h2>
                    A week ago I was trying to copy an album to my Windows Phone, but I kept having this issue. For some reason it renames songs that I copy to the device. I don't have Windows 8 or 7, but I have Vista. I can't use the Windows Phone app to sync music, so instead
 I use Windows Explorer to copy my mp3s into my phone. My issue is that some songs I copy by a specific artist will be renamed and will share the same title of one song that I copied with the group. So say if I copied the album "RAW" by Hopsin into my phone,
 the songs will copy successfully. But when I go to listen to them on my phone, the first song on the album, "Hot 16s", is the name of every song on the album as well. I even copied another song by Hopsin, it wasn't a part of that album, but it STILL was renamed
 "Hot 16s". Yesterday I discovered that three different songs that I have by the same artist, but are from different albums share the same name as well.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, the songs aren't duplicated, they're all different, they just don't have the correct name. Why does my Windows Phone do this? I already checked the properties of each song that I have on the computer, but when I check the properties of the songs
 on my phone, there is something wrong. Along the list where it says "Title" it displays the name of the song next to it. The title is of course incorrect, but I can't change it. Is there anything I can do?</div>

<h3> auguestina  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I syn more emails on the mail app in my iphone&#47;mac&#63; It only shows slightly more than 100 emails.</h2>
                    <p>I have several email accounts set in my iphone and Mac, only hotmail got this problem. I tried deleted/reset the acc, but no luck. In the earlier OS version when I can set the email syn emails to 'no limit', it also didn't work. Even when I do a 'search'
 in the mail app, it still failed to search in the older emails which are actually in my email box in the server. Pls kindly advice how can I syn all my emails in the app using an iphone/Mac. Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;assist you further with the issue could you please confirm a couple of things:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Are you using the default Mail App?</span></li><li><span>Has your Account migrated to Outlook Mail?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried sending a test email and check if you're able to receive?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This issue normally occurs due to bad caches and bad settings after the update. As an initial troubleshooting, you need to clear your mobile cache, remove (make sure to
<strong>turn off the automatic update</strong>), and reconfigure your account. Refer to the link below for more information:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/to-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/to-go</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your email app supports Exchange ActiveSync and you need to configure it manually, use the following settings:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Server address: s.outlook.com</span></li><li><span>Domain: &lt;leave empty&gt;</span></li><li><span>User name: Your email address</span></li><li><span>Password: Your password</span></li><li><span>TLS/SSL encryption required: Yes</span></li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Default mail app is used</p>
<p>2. Migrated</p>
<p>3. No problem on send and receive, just the number of emails syn to my phone and Mac book is too limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the setting in your reply to create a new exchange email account using the default app, it still doesn't help.</p>

</p><p>My phone model is iphone6s, ios9.0.1. This problem actually persisted in the passed few years with my older iphone models. Do want to figure out what's the problem as it is quite inconvenient.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this happened in all my Iphones (old ones and new one) and Mac book, which seemed to be an Hotmail account problem.....I don't understand what did you&nbsp;mean by '<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">bad caches and bad
 settings' after what 'update</span>'? To trouble shoot, I have deleted the hotmail account in my Mac book (at the cost of loosing all the flags/labels in my important mails....), but this problem still persist. I wish further helpful advices can be provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Oh I just found I have lost all my mails before 20May2016....why? This just happened during my 'trouble shooting' these days.....since I had all my old mails in the web mail, which is the only way I can check my older mails. Could you tell me how can I
 get them back??? I guess they were lost during I switched between IMAP/POP/exchange mail setting in my Iphone/Mac book...why is that...which is less important now. I do want my older mails back!!!! Thanks.

            Hello. What does this app do? Was it specifically designed for WM 6.X? Did you install the app to main storage memory or storage card?&nbsp; If the developer has a user support or forum page, I would go there for any additional help.

            Hello. Yes, it appears to be a code reader. It says you can d/l it by an SMS or going to www.flashcode.fr. Unfortunately, I don't speak French so had to rely on the translator. You must have got an SMS invite if you didn't go to the site. So did it install
 to the main memory or storage card? All apps usually give you a choice. There weren't very good instructions on how to use the program. Maybe you need to have code to read before you open the program. I'd uninstall it if you don't want it. Not worth the trouble.

    <title>Mac Outlook 365 bullets different than Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob murata  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac Outlook 365 bullets different than Outlook.com</h2>
                    <div>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>If I create a simple bulleted list HTML email on Outlook.com (and I also believe Outlook on Windows, but I can't test due to an old install issue), it creates true HTML bulleted lists. When I do the same thing
 on Mac Outlook 365 it creates some weird &lt;span&gt; coding.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><strong>Why this is a problem</strong>: as a Director I sent lots of emails to VPs and above. When executives reply to my bulleted emails from the Mac the indents and bullets often get lost/messed up. This is
 a big problem. See below for the source code each generates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span><strong>Request</strong>: of course ideally there’s some preference hidden somewhere to make Mac Outlook generated HTML bulleted lists like Outlook.com that'd be great. If that’s not possible I’m totally open
 to a work around where I write the text in another Mac app and then paste into an email window on Outlook Mac.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
