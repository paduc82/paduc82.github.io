<h2>            How do I display the name of the applications in my taskbar &#40;in addition to the icons&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    My office is in the process of upgrading to Windows 8 and we've run into a small problem. On older versions of Windows, when an application or file is opened, each application is listed on the Taskbar with an icon and the name of the application of file.
 In Windows 8, only the icon is displayed. <br />
<br />
This is fine for most programs; but, at my office, we use a number of proprietary applications. The icons for all of these applications are identical (just the default generic application symbol.) So, when you have multiple windows and/or applications running
 within our proprietary system, all of those icons appear on the Taskbar, but are identical. You can hover your mouse over them to see what they are (or use Alt + Tab to see them;) we could also change the icons for all of the applications, I suppose. So, there
 are workarounds. But, ideally, some people would like to have the names listed along with the icons. Is there a way to do this?<br />

Yes but I wouldn't call it "ideal".&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes up a lot of room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think "ideal" would be finding out how to make showing the tooltip quicker and more reliable.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTW notice that if there is a window already opened for a Taskbar icon that its thumbnail seems
 to pop up quicker than its tooltip would have?&nbsp; And that when that happens you can read the application's name as the title of the thumbnail?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, for that case check out&nbsp; Task Manager's Fewer Details display.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running tasks are listed with their full name
 there too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, if you really want this, it's in the Taskbar Properties, Taskbar buttons:&nbsp; Never combine.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Yuck.&nbsp;&lt;w&gt;)</p>

            Sorry but the programming is done that way.&nbsp; You could change the look of the icons by going into the Properties and change the icons to a different one for each user.

    <title>Multiple Internet Explorer Icons - All but the actual program link to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Internet Explorer Icons - All but the actual program link to My Documents</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently encountered a problem with a number of icons on my desktop screen - I have at least four Internet Explorer icons appearing, and each of the icons, when double-clicked on, link directly to the 'My Documents' folder. The strange thing here is
 that instead of being named 'My Documents', the folder is actually named 'Internet Explorer'.</p>
<p>Another strange thing is that when I attempt to access my Control Panel, it also redirects me to 'My Documents', which also is named 'Internet Explorer' instead.</p>
<p>When I right-click on these icons, only three options are shown: Open Home Page, Create Shortcut, and a jumble of random characters. Clicking on Open Home Page brings me to the wrongly-named My Documents folder. Clicking on Create Shortcut does exactly what
 it says. Clicking on the jumble of characters opens the Internet Explorer Properties Droplist.</p>
<p>I am also unable to delete these icons by dragging them to the Recycle Bin icon; a red No Entry symbol is shown, and the Delete key has no effect.</p>
<p>Checking the Registry via Regedit revealed next to nothing, except for one shifty looking registry value that I'm not willing to risk tampering with -&gt; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\Desktop\NameSpace\{ED228FDF-9EA8-4870-83b1-96b02CFE0D52}</p>
<p>I'm pretty much at my wits' end here. I've downloaded and used the following softwares:</p>
<p>- Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool, which found nothing</p>
<p>- SuperAntiSpyware, which found only Tracking Cookies and deleted those</p>
<p>- Malwarebyte's Anti-Malware, which detected a number of problems and dealt with those, but did not affect the icons</p>
<p>- AvG 9.0, which had fixed some of my earlier problems in the past but found nothing</p>
<p>- PC Doctor, which found only Tracking Cookies and dealt with those</p>
<p>- Advance SystemCare, which scanned my system for spyware, scanned my registry and entire system, did a lot of nice little things, but did absolutely nothing to the icons</p>
<p>- Spybot Search and Destroy, which found only Tracking Cookies</p>
<p>- Registry Mechanic, which found quite a number of problems, but would not allow me to do anything until I bought the software</p>
<p>- ComboFix, which removed 'MyWebSearch' and some other programs, but essentially did not solve the problem</p>
<p>At this point, I'm already quite lost. I'd like to solve this problem once and for all, because this computer is pretty new and all.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Try using one of the following free products to delete the files.&nbsp; Unlocker
 at: </span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>or
 File Assassin </span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;(with or without Force Delete:</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></a><span>).
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.&nbsp; The fact that your Documents folder is renamed Internet Explorer concerns me -but I'm not yet sure how to resolve that or if one of the following procedures will do so
 automtically.&nbsp; We'll address this later if nothing else helps identify and/or resolve the problem.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;desktop or shell folders (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow
 from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although
 this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system
 came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span>

<p>Hi Lorien,</p>
<p>thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>I've followed your instructions, and this is what happened:</p>
<p>1. I installed both Unlocker and FileAssassin. Unlocker detects the files, but is unable to delete or do anything to them. FileAssassin was unable to detect the suspicious files at all.</p>
<p>2. System Restore shows only a single Restore point, and that was created by ComboFix. There are absolutely no Restore points prior to that, and this problem surfaced on the day before I used ComboFix, so this isn't an option I'll be able to utilise.</p>
<p>3. I've run the Disk Check through the command prompt, and the system found no bad or corrupted files.</p>
<p>4. Event Viewer doesn't have any issues regarding Desktop or Shell folders.</p>
<p>5. I've already run MBAM and Spybot, but they've found nothing related to the icons. The rest of the Antivirus programs I've run have also found only simple issues such as Tracking Cookies and several potentiall unwanted programs.</p>
<p>This is the MBAM log:</p>

<p>6. I've done a clean boot, and the icons are still there.</p>
<p>There's one thing I've noticed about the icons, and that is that they're not shortcuts; they're actual programs. I'm not sure what their nature is, though.</p>

<h2>            Big XP wknds are BAD&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>am i the only person who thinks massive xp weekends sort of devalues the ranking system, im not a rank *** or anything im only level 50 and was 37 before this weekend, but i kinda dont like it, although people will say rank means nothing that is not true
 its there as a part of the game and although its not the most important thing in the world it is silly to ruin it by doing big xp weekends that mean someone could be a 100 and played less then a 60 and be a worse player.<br />
<br />
cod does 2xp and that i guess is fine but it just seems stupid what epic do... i really hope gears 3 sees the end of these kinda things<br />
<br />
like i said not the most important thing in the world but still anyone else got any thoughts on the subject?</p>

<p>Then they should stop having achievements for rank then too. I wouldn't even play Gears multi if they didn't have those stupid rank required horde achievements. They should stop having multiplayer achievements all together in my opinion anyway.

<p>dont take this the wrong way unseen shadow but if you dont enjoy playing gears 2 then just stop, is it really worth it for achievements?<br />
<br />
i mean achievements are all well and good if you like a game they can add something else to do, but i dont see how getting them on a game you dont like is fun or gives any satisfaction?

<p>Different strokes, Guns and Horses. Achievements matter to a lot of people, and as such has become an objective for many to knock all of them out before Gears of War 3 comes out.</p>

<p>I agree with what Afsos 1 is saying. I personally am just trying to get my Veteran Gears achievement. Before these events, I didn't touch online at all (Except horde) But I actually do have a bit of fun playing online now that i decided to "take the plunge"
</p>
<p>I agree that they shouldn't have any multi-player achievements, but what can you do. &nbsp;The thing with the ranking in this game is after level 50 the gaps between each level become greater and greater. For example to get from level 97 to 100. You need the
 same amount of XP as going from level 1-50. &nbsp;So at least when they run these events it speeds up the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I mainly want to get the Veteran Gears achievement so that I can get the Veteran Gears medal in Gears 3.

<p>no no no listen lol that guy said he didnt like gears 2 and was just playing for the achievements, he didnt mention wanting to unlock things for gears, if you play a game you dont enjoy purely for gamerscore/achievements i dont get it...</p>
<p>anyway everyone is different so fair enough im not saying hes wrong ive just never understood it, anyway back to my main point it maybe the same to go from 97-100 as 1-50 but thats how the game is, its not fair for someone who got to 100 with normal xp if
 you get it faster, i dont think well it takes a long time so justifies it is a good reason for big xp weekends.</p>
<p>if people have the vet medal in gears 3 i wont think wow they are a good player and big gears fan ill think oh i bet they didnt get that with out the weekends, SOOOOO (lol this is long my bad) i go back to my original view, big xp weekends devalue rank and
 now it even devalues gear 3 unlocks.</p>
<p>my final thing battlefield bad company 2 has a 1-50 scales and they never have xp changes so when i see a 50 or even a high rank i think they must be good, yeah some just play alot but trust me with a score/min of 210 im only rank 28 and ive played for almost
 3 days, so in that game ranks means something. just because you may want gears 3 unlocks if you get it in one 20th of the time a proper 100 got it... whats the point</p>
<p>anyway i think this is way to much discussion on the subject lol and im not even sure if my point is really correct but anyway a good debate is always good :D</p>

<p>With all the games out there, some people still pick their favorites. I think they should just get rid of Multiplayer based achievements in general. :D Good debate :D</p>

<p>i dont agree that multilayer achievements are bad to be honest, i think most (NOT ALL lol) people that say that just dont like or arnt good at it and still want all the achievements on the game, i think if they are balanced properly then they are good, for
 example get 10,000 knife kills while spinning backwards and telling everyone else in the lobby they suck = bad achievement, get 20 kills with each weapon = good achievement, because like all achievements it should encourage you to play all the game even bits
 you perhaps wouldnt normally &nbsp; <br />
<br />
not every achievement online has to ruin the game and if done properly they dont (by ruin i mean cause people to play in such a way that it effects the result of the game just for personal achievements), its good to reward people with achievements not just
 rank in that particular game, and for people that dont want to play online just to get the achievement.. well then you dont get it lol</p>

    <title>Window 10 Enterprise Evaluation build 18362.19h1 issues in my Dell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hari j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 Enterprise Evaluation build 18362.19h1 issues in my Dell Latitude E6540</h2>
                    <p>I had installed&nbsp;Window 10 Enterprise Evaluation build 18362.19h1 couple of days back as to tryout. To my surprise the build quality is very poor. Since mine is 4 year old laptop with old hardware I wouldn't worry on the performance (still way slower than
 my windows 8.1), however, there are basic issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I had display calibration done since my e6540 has default yellow tint. My screen keeps flickering to old calibration quite frequently. This behavior is seen during network/wi-fi connect/disconnect, lock/unlock, portable browser open/close etc.</p>
<p>2) Finger print scanner not working though (Dell DDP) appropriate drivers are installed and was working fine for a while.</p>
<p>3) Wi-Fi is active and connected yet says "no internet connection" while trying to browse. I had to disconnect and reconnect manually.</p>
<p>4) Removable SD Card reader kept reconnecting, volume/drive is on/off in explorer. Not to mention screen flickers each time it does that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above are some basic stuff and should be a issue in Window 10, which has evolved over time.
</p>
<p>Note: appropriate drivers are installed and updated. It's a shame MS only focused on UI and does't bother much on stability w.r.t to basic device drivers/connectors/plug-in play systems. Also, the small icons are actually larger and I could fit only 5 shortcut
 icons in my taskbar and could remove "Search", "Cortana" and "Task View".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate someone guide me should I go forward spending more time on workaround or revert back to Windows 8.1. The reason I would want to go for Windows 10 is because there isn't much support for older OS. As a developer, any update to, say, VS,
 Python and essential utils are unsuccessful stating necessary runtime dlls were missing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Yoga 2 Pro - Samsung SSD T1 connection problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Yoga 2 Pro - Samsung SSD T1 connection problems</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">For many months, I have been dealing with a frustrating issue when connecting my external Samsung SSD T1 (500 GB) to my Yoga 2 Pro laptop. &nbsp;After two weeks dealing with Samsung tech support and getting a new
 unit, I am convinced the problem lies with laptop Windows installation and not the drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">The external SSD is supposed to launch an "unlock" window upon connection, allowing you to enter a password to unlock the drive. &nbsp;When I connect it to the USB port, it acts as if it is going to work, but then
 the disk seems to "hang" and stop communicating with the laptop. &nbsp;I can see the disk in File Explorer, and even open the drive folder to see the executable inside that needs to run. &nbsp;But when I double-click the unlock program, it hangs. &nbsp;The entire drive becomes
 unresponsive. &nbsp;I see this behavior regardless of&nbsp;(A) the drive is connected before the laptop is powered on; or (B) when I let the laptop fully boot and then connect the drive afterward. &nbsp;Either way, same problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">With me so far? &nbsp;So here's the piece I find bizarre. &nbsp;I have found that I can "temporarily fix" the issue by (A) doing a hard reset to the laptop; or (B) running the Windows troubleshooter. &nbsp; But the fix doesn't
 keep. </p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">Holding in the power button for ten seconds to force a power-down of the laptop. &nbsp;If I do that and then restart the laptop, everything comes back up fine and the SSD will connect and work exactly as it is supposed
 to. &nbsp;But the next time I connect the drive or power up the laptop? &nbsp;Back to having issues again. &nbsp;Only works with a hard reset. &nbsp;It doesn't work if I use the standard Windows power-down option.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">Same exact thing if I run the Windows troubleshooter. &nbsp;It tells me it fixed an issue and I have to reboot. &nbsp;After rebooting, everything works once. &nbsp;Then the next time I start the laptop or connect the drive,
 back to the drawing board.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">That's the cycle and it happens like clockwork. &nbsp;Connect drive and it doesn't work. &nbsp;Resort to a ten-second power-button hard reset, and then things will work fine once. &nbsp;After that, back to the beginning of
 the cycle.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">Has anyone here seen this type of behavior before? &nbsp;Or have troubleshooting tips&nbsp;I might try to resolve the issue? &nbsp;It's driving me up the wall. &nbsp;Thank you for any suggestions you may have.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(73, 73, 73, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for trying some steps in order to get the issue fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the issue persist with other devices? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to perform a Scan for hardware changes and then see if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key + X.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b: </strong>Then click <strong>Device Manager.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Then click <strong>Scan for Hardware changes</strong>( the icon looks like a computer)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I followed your directions to "Scan for Hardware changes" but it did not make a difference. &nbsp;The laptop continues to behave in the same manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried right-clicking each of the USB hub &amp; device items in an attempt to update drivers, but in every case it came back and told me the best driver is already installed.</p>

            <p>Hi Patrick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please perform SFC Scan and then check if it helps. As it will help in clearing if there are any&nbsp;system file corruptions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the

<p><span>System file check works on Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1, and win 10&nbsp;<strong>

            <p>Hi Jessen. &nbsp;I've been experimenting with this for a while now and have two lines of thinking. &nbsp;Please let me know if they make sense at all, or if I'm out in left field. &nbsp;(Definitely getting out of my technical comfort zone with these topics.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the drive is set up to automatically launch an executable upon connection to the USB port, I'm wondering if there could be some kind of permission problem somewhere? &nbsp;A setting in Windows that occasionally doesn't want to give it administrator-type
 privileges to run, causing something to stop/hang/pause? &nbsp;Could it be something along those lines?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a similar line of thinking, is there a way to uninstall it completely from Windows, so I can attach it again as if my laptop had never seen it before? &nbsp;I tried uninstalling it from the Device Manager and reconnecting it. &nbsp;If I remember correctly -- and
 it was a few days ago so I could be wrong -- it still remembered what the drive letter(s) were and all of that when I connected it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, just the mechanics of how it works, when I first connect it, Windows recognizes it as Drive E. &nbsp;It appears as small (124 MB) drive formatted as FAT32. &nbsp;It contains the executable "Samsung Portable SSD.exe". &nbsp;Running that is supposed to bring
 up the password screen, and after successfully unlocking the drive, it "disappears" from Windows and reappears as the real drive (465 GB under letter Z).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I reinstalled Windows 10 hoping that would help. &nbsp;I forget the exact name of the process I used, but it was a reset or reinstall, keeping all of my user files. &nbsp;I had to reinstall all of my software again afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After everything was reinstalled and Windows went through all of its necessary updates, the problem persists. &nbsp;For good or for bad, I know a little more about it, but not enough to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be some kind of interaction that involves the antivirus software on this particular laptop. &nbsp;If I am using Windows Defender, I need to put an exclusion rule in the mix to make sure it ignores the file "E:\Samsung Portable SSD.exe". &nbsp;<em>That
 seems to do the trick, for the vast majority of the time.</em> &nbsp;I happen to prefer the free Avira antivirus software, but when it's turned on, no matter what I try to do to exclude that executable or even the whole drive will do the trick. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's both noteworthy and frustrating that I have very similar setups on my two desktop computers, with no problems whatsoever. &nbsp;They work fine, and they have Avira installed with no exceptions or anything like that. &nbsp;I am only seeing this on my laptop, and
 I can't for the life of me figure out what the antivirus real-time checker is hitting that makes things essentially "hang". &nbsp;And, furthermore, the hard reset thing from before still seems to resolve the issue "once", only to have it come back on the next connection.<br />
</p>
<p>At this point, I think I've spent enough time on this problem. &nbsp;If you have any wonderful insights that might put the whole thing to rest, I'm all ears. &nbsp;But active troubleshooting is behind me now. &nbsp;I appreciate your time.</p>

<p>Thank you but unfortunately it did not help.</p>
<p>I have only a brand new, MS supplied install USB stick for Windows 10.</p>
<p>The PC has no software on it and there is no option for 'repair' as windows is not installed yet (hence the USB). The screen is the basic black with white text (original DOS form).</p>
<p>After checking the BIOS for boot from USB and rebooting, it starts the install from the USB, a ribbon bar shows progress. It runs for less than 10 seconds and then comes up with the error mentioned or now&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Jennay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Who
 is your sound card manufacturer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To check the Sound Card manufacturer, follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Start; in the<em>start search</em> type “msinfo32” (without quotes) and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the left pane, under system summary, expand Components and click on Sound Device.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the “value” for the item “name” in the right pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you recently make any changes to your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the sound card driver software usually has an application which will include a volume mixer, equalizers, etc. If you’ve a sound application
 installed along with your sound driver, then I would ask you to check the settings for the speakers and headphone in that application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to make your headphone as the default device when it is plugged in.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To make headphone as the
 default device</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; Go to Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Switch
 to Recording.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 your microphone/headset as the default device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Save
 the changes by clicking on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Uninstall and re-install your audio device drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type “devmgmt.msc” without quotes and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and Game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the audio component and then click uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you’ve uninstalled the driver completely, manually download the drivers for your computer manufacturer website and install it. You can visit
 the link below to know how to manually update the driver for a device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Call Of Duty World At War&#58; Installed but doesn&#39;t run smoothly </h2>
                    I have just received my copy of call of duty world at for my laptop. unfortunatly it didn't show on the website i bought it from what the system requirements were. so i tried installing it, and it worked. but for the game to run at its fastest (which is
 still slow) it has to shrink my screen resolution to its smallest but it still runs slowly. afterwards i read the system requirements and my laptop doesn't meet the requirements. is there any software or anything i can buy or download so that i can play with
 a full screen?

<br />
It lags during gameplay, making it very hard to play it at all, because the game is constantly trying to catch up whatever's going on.

<p>Hello Lil Jim 666,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, If you system does not meet the system requirements, there is not much that can be done. You will need to have at least the minimum requirements is order to have a decent result from the game.</p>

            Sorry all you can do is to download the latest driver for your graphics card, but that wont help a lot. What is your graphics card? If your laptop cant run the game I suggest you stick with older games. Newer games doesnt mean better games. Counter Strike,
 Call of duty 2 are great games, in my opinion they are better than some this gen games.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having issues in game with GTA V stats changing. Since this is an in game issue there's not much assistance we can provide because the developers own and operate the
 systems that maintain your progress on their end. One thing you can try would be to remove and recover your profile from the console. Forcing the console to sync data back up from the developers servers. If it is a problem with the information on the servers
 themselves I'd recommend contacting GTA V support or Rockstar themselves. </p>

<p>Dear Shubham Chaubey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for paying attention to my query.</p>
<p>I checked the web link you shared. There its all about "How to be able to use Hyperterminal in Windows 7".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current Possibilities:</p>
<p>I am able to launch Hyperterminal in Windows 7 machine and use it for serial port emulation manually.</p>
<p>My problem is whatever I do manually with keyboard and mouse in hyperterminal, needs to be done using automation. I am using AutoIt tool.</p>
<p>There again I am able to launch Hyperterminal, configure settings, inject text into it all through AutoIT automation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Challenges:</p>
<p>I am not able to retrieve text from Console and use it as events to perform different actions. Because it looks like the Control identified as Class type "Term Class" is not exposing the text in the console. Whereas text in notepad application gets detected
 easily. Hence my question, is it possible to detect texts and characters printed on hyperterminal console in automation tools in particular AutoIT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mayoor</p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/30483e15-b7ea-44c4-8162-32dd33c9db26" title="MahmoudKeelany">

</p><p>Whether Skype Caller ID works depends upon several factors.&nbsp; Please see the entire FAQ help article,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What is Caller Identification, and How Do I Set It Up?</a>, and excerpt of which is copied and pasted, below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>In what countries is caller identification available?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The caller identification using your mobile number and/or Skype Number is available in most countries.</em></p>
<p><em>Caller identification using your mobile number is available across the world, with the exception of China, Hong Kong, Japan and Mexico.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Caller identification using your Skype Number is available in:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>USA</em></li><li><em>UK</em></li><li><em>Chile</em></li><li><em>Denmark</em></li><li><em>Estonia</em></li><li><em>Poland</em></li><li><em>Sweden</em></li><li><em>Switzerland</em></li></ul>
<p><em>If the caller identification doesn’t work it might be because it’s not available in your country or it’s not currently supported by the local telecommunication provider for the country you’re calling. We're working hard to make caller identification
 available in other countries, too so that everyone can recognize you're calling them from Skype.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps to provide the definitive information you seek.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10, General Failure, Class Not Registered</h2>
                    I have gone through every discussion thread, and every resource to try to correct this problem with Outlook 2010, where all links error out with the above message. &nbsp;I did not have this problem before the Windows 10 installation which completed last evening.
 &nbsp;All defaults are properly checked, I've just completed an SFC scan (which wasn't an easy task)....no issues here either. &nbsp;I REALLY need to find a way to resolve as it's impeding my job. &nbsp;Can someone help with any alternative suggestion(s) beyond what I've
 tried. &nbsp;BTW, I know it's a glitch that's appeared in Outlook because the links work fine when I use my email web browser. &nbsp;I have also run into an issue where I'm receiving a MAPI error when I try to save and send a document without closing the document. &nbsp;
 I'm using Chrome, and was on Windows 7. &nbsp;If that helps. &nbsp;thank you.

    <title>Disk Usage at 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> venrosonitas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Usage at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure how long I've had this problem, but the other day my computer randomly started to act visibly slower. I hadn't downloaded anything new, and it was in the middle of a session while I was just listening to music on Youtube. I then decided to
 check my task manager and long behold my disk was at 100% usage even though I had already closed all the running applications. I have tried every solution the internet has to offer. First I disabled superfetch, windows search, and BITS, but that didn't do
 anything for me. I also changed the virtual memory, but again to no avail. I then did an error check and chkdsk.exe but these didn't help either. My disk wasn't fragmented. This led me to finally trying to reset windows, and that didn't work either. (Note:
 I did run my system for viruses with malwarebytes premium and avast but they found no problem). I then remebered that I could do an SFC which I ran and it concluded that some files were corrupted but was unable to repair them. I tried checking the cbs.logs
 but I couldn't it gave me a message saying "Ignored" or "can't check." So what do I do now? I am unsure of how to proceed. At this point I am considering going to a computer repair technician.&nbsp;<br />

            <span>Hi Windy Joe,<br />
<br />
Try the following steps in the methods and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1 :</strong> <br />
<br />
First check for file size</span> of the Windows.old folder.<span>Then under your C drive in the root there will be a folder named "Windows.old", delete it. it will promt you several times that you are deleating system files. Just say ok
 to all of them, they are old.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2 : delete files using Disk Cleanup</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>To delete files using Disk Cleanup</strong> <br />
<br />
The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To clean up all files on the computer<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3 : Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</strong> <br />
<br />
Follow the the steps in the following link : http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance<br />
<br />
Also applicable for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span><br />
Method 4 : <br />
<br />
System Restore</span> </strong>is a very useful feature of Windows 7 but it has one main drawback. After running for a few weeks, it can use a lot of your hard disk space. With the default settings turned on,System Restore might use up to 15 percent of the
 space on each disk. For example, if you have a 250GB <span>hard disk drive</span> , System Restore might end up using 37,5GB of it. That is a lot of space.<br />
<br />
What can we do to limit the amount of space used by System Restore? In <span>
Windows XP</span> making this kind of configuration was pretty easy. You had a slider in the
<em>System Properties</em> window that you could move <span>left or right</span> to the desired percentage. Unfortunately this slider was removed from Windows 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to configure the amount of space used by System Restore, you need to use a tool called
<em>Volume Shadow Copy Administrative Command-Line Tool</em> (or vssadmin.exe).<br />
<br />
<br />
To access vssadmin.exe we will have to open the <span>command prompt</span> with administrative rights. In order to do that, type "cmd" or "command" in the
<em>Start Menu</em> search field. The first result should be <em>cmd.exe</em> or the
<em>Command Prompt</em> . If you have UAC turned on, right click on it and select
<em>Run as administrator</em> .<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The <em>Command Prompt</em> will open. The Volume Shadow Copy Service offers several configuration option. Type
<em>vssadmin /?</em> and press <em>Enter</em> to see the list of available options.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to know how much space has been allocated and the maximum amount of space that can be used by System Restore, type
<em>vssadmin list shadowstorage</em> and then hit the <em>Enter</em> key.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fsysrestsp%2fsysrestsp2.jpg" />
<br />
If you want to change the amount of space used by System Restore, you should use the following command:<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /on=[drive letter]: /For=[drive letter]: /Maxsize=[maximum size]</em>
<br />
MaxSizeSpec must be 300MB or greater and accepts the following suffixes: KB (for kilobytes), MB (for megabytes), GB (for gigabytes), TB (for terabytes), PB (for petabytes) and EB (for exabytes). If a suffix is not supplied, MaxSizeSpec is in bytes. If MaxSizeSpec
 is not specified, then there will be no limit to the amount of space it may use.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, if you want System Restore to use a maximum of 1GB of space for the restore points on drive "C:", you should type the following:<br />
<em>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=1GB</em> <br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.vista4beginners.com%2ffiles%2fimg%2fsysrestsp%2fsysrestsp3.jpg" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The maximum space used by System Restore has now been resized.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 5 :</strong> <br />
<br />
You can launch CHKDSK using two methods (the former being the easiest):<br />
<br />
<strong>Graphical Interface method:</strong> <br />
<br />
Open the <strong>Computer</strong> option from the start menu, which will display all of the drives available to scan on your PC:<br />
<br />
Then, right click on the drive you wish to scan for errors and select <strong>Properties</strong> :<br />
<br />
Now click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, then <strong>Check Now</strong> under the error-checking section:<br />
<br />
You have several options within the check disk tool. It is always recommended you leave the "automatically fix file system errors" box checked, as this repairs and problems found. If you want to perform a deeper scan, tick "scan for and attempt recovery of
 bad sectors". This second option takes longer, but is worth doing if you suspect a drive problem. Once you are configured, click
<strong>Start</strong> :<br />
If you try to check a disk that is currently in use, you will receive a message asking if you wish to schedule a scan. Accepting this will perform the scan next time you restart your PC:<br />
<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Command Prompt Method:</strong> <br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can use the command prompt to perform a scan on a drive letter of your choice by running "chkdsk x:" where x is your drive letter. The manual scan options are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>/F Fixes errors on the disk. </li><li>/V On FAT/FAT32: Displays the full path and name of every file on the disk. On NTFS: Displays cleanup messages if any.
</li><li>/R Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information (implies /F). </li><li>/L:size NTFS only: Changes the log file size to the specified number of kilobytes. If size is not specified, displays current size.
</li><li>/X Forces the volume to dismount first if necessary. All opened handles to the volume would then be invalid (implies /F).
</li><li>/I NTFS only: Performs a less vigorous check of index entries. </li><li>/C NTFS only: Skips checking of cycles within the folder structure. </li><li>/B NTFS only: Re-evaluates bad clusters on the volume (implies /R) </li></ul>
"CHKDSK x: /F /R" would perform a full scan (including bad sectors) and attempt to fix them.<br />
<strong><br />
Chkdsk disclaimer</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost<br />
<br />
Complete information on chkdsk see : <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc730714(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 8- &#34;SecureBoot is incompatible with firmware&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a computer- an ultrabook model from Sony that has only been out for a couple of months. I assumed two brand new technologies would be compatible. However, running the Upgrade Assistant tells me that the firmware on my computer is incompatible

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked Microsoft for help and they told me- sorry... looks like Windows 8 won't work with your computer. (I would blame this issue on them. Windows 8 should have been made compatible with computers that have recently been released.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked Sony for help and after 5 different technicians, still have the same problem- my firmware is still incompatible with Secure Boot.</p>

Well it is even bad to see my Toshiba P770 bought just last year 2011, a really new laptop with lots of first class hardware, and then one finds out that upgrading has a big issue with M$ Secure Boot because of firmware.&nbsp; Note that after upgrading my BIOS to
 the latest version, I still get the same result, and I don't plan to buy yet another computer just because M$ says that's the only solution.&nbsp; I now see W8 as a total failure, and one reason to jump on Apple camp.<br />

My laptop was bought in 06/2011, and as I said somewhere else my Toshiba laptop does not have this feature in the BIOS.&nbsp; In fact, I went back and loaded the latest BIOS from Toshiba, ran upgrade assistance, I got the same result as the original poster.&nbsp; Another
 M$ failure!<br />

 there it is, some homework for Microsoft to complete before it becomes a worldwide cry for help about this issue. Well I am glad I checked first if everything was okay before running to buy Windows 8 Pro. Otherwise I will be at this moment with a bricked desktop.

I don't have a solution for your problem, but M$ should have done a better homework before that M$ puts that show displaying how easy it was to upgrade to W8 Pro.&nbsp; Another OS failure coming from M$, and this lets the door open to move to Linux or Apple OS X.&nbsp;
 It seems that M$ will never learn its lessons from other failures in the past.<br />

<h2>            USB 3.0 device isn&#39;t recognized as such on a USB 3.0 port</h2>
                    I bought a new memory stick. Transcend 8GB USB 3.0. The speeds are about 10mB/s (USB 2.0 speeds). I got this message when I put it in a USB 3.0 Port: "This device can perform faster if you connect it to a Super-Speed USB 3.0 port"<br />
<br />
My computer is MSI GT780DX. I downloaded the USB 3.0 drivers from the MSI page: http://www.msi.com/product/nb/GT780DX-GT780DXR-.html#/?div=Driver&amp;os=Win7%2064<br />
<br />
When that did not work I went here: http://www.station-drivers.com/page/renesas.htm<br />
and downloaded "Firmware Version 4.0.1.5.0.2 (Windows 32 &amp; 64bits)" but that did not work either.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 64-bit.<br />
<br />
At Device Manager I find "Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller" and "Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Root Hub" which I have read they should be there. They are also "working properly".<br />
<br />
What can I do to make my USB 3.0 device working? Thank you for your answers.<br />

<p>As XBF suggested, it is generally best to start your own thread, particularly as this thread is almost two years old,</p>
<p>but while I'm here....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>minimum</em> VRAM</span> requirement for this game is
1GB.</span></p>
<p>If the game actually launches and runs smoothly @1280x720 consider yourself lucky, but if you want to run the game</p>
<p>@1080p and be able to use high graphics settings you will need a new graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your cpu and system RAM are quite adequate for most games but games are increasingly using more VRAM so you should
</p>
<p>look into buying a new graphics card with at least 4GB VRAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your budget, try for an AMD <em>RX570</em> minimum if you want to stay with AMD, or an Nvidia
<em>GTX 1050ti</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>minimum if you want to try Nvidia.</p>
<p>- If you wait a bit longer you could get the new Nvidia 2000 series, but they always release their high end model at the start,</p>
<p>so it will be a couple of months before they release the GTX 2050 and a bit longer before the GTX 2050ti , both of which</p>
<p>should be significantly more powerful than the 1050ti </p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you were to go for a more powerful gpu&nbsp; you would also need to upgrade your power supply.
</p>
<p>eg- GTX 1060 - 450W , GTX1070/1080 - 500W are Nvidia's recommended minimum for these models.<br />
My understanding is the new 2000 series will have higher psu requirements than the 1000 series with 650W minimum for the GTX2080.</p>

    <title>Frequent Windows 10 BSODs on a new machine build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deejayshag  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frequent Windows 10 BSODs on a new machine build</h2>
                    <p>I recently built a new machine with Windows 10, and am running into BSODs occurring pretty regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a number of different errors noted in them...</p>
<p>Attempted_Write_to_readonly_memory</p>
<p>Kmode_exception_not_handled</p>
<p>System_service_exception</p>
<p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is very little installed on the machine at this point, because it hasn't been stable enough. It has a couple of steam games, for my son to play, and that's about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically the BSODs occur during normal use-- sometimes while playing something on steam, other times while trying to read basic web page in firefox or chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled the driver verifier, per the instructions here:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983</p>
<p>
</p><p>After disabling the on-board LAN in my BIOS (since it's not being used) no BSOD occurred during boot up, so, on a whim I enabled verifier on all drivers, including Microsoft's, and consistently get&nbsp; DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION crashes on CLIPSP.SYS
 during boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have grabbed the last couple of minidumps, as well as exported the msinfo32 data, and used Speccy to dump the system specs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjzKkSvXx_KjgQvbKMUtx4aQUHcW</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find anything of value regarding the CLIPSP.SYS violations, so I'm not sure what to do about those.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
I am about to re-enable the verifier (just selecting the non-microsoft stuff again) and will run it while using the computer normally again, to see if I get any other crashes again, then will repost those here, again, if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really hoping somebody can help figure out what's going wrong, because it's driving me nuts at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Was the on-board LAN Realtek wireless? If it was, you seem to have resolved the issue by disabling it and I think you should stop running verifier and check to see if the crashing has stopped.</p>

            Looks like a virus. I recommend the following 2 things:
<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Perform a Windows Defender Offline Scan:

<p>One of two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Your computer is currently infected with malware, or</p>
<p>2- Your computer was previously infected with malware, and your anti-malware application didn't completely remove the malware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two steps to perform:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Install the&nbsp;<em>free</em> version of <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Malwarebytes</a> to (hopefully) remove whatever remains of the malware. If you still see the message:</p>
<p>2- Sign in to an account with Administrator permissions and open Task Manager [CTRL+ESC+DEL] and then open the Startup tab. Right-click on the startup entry for&nbsp;<span>ryhbq.vbs and delete it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You should also open File Explorer and navigate to&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c:\Users\joejo\AppData\Roaming\hwisi\ryhbq.vbs</span></p>
<p>

<br />On the view ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Navigate to:

<br />
<br />If the file ryhbq.vbs exists: 
<br />Right click it and open it in Notepad 
<br />Replace all the contents of that file with: 
<br />Wscript.Quit 
<br />
<br />If the file does not exist in that folder, right click and choose New - Text Doument 
<br />Put this text in that file: Wscript.Quit 
<br />
<br />Then click File - Save As 
<br />At the bottom of the save as dialog, set save as type to *.* 
<br />Save the files as ryhbq.vbs 
<br />Note you must enter the vbs file extension youself 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC

            Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>

<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.
