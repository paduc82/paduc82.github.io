<h2>            Page number disappears when I add texture or background to my documents. Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I thought I had posted this this morning, and sorry if I am repeating the questions!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an approximately 135-page document that I am adding 5 textures to different pages through the document (a book). These textures are background to the text on the pages. I am working on the document in Windows 10, Microsoft 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening, however, is after the texture is added, the numbers at the top of each page disappears and only appear on pages that have no background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciated help in solving this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Suzanne's suggestion is correct, but it needs some additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, a discussion of layers in Word:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floating objects, such as your pattern graphic, can be in layers in front of the text of the body of the document, or in layers behind that text.</li><li>If the cursor is in a header or footer when you insert a floating object (which anchors the graphic in the header/footer), that object can be in a layer in front of the header/footer text or behind it.</li><li>The fact that's missing here is that every layer in the header/footer is behind any layer in the body text. So even though you made your pattern "behind text" in the body text, it's still in front of the text in the header. That's what you have to fix,
 by cutting the graphic from the body, clicking in the header, and pasting.</li></ul>
<p>However, that involves another characteristic of Word documents, that the header (or footer) in each section of a document defaults to being linked to the one in the previous section.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply paste a graphic (or text or anything else) in the header of one page, it will appear on all the pages unless you first turn that page into its own section and break the links to the preceding and following sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that, click at the end of the page <em>before</em> one that has a pattern graphic, and click Page Layout &gt; Breaks &gt; Next Page. Then go to the end of the page that has the graphic, and again click&nbsp;Page Layout &gt; Breaks &gt; Next Page. Next, click Insert
 &gt; Header &gt; Edit Header to open the Header &amp; Footer Tools tab on the ribbon, and click the Link to Previous button to turn it off. Now you can paste the graphic into the header, and it will affect only the single page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pattern graphic will appear dimmed whenever the cursor is in the body text, but it will print as normal.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I am anchoring it to the Header. What I am doing is putting my cursor before the first word on the page, then I am copying and pasting the image. Then I am formatting it, so that it is behind the text. Then I am formatting the size and position
 so that it is 11 inches x 8.5 inches. At this point, the upper margin and the left hand margin are both white;&nbsp; I can still see the page number. The last thing I do is drag the image upward and to the left so that it now covers the upper margin and the left
 hand margin, which is what I want.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, when making this move, the page number disappears. And this is the problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not anchoring in the Header. To do that, you must be in the Header editing area. Insert &gt; Header &gt; Edit Header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, your insert must be formatted to be behind text. This is a Wrapping setting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A text box is another way of putting something in the graphic layer(s). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the layers, bottom to top. Anything with a larger number can occlude things with a lower number.</p>
<p>

<li>Graphics layer behind text header/footer</li><li>text header footer (including page numbers)<br />
</li><li>Graphics layer in front of text header/footer</li><li>Graphics layer behind text document layer</li><li>text document layer</li><li>Graphics layer in front of text document layer</li></ol>
<p>You are currently placing your graphic in layer 4, 5 or 6. This will hide anything in layers 1-3. You need layer 1.</p>

                    <div>Original Title:&nbsp;Outlook 2010 issue</div>
<div><br />
</div>
In Outlook 2010 it was possible to override the behavior that Outlook needs a default gateway with setting DefConnectOpts to 0 in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\RPC.. I don't see the \RPC in my registry however.
<br />
<br />
I see it the path down through \Outlook only.<br />
<br />
This is causing the issue where the Exchange is unavailable, not connected, et cetera.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help!<br />

    <title>Emails not opening - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails not opening</h2>
                    <p>Just today I starting having problems with my emails not opening in Microsoft Outlook. These are old emails that have previously been opened. Regular emails without any embedded links, will open fine. However, any email that has a link won't open and instead
 a small screen opens with what appears to be a link trying to run. Several try to run for each email, but the email itself does not open. I end up having to close Outlook through Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

            Hello WhippetMomma 
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community !!
<br />
<br />My name is Alaf, I am an independent advisor and I will help you.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Outlook is not responding? Outlook is stuck on a screen that simply says "Processing"? Or does Outlook crash, freeze or stop working when you open a file or send an email message?
<br />
<br />There are several possible reasons why Outlook behaves this way. We present the possible solutions in order, from the fastest to the most time consuming.
<br />
<br />Start Outlook in Safe Mode to correct the "Processing"
<br />If Outlook stops responding on a screen that says "Processing", you can close Outlook, start it in safe mode, then close it and open it normally to correct the problem.
<br />
<br />Quit Outlook.
<br />
<br />Start Outlook in Safe mode by choosing one of the following options.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10, choose Start, type Outlook.exe / safe, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />In Windows 7, choose Start, and in the Search programs and files box, type Outlook / safe and press Enter.
<br />
<br />In Windows 8, on the Applications menu, choose Run, type Outlook / safe, and choose OK.
<br />
<br />Quit Outlook and open it normally.
<br />
<br />If Outlook is not stuck on a screen that says "Processing" or if this does not solve the problem, follow the steps below. If these steps do not work, see Do you need additional help? at the end of this article.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, please visit <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-not-responding-stuck-at-processing-stopped-working-freezes-or-hangs-5c313d04-64af-4441-82d2-44e5a43eee5a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outloo...</a>

            Hello, thanks to contact the Microsoft Community. My name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />First access your email from the web and validate if the error persists via web.
<br />As you tell me the emails that are giving the inconvenience to open are old emails, so it validates the Outlook cache.
<br />Check the Office updates.
<br />In addition, check the Office and operating system updates.
<br />In addition, make sure your email is correctly imported into your Outlook profile.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that work for you.

<p>The problem only exists on my desktop computer. I can access my emails fine on my smart phone. And the problem is not just with old emails. I just said they were old emails because they were emails I had previously opened but were still in my Inbox. I was
 saving them to address at a later time. I opened them fine yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today, I received an email that had an embedded logo. When I tried to download just the logo, it gave me the same problem. I then tried to reply to the email and it would not let me reply. Instead it had the small message that said Microsoft Outlook
 was Contacting something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open one of the emails from yesterday from Petco.com, the little screen pops up and says Microsoft Outlook in the top corner, then it says Contacting: http://img.petco.com...then an entire string of more of the link. Then it has a green bar
 scrolling across as though it was trying to do something, but it locks up my Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I will have to get my computer technician over here. I appreciate your attempt to help.</p>

            Could you create a new Outlook profile?? 
<br />In addition, do you have access to other Windows profile in the same computer? 
<br />
<br />Yo can try to access these emails from Outlook on safe mode. For that:
<br />
<br />Press and hold the CTRL key and double-click the application shortcut.
<br />
<br />Click Yes when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />Then, go to File\Options\Add -ins
<br />Select COM Add-ins\Go
<br />Uncheck all add-ins.

                    When viewing full screen in Word 14.2.2 (or PowerPoint) on Lion 10.7.4, the Esc key doesn't return the view to normal view. Exit with the Esc key _does_ work for Excel. I think something was missed in the checklist when full screen support was added. Can
 anyone else duplicate this problem? Or is it just my installation?

            I can't honestly say because I still refuse to chase after Apple's most recent feline, but according to Microsoft KB there has not been any claim of Office-wide support of Lion's Full-Screen Mode. According to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2685940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2685940</a> the support has been added only for PowerPoint, not Word, Excel or Outlook.<br />

            Does here :-) But I think he's referring to the OS X Lion feature since PPT doesn't have Full Screen/Focus... or do you mean that ESC always returns to Print Layout View regardless of which View was in use before going to Focus?<br />

            Yes, this is happening to me in powerpoint 2011 as well, also on Lion 10.7.4. I currently have 3 presentations open in full screen mode, and can't figure out how to shut the two I'm not using! I also found that when I opened one presentation, another one
 I had been working with previously opened itself in full screen mode. Restarting the computer didn't fix it. It might be because I have copied slides between the presentations, but it seems like a really annoying bug.<br />

<p>Try&nbsp;refreshing the screen using the F5 key&nbsp;and then check if the duplicate file still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Word creates the duplicate file also called temp file to increase the speed and also for data integrity. You can refer to the link below for more information.</p>

    <title>Multiple copy from word to powerpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunildingankar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple copy from word to powerpoint</h2>
                    There are multiple text boxes in a powerpoint slide. I have to copy the sentences from Word and paste them in the ppt slide text boxes. Right now I am copying one sentence at a time and pasting it. So if there are 6 text boxes I have to navigate between
 Word and Power point six times. Is there a way to copy multiple items on Word clipboard (assigning each item a different shortcut like cmd+1, cmd+2) etc. and paste them one by one in every text box.&nbsp;

<p>No. The clipboard can have only one thing on it at a time.</p>

<p>You could try to <strong>copy all sentences </strong>(ctrl + c) into a single textbox in PowerPoint, then<strong> cut and paste</strong> (ctrl + v) each sentence onto the same slide, which will automatically create a new text box containing your selected
 sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This method should be much faster than constantly switching between applications.</p>

<p>You can select &amp; copy multiple items but they can be pasted only all at once due to the limited functionality of the macOS Clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is something you need to do frequently you may want to investigate some of the Clipboard Manager utility apps such as
<em>CopyClip</em>.</p>

<p>Soo through some intense searching and reading I found an answer.</p>
<p>My time was wrong on my PC. I suspect the cmos battery is empty and during resetting of windows it got off.</p>
<p>For some reason it also couldn't sync because it got a peer error or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution: Make sure the date and time on your pc is correct.</p>

<h2>            Adding more circles to Venn Diagram</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Is there a way to add more than seven circles to the SmartArt basic venn diagram? After I reach seven circles, it won't let me add more. I'd like to use the basic venn (not linear or another design) if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Welcome to Microsoft community forum.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">From my understanding, you're emails were automatically deleted after a specific period of time. Let me assist you with this.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">It is possible that&nbsp;<strong>Scheduled cleanup</strong> is activated in your account. Once, a Schedule cleanup is set in your account, it will automatically create an email rule depending on the conditions that you have set. Also,&nbsp;i</font></span><span><span>f
 you performed scheduled clean up before, please be informed that it will automatically create an email rule in your account performing the same action.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p>To check and delete existing rules on your account, please follow these steps:
</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Sign in</strong></a> your account.</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Gear Icon</strong> located at the upper right of the screen then select
<strong>More mail settings.</strong></p>
<p>3. Under <strong>Customizing Outlook</strong>, choose <strong>Rules for sorting new messages</strong>.</p>
<p>4. It will display all the rules created. Tick the Box for the rule you want to remove and hit the delete button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, if there are no email rules in the account and the emails are still being automatically deleted from your inbox after a certain period, i<span>t will help if you can provide us with your
<strong>affected email address</strong>. This will allow us to investigate the issue in our end and provide an appropriate solution.</span></p>

            <p>No, this is caused by update KB3114409 which causes Outlook 2010 to start in Safe Mode. Microsoft has already removed this update from Windows Update but you computer must have downloaded it before it was pulled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can safely uninstall the update and after restarting your computer, Outlook will start with your own settings again and with Search enabled. The dll-file you referenced should remain disabled.</p>

 up and restarted, but nothing change.</p>
<p>I even uninstalled and reinstalled it, but now everything is blank, I can't access my groups or contacts, and even if I do I get a message, it just says "untitled conversation" and won't let me say anything. On my computer everything is fine so I don't know

<p>
Any video I've purchased will let me stream, but if I click the download button within the Windows 8.1 immersive video app an error will pop up and say "The item is missing or we can't get to it". Happens for all my purchases on all my devices...</p>

<p>Howdy Dylan_Kelly,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Support forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is normally caused by having invalid folder paths in your Videos library settings in File Explorer. Resetting the video library properties then restarting the PC normally fixes this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows Explorer, right-click the <strong>Videos </strong>Library, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart the PC.</li></ol>
<p>Once that is done, downloading videos through Xbox Video should now work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps to address your issue. As always if you have any additional questions or concerns, please feel free to reply to this post and we'll be happy to assist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, <br />
Bryce B</p>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/bbc3358b-ff86-4b55-9fa6-56f050a138f9" title="LarsLindén"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">LarsLindén</span></a><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount you pay for calling mobiles and/or landline numbers will depend on the country you are calling to. If you have a subscription, as long as the number you are calling is covered by your subscription, then you wouldn't be
 charged extra, the calling minutes you used will be deducted from your subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check which countries and call types are covered by your subscription:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to <strong>My Account </strong>on the Skype website. </li><li>Under your profile photo, look for the name of your subscription, in your case Unlimited World subscription.</li><li>Click the subscription and you will be given a list of the countries which are covered of the package.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><em>Note: If you see (incl. mobiles) beside the name of the country, that means you can call both mobile and landline numbers e.g.
</em>United States (incl. mobiles<em>).&nbsp;However, if you do not see that indication, then it means that you can only call landline numbers to that country.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If for example, the number you will be calling is not included in your subscription package, then you would be charged by Skype's low call per minute rates.&nbsp;Our call rates are the same wherever you are calling
<strong>from.&nbsp;</strong>They only vary depending where you are calling to. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check our <strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/en/calling-rates?expo365=empty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rates page</a></strong> for details. Find the country you wish to call and then search. Under Pay As You
 Go, you will see the call rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a call in Skype, you can tap or click their name from your contact list if you have their contact information saved, or use the
<strong>dial pad</strong> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2ffa100xx%2ffa12133_dial.jpg" />&nbsp;to enter their phone number. Please check

            <div>Some of the contacts are in people.live.com and some are in my local conatacts on my Sony Xperia tablet, it appears to be the contacts that are in my local device that are causing the
 problem. Although i just tried to respond to an email of yours and it sat in Outbox without being sent. I have since deletded my account from my tablet and started again. Previously a had to send an important email via my Gmail account as I had no other option.<br />
<br />
Any further would be appreciated as my hotmail account is my preferred account.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly new to Sharepoint and was wondering if I could get some help from the community. &nbsp;I've created a new Community Site, where our consultants and publicly communicate with each other in a forum format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that when a new discussion is created in a certain category, that certain members of a team get notified?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case in point, when any new discussion is created in Category A, it will alert User A and User B that a new discussion was created in Category A?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, to send the email notifications to community members, you may choose to set up the Alert for the discussions. However, this way doesn’t apply to the specific category. That means when you set up the
 alert, the new created discussions in all categories will send the notifications by emails to the members.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you regard this as an exception, please follow the steps blow to proceed.</span></p>

<h2>            Macro and Dcount</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a database, and have created a macro to count the number of active tickets but get a Data Type Mismatch in criteria expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro I created is a DCount if Field One a technicians name and Field two the status of the ticket match then count, I am sure it is something simple. (Below I have changed name to user1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>=DCount("[Assigned To]+[Status]","Tickets","'User1'"+"'Active'")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>any help would be appreciated</p>

            You should express the two criteria separately within a Boolean AND operation.&nbsp; The asterisk character can be used as the first argument to return the number of rows which match the criteria:<br />
<br />
=DCount("*","Tickets", "[Assigned To]='User1' And [Status] ='Active'")<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that personal names can contain apostrophes.&nbsp; My name in its original non-anglicized form for instance is Cináed O'Siridean.&nbsp; To cater for this each literal quotes character can be represented as a contiguous pair of quotes characters like this:<br />
<br />
=DCount("*","Tickets", "[Assigned To]=""User1"" And [Status] =""Active""")<br />

            Hi Wyndham,
<br />
<br />This works on a PC, maybe it will work on the mobile version . . .
<br />
<br />At the top right of the table is a small box, 
<br />
<br />From that choose table properties - Cell Vertical Alignment - Center       
        </p>

<p>Thank you DaveM121</p>
<p>
</p><p>The iOS version is quite different to the Windows version and doesn’t have the box you suggested. I did however find the vertical alignment option although it took some fiddling about to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I couldn’t get it to work if I selected the whole table - it only works, for me, row by row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has been very slow to fully accomodate iOS and typing into this reply box on an iPad is an example. The page keeps on jumping to the bottom every time I try to use an arow key to navigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not the end of the world, but it is irritating.</p>

            Hi Wyndham, yes Office on Mac does need a lot of catching up, but the Microsoft Developers are working hard to get it up to speed with the PC version . . .
<br />
<br />Every month on the iOS version we should see improvements as they implements new functionality . . .

This is Dasiel, a Microsoft Community fellow willing to assist you. <br />
Please refer to the following thread about an issue similar to the one you are facing. Since you already try some of the tips described on it, you can try the last one (temporary deactivating Firewall and Antivirus Program). I am adding another link with some
 other tips for you to try. <br />

<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>I've had similar issues like the above and followed all the steps, none of which worked.&nbsp; I decided to re-book my computer (HP Elite Book 64 bit with Windows 10 Pro) and the 30088-11 error still comes up despite a new installation of Windows, over 300GB
 free disk space and turned-off virus and firewall settings.</p>
<p>Would you have any other solution approach?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Mac Word 2011, Won&#39;t Print Multiple Copies of a Dodument</h2>
                    <p>I am running OX 10.9.2</p>
<p>Product installed is Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, Latest Installed Update: 14.3.9.</p>
<p>Printing to HP ColorLaserJet 3800n and HP LaserJet 4014n both via the network</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to print multiple copies of a document from Word, it will only print one copy. This happens when I print to either of the above printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can print multiple copies of documents from Excel, preview, Safari to both printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an issue for some time and I am finally tired of hitting print 25 times when I need 25 copies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
Thank you,<br />

            <p>As a general comment, what happens with some programs doesn't necessarily mean the same will be true with all... Different apps call on varying levels of print service, with apps such as browsers, PDF readers &amp; text editors at the bottom. Word is closer
 to the top end. That said, there are a few other steps you might try before actually reinstalling OS X:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-check everything based on this Apple KB: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Troubleshooting printer issues</span></a></li><li>If using AirPrint, see: <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/osx/printing/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Search for more AirPrint or printing solutions</a></li><li>Try the Mavericks <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery</a> feature.<br />
</li></ul>
Also, do you have any other versions of Office installed on the same Mac? Or if a prior version was installed, exactly how did you remove it?
