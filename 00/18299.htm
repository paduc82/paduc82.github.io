                    <p>Until recently I was able to run a java aplet in IE9.&nbsp; But with no apparent cause, the aplet won't run and a check for installed java shows none.</p>
<p>1 I uninstalled and reinstalled java.</p>
<p>2 Checked that java is enable in "manage addons"</p>
<p>3 Uninstalled IE9 and reverted to IE8, at first it seemed that the aplet ran, but stop running.</p>
<p>4 Reinstalled IE9 and jave.</p>
<p>Still won't operate.</p>
<p>Note: the aplet runs in Firefox fine.</p>

<p>can you give us a link to the website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but try</p>
<p>Tools&gt;Internet Options, Security tab, click "Reset all zones to default"</p>
<p>make sure that the website(?) is not in your Restricted Sites Zone (if it is, and you did not put it there, leave it there util you post back with its address.... your anti-virus may have placed it there...</p>
<p>to stop known malicious attacks....) we need to know the website address to give a better answer.</p>

    <title>School Office 365 account hacked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andyweinstock  say:</h3>
<h2>            School Office 365 account hacked</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so quick rundown of the situation:</p>

<p>Wednesday night I log into my school email (through Office 365/outlook), and notice I have an email sent from myself to myself with personal threats. I then check my sent email folder and see they messaged two of my instructors (I have since cleared this
 up with them).</p>
<p>I'd like to mention that I was not phished nor keylogged, and yes I know that for a fact. The person (and I know who did it) had no idea of any information besides my email address for my school email. Yet, they were able to break in and attempt to mess
 things up for me.</p>
<p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>One, are failed login timeouts controlled by the school?</p>
<p>Two, is there no two-step verification, and if so, is that also controlled by the school?</p>
<p>Why was my Office 365 account hacked so easily? I have since changed my password. My old password was only nine numbers. Is bruteforcing an Office 365 account that simple?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Office 365 has multiple factor authentication(MFA) feature, global administrators can set it up which requires Office 365 accounts to go through multiple steps authentication for accessing Office 365 online services. For using MFA-enabled Office 365 account
 in Outlook desktop app, app password is required. Refer to the link below for more information:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-Office-365-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6</a></p>
<p>I haven't seen such issues about Office 365 account get hacked. To avoid this to happen in the future, I would suggest that you always follow the best practice:<br />
1. Set complicate password and change password frequently.<br />
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj943764.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj943764.aspx</a>
<br />
2. Contact your Office 365 administrator to set up MFA.</p>
<p>Moreover, could you specify what "failed login timeouts" refers to? Is it the times that users are allowed to attempt to login? As far as I know, there isn't such setting for Office 365 account.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Vincent</p>

<p>I was referring to the system locking my account for a period of time if there are too many failed login attempts. There is no other explanation to my account being hacked besides bruteforcing, right? Since it was personal, and I wasn't phished or keylogged.
 Otherwise, I have no idea how they got into my account.</p>
<p>Also, I've contacted the admin about setting up MFA. </p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>Thanks for your explanation. Yes, there is an account lockout property for Office 365 account:<br />
1. After 10 unsuccessful logon attempts (wrong password), the user will need to solve a CAPTCHA dialog as part of logon.<br />
2. After a further 10 unsuccessful logon attempts (wrong password) and correct solving of the CAPTCHA dialog, the user will be locked out for a time period. Further incorrect passwords will result in an exponential increase in the lockout time period.</p>

<p>This policy is configured by cloud services from the backend, Office 365 global administrators are unable to change it.</p>
<p>As for your question about the reason of your account being hacked, I would suggest that you post the question to
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=windowsazureaditpro&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

There is no option to pin notebook pane to side in OneNote for Mac. You can vote for this feature via the link below, this is the best way to improve the product. Many features have been designed or upgraded based on our customers' constructive comments.<br />

            Hey AurieChidziva,
<br />
<br />If you add a word to the dictionary, it will never be marked as wrong again.
<br />Is that the solution you were looking for?

<h2>            Splitting up a large word document into many &#40;900&#43;&#41; subdocuments</h2>
                    <p>I have a very large word document that is an export from a Jira database of &gt;900 records.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have this document split into &gt;900 separate documents, each titled using a key that is in the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding out if Jira can export into separate documents per record, but it appears it cannot be done easily, so I am looking at other ways to solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a function in Word, or an external tool that would allow me to set up some search parameters to define where the start of each record is, and have the document split into &gt;900 separate docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of manual methods for doing this, but am reluctant to go through this &gt;900 times, plus I will likely want to make this process repeatable for new data sets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>If you can get the data from Jira, which I know nothing about, and you can get access to a computer running Windows, you could use the Merge to Individual Documents facility on my
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Merge Tools Add-in that is contained in the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file that you can download from the following page of my One Drive:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>Extract the files from the archive and read the:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>“READ ME –
</span></span><span><span>Setting up and using the Merge Tools Add-in</span></span><span><span>.docx
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Failing that, this is a macro that can be used to split each document created by a mail merge into individual documents.&nbsp; However, once again, this was created for use with Word running under Windows</span></p>

<h2>            windows driver updates</h2>
                    <p>OK I have a slight problem with driver updates for my sound card. I realize that you can disable auto updates for devices from windows update but what if the driver has been specifically written by Microsoft for the device on Windows 10? Will Microsoft correct
 windows 10 so the default manufacturer's driver will work and if not how do I check to see if Microsoft has updated their custom driver. &nbsp;The device in question is my IDT sound card which only works with a driver supplied by Microsoft. Windows Update seems
 to think that the device should be updated to the latest IDT driver every time I change it back to the Microsoft driver.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will try my best to address your concern. I would appreciate if you could provide the build number of Windows 10 Insider Preview which you are using and the make and model of your computer. I would like to inform you that Windows
 10 is still in developmental stage, therefore you may face issues with compatibility of certain devices. You may wait till Windows 10 full version comes and the manufacturer might release the drivers for that.</p>
<p>As of now, if you are facing issues then you may try uninstalling and re-installing the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps. Try the below mentioned steps and check if it helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>manufacturer’s website </strong>and download the <strong>Driver setup file
</strong>for your computer.</li><li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>on your desktop screen to go to run box.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Wireless Driver</strong>, expand, then right click and select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>If you are prompted to Confirm or see any option that says <strong>remove the driver completely</strong>, select that option and
<strong>Confirm</strong>.</li><li>Go to the location where you had saved your downloaded setup files of the drivers and
<strong>right click</strong>, then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong>.</li><li><span>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.</span></li><li><span>Let the driver to install and then check the functionality.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status of the issue and we’ll be glad to help you further.</p>

<h2>            Loop Macro To End of Document</h2>
                    <p>I'm a real newbie to macros, so I am stumped&nbsp;but I'm sure there is&nbsp;a good&nbsp;answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have multiple pages of paragraphs formatted "Type of Report, Name of author, date of report, paragraph of information (ie, Title of Report&nbsp;Summarized, John Jones, Ph.D., 12/24/12.&nbsp; Paragraph highlighting pertinent info blah blah blah...).&nbsp; Then a new paragraph
 is written in the same manner.&nbsp; I can have more than 20 pages done in this manner. &nbsp;I'm trying to list the name of the author and date at the top of the document, before all the data.&nbsp; Therefore, I need to erase the&nbsp;report type of&nbsp;each paragraph and then the
 summary.&nbsp; What I've done so far is copy the entire document&nbsp;into&nbsp;a new document.&nbsp; I then erase the title of the&nbsp;document. I&nbsp;then made a macro that finds the date and erases to the end of the paragraph, but can't figure out how to make the macro run on each
 paragraph to the end of the document so I have the list I need.&nbsp; I'm sure there is a better way to do this. &nbsp;Can anyone please help?&nbsp; Even if I just manually make the new document, erase the title and have the macro find the date and erase to&nbsp;the end of each
 paragraph, that would be an amazing help.&nbsp; Then I can just copy that to the top of my original document.&nbsp; Thanks so much in advance!</p>

            It's probably easiest to help you if you show use the macro(s) that you have written so far, that way we can more appropriately advise on what technique to use.
<div><br />
<div>For example, moving the end of a selection point can be accomplished in a number of ways... here are two:</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Selection.MoveEnd Word.WdUnits.wdParagraph, Count:=1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selection.MoveEnd Word.WdUnits.wdStory</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first would extend the selection to the end of the current paragraph. Its a VBA equivalent of holding down the shift key and clicking at the end of the paragraph. The second extends the selection all the way to the end of the document.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for looping thru paragraphs there are a number of ways and the "right" way really depends on what you are trying to do. Here again are just two techniques:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim para As Word.Paragraph</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim rng As Word.Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dim x As Integer</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For Each para In ActiveDocument.Paragraphs</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set rng = para.Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'do something</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; x = 1</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; For x = 1 To ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.Count</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Set rng = ActiveDocument.Paragraphs(x).Range</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'do something</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Next</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if you show us what you've got so far we can probably help.</div>

</p><p>Changing the status on Skype for Windows 10 is slightly different from the classic Skype for Windows desktop client. The available statuses on Skype for Windows 10 are:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Online </strong>which shows when you sign in to Skype. </li><li><strong>Do not show my presence </strong>status which is similar to Invisible. You'll appear offline to all your contacts but you can still use Skype as normal.</li><li><strong>Do not disturb </strong>which you can enable when you want to let your contacts that you are online but do not want to be disturbed. Your contacts will still be able to send IMs and call you but you will not hear sound alerts.
</li><li><strong>Offline </strong>which will show when you sign out. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To change your presence status on Skype for Windows 10: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click your<strong> profile picture</strong>. </li><li>Below your profile photo, you'll see the options <strong>Do not share my presence status
</strong>and <strong>Do not disturb</strong>. </li><li>Toggle the button of either of the status to change your presence. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You will not see an indication that your status has&nbsp;changed, however it will reflect on your contact's side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query. Let us know if you need additional information. </p>
<p>

            <p>There's nothing for that level of precision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office apps are not Graphics programs., they're simply provided with some fundamental drawing tools as a convenience. If you need to employ capabilities beyond their scope it would be best to use a graphics design program, then Insert your graphic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What may help is to right-click a Shape (such as an Arc) to select <strong>Edit Points</strong> from the shortcut menu. You can then use the vector handles &amp; points to manually adjust the shape, but there is no means of inputting values for anything other
 than Height, Width, [Scaling], &amp; Rotation.</p>

            I think you could do this programmaitcally. You'd need a starting point and the distance from that point, or you could start with a line and determine its length. You'd have to decide whether to start your x-axis horizontal or determine the starting line's
 angle from the slide horizontal. Once you know the starting point of the arc you wish to generate, you can compute the end point and then connect the two points with a curved line. The amount of curvature can be computed based on the distance from the starting
 point as a radius of a circle.

<p>Can someone at Nokia please tell us N900 users why we can no longer access the Ovi Store from our handsets? The site keeps telling us that our phones are not supported :smileymad:</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. No idea why I cannot access it any more. I have the latest updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I login to my account from my PC it shows the 4 apps that I previously installed and that I have an N900 AND I can go through the apps and stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my n900 I just get this at the store:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're sorry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ovi store is currently not available for your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check back as new Nokia devices are being added frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if I go to my ovi site account settings with n900 I get much less options (than PC) and no indication that I have an n900.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustrating! :smileymad:&nbsp; please help. Something happen to the browser?? I've cleared cache/data in the browser...doesn't help.</p>

<p>Hello psylocke and turok101,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I have been given a solution for you two.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove the Ovi Store application by using the app manager.&nbsp; After&nbsp;that,&nbsp;please&nbsp;enter the following link into your mobile web browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://store.ovi.mobi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.ovi.mobi</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try downloading this version of Ovi Store onto your N900 and use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            process called system send data to ip pptp server</h2>
                    <div>Sorry for my bad English</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I connected to VPN a few days ago PPTP connection in Windows 7</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Then I realized when my system connected to vpn pptp ,&nbsp; A process called "system" send data to server PPTP Without my permission And without i running a software ! just i connect pptp and process "system" send data !</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>For example, the first moment I connect to pptp connection Uploaded 100 MB of data and received 20 MB Or yesterday received 15 megabytes and sent 100 megabytes to the ip PPTP server that I was connected to I realized NETLIMITER software&nbsp; SYSTEM process Send
 and receive information to the same ip server i connected</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The final destination was to send files to the pptp ip server</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>This has happened many times</strong><br />
<strong>This happened to any pptp server that I connected</strong><br />
<strong>Several providers of VPNs</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Sometimes it sends information to LAN or sometimes on the INTERNET This process is by the system itself This means the SYSTEM user runs</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I closed the Windows Update, no software upgraded What do you think of the problem? Hacked Or a man-in-the-middle attack? Or stealing information? Sniffing attack ? Or hacker use my ip address To hack another place?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>please help</div>

<p>If this happens when you connected to VPN, then it might be behavior of VPN as it creates Virtual LAN to establish your connection and it needs to send and receive some files to find the best server and so on. But you may submit all suspicious files to VirusTotal
 and see what is the result:</p>

<div><strong>Well, the problem is, I do not know exactly what the file was sent or what file they received</strong></div>

<div>When I connect to the pptp server,&nbsp; find a new ip, of course, the range of ip's it's limited.</div>

<h2>            Updater removes preinstalled programs&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm pretty much upset now.... My 6233 had Translator, Converter, World Clock and a Sudoku Game preinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wasn't able to copy them to the Memory Card because of some stupid protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I did a backup as advised before doing an update, updated from 5.43 to 5.60, did replay the backup, and the named applications are all gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please anyone give advice how to get them back, I really liked the Translator...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Update p2p updates not working</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying my hardest to get build 10162 to populate from my desktop to my laptop when set to only receive updates from local sources. No matter what I do, I can't seem to get this to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried creating a homegroup (something I've never done before) - yet everything still seems to hammer the internet connection to download. And when I say hammer, I mean fully saturate! I hope this gets fixed before release - as any update coming to
 me via Windows Update seems to act very hostile - to the point where I can't even browse the web. VoIP phones time out, network monitoring alerts go off. All kinds of nasty stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing else has managed to screw my network *that* much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone gotten this working before? If so, what steps to follow? I can't seem to find anything about it.<br />

<h2>            Another build, another missing Media Feature Pack</h2>
                    <p>So, here we are. Got build 16232.rs_prerelease.170624-1334 on my Windows 10 Pro N machine, and there's no sign of Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got on the Slow ring so that things like the MFP would be there or thereabouts at time of update. Is it that difficult to allow the insider builds to use an older MFP?</p>

<p>Windows Media Player is present on my system running 16141 (and I presume other systems running the fast release previews). I do not know why it is not on your slow release preview.</p>
<p>

<p>Yeah, and that's the rub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>N editions of Windows don't come with WMP by default, so even though there is a version of WMP that will work with this version (proved by it working for you), there's no package

like this one</a> to download when a new build of the N edition is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We usually have to wait for a while for the MFP to be released, and it's a pain.</p>

<p>Sorry you have to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, at least I can assure you that WMP has not been deprecated to be replaced by Groove and Films &amp; TV. I stopped using WMP when the Win 7 version became less useful to manage and let me organise my music library. Personally I use MusicBee. Perhaps
 you could use an alternate media player so you don't have to wait?</p>

    <title>Tabbing through my form template not working correctly - skipping from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> connie_852  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tabbing through my form template not working correctly - skipping from page 1 to page 4.</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm new at creating forms. I created a 4 page fillable form and locked it for users to complete and send back to me. When a user opens
 the form, they can tab through the first page fine, but when you hit tab to go to the next field on the next page it skips to the last page - skipping the first 2 fields on that page and going to the date picker. If you scroll up and place your cursor in the
 first field of the 2nd page it will <strong><em>then </em></strong>let you tab through the rest of the document fine.
</span><span><span>I’m using Legacy form fields. It wasn't doing&nbsp;this in&nbsp;the original form I created.&nbsp;After creating the form and giving it to my boss for review,
 he advised a few changes. It was after that when it started doing this. Things I added: 1. He wanted the Name field to automatically populate on pages 2-4 after the user fills in their name on page 1. I put a styleref in the header but had to insert a continuous
 page break so it would not appear on page 1. I thought that is what caused it but when I deleted the break it continues to skip. 2. He didn't want the tables or headings to be orphaned so I added "keep with next" to some of the paragraphs. 3. He wanted some
 of the instructions to be typed over in the field boxes as they are completing the form. I don't think the last 2 changes have anything to do with the skipping problem but those are the only changes I made to the document when it started to skip pages.
</span></span><span>Any help you could provide is greatly appreciated!
</span><span><span>Thanks!!!</span></span></p>

            <p>Instead of inserting a Continuous section break, enable "Different first page" and leave the First Page Header empty, putting your StyleRef field only in the Header, which will appear on pages 2ff.</p>
<p>Tab order for form fields is usually quite linear (with the understanding that fields in tables will go left to right before going down) unless the form fields are in text boxes or frames, in which case they will be accessed in the order of the paragraphs
 to which the text boxes or frames are anchored, but this should affect layout on a single page only; a field on page 4 could not be anchored to a paragraph that precedes fields on page 2.</p>
<p>One clue, however, might be that a date picker field is not a legacy form field.</p>
