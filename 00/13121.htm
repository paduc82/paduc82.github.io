<h2>            New Outlook for Mac &#40;Office 365&#41; issues with SOCKS proxy</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with new Outlook for Mac repeatedly popping up a box asking for name/password for my corporate SOCKS proxy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SOCKS proxy does not require authentication. The popup does not allow me to click "OK" if I leave the fields empty. Entering any value (such as my username/password, for exemple) results in the popup being immediately redisplayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click cancel (or press ESC) then sometimes I'm fine for 10 to 15 minutes but often the popup immediately redisplays. I sometimes have to dismiss it 4 or 5 times in a row before it goes away (again for 10-15 minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, Outlook seems to have no need of my SOCKS proxy. Once I manage to dismiss the popup then it connects perfectly to my Exchange server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable SOCKS proxy in OSX Network config then it also works perfectly but the thing is that the SOCKS proxy is needed for other apps and must be running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug in the product? Any workaround ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

            Is this an exchange account, as far as I know this behavior is by design. Outlook will always pop up for&nbsp;a box asking for name/password for&nbsp;your corporate SOCKS proxy.

            Hello. Thanks for responding but I don't think it can be "work as designed" to show a popup requesting credentials every few seconds (for credentials that are not even needed as the app is able to connect to Exchange server without them). This makes the
 product almost unusable!

    <title>Leading zeros not saved in text file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ecocrop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Leading zeros not saved in text file</h2>
                    I have a column of "text" numbers preceded by zero, each has the 3 digit code eg 010, 003, 014 etc. I need to save the sheet as a text file for using elsewhere and have been saving as a text(tab delimited) file. However even after various permutaions on
 formatting the columns before saving I always lose the preceeding zero in the text file saved. I do not want to go into the text file and change these as it is defeating a lot of the purpose of the whole exercise. Is there anything I can do in the excel spreadsheet
 to the column so that when it is saved as a text file the full 3 digit code will come through wit the leading zero? I would really value any help.

            Thanks for reply but I am afraid that actually does not solve the problem. Say in sheet 1 I have in cell A1 with the value '010 with a leading apostrophe. Then in Sheet 2 I enter the formula =Sheet1!A1 then save Sheet 2 as a text file then the 010 will
 appear as 10 not 010. This is the problem

<p>Your text file is ok.</p>
<p>Look at it using NotePad or any other text editor.</p>
<p>But if you import the text file back into excel (and keep the field General (or<br />
non-Text)), then you won't see the leading 0's.</p>

            Thanks for all the help. I can get round it by opening the text file with the wizard and making sure the column is formatted as text. It is a pity it cannot just be saved as the properly formatted text as it it used with a pen file to upload bulk data
 to another program and it does not recognise the leading zero unless I carry out this process. Thanks to all for their input.

<h2>            BL-5B battery problem-expanded</h2>
                    I have noticed that my 3230 battery BL-5B has expanded, its surface is not flat,instead it has became OVAL in shape from last one month.<br />
DOES ANYBODY noticed such issue with BL-5B battery.<br />
its battery life is also reduced drastically,although my usage is very less then also I have to recharge it everyday. previously when phone was new, it used to remained powered for at least 2 days(although that was also not good enough as compared with other
 phones).

            I would replace that battery immediately and stop using it if possible.<br />
<br />
If it's less than 6 months old (still under warranty)take it to a nokia care point with proof of purchase and they will replace it.<br />
<br />
If it's older than 6 months you may have to pay. But they may make an exception because of whats happened to it.

            I visited nokia Care, but those people have no reason why battery have expanded. just for avoiding they tell, u might have overcharged it. but that is not d case because i dont charge it for more then 2 hours. Anyways nokia phones provide facility that
 charging will stop automatically once battery is fully charged, so if they claim d reason is overcharging, that means either their circuit doesn't works correctly or their Battery is FAULTY.<br />
<br />
Might be d same case what happened with BL 5C. Probably Nokia is waiting for some more cases to happen/might have happened but not Reported, before they take some action on it.<br />
<br />
Other thing I don't understand, Why these people keeps battery price and charger PRICE SO HIGH. This is almost equal to their lowest segment phone model price(along with phone, battery and charger comes, does it mean they are charging for battery and charger
 only and phone equipment is free) this is really disgusting. Mobile companies must reduce battery prices. They are making too much margins out of it.

            Please note that this is not the same issue as the product advisory on the BL-5C.
<br />
<br />
I suggest that you contact Nokia in your own country with regard to your BL-5B, as this seems to be highly unusual behaviour. Please also advise them which Nokia care point told you that you must have mistreated the battery.

            I have a similar battery problem that I have only noticed today on my BL-5B battery in my sim-free N80-1 RM-92 that came direct from Nokia.<br />
<br />
It is swollen and distorted (towards oval too)in shape - so much so that it will not close in its case properly !<br />
<br />
I was curious whether anyone else with a N80 had seen this problem?<br />
<br />
I'm going to try to get to a nokia support store but getting the time to do that is tought at the mo :-(

            To update:<br />
<br />
Went to the authorised Cork based Nokia Care Poin<br />
<br />
<br />
They checked the battery and yes as I knew - its working fine its just "grown" in size.<br />
<br />
They were so sure and narky that I must have gotten it wet, or dropped it (the phone/battery)- neither of which scenarios have ever happened :-)<br />
<br />
They reiterated this 3 times, said its over 6 months old and so out of warranty.<br />
<br />
The phone will not close properly, I'm converneed the battery will eventually split or burst but they would not and could not do anything for me :-)<br />
<br />
So tough you'll have to spend 49 euro on a new battery.<br />
<br />
(when they cost 49 pence - 3.49 pounds in the UK)<br />
<br />
what is going on here !<br />
<br />
customer service my foot!<br />

            It may be worth trying another care point.<br />

Batteries are only covered for 6 months by most phone manufacturers warranties.

Has this been resolved for you? have you tried any other Nokia Care Points?

            OK, I had this problem with my Nokia N80, too.<br />
<br />
I will return it to nearest Nokia Care Point, even if my phone is 22 months old, and that is because I think this has been a defect for a very long time. The short battery time came almost immediately, and I didn't realize that it could be as long as it is
 with my new battery, because of all reviews complaining about short battery time... ;)<br />

            I've also got this problem with my N80. The battery is almost too big to shut the battery cover now. Also the battery life is terrible. It's always been poor, but if I don't charge it up every night it dies before I get home on the second day.<br />
<br />
It's out of warranty but I'm going to take it to Nokia repair centre to see what they say anyway.<br />
<br />
I've been there at least 5 times in warranty with this phone!<br />

<p>This is now the second time that I have attempted to look at a Word document that was working fine/easily readable before, but now the letters in the words are displaying as overlapping and illegible (examples above). I have tried using the Font dialog box,
 but it says that character spacing is normal. In the preview in the font dialog box, it still has the words written out correctly, so I know that they're there, but I'd like to be able to read my document normally. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Try copying everything except for the final paragraph mark ¶ in the document and paste it into a new blank document and see if that overcomes the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Penygent,</p>
<br />
<p>To share files in OneDrive for Business with external users. In this thread, external users mean those users who use consumer OneDrive. To enable sharing, see the article below:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-external-sharing-on-or-off-for-SharePoint-Online-6288296a-b6b7-4ea4-b4ed-c297bf833e30#ID0EAABAAA=Tenant_(global)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn external sharing on or off for SharePoint Online
</a>(1. turn on external sharing for tenant level. 2. Turn on external sharing for https://domain-mysharepoint.com)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the sharing method, you may refer to this article: </span>
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Share-sites-or-documents-with-people-outside-your-organization-80e49744-e30f-44db-8d51-16661b1d4232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Share sites or documents with people outside your organization</span></a><span>.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your configuration is correct, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Capture a screenshot for the "fail" error message.</p>
<p>2. Is the issue related to specific external users? I mean, if one file cannot be shared with that external user, all other items cannot be share with him. In this situation, please share with us some example of these accounts. For privacy protection, you
 may reply to my private message with accounts information.</p>
<p>3. Capture a screenshot of your OneDrive for Business library. I want to know if it's in new UI or classic UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Try this; </p>
<p>Restart pc after installing WDRT, then restart WDRT. After download etc for phone has completed and when it says device not detected, pull out and re-plug USB from PC. For me, WDRT then started to reboot/re-flash my 950. What I then saw was a Red screen
 shown on 950 with a square arrowed timer icon then the usual blue windows icon, then the usual restart and restore progressed normally. SUCCESS, Than God! and my perseverance and of course the Microsoft community :)</p>

<h2>            Excel always freezes and does not respond on first execution</h2>
                    I have an issue where every time I turn on my PC and first load up excel it freezes and does not respond. I have to force close it. I am then able to open and use excel just fine, until the next time I reboot my PC and again the first time I open excel
 it freezes and doesn't respond. Any idea what might be causing this? It is becoming quite annoying to have to do this every time I boot my PC.

<p>Hi Dundalis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the issue, please follow these steps and let me know the result:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17154/windows-10-keep-your-pc-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make sure your system is update to date</a>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2939112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Scan Excel for Known Issues</a>.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>3. Investigate possible issues with COM add-ins:<br />
To disable COM add-ins, follow these steps:<br />
Select&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Options</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Add-ins</strong>.<br />
At the bottom of the dialog box, change the&nbsp;<strong>Manage</strong>&nbsp;dropdown to&nbsp;<strong>COM add-ins</strong>, and select Go.<br />
Clear the checkbox for any enabled COM add-ins. select OK.<br />
If disabling the COM add-ins alleviates the issue, try enabling them one at a time to test for the problem add-in.<br />
<br />
4. Investigate Excel file details and contents.<br />
The following areas can cause performance or crashing issues:<br />
Formulas referencing entire columns.<br />
Array formulas referencing an uneven number of elements in the arguments.<br />
Hundreds, or perhaps thousands of hidden or 0 height and width object<br />
Excessive styles caused by frequent copying and pasting between books<br />
Excessive and invalid defined names<br />
<br />
5. Check whether your antivirus software is up to date or is conflicting with Excel&nbsp;<br />
If your antivirus software includes integration with Excel, you may experience performance issues. In this case, you can disable all Excel integration within the antivirus software by creating exceptions for Excel files.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi, I downloaded the offcat tool and its scan says an add in has been disabled because of stability or performance issues. This was a simple macro to fix cell height and width. This has been disabled though so I don't see why this would cause this problem.
 I only purchased Office 2016 a few weeks ago and have only used excel a handful of times, so have not done anything much with the program other than that simple macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have any Com add ins flagged, and I do not have any anti virus software, only malwarebytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have this issue when first accessing excel upon booting up my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Dundalis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this situation, please try to start Excel in safe mode as safe mode lets you safely use Excel without encountering certain startup programs. You can open Excel in safe mode by pressing and holding Ctrl while you start the program or by using the "/safe"
 (that is,&nbsp;<strong>excel /safe</strong>) option when you start the program from the command line. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist in the safe mode, please perform a clean boot to troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem. For your reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists in safe mode, could you provide the detailed version of your Excel for us to further troubleshoot the issue? You can click FILE &gt; Account &gt; Product Information to get the detailed version of your Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening in safe mode worked, so I did the clean boot, enabling half the services and the issue did not occur. Tried to narrow down the services causing the issue but eventually enabled everything and the issue didn't reoccur at all. So not sure what was
 causing it but so far seems to be ok.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Alain,</p>
<p>We are able to deploy and work with both local and Online applications in the virtual machines. However, to achieve that, we may need to meet the specific requirement.
<br />
<br />
1. Network environment. We need to have the ability to access Office 365 portal page to work with Office Online or download Office applications. Reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges</a><br />
2. System requirements. For details, you can see this article: <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-system-requirements?CorrelationId=e63c5c5d-2d08-4564-8629-96f146cbb584&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System requirements for Office</a><br />
3. Exactly real hardware partition or blade to install Office application. To install Office on a computer, a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with a storage device capable is required to run this software.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

<p>Dear Kerwin,</p>
<p>So this means i can buy 35 business premium licenses and run them on the remote desktops of my workers?</p>
<p>Because i also read alot about Shared Desktop Activation being only available in Pro Plus and E3. Thing is, i'm not sharing desktops. everybody has his own remote desktop which isn't by any means 'shared'
</p>
<p>Tahnks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Alain,</p>
<p>To answer your questions, may I first confirm if the terminal server you are using is configured as a Shared Computer for multiple users via Remote Desktop Services (RDS)? If so, as you have mentioned, to install Office in this shared computer, we need to
 own the Office 365 subscriptions which contains Office 365 ProPlus such as Office 365 ProPlus and E3 plans. Also Office Deployment Tool to download and install Office is required. After configured, all the users can access this shared computer and user their
 Office 365 accounts to work online and local. Below is the two related articles for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Overview of shared computer activation for Office 365 ProPlus</a><br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn782858.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deploy Office 365 ProPlus by using Remote Desktop Services</a></p>
<p>If the terminal server is divided into individual computers for different users, we can just assign users Office 365 Business Premium licenses to let them work online and local in their own individual machines.</p>
<p>If anything is misunderstood or unclear, please post back and let us further help you.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

</p><p>I am having this same problem, and have been for many, many updates. I have installed the 17115.1 build from the ISO file and it all went well, but the newest updates, 17120 and 17123 do not update, and I am getting a new error. "cannot connect to the update

<p>Hi SibeMan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's usually an Internet connection issue, for public builds at least. Since you were running a preview build, it might be anything else. Let's sort it out. Run the following automated troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run the Network troubleshooter. Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security
</strong>&gt; <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Internet Connections</strong>.</li><li>Run the Windows Update troubleshooter. Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>Reset Network. Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet </strong>
&gt; <strong>Status </strong>&gt; <strong>Network reset</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, opt out of the Windows Insider Program by unlinking your Windows Insider Account and install the public build. (Version 1709) Then, after a while, link your Windows Insider Account and make sure to select the correct channel. I believe
 you were in Fast Ring but not Skip Ahead. The latest build for that should be Build 17127.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Problem with Settings and Windows Security apps.</h2>
                    <p>OK, this is a real puzzle.</p>
<p>Since installing the very latest Insider Preview, I've had a strange problem occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn on the PC and it's finished booting up, when I try to open Settings, all I get is the Cog appear, and then after 20-30 seconds it just closes back down on its own.</p>
<p>ALSO when this happens, if I try and open Windows Security, all I see is this :</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>IF I reboot the system, either just using Reset, or Shut Down, sometimes they are both back to normal, other times the Settings are back to normal but the Windows Security is still the same. (Another Reboot usually fixes this, but not for long)</p>
<p>Full Virus scans (WHEN I have windows security working normally) and full scans using up-to-date Malawarebytes report nothing is found.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this problem? Is there any solution available, or is it another bug in the Insider Previews creeping in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 version is version 1803 (Build 18219.1000) 64bit</p>

<p>If you read back through the many posts in this forum you will see that a lot of us have had very similar problems with Settings and Security in the latest builds. Other than waiting for the next build or using UUPtoISO for a new clean download I don't know
 of a solution. You can run SFC &amp; DISM to see if you have any corruption. However when I ran them nothing was found but Settings &amp; Security would not work.

<p>Edit. Did you attempt to place an image? Did you use the Insert Image Icon above?</p>

<h2>            How can I check my storage on my Onedrive for business account&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Onedrive for business account with my school email so I am wondering if it's possible to check how much storage is left. I've tried signing into Onedrive, Microsoft and opening Onedrive from my computer desktop.&nbsp;

<h2>            Unable to sign in to Windows with my Microsoft account</h2>
                    I enter my username and password, then verify myself using the authenticator app.
<br />
Finally when I try to switch my local account with the Microsoft one, it says "The password you signed in with is different from your password for your Microsoft account. Sign in again using your current password or reset it."

<p>Tried it.<br />
It poses a different problem. I could make another account but couldn't login. It says "You have to be online the first time you sign in", even though I'm online.&nbsp;</p>

            have the same issue.&nbsp; Sitting behind a corporate proxy running on a hyper-v vm on one of our hyper-v servers so I can't just attach to our wireless network or plug in to a network port that doesn't route through the proxy.&nbsp; I can't switch to an MS account
 or login with a newly created account because of the above two issues.&nbsp; MS need to sort this really as a lot of technical preview testers (especially corporate IT ones) will have this issue as they're probably behind a proxy.

            <p>I had the similar scenario (hyper-v-vm on 2012r2 based hyper-v-host behind proxy server (with authentication) and I was able to solve it by:</p>
<p>1. Enable NAT on my Hyper-V-Host Server and connect the server to the corporate network</p>
<p>1. Configure proxy ip and port on IE on the Win10 virtual machine</p>
<p>2. authenticate to proxy by opening a website (on win10 virtual machine)</p>
<p>3. open elevated command prompt and go to "netsh winhttp"</p>
<p>4. import IE-proxy settings by: "import proxy source=ie"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, for me the switch from local account to my live-id worked, maybe it is also helping others...

<h2>            Sharepoint Word Quick Parts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a template in Word 2016, a .dotx file. A document was created using this template, and I uploaded the document onto sharepoint. "Edit in Word" is used to edit the document, I can insert my quick parts. If another team member edits the document,
 the quick parts aren't present, even though the same template is referenced in Word's "Save" settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't other team members use the quick parts of the document I uploaded, but I can?</p>

<p>Hi Member,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to this support community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, I create a Word document and update it into my SharePoint site. I edit it via "Open in Word" and I can use my&nbsp;newly created Quick Parts. After that, my member can't find the Quit Parts I created on their site. And I can also use the new
 created Quick Parts in other newly created files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to deliver the explanation that the Quick Parts I create were saved to my local Word app instead of the file I edit. If you want your&nbsp;team members also using the same Quick Parts, I'd like to suggest you share your Quick Parts to your members to
 let them add it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Neo&nbsp;</p>

 on his email autocomplete list, the autocomplete box shows up and changes the name he typed to that persons full email address. &nbsp;I have never seen the autocomplete box show up not in one of the address fields at the top of the message. &nbsp;anyone have any idea
 why this feature is suddenly showing up in the BODY of his mails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

<p>Ricky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for a bug that matches the issue you are seeing and there are a couple that look the same fixed in different builds&nbsp;but I cannot be sure which matches the issue.&nbsp; Its not possible without an Engineer&nbsp;debugging the issue to know for sure what build
 it is fixed in.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The next Deferred Channel update with major updates&nbsp;will be shipping in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; If you want to check if the fix could be in that build you could put a user that is seeing the issue on First Release For Deferred Channel currently build 7766.2084.&nbsp;
 The upcoming DC update will be from the builds on this channel.&nbsp; Or you could wait a couple weeks and test when it comes out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still in that build and it becomes highly impacting then I think the best option would be to open a support case and use that for us&nbsp;to figure out the bug and if fixed in Current Channel for example request backporting to DC.</p>

            Most old phones should get the 7.8 update, yes. The official release has not been set for any region. We only know it will be
<em>after</em> Windows Phone 8 has been released.

            It depends how the files were encoded. The 5130 will play normal MP4-video files but it won't play MPEG-4(H264) or MPEG-4(VSP) files.

<p>hi redadmin9583,</p>
<p>to troubleshoot the issue more efficiently, would you firstly clarify the following information?<br />
1. i notice that “<em>using "get-sposite" none of those deleted sites were listed</em>”, please note site collections in the recycle bin will not be retrieved by using the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161380.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">get-sposite</a> cmdlet. to return the deleted site collections from the recycle bin, we need to use the
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">get-spodeletedsite</a>. have you checked with this command to see whether the sites were listed?<br />
2. have you tried to create the sites via the sharepoint online admin center? if the sites haven’t been removed from the recycle bin, we will get the error below when we create the sites which with the same name. after we click the option “<strong>permanently
 delete the site collection from the recycle bin and continue</strong>.”, it will delete the sites in the backend and then re-create the sites.</p>

<p>if you have tried the methods above and you still cannot create the site, we need your account information and the full url of the problematic sites to fix these from the backend. to protect your privacy, i have sent you a private message to collect them.
