    <title>Font characters not supported in Word 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Font characters not supported in Word 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a font I designed which has worked well in Word 2007, and Word 2010.&nbsp; In addition to the characters that use the regular keys, I have several additional characters on the font that use the ALT + a number.&nbsp; For example, ALT + 0224 and ALT + 0227</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in Word 2016, some of these ALT characters do not show up.&nbsp; They do, however, show up if used in Excel 2016.</p>
<p>Most of the other ALT characters show up fine in Word 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting I need to adjust in Word 2016 so it will see the characters that Word 2010 had no trouble seeing?</p>
<p>Or are certain font characters not compatible with Word 2016 that are work fine in Excel 2016?</p>
<p>Are there font requirements for Word 2016 that are such that I need to adjust the characters on the font so they work in Word 2016?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of all of the ALT spaces that worked fine in earlier Word versions, but show up as blank in Word 2016:</p>

<p>Hello Zane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Special characters that are present on the character map are helpful especially when shortcut keys have been assigned to them to make your work efficient. Originally on Word, characters used from the
<strong>Character Map</strong> would be dependent on the font that's being used on Word as the character might not be compatible or might not be available for that certain font. That being said, for us to determine what troubleshooting shall we apply, we would
 like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from performing a shortcut re-assignment, is the issue the same when using the
<strong>Character Map</strong>?</li><li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other fonts on Word?</li><li>Is this happening on an existing Word file or also on new Word documents when using the shortcuts?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you have the characters tested from <strong>Notepad
</strong>to <strong>Word </strong>using a different user profile. Creating a new user profile will help us identify if the issue is with the user profile or not. Also, we will be able to isolate if the issue is only happening in Word and not on your Windows.
 Here's the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> where you can find the instructions on how to create a new user
 profile. Kindly name it as <strong>Test</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reply to us with the information so that we can assist you better.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from performing a shortcut re-assignment, is the issue the same when using the&nbsp;<span>Character Map</span>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>All of the characters show in the character map, including those that will not show in Word.&nbsp; When I click on one of these characters in the character map, select it, and copy it, then try to paste it into Word, it does not work.&nbsp; But that same character
 on the clipboard pastes into Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same issue with other fonts on Word?</li></ul>
<p>Not to my knowledge.&nbsp; I have not seen this with any other font, at least yet.&nbsp; But then I have not tried every Alt character on every font I have on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this happening on an existing Word file or also on new Word documents when using the shortcuts?</li></ul>
<p>Both existing Word file, and also any new Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you have the characters tested from&nbsp;<span>Notepad&nbsp;</span>to&nbsp;<span>Word&nbsp;</span>using a different user profile. Creating a new user profile will help us identify if the issue is with the user profile

 you can find the instructions on how to create a new user profile. Kindly name it as&nbsp;<span>Test</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to set the default font in Notepad to this font, and have no trouble with the characters.&nbsp; They show up fine in Notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed this font on another family member's laptop who also has Word 2016 and Windows 10, and the same thing occurs.&nbsp; Thus it is not specific to my profile, or even my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not created a new profile on my computer, since I verified the problem exists on another computer as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What next?</p>

<p>Can you see these characters in Word's <strong>Symbol</strong> dialog? If so, you can use the Unicode glyph number shown there to insert the character by typing the number and immediately pressing
<strong>Alt+X</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As just one example, <strong>Alt+0174</strong> inserts the ® symbol. There is actually a built-in keyboard shortcut for this:
<strong>Alt+Ctrl+R</strong>. But you can also type 00ae (the Unicode number) and press
<strong>Alt+X</strong> to get the character.</p>

<p>I mentioned that I have been holding the ALT key down and typing the numbers, such as ALT + 0224 and ALT + 0227, and the characters do not show in the Word 2016 document. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely see the symbols in Word's Symbol dialog box.&nbsp; But when I click on it from there, and then click insert, it only puts a blank space in the Word 2016 document.&nbsp; (It works fine in a Word 2010 document with the Symbol dialog box).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I am misunderstanding you, but if I type the numbers first before pressing the ALT key, such as 0224, it types the characters represented by the 2 key and the 4 key.&nbsp; Typing ALT and then X after that just duplicates the characters typed with
 the 2 and 4 key.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>When you hold the Alt key and type on the number pad, you use <em>decimal </em>
numbers such as 0224. When you use the Alt+X, you must use the <em>hexadecimal </em>
equivalent value; for example, decimal 0224 is equal to hexadecimal 00e0. At the bottom of the Insert &gt; Symbol dialog, both of these values are shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/506c1b12-7460-478e-b5b8-67ee1daece07?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/506c1b12-7460-478e-b5b8-67ee1daece07?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So try typing the hex number 00e0 in the document and then (with the cursor to the right of the last character) pressing Alt+X. In most of the standard fonts, that will convert the number to the character à, and in your font it should produce the custom
 character you expect.</p>

<p>I type in the hexidecimal using the regular keys?</p>
<p>One character has hexidecimial 0xDD.</p>
<p>I type in 0xDD </p>
<p>This of course showed up as those characters on the font.</p>
<p>Then I did Alt+X.</p>
<p>It added additional characters but did not convert to the character desired.</p>
<p>I changed the result from my font to Courier, and it turned 0xDD into 0xDF044</p>

<p>Yes, you type the hex number using the regular keys, and they are not case-sensitive, so you can type DD as dd, but the "x" suggests that this is not a standard Unicode character. If I try 0xdd, I get
<span>0Ý.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking, to use <strong>Alt+X</strong>, you must have a space before the hex code (you can delete it later). If the character doesn't exist in the current font, a different font (such as MS Mincho or Cambria Math) will be substituted.</p>

<p>All of this is interesting but it doesn't address the basic issue:</p>
<p>Some characters on a font I created worked fine in Word 2010, but no longer show up in Word 2016.&nbsp; These same characters show up fine in the Windows charmap, and they show up fine in Excel 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, something has changed in Word 2016 so that it no longer finds these characters compatible, as compared with Word 2010.&nbsp; But it is not the whole Office suite, since Excel 2016 has no issue with the font characters.&nbsp; I just checked and the characters
 also show up fine in Powerpoint 2016 and in One Note2016.&nbsp; So the issue is ONLY with Word 2016.<br />

            I had missed the fact that this was a font you created. Is it possible that there's something in the coding of the font that Word is choking on? I know Word 2016 has been reported to have problems with certain commercial fonts, and they appear to be ones
 with "extended" characters.

<p>Hi Suzanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is possible, but I have no idea what it might be.&nbsp; That is why in my initial post that started this I wrote, "Are there font requirements for Word 2016 that are such that I need to adjust the characters on the font so they work in Word 2016?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a program called FontCreator to create the fonts, and never had any trouble with any of the fonts until I upgraded to Word 2016.&nbsp; There may be a setting in FontCreator I can tweak to edit the font for compatibility with this version of Word, but I
 would have no idea what needs to be adjusted.</p>

    <title>Return auto id from access database after a record is added through a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joel levy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Return auto id from access database after a record is added through a form</h2>
                    
<p>TIA:</p>
<p>I have an Access database table with autoid field.&nbsp; I have a form that submits first and last name to the table in the database.&nbsp; I'm trying to send a confirmation page that returns the submitted first and last name AND the auto id generated by Access.&nbsp;
 My approach has been generate a custom confirmation page where I have entered the confirmation fields (first and last name that comes from the submit form) and a results query reqion to query first and last name for the id&nbsp;generated when the record was added.&nbsp;
 I just can't figure out how to set up the names as variables to use in the sql for the query.&nbsp; Thanks for any help.&nbsp; Joel</p>

<p>Joel:</p>
<p>There are several ways to accomplish this.&nbsp; Below is a procedure for directly querying for the ID value.&nbsp; The normal precautions apply here for using name as the basis for a query.&nbsp; For example, what happens if you have two women named Jenny Doe in your
<p>You could also create a parameter query and then use a QueryDef object to query for the result.&nbsp; Since this is a simple example I just chose to use a dynamic SQL statement.</p>
<p>Public Function ReturnAutoID(sLastName As String, sFirstName As String) As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim sSQL As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rs As DAO.Recordset<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sSQL = "SELECT [ID] as MyID FROM MyTableName WHERE LastName='" &amp; sLastName &amp; "' AND FirstName='" &amp; sFirstName &amp; "'"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rs = CurrentDb.OpenRecordset(sSQL)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ReturnAutoID = Nz(rs("MyID"), -1)&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Return -1 if ID does not exist for some unknown reason<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
End Function</p>

<p>It would depend on how you enter the record, but generally, if you use:</p>
<p>lngPK = DMAX("[pk]","tablename")</p>
<p>where pk is the name of your autonumber field, that should return the last PK entered. Assuming you do this immediately after inserting the record in the table.</p>

<h2>            6230i Themes</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Anyone know if it is possible to download themes for the 6230i?<br />
<br />
For some reason I deleted them with the exception of Waves.nth, it has left the display on my phone blue including the backdrop when reading sms messages. I want to try change it with something that makes the message a little easier to read!<br />
<br />

I'm fairly naive when it comes to downloading to my phone! Can you give me a rough idea how I download from the site?<br />

            On the home page, hover your mouse over the "Original Files" on the main menu on the left. Click on "Themes". On the page that appears click on the "Download" link to whichever theme you want and download the file to your PC. It will probably be a Zip
 file so you will need to "Un-Zip" it. Then using Nokia PC Suite you can copy the files to the corresponding folders on your phone. You can create an actual "Theme" from the files using the S40 Theme Studio 1.2 but that's a little more complicated.

<h2>            Lost document using Office for iPad and OneDrive - completely vanished</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Office for iPad for a couple of week to create and edit a document in Word. I only ever used Office for iPad to open this particular document,it was never opened or worked on on another machine or iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One morning I opened the iPad's multi-tasking to switch to the document (which looked to be still open) and Word loaded for a second and then prompted for me to Open a document. I tried to browse to the document in Word by tapping through OneDrive but the
 document was completely gone. I logged into OneDrive in Chrome and checked the recycle bin but the document was not there either. It appears to have completely disappeared!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last day I successfully edited the document was the 29th of April. The following day (30th) was when it went missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

</p><p>The moral of the story is "never walk away from Word" &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;It's like a drunken gunslinger in the Wild West, you do not want to turn your back on it, ever, or somebody is going to get hurt!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By which I mean: you need to ensure you close your files properly before ending an editing session. &nbsp;Otherwise: one glitch on the inner-tubes and -- well you know what happens.</p>

</p><p>Because the file was not "deleted", it probably won't be in the trash. &nbsp;You can call customer service: they could get your file back, but they will want money for that.</p>

    <title>VBA help with multiple required fields in a Word form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qwarner  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA help with multiple required fields in a Word form</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi all. I created an overtime work sheet in Word 2010 that has 9 required fields interspersed among other fields. After searching the internet I found something that somewhat
 works. The problem is that the code works a little too fast and skips the non-required fields. By too fast I mean, that after “Name” is entered it immediately state's that the “Date” field is required without giving the user a chance to tab over. Below is
 the code I’ve tried as on exit macro and a pic of the form. Thanks for any help provided.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi&nbsp; Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if anyone came across this issue about one drive in windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Platform : Win 10 + One drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After install windows 10 and update all the patches, one drive does not start up for multiple users. I cannot even manual launch the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works reinstall it under different login. But I have hundreds of user. Without a doubt I cannot reinstall for every login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can locate one drive under %appdata%\local\Microsoft\one drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is one drive is available for everyone to user in windows 10 by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Much appreciated if anyone could point me to the right direction.</p>
<p>

            Hi JLA_119,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall to do a clean installation 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version 
<br />and from the Account, folders directory remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version from this link:

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, OneDrive should work for all users who use Windows 10. However, I believe they do need to have their Microsoft Account connected to their Local User Account for this to happen. Please can you make sure that they all have their Local Accounts connected
 to a Microsoft Account, then try again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, when you say "Installed", are you referring to installing the OneDrive App from a different site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

            That's why if your going to go with SSD not to get less than 1TB drive. If you have pay $1K extra it's is worth every single Penny and Not less than 16 GB System RAM. And if they were available and apple would allow it I'd get a 2TB Drive&nbsp;and 32 &nbsp;or 64
 GB RAM.<br />

 in but that hasn't made any difference. When I connect it to a laptop I can't do anything with it as it won't let me enter storage sense. Anyone know what I can do? Thanks</span>

</p><p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your issue with storage sense, are you able to have your phone detected by the laptop whenever you connect it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is your PC using the Windows 10 version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we recommend saving your photos on your OneDrive account first to save space on your SD card.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Excel 2016 column width changed after Win 10 Anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivankst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Excel 2016 column width changed after Win 10 Anniversary Update.</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my Windows 10 to the Anniversary Update on my laptop, the default column width in Excel 2016 (part of 365 Home) changed from 64 (which was the default since the beginnings) to 73. Now all of my sheets are wider and some do not fit to the
 screen (as I make sheets fit the entire screen most of the time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Striking is the fact that the same document opened on my desktop, where I did not install the update yet, has column widths 64 and the same one opened on the laptop has widths 73.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure whether some Office update did the problem, or the Windows update. Any help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Browser redirect virus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack splatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Browser redirect virus</h2>
                    
<p>I am a newcomer to seeking help from online forums but have come to my wits end in trying to remove a browser virus that is effecting both yahoo and google searches. Both search OK but then 100% of links are redirected to sites that either fail or are not
 as requested.</p>
<p>The main thread seems to be redirect thru <a href="http://plxlestatservice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://plxlestatservice.com</a> with all searches showing <a href="http://www.avitu.ru" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.avitu.ru</a> as the sponsored result.</p>
<p>I have tried, MS Security Essentuals, SUPER Antispyware, Spybot and Malwarebyte's Anti-malware. Every time I run these new threats are detected and removed but the redirect remains (and obviously loads new threats).</p>
<p>I have tried searching this and other forums but cannot find a thread that seems to match my symptoms.</p>
<p>I have also reloaded windows XP and IE7.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jack</p>

<p>Open Internet Explorer and in the search box drop down menu select "Find more search providers". Find Yahoo and install it. You will see a message stating Yahoo is already installed, do you want to replace it? Select yes then do the same with Google. This
 may resolve the problem but if not you can get help here - <br />

<p>Assuming that you are in fact dealing with updating fields, you could always lock them before converting the document to PDF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word, you can lock all the fields in the selection with Ctrl+F11. (Later, if you want to unlock the fields, use Ctrl+Shift+F11.) Some keyboards require that you press Ctrl+FN+F11.</p>

<h2>            Mail merge using outlook 365 on my server</h2>
                    <p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend of mine owns a company and 5-6 users are using the same contacts groups found in office 365 - exchange&nbsp;(cloud).</p>
<p>
</p><p>He needs to create a mail merge every now and then using this shared contact group.&nbsp; The problem is that the user might be the one or the other each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to make mail merge using his PC (MS-Word 2013)&nbsp;using outlook&nbsp;&nbsp;contacts and works just fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i move the mail merge template to another PC it doesnt work properly since it looks in e.g. C: userABC....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to make mail merge using the contacts directly from outlook 365 (cloud) or any other way to have this mail merge in the server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanking you in advance,</p>
<p />

<p>How to reset it? I have Microsoft account on my phone, but I do not see an option to change the PIN anywhere on MS site.</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/56fd4c54-6c44-4e44-be31-c0777581e060" title="AlexanderDjhvbhjyv">
AlexanderDjhvbhjyv</a> , </p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to perform a hard reset to remove the PIN that you set up. You may follow the steps below:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />and
<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10–15 seconds).</li><li>
<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until you see a large exclamation mark.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following buttons: <span><strong>volume up</strong>
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f6bd43a94-9d17-4c2d-8124-ac977d0da8b5%2fhardware-icon-volumeUP-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,
<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />,
<span><strong>volume down</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />. Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hard reset process will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings.&nbsp;After the process, you need to set up your account again. If you have backed up your files you can restore it immediately.
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Performing hard reset will remove all data on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i have two separate email accounts - one hotmail and one outlook - which I don't want to combine&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i access the hotmail account from the preinstalled icon on my iPad - so I assume that's the apple mail you're referrng to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive accessed my hotmail account from my iPad for many years however the duplication of folders has only been a problem for some months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is is there still a way to fix this?</p>
