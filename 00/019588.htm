<p>
</p><p>Since last week I am not able to connect to my exchange mailbox on LAN.I am using Win10 and when I connect to VPN its working fine.</p>
<p>It's happening with all users who are using windows&nbsp;10. We are using office LAN only. Every time a dialog box comes and ask to enter the password when we are using the SSO feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another dialog box appears sometimes and said you will need the internet for this at the bottom&nbsp;in outlook error says password require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pls. help me to troubleshoot, it is very frustrating and time taking.</p>
<p>

            Hello Puja,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately the screenshot is a blank black screen for me. could you please try to attach it again? when connected to LAN it keeps asking for password? Please try to follow the steps in below thread and see if, it helps. 
<br />
<br />Are you connecting through web browser or outlook client desktop application?

            I have recently purchased a new computer with Windows 10 and it will not allow me to access my old Hotmail.com account. When I try to sign on it takes me to Outlook.com, not Hotmail.com. How can I change this.

    <title>Macro not rerunning when new dropdown item is selected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Macro not rerunning when new dropdown item is selected</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Word 2007. I have a macro to automatically populate a text field based on a dropdown box I cerated. The macro reads as follows:</p>
<p>Sub OnExitDDList()<br />
Dim oFFs As FormFields<br />
Set oFFs = ActiveDocument.FormFields<br />
Select Case oFFs("DropDown1").Result<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "None"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current policy does not have a Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "Intensive Care"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current policy has a $300 daily Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "Dread Disease"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current policy does not have a Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case "Dread Disease and Intensive Care Benefit"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current&nbsp;policy has a $300 daily Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
End Select<br />
End Sub<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to protect the document so that just the drop down box and text fields in the document are fillable. The macro runs fine the first time one of the options in the dropdown box is selected. However, the text field does not update if the dropdown box
 selection is changed. Can anyone help me figure out how to get the text field to update when&nbsp;a new selection is made in the dropdown box? I have the macro set to run on exit with the drop-down for field right now.</p>

<p>I think that the issue is that you are not exiting from the dropdown formfield after changing the selection.&nbsp; The code only runs on exit.&nbsp; There is no change event for dropdown formfields.</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

            I am tabbing through the Word document to get to each fillable field. When I get to the dropdown box, I make my selection, hit enter and tab to the next fillable field. Is there another way I should be exiting the dropdown? I apologize for my ignorance...I'm

<p>Are you sure that you are selecting an item from the dropdown for which the result that is to be displayed in IntesiveCare is different from that which was displayed by the previous selection.</p>
<p>For example, if the previous selection was "None" and you then select "Dread Disease", nothing will change.&nbsp; Likewise with selections of "Intensive Care" and "Dread Disease and Intensive Care Benefit"</p>
<p>You will need to select one of the first pair and then one of the second pair to see any change (or one of the second pair and then one of the first pair.)</p>
<p>-- Hope this helps.</p>

<p>The entries in the dropdown field must match&nbsp; <strong>exactly</strong> the conditions in the case statements, both in wording and case for the results to be achieved and as Doug stated you must tab out of the dropdown field having made a change. It is also
 possible to simplify the code a tad given that there are only two possible results.</p>
<p>Sub OnExitDDList()<br />
Dim oFFs As FormFields<br />
Set oFFs = ActiveDocument.FormFields<br />
Select Case oFFs("DropDown1").Result<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "None", "Dread Disease"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current policy does not have a Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "Intensive Care", "Dread Disease and Intensive Care Benefit"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oFFs("IntensiveCare").Result = "My current policy has a $300 daily Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
End Select<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>Personally I would use the macro to populate a docvariable and reproduce the result in a docvariable field e.g.</p>
<p>Sub OnExitDDList()<br />
Dim oFFs As FormFields<br />
Dim oVars As Variables<br />
Set oFFs = ActiveDocument.FormFields<br />
Set oVars = ActiveDocument.Variables<br />
Select Case oFFs("DropDown1").Result<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "None", "Dread Disease"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oVars("IntensiveCare").Value = "My current policy does not have a Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Case "Intensive Care", "Dread Disease and Intensive Care Benefit"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oVars("IntensiveCare").Value = "My current policy has a $300 daily Hospital Intensive Care Benefit."<br />
End Select<br />
ActiveDocument.Fields.Update<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>{ DocVariable IntensiveCare }</p>
<p>Or at least uncheck the fill-in enabled box of the text form field</p>

<h2>            Draft message is lost&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have one problem with draft message. I have saved my unfinished mail (with very important information). The message was saved into folder drafts. Now I can see the message but when I want to open it the email client falls down. Is it possible somehow to
 find this message somewhere in the phone memory and open it????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or is it possible to reinstall the email client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have C7 - Nokia belle</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Thanks a lot</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;hippie,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia discussions board!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I advise you to download Nokia Suite on your PC from this link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/product/nokia-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/product/nokia-suite/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the program is installed, make a full back up of your data: Tools &gt; Back up.&nbsp;Then, please check for software updates from the updates tab. If any is available, please install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, please perform a soft reset on your device: type *#7780# on the keypad, the default lock code is 12345.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please delete your mail account and set it up again, you should now be able to open all draft messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on and feel free to post any other questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook automatically resets Read emails to Unread state</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem that I have had since Outlook 2013 and I'm still having when I recently upgraded to 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens with my Gmail accounts, and not with the Microsoft Exchange account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get new email, I click to read it, then I change focus to another message. The message I read changes to "Read" state, but then a second or two, it reverts automatically to "Unread". This also happens if I click on the small tab to the left of the
 message to set it to "Read" without reading it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really annoying since it wastes my time and I have to manually mark them as "Read" and sometimes even then it reverts to "Unread", forcing me to try the same thing multiple times. This should be a simple thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been reported before but I don't see a valid solution:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried re-creating my outlook profile, installing a fresh copy of Windows 10 has not fixed the issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>WIP updates are too frequent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natisrael972  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIP updates are too frequent</h2>
                    Hi all.<br />
<br />
I am in the Slow Ring of the Windows Insider Program (WIP) and recently, I have been experiencing updates that are too frequent. I was prompted to update and to either shut down or restart my computer too frequently. This has never happened before throughout
 the days in the Slow Ring. Could it be that my computer is to blame? Every time, after updating and starting up my computer, I receive a notification informing me that some updates could not be installed. Could it be why I am constantly prompted to update
 and restart my computer? So that the updates which failed to install could be installed?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Nat.

<p>If you are on the Slow ring your build should be 15002.</p>
<p>One of those failed updates actually did finally install.</p>
<p>Those all look like updates for an older build, like the Anniversary Build, 14393.</p>

<p>But network shares are all OK if you change back to a local account.</p>
<p>Problem you are now forced to use&nbsp; MS account for inside updates which loses your shares.</p>

Since you are asking this question in the <strong>Windows Phone forums</strong>, I am assumming you are asking this question to find a solution for backing up your contact data on your device.&nbsp; If that is the case, then consider using the FREE MyPhone service
 as a means for backing up your device pim DATA.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.MYPHONE.MICROSOFT.COM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WWW.MYPHONE.MICROSOFT.COM</a>.&nbsp; There is also another program that is also free called PIM BACKUP that does a great job as well (<a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.net</a>).</p>
<p>If you are not asking your question in relationship to a phone but rather are asking how to backup your data using Outlook, then head over to the Outlook forums here:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/default.aspx#tab=3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/default.aspx#tab=3</a></p>
<p>You can also use the help menu in Outlook ... it is well done and will explain it clearly how to export the data you want.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>Windows Defender previously worked on my 32 Bit HP 8100 Convertible with latest version of Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after applying recent updates Windows Defender will not start and gives the error code of&nbsp; 0x800b0100</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked with Services.MSC; and Defender appears to be set to 'automatic' and is listed as 'Running.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the next recommended steps to resolve this??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project GUMP strikes again.....&nbsp; every Boot Up is like a Box of Chocolates.....</p>

            <p>Yes, am aware of and have previously tried the DISM procedures mentioned within the link provided.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have prepared a 'batch file' containing them and run this batch file on occasion; with no resolution to the problems.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have decided to sit back chill and wait for a resolution from Microsoft; since this all started after application (with GREAT difficulty) of the Cumulative Update for 1511 from a few weeks ago.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really regret ever applying this update........</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Defender is getting a much needed rest on the bench so will be keyed up and ready to go when the buzzer sounds for the next half-time of play to begin........</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the Troubleshooter is also out of a job since it won't do anything either except spit out problems it encounters and can't deal further with......</p>

            If your version is activated under Digital Entitlement you can do a clean install as the problem is do to a corrupt file and won't get corrected by waiting.

            <p>Not sure what 'digital entitlement' is; this particular Windows 10 install was done as an upgrade to an existing Windows 7 installation; which I wish I could have stayed with; and would have if not for its 'twilight time' being on the horizon.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming by 'clean install' that this is of the entire Windows 10 system and not just Defender itself; which I am not going to do......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite fed up with 'Project GUMP' (where every boot up is like a box of chocolates) and my guess is that a clean install will only conjure up a whole host of new problems of its own.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather spend my time sending in regular 'Feedbacks' on this issue.........&nbsp; which I just did prior to looking at this thread.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue was directly caused by doing a recent 'Cumulative Update' to Windows 10 Build 1511; and it does speak of the amount of 'quality control/assurance' being given at present to these released 'updates.....'</p>

<p>Try making a back up of everything and restorring to factory settings *#7370#. If that doesn't work you will probably have to perform a hard reset.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Printer doesn&#39;t work after recent patch updates LPT1</h2>
                    <p>For the past week, &nbsp;I've successfully been using Windows 10 with my HP p2035 which is connected via LPT1</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past few days, &nbsp;I received some MS updates....</p>
<p>Now, &nbsp;the printer is still visible in my programs, &nbsp;IE, Chrome, Open Office, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, when I attempt to print... It sends the document to the spooler... I can see that a document (1) is there... &nbsp;within about 10 seconds it disappears... &nbsp;With no errors not results.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can no longer send test pages from the properties page either...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Interesting though...</p>
<p>When I look under Open Devices &amp; Printers I only see two items... Send to One-Note and FAX as an option. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt to add the printer back, it cannot locate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added &nbsp;LPD &amp; LPR under Windows services... Rebooted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still same problem exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts what happening or where I can look?</p>

            <p>Hi, Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my first guess about your printer issue: The updates that you mentioned included a new driver for your printer, a USB driver, and it replaced your old driver for the LPT1 connection, therefore uninstalling the printer. For Win 8/8.1, HP only speaks
 of connecting your printer either via a network print server, or a USB cable, and the 8/8.1 driver is the one that you need for Win 10 TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am correct in that guess, you will need to disconnect the LPT1 cable and connect the USB cable, and turn the printer on, and it will install, using the driver that was previously downloaded. If my guess that the new driver was downloaded was wrong,
 here is the link to HP support, where you can download it:</p>
<p>http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&amp;docId=emr_na-c03470332</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, here is something to consider .... USB printers install automatically when connected and turned on
 old one, uninstalling the printer.</p>

            <p>I'm in IT at my company, mostly programmer but also tech support. &nbsp;Since the latest W10 update that has gradually rolled out throughout the company, printers are reset, programs (Office in a few cases) lose registration/validation, and now LPT1 printing
 issues on at least one machine. &nbsp;Other machines that use a variety of custom paper sizes for printers have seen these custom sizes dissappear, and often the printer name (very important in our production process) is reset back to default.</p>
<p>I don't know what to say except that Microsoft has really dropped the ball this time. &nbsp;Sure we have all had random bugs or problems that affect a very small % of computers... but this windows 10 update has an credibly wide ranging impact on a tremendous
 number of users, it seems primarily when it comes to user profiles but also beyond. &nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT A DISASTER of a job they have done this time, I have done nothing but fix problems for 3 days or so now, simply because of all the negative effects of this/these update(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going to the port configuration and changing anything seems to make LPT1 printing work by the way... but after reboot it has to be done again to print. &nbsp;Out of respect for everyone I'm keeping my language clean, but believe me, insert any expletive anywhere
 in my post and it probably fits what I was thinking as I typed. &nbsp;EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED!!<br />

            Had the same problem after updates 12/21/2015. Laserjet 4 plus on LPT1 worked before update not after. Finally discovered that the LPT1 port has a new check box "Enable legacy plug and play detection" under Port Settings in the properties panel. (go to
 device manager - ports - LPT1) Once this was checked on the printer worked as usual.

            <p>Brilliant DEWIDAHO, The legacy check box fixed the problem. </p>
<p>Now as for you Microsoft...What are you thinking??!! This isn't the first issue I have had with Updates trashing my system. One thing that is consistent is that every single time I get an auto update, my network settings are all changed. Cannot connect from
 networked PC's (whether running WIN 10, WIN 7 or WIN XP), tells me that passwords are not correct, usually a 4-5 hour fix session after every set of updates that I don't even sign up for. I also lose favorite settings in Etech and previous browsing historys.</p>
<p>Call MS tech support and get a broken English person with no idea of how to remedy the problem, and then logs into my system and starts making more changes that cause more problems.
</p>
<p>This is beyond bugs. WIN 10 ...if you're thinking about upgrading ...DON'T DO IT</p>

<h2>            Screen flicker on open or save in Office 2007 on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    I keep getting a screen flicker and it appears that the office application(s) open and close multiple times when trying to use the open, save, or save as functions in any of my office 2007 applications running on Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; I have tried all of
 the following: repair office, re-install office, reload drivers, turn off all non-windows services and startups using msconfig.exe. Kept happening.&nbsp; Booted into safe mode and brought up office applications.&nbsp; Flicker no longer appeared when using open or save
 functions.&nbsp; That is why I disabled all non-windows services.&nbsp; However, when booting normal with all services disabled, flicker returned.&nbsp; Almost impossible to open or save in this condition.&nbsp; Thx in advance for any help.

<p>Ruchi,</p>
<p>I hate breaking bad news, actually I love it, but it's not a problem with a non-Microsoft service. It's a problem with Windows 7. Specifically, the Desktop Window Manager - there are literally thousands of people complaining about this and it needs to get
 fixed. It's the #1 reason we are not deploying it at our company of over 4000 computers.</p>
<p>The Desktop Window Manager service, if enabled (automatic with the Aero profile) causes issues with every piece of software out there. I've had it freak out with ONLY WINDOWS EXPLORER running. It's not a graphics card issue - I've tried on HP, Toshiba, Acer,
 and Dell laptops using Intel integrated graphics, Nvidia, Radeon. All of them have this problem - as the system's consumed resources go up - memory, cpu cycles, etc, the desktop window manager starts to freak out. It redraws the windows on screen, causing
 this "flickering" that people are referring to - the easiest way to drastically reduce the screen flicker is to set all programs you run into compatibility mode: disable visual themes. However, you can't do that for programs that are part of windows, and if
 you're having screen flickering while, for instance, copying files from one folder to another, it's extremely frustrating. It's a huge flaw in Windows 7 and the #1 complaint I've seen anywhere - ____, talking to the folks at Lockheed Martin, they HATE it because
 of that issue.</p>
<p>As to the original poster, to fix this issue disable Aero, or disable the Desktop Window Manager service. To disable Aero, set your theme to the Windows 7 Classic theme. To disable just the DWM, go to Start and type "Services.msc" without the quotes. Find
 the Desktop Window Manager service and right click, properties. Select "Disable service." also, right click, Stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will immediately stop all screen flickering and allow you to actually use your computer. It is ludicrous that Microsoft is ignoring this gaping issue with the DWM, the same issue that affected early adopters of Vista. It's not the hardware's problem,
 it's Microsoft's. I'm sorry but when you've got issues with all video cards out there, it's not them. It's you. But hey, I guess the engineers are too busy rolling in money to care about fixing mere graphical errors - the rest of the OS is fine, who cares
 about eye candy?</p>

<p>I am experiencing similar "flickering" whereby Outlook 2007 flickers uncontrolably and says "Not Responding".</p>
<p>Similar has happened in other Office 2007 apps.</p>
<p>This happens every day and several times daily.&nbsp; I have only noticed that the "Not Responding" occurs at startup of Outlook 2007 and thereafter sporadically especially when modifying a recurring calendar entry or when opening&nbsp;the&nbsp;function to send an email.&nbsp;
 Does activation of those functions within Outlook call the same file and attempt to access the same registry entry? &nbsp;I seem to have defined the problem down to both any one of many Outlook registry entries, issues which I don't know how to address.&nbsp; Today,
 however, I began to question&nbsp;that preliminary diagnosis as I noticed that Ipoint.exe was running with 48 handles.&nbsp; Could the Ipoint.exe abberrations (pulling 48 handles) be a process called into repetitive loading and just be a symptom?&nbsp; Could it be that a
 call to a registry entry that either isn't there or is corrupted fails to activate the appropriate Office 2007 DLL and thereby initiates a reloading of the mouse command?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "flickering" issue did NOT happen until about 1 month ago although I had been using the Lenovo R500, Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, and Office 2007 with No problem for about 1 year, 2 months.</p>
<p>The problem started immediately following my testing of a registry "repair" program that I have since removed from my PC.</p>
<p>I suspect that it deleted or corrupted a registry entry.&nbsp; So bottom line, it is most likely a registry entry failure that is the source of the issue that I'm experiencing.</p>

            Well almost a year and this issue is apparently unresolved. &nbsp;I will say after installing SP1 that the problem disappeared and everything seemed fine until I picked up a new video card and installed the new drivers and then the problem came back. &nbsp;I even
 uninstalled SP1 and reinstalled to see if that would resolve the problem as it did before but no dice. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Sure I can disable DWM but I feel like that is a horrible fix. &nbsp;I put a lot of money into my hardware and should have no problem displaying the operating system to it's fullest. &nbsp;I shouldn't have to gimp something to make it work efficiently. &nbsp;I've ignored
 the problem for over a year now and just made due but after seeing it "fixed" after installing SP1, I would like to get to the root of the problem. &nbsp;So far everything I've tried has had no effect and my searches online have turned up plenty of people asking
 the same questions but the only working answer seems to be to disable the DWM which to me isn't an answer really. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's even more frustrating because my brother has almost the exact same setup as myself and doesn't have this issue. &nbsp;We run the same programs and most of his hardware is stuff that I gave him after upgrading. &nbsp;</div>

<div>I concur in terms of Outlook 2007 being more problematic instead of the visual aspect of Windows or Office 2007.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was unable to gain access or even repair one of my main .pst accounts, which was well below the maximum allowable. I noticed that my HDD was acting up as well, but that only started a couple of weeks after the Outlook issue where it would take forever
 to boot up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, to be safe, I ran a Dell diagnostic and it determined that my drive(s) were about to fail. I managed to extract all pertinent data and then did a complete mirror copy. This allowed me to rebuild the said .pst file with the new drive, but Outlook
 2007 keep having the "not responding" issue anytime I look at a new email or otherwise.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Granted, this could be related to a missing registry, but I did not run a registry fixer program until after I started having problems with the HDD. Could this be related to a recent Office 2007 update that was downloaded automatically by Windows 7 via
 Microsoft's update service?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is not the case, I could run the rebuild in Office, but if that doesn't work, should I uninstall and re-install just Outlook 2007 or re-install the entire Office 2007 again. Curious to know what the other zillion Microsoft users are stating...&nbsp;</div>

<div>I have used a photo as a watermark. The text overlaying the photo is highlighted in white. I would simply like the text to go straight over the photo, with no white highlighter.</div>

            There is no white highlighter color; what you are seeing is probably text shading. Select the affected text, click the Shading (paint bucket) button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab, and select No Fill.

<p>Since you have the product key, go to this site and download the installation file:<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-office-2010-backup-FX101853122.aspx</a></p>
<p>When you activate it, if it fails on internet activation (it shouldn't), do a phone activation and explain the situtation to the service rep. You are allowed to "upgrade" you PC. A new HD, whether to replace a dead one or a too small one, is allowed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I see how to do a Timeline from Project but not a Gantt Chart. &nbsp;a Timeline is a little different than creating a Gantt chart with the information that i already have.</p>

            <p>Hi Potsha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We seem to be talking past one another.&nbsp; The Gantt Chart view in Project shows the Gantt chart, so I am not sure why you need Visio.&nbsp; Click the View tab to show the View ribbon and click the Gantt Chart icon to apply the Gantt chart view.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That will show the Gantt chart.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have Visio installed to the machine I'm using right now, and I am by no means skilled in Visio.&nbsp; I did find this reference to Visio 2007 - I don't know if the command is still there in 2010.</p>

            <p>thanks Julie: &nbsp;I'm creating a Power Point Presentation. &nbsp;I need to put my gantt chart in the PPT as i'm presenting to show the gantt with the resources like you have it above. &nbsp;Will I be able to copy this view and add it into my Power Point slide? &nbsp;I just
 need to make this work for my PPT that I'm presenting tomorrow. &nbsp;I need to make sure those readers that are unable to understand project can view this and understand my project mile stones, tasks, and resources by viewing the project Gantt Chart. as you have
 presented it above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks, Potsha<br />
